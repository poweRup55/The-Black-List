          baby blue 75 dodge dart
          
          a stray skateboard clips her causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee as well as the contents of her backpack

                    mean
          
          michael nods solemnly
          
          across the room
          
          patrick sits at a table with scurvy making something that 
          looks like a machete out of a twobyfour
          
          cameron approaches full of goodnatured farm boy cheer
          
                                 cameron
                    hey there
          
          in response patrick brandishes a loud power tool in his 
          direction
          
          cameron slinks away
          
                                 cameron
                           continuing
                    later then 
          
          michael watches shaking his head
          
          int cafeteria  day
          
          joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria 
          tray with a magic marker
          
          michael walks up and sits between them casual as can be
          
                                 michael
                    hey

                    were not
          
          he grabs michael by the side of the head and proceeds to 
          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker   michael 
          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted
          
                                 michael
                           grimacing

                    you
          
          joey sits back and cackles at his drawing
          
                                 michael
                           continuing
                    but she cant go out with you because 
                    her sister is this insane head case and 
                    no one will go out with her right
          
                                 joey
                    does this conversation have a purpose
          
                                 michael
                    so what you need to do is recruit a guy 
                    wholl go out with her  someone whos 
                    up for the job
          
          michael points to patrick who makes a disgusted face at his 
          turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage 
          can rather than in it
          
                                 joey
          
          that guy  i heard he ate a live duck once  everything but 
          the beak and the feet

                    exactly
          
          joey turns to look at michael

                    on my part
          
          he rises to leave and turns to the others
          
                                 michael
                           continuing

          michael stands at the sink trying to scrub joeys artwork 
          off his face as cameron watches
          
                                 cameron
                    you got him involved
          
                                 michael
                    like we had a choice  besides  when 
                    you let the enemy think hes 
                    orchestrating the battle youre in a 
                    position of power we let him pretend 
                    hes calling the shots and while hes 
                    busy setting up the plan you have time 
                    to woo bianca
          
          cameron grins and puts an arm around him
          
                                 cameron
                    youre one brilliant guy
          
          michael pulls back noticing other guys filing in
          
                                 michael
          
          hey  i appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy but 
          its not gonna do you any good to be known as new kid who 
          embraces guys in the bathroom 
          
          cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a 
          manly way for the others now watching

          mandella replies with a look of ice  kat uses the moment to 
          stub out mandellas cigarette 
          
                                 kat

          mandella leans toward kat with the glow of fresh gossip

          shes completely taken aback  he uses the moment to his 
          advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into 
          her ear
          
                                 patrick

          kat steps away brushing the hair back that he just touched 
          her cheeks pinken
          
          his cocky side is back in a flash

          he tosses some bills on the bar
          
          rather than thank him kat simply watches him trying to 
          figure out his motive
          
                                 patrick

                    so then she says that she almost 
                    didnt wear the kenneth coles with that 
                    dress because she thought she was 
                    mixing you know genres and the fact 
                    that i noticed  and im quoting here 
                    really meant something

          as patrick turns kat breaks free and dives into the sea of 
          dancing people in the dining room

          starts dancing by herself  she lets loose hair flying 
          shes almost burlesque
          
          others form a crowd clapping and cheering her on
          
          she swings her head around banging it on a copper pot 
          hanging from the rack above the center island  she starts 
          to sway then goes down as patrick rushes over to catch her
          
          the others clap thinking this is a wonderful finale 
          patrick sets her down on her feet holding her up

          looks up at her house

          she leans drunkenly toward him
          
          their faces grow closer as if theyre about to kiss and then 
          patrick turns away

          bianca thinks a minute
          
          he pulls up in front of the house
          
                                 cameron
                    just because youre beautiful doesnt 
                    mean you can treat people like they 
                    dont matter
          
          she looks at him for a moment  then grabs his face and 
          gives him a kiss on the lips  he draws back in surprise 
          then kisses her back  she smiles then gets out of the car 
          without another word
          
          cameron grins and drives away

          standing in the doorway  she gives him a smile and he perks 
          up a little
          
          kat walks into the room and addresses mr chapin again he 
          turns fully to face her

          patrick shrugs not knowing what she  s talking about
          
          she motions again and looks toward the window with an 
          expression that says make a break for it moron
          
          kat brings her attention back to mr chapin while patrick 
          inches out of his seat toward the window
          
          the other miscreants watch with glee
          
                                 kat
                    but mr chapin i hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention  there are far more hideous 
                    acts than offkey singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis
          
          patrick is halfway out the window now  and none too happy 
          about it considering theyre on the second floor
          
          he eyes a large tree a few feet away from mr chapin  he 
          starts to turn away from kat
          
                                 mr chapin 
                    youre not gonna change my mind kat 
                    rules stick
          
          kat starts to panic as patrick has yet to make the jump for 
          the tree
          
                                 kat
                    wait mr chapin  theres something 
                    ive always wanted to show you
          
          he turns back toward her again the very second before he 
          would have spotted patrick
          
          kat glances toward the window  patricks just about to make 
          the jump
          
                                 mr chapin 
                    what
          
                                 kat
                    these
          
          from behind we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at mr chapin just as patrick makes the jump
          
          the miscreants cheer for both the daring escape and the 
          flash of skin
          
          mr chapin reddens and tries to be stern
          
                                 mr chapin 
                    im going to let that slide katarina  
                    but if i catch you doing that again 
                    youll be in here with the rest of these 
                    guys
          
          he motions to the remaining detention prisoners without 
          noticing patricks absence
          
          kat smiles at him
          
                                 kat
                    thank you mr chapin
          
          kat bolts out the door  mr chapin goes back to his muscle 
          mag wiping the sweat from his brow

          she sighs and dose so  when she gets to his level she 
          perches on the branch next to him  he grins at her
          
          then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a 
          monkey leaving her sitting there realizing shes been 
          duped

          are so smeared with paint globs but they still manage to 
          find each others eyes

          cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux
          
          the various cliques descend angrily and joey is soon

          around
