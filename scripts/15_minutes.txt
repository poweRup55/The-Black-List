	rummages through the apartment  moving into the kitchen and
	living room leon watches as korfin sticks a pencil in a
	charred beam measuring how deep in it goes

				korfin
		okay jordy  it was a fast fire we got
		good patterns  about thirty minutes

				jordy
		dont blow your nose

	jordys looking at leon who was just about to blow his nose

				jordy contd
		the smokell permeate your nostrils

	heads  korfin supplies the paint can  jordy drops the cloth
	inside

	leon and eddie move to higher ground  on top of a burnt tv
	set  eddie hands the brushed bracelet to leon  as camello
	hacks at the floor with an ax jordy continues to examine the
	bodies and korfin explains

				korfin
		they have not soot in their mouths
		which means they werent breathin
		before the fire and that usually means
		they were deceased  and this piece of
		cloth that my partner found means they
		were wrapped up in something probably
		doused with a flammable liquid and
		positioned like this on the bed  to the
		untrained eye it looks like an
		accident

	jordy kicks around the draining floor reaches down for
	something

				leon
		whats he looking for

				eddie
		a timer

	jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet pulls them up

		an exclusive interview with stephen
		geller  who horrified the nation two
		years ago when he went berserk and
		murdered three clerks in a manhattan
		shoe store  but now mr gellers
		claim spoken softly and articulately
		is that he is the victim  according to
		mr geller the events of that fateful
		day were not his fault but were the
		fault of his psychiatrist  hard to
		believewatch

		father who as you know made a fortune
		selling penny loafers in the fifties 
		these people died because of the
		criminal actions of my doctor

				robert hawkins
		your doctor

				stephen geller
		yes  my psychiatrist didnt insist that
		i stay on my medication

				robert hawkins
		so you feel absolutely no
		responsibility for killing these people

				stephen geller
		it was my finger that pulled the
		trigger but im not morally
		responsible  my psychiatrist knew what
		i was capable of  how could i know 
		im not a doctor

				robert hawkins
		you seem very savvy for a man whos been
		found mentally incompetent to stand
		trial

				stephen geller
		look im a victim here too  i was a
		year away from getting my masters in
		art now ill never graduate  my life
		has been permanently disrupted

		look im in here  you call this a
		career move

				robert hawkins
		and isnt there a movie in the works
		about you

				stephen geller
		were in negotiations thats correct

				robert hawkins

	pours from a halfpint bottle of vodka into his won ton
	soup container smoking a cigar  on the arm of the armchair
	is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the

	eddie knocks his won ton soup back

				jordy
		did you get a report from the me

				eddie
		sure  but i would like to ask you
		something  you got a problem with me

				jordy
		if you found me steppin on your crime
		scene  it might piss you off too
			then
		what about the report

				eddie
		you were right they were both dead
		before the fire  the male was stabbed
		so hard the killer broke off the tip of
		the knife in his spine  thats usually
		an indicator of something personal

	jordy pulls out a sketch of daphne  hands it to eddie

				jordy
		the super said hed seen her before but
		she didnt live here

				eddie
		pretty

				jordy

				eddie
		obviously they werent having sex  as
		you pointed out  so why go through all
		the trouble of putting em like that

	eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to jordy

				jordy
		maybe its a ritual thing or someone
		trying to send a message  burial rites
		are taken very seriously in eastern
		europe  it could be to humiliate them 
		just burning them up no proper funeral
		its like condemning them to hell

				eddie
		eastern europe  like what  romania 
		hungary

				jordy
		or czechoslovakia  the slavs have been
		fighting the germans and the russians
		for a thousand years  these are very
		intense people and they take things
