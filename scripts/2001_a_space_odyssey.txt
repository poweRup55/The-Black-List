transcribers note

for all you clarkekubrick2001 fans

i found the original paper copy of this screenplay a while back and felt 
compelled to transcribe it to disk and upload it to various bulletin 
boards for the enjoyment of all

the final movie deviates from this screenplay in a number of interesting 
ways ive tried to maintain the format of the original document except 
the number of lines per page of the original in order to reduce the 
length of this file ive used a bar of  to delimit the pages as 
there was a lot of whitespace per original screenplay page

views of african drylands  drought

the remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years
and would not end for another million the reign of the ter
rible lizards had long since passed but here on the continent
which would one day be known as africa the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity and the victor was not
yet in sight in this dry and barren land only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish or even hope to exist

int  ext caves  moonwatcher

the manapes of the field had none of these attributes and
they were on the long pathetic road to racial extinction
about twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small parched valley divided by a sluggish brown stream

the tribe had always been hungry and now it was starving
as the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave moonwatcher
discovers that his father has died during the night he did not know
the old one was his father for such a relationship was beyond
his understanding but as he stands looking down at the emac
iated body he feels something something akin to sadness then
he carries his dead father out of the cave and leaves him for the
hyenas

among his kind moonwatcher is almost a giant he is nearly
five feet high and though badly undernourished weighs over
a hundred pounds his hairy muscular body is quite manlike
and his head is already nearer man than ape the forehead is
low and there are great ridges over the eyesockets yet he
unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity as
he looks out now upon the hostile world there is already

101365										 a2

continued

something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape in those
dark deepset eyes is a dawning awarenessthe first intima
tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another
two million years

101365										 a3

ext  the stream  the others

as the dawn sky brightens moonwatcher and his tribe reach
the shallow stream

the others are already there they were there on the other
side every day  that did not make it any less annoying

there are eighteen of them and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of moonwatchers own tribe as
they see him coming the others begin to angrily dance and
shriek on their side of the stream and his own people reply
in kind

the confrontation lasts a few minutes  then the display dies
out as quickly as it has begun and everyone drinks his fill of
the muddy water honor has been satisfied  each group has
staked its claim to its own territory

101365										 a4

ext  african plain  herbivores

moonwatcher and his companions search for berries fruit
and leaves and fight off pangs of hunger while all around
them competing with them for the samr fodder is a potential
source of more food than they could ever hope to eat yet
all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched
savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach
the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination they are
slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty

101365										 a5

a5
ext  parched countryside  the lion

the tribe slowly wanders across the bare flat country
side foraging for roots and occasional berries

eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain
about fifty feet apart

the ground is flat for miles around

suddenly moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion stalking
them about 300 yards away

defenceless and with nowhere to hide they scatter in all
directions but the lion brings one to the ground

101365										 a6

ext  dead tree  finds honey

it had not been a good day though as moonwatcher had no
real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day
with another but on the way back to the caves he finds a
hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree and so enjoys the
finest delicacy his people could ever know of course he
also collects a good many stings but he scacely notices
them he is now as near to contentment as he is ever
likely to be for thought he is still hungry he is not actually
weak with hunger that was the most that any hominid could
hope for

101365										 a7

a7
int  ext  caves  night terrors

over the valley a full moon rises and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains it would be very cold tonight 
but cold like hunger was not a matter for any real concern
it was merely part of the background of life

this little sun that only shone at night and gave no warmth
was dangerous there would be enemies abroad moonwatcher
crawls out of the cave clambers on to a large boulder besides
the entrance and squats there where he can survey the valley
if any hunting beast approached he would have time to get back
to the relative safety of the cave

of all the creatures who had ever lived on earth moonwatchers
race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the moon
and though he could not remember it when he was young
moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face
now he new he would have to find a tree that was high
enough

he stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from
one of the lower caves and he does not need to hear the

101365										 a8

a7
continued

occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening down
there in the darkness old oneeye and his family are dying
and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses
moonwatchers mind the harsh logic of survival rules out
such fancies every cave is silent lest it attract disaster

and in the caves in tortured spells of fitful dozing and
fearful waiting were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come

101365										 a9

ext  the stream  invasion

the others are growing desperate the forage on their side of
the valley is almost exhausted perhaps they realise that
moonwatchers tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night for they choose this mourning to break the truce when
they meet at the river in the still misty dawn there is a
deeper and more menacing note in their challenge the noisy
but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds
before the invasion begins

in an uncertainlymoving horde the others cross the river
shieking threats and hunched for the attack they are led
by a bigtoothed hominid of moonwatchers own size and age

startled and frightened the tribe retreats before the first
advance throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations
at the invaders moonwatcher moves with them his mind a
mist of rage and confusion to be driven from their own
territory is a great badness but to lose the river is death
he does not know what to do it is a situation beyond his
experience

then he becomes dimly aware that the others are slowing

101365										 a10

a8
continued

down and advancing with obvious reluctance the further they
move from their own side the more uncertain and unhappy
they become only bigtooth still retains any of his original
drive and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers

as he sees this moonwatchers own morale immediately
revives he slows down his retreat and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions novel sensations fill
his dim mind  the first faint precursors of bravery and
leadership

before he realizes it he is face to face with bigtooth and
the two tribes come to a halt many paces away

the disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
future instead the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other

rolling over and over they come to a patch of stony ground
and when they reach it moonwatcher is on top by chance

101365										 a11

a8
continued

he chooses this moment to grab the hair on bigtooths scalp
and bang his head on the ground the resulting crack is
so satisfactory and produces such an immediate weakening
in big  tooths resistance that he quickly repeats it

even when bigtooth ceases to move for some time moon
watcher keeps up the exhilirating game

with shrieks of panic the others retreat back across the
stream the defenders cautiously pursue them as far as
the waters edge

101365										 a12

ext  cave  new sound

dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle moonwatcher is
startled by a sound

he sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave straining his
senses out into the night and fear creeps slowly into his soul
never in his life  already twice as long as most members of
his species could expect  has he heard a sound like this the
great cats approached in silence and the only thing that
betrayed them was a rare slide of earth or the occasional
cracking of a twig yet this is a continuing crunching noise
that grows steadily louder it seemed that some enormous
beast was moving through the night making no attempt at
concealment and ignoring all obstacles

and then there came a sound which moonwatcher could not
possibly have identified for it had never been heard before
in the history of this planet

101365										 a13

a10
ext cave  new rock

moonwatcher comes face to face with the new rock when he
leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning
he had almost forgotten the terror of the night because nothing
had happened after that initial noise so he does not even
associate this strange thing with danger or with fear there
is nothing in the least alarming about it

it is a cube about fifteen feet on a side and it is made of
some completely transparent material indeed it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges
there are no natural objects to which moonwatcher can
compare this apparition though he is wisely cautious
of most new things he does not hesitate to walk up to it
as nothing happens he puts out his hand and feels a warm
hard surface

after several minutes of intense thought he arrives at a
brilliant explanation it is a rock of course and it
must have grown during the night there are many plants
that do this  white pulpy things shaped like pebbles that
seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness it is true that
they are small and round whereas this is large and square

101365										 a14

a10
continued

but greater and later philosophers than moonwatcher would be
prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws

this really superb piece of abstract thinking leads moonwatcher
to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test the white
round pebbleplants are very tasty though there were a few
that made one violently sick perhaps this square one

a few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him
there is no nourishment here so like a sensible hominid he
continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the cube

101365										 a15

a11
ext cube  first lesson

they are still a hundred yards from the new rock when the
sound begins

it is quite soft and it stops them in their tracks so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging a simple
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube
and hypnotises all who come within its spell for the first
time  and the last for two million year  the sound of
drumming is heard in africa

the throbbing grows louder more insistent presently the
hominids begin to move forward like sleepwalkers towards
the source of that magnetic sound sometimes they take little
dancing steps as their blood responds to the rhythms that
their descendants will not create for ages yet

totally entranced they gather around the cube forgetting
the hardships of the day the perils of the approaching dusk
and the hunger in their bellies

now spinning wheels of light begin to merge and the spokes
fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance

101365										 a16

a11
continued

rotating on their axes as they do and the hominids watch wide
eyed mesmerized captives of the crystal cube

then by some magic  though it was no more magical than all
that had gone on before  a perfectly normal scene appears it
is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and
shifted into the night inside that block is a group of four
hominids who might have been members of moonwatchers
own tribe eating chunks of meat the carcass of a warthog
lies near them

this little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete with sleek and glossy pelts  and this was a
condition of life that moonwatcher had never imagined from
time to time they stir lazily as they loll at ease near the
entrance of their cave apparently at peace with the world
the spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally
different scene

the family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave
it is foraging searching for food like any normal hominids

101365										 a17

a11
continued

a small warthog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species

but that happy state of affairs is about to end the big male
suddenly bends down picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet 
and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig the stone descends upon
its skull making exactly the same noise that moonwatcher had
produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with bigtooth
and the result too is much the same  the warthog gives one
amazed indignant squeal and collapses in a motionless heap

then the whole sequence begins again but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness every detail of the movement
can be followed the stone arches leisurely through the air the
pig crumples up and sinks to the ground there the scene
freezes for long moments the slayer standing motionless
above the slain the first of all weapons in his hand

the scene suddenly fades out the cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness the hominids stir as if

101365										 a18

a11
continued

awakening from a dream realise where they are and scuttle
back to their caves

they have no concious memory of what they had seen but that
night as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him moonwatcher
feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion  the urge
to kill he had taken his first step towards humanity

101365										 a19

a12
ext cave and plains  utopia

babies were born and sometimes lived feeble toothless thirty
yearolds died the lion took its toll in the night the others
threatened daily across the river  and the trib prospered
in the course of a single year moonwatcher and his companions
had changed almost beyond recognition

they had become as plump as the family in the cave who no
longer haunted their dreams they had learned their lessons
well now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that
the cube had revealed to them

they were no longer halfnumbed with starvation and they
had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought
their new way of life was casually accepted and they did
not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing
outside their cave

but no utopia is perfect and this one had two blemishes the
first was the marauding lion whose passion for hominids
seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better
nourished the second was the tribe across the river for

101365										 a20

a12
continued

somehow the others had survived and had stubbornly refused to
die of starvation

101365										 a21

a13
ext caves  killing the lion

with the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact moon
watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two
consecutive nights on the third the lion comes
betraying his presences by a small pebble slide

when they can here the lion below softly tearing at the meat
they strain themselves against the massive boulder the sound
of the lion stops he is listening again they silently heave
against the enormous stone exerting the final limits of their
strength the rock begin to tip to a new balance point

the lion twitches alert to this sound but having no fear of these
creatures he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost
him his life he goes back to his meal

the rock moves slowly over the ledge picking up speed with
amazing suddeness it strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground which deflects its path outward

just at this instant the lion reacts instinctively and leaps
away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the

101365										 a22

a13
continued

onrushing boulder he has combined the errors of over
confidence and bad luck

the next morning they find the lion in front of the cave they
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening and was apparently killed by a small
rock torn loose by the boulder but this was a small price to
pay for such a great victory

					         

and then one night the crystal cube was gone and not even
moonwatcher ever thought of it again he was still wholly
unaware of all that it had done

101365										 a23

a14
ext stream  master of the world

from their side of the stream in the never violated safety of
their own territory the others see moonwatcher and fourteen
males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over
looking the stream silhouetted against the dawn sky

the others begin to scream their daily challenge but today
something is different though the others do not immediatly
recognize this fact

instead of joining the verbal onslaught as they had always done
moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise and
begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness
never befor seen

as the others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist they become aware of the terrible strangness
of this encounter and their rage gradually subsides down to
an uneasy silence

at the waters edge moonwatcher and his band stop they
carry their bone clubs and bone knives

101365										 a24

a14
continued

led by oneear the others halfheartly resume the battle
chant but they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts
the sound from their throats and strikes terror into their
hearts

moonwatcher who had been partly concealed by two males who
walked before him thrusts his arm high into the air in his
hand he holds a stoud tree branch mounted atop the branch is
the bloody head of the lion its mouth jammed open with a stick
displaying its frightful fangs

the others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power

moonwatchers stands motionless thrusting the lions head high
then with majestic deliberation still carrying his mangled
standard above his head he begins to cross the stream followed
by his band

the others fade back from the stream seeming to lack even
the ability to flee

moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to oneear who stands

101365										 a25

a14
continued

unsurely in front of his band

though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the waters edge
oneear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon oneear merely looks up at the raised club
until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness
down around him

the others stare in wonder at moonwatchers power

moonwatcher surveys the scene now he was master of the
world and he was not sure what to do next but he would
think of something

the russians
exchange
significant
glances

					    floyd
					    is there any particular reason
					    why you ask

12765										  b31 

b20
continued

					    smyslov
					    pleasantly  well dr floyd
					    i hope that you dont think im
					    too inquisitive but perhaps
					    you can clear up the mystery
					    about whats been going on up
					    there

					    floyd
					    im sorry but im not sure
					    i know what you mean

					    smyslov
					    well its just for the past
					    two weeks there have been
					    some extremely odd things
					    happening at clavius

					    floyd
					    really

					    smyslov
					    yes well for one thing
					    whenever you phone the base
					    all you can get is a recording
					    which repeats that the phone
					    lines are temporarily out of
					    order

12765										  b32 

b20
continued

					    floyd
					    well i suppose theyve been
					    having a bit of trouble with
					    some of the equipment

					    smyslov
					    yes well at first we thought
					    that was the explanation but
					    its been going on for the past
					    ten days

					    floyd
					    you mean you havent been able
					    to get anyone at the base for ten
					    days

					    smyslov
					    thats right

					    floyd
					    i see

					    elena
					    another thing heywood two
					    days ago one of our rocket
					    buses was denied permission
					    for an emergency landing at
					    clavius

12765										  b33 

b20
continued

					    floyd
					    how did they manage to do that
					    without any communication

					    elena
					    clavius control came on the
					    air just long enough to transmit
					    their refusal

					    floyd
					    well that does sound very odd

					    smyslov
					    yes and im afaid theres
					    going to be a bit of a row about
					    it denying the men permission
					    to land was a direct violation of
					    the ias convention

					    floyd
					    yes well i hope the crew
					    got back safely

					    smyslov
					    fortunately they did

					    floyd
					    well im glad about that

					    dr floyd at the risk of pressing
					    you on a point you seem reticent
					    to discuss may i ask you a
					    straightforward question

					    floyd
					    certainly

					    smyslov
					    quite frankly we have had some
					    very reliable intelligence reports
					    that a quite serious epidemic
					    has broken out at clavius
					    something apperently of an
					    unknown origin is this in
					    fact what has happened

a long awkward
pause

12765										  b33b

continued

					    floyd
					    im sorry dr smyslov but
					    im really not at liberty to
					    discuss this

					    smyslov
					    this epidemic could easily
					    spread to our base dr floyd
					    we should be given all the
					    facts

long pause

					    floyd
					    dr smyslov im not
					    permitted to discuss this

					    elena
					    are you sure you wont change
					    your mind about a drink

					    floyd
					    no thank you and im
					    afraid now i really must be
					    going

					    elena
					    well i hope that you and your
					    wife can come to the iac
					    conference in june

					    yes well whatever it is theyre
					    certainly not fooling around this
					    is the first flight they allowed

					    pilot
					    yes well i wouldnt have been

					    you have made and of course
					    his congratulations on your

					    floyd contd
					    mr halvorsen has made known
					    to me some of the conflicting
					    views held by many of you
					    regarding the need for complete
					    security in this matter and
					    more specifically your strong
					    opposition to the cover story
					    created to give the impression
					    there is an epidemic at the base
					    i understand that beyond it being
					    a matter of principle many of
					    you are troubled by the concern
					    and anxiety this story of an
					    epidemic might cause your
					    relatives and friends on earth

					    i can understand and sympathize
					    with your negative views i have
					    been personally embarrassed by
					    this cover story but i fully
					    accept the need for absolute
					    secrecy and i hope you will

					    it should not be difficult for all
					    of you to realise the potential for
					    cutural shock and social
					    disorientation contained in the
					    present situation if the facts
					    were prematurely and suddenly
					    made public without adequate
					    preparation and conditioning

112565										 b55 

b38
continued

					    floyd
					    this is the view of the council
					    and the purpose of my visit here
					    is to gather addition facts and
					    opinions on the situation and to
					    prepare a report to the council
					    recommending when and how the
					    news should eventually be
					    announced are there any
					    questions

					    michaels
					    dr floyd how long do you think
					    this can be kept under wraps

					    floyd
					    pleasantly
					    im afraid it can and it will be
					    kept under wraps as long as it
					    is deemed to be necessary by
					    the council and of course you
					    know that the council has requested
					    that formal security oaths are to
					    be obtained in writing from every
					    one who had any knowledge of this
					    event there must be adequate
					    time for a full study to be made
					    of the situation before any con
					    sideration can be given to
					    making a public announcement

					    not really its completely
					    inert no sound or energy
					    sources have been detected
					    the surface is made of
					    something incredibly hard
					    and weve been barely able
					    to scratch it a laser drill

112565										 b63

continued

					    michaels
					    might do something but we
					    dont want to be too rough until
					    we know a little more

					    floyd
					    but you dont have any idea as
					    to what it is

					    michaels
					    tomb shine surveymarker
					    spare part take your choice

					    halvorsen
					    the only thing about it that we are
					    sure of is that it is the first direct
					    evidence of intelligent life beyond
					    the earth

silent appreciation

					    halvorsen
					    four million years ago something
					    presumably from the stars must
					    have swept through the solar
					    system and left this behind

112565										 b64 

b44
continued

					    floyd
					    was it abandoned forgotten left
					    for a purpose

					    halvorsen
					    i suppose well never know

					    michaels
					    the moon would have made an
					    excellent base camp for
					    preliminary earth surveys

some more silence

					    floyd
					    any ideas about the colour

					    michaels
					    well not really at first glance
					    black would suggest something
					    sunpowered but then why would
					    anyone deliberately bury a sun
					    powered device

					    floyd
					    has it been exposed to any sun
					    before now

					    michaels
					    i dont think it has but id
					    like to check that simpson
					    whats the log on that

112565										 b65 

b45
inside monitor dome
we see a number of
television displays
including several tv
views of floyd and
company in the
excavation

					    simpson
					    the first surface was exposed at
					    0843 on the 12th april let me
					    see that would have been
					    fortyfive minutes after lunar
					    sunset i see here that
					    special lighting equipment had
					    to be brought up before any
					    futher work could be done

112565										 b66

tma1 excavation

					    michaels
					    thank you

					    floyd
					    and so this is the first sun that
					    its had in four million years

					    photographer
					    excuse me gentlemen if youd
					    all line up on this side of the
					    walkway wed like to take a few
					    photographes dr floyd would
					    you thand in the middle dr
					    michaels on that side mr
					    halvorsen on the other
					    thank you

the photographer
quickly makes some
exposures

					    photographer
					    thank you very much gentlemen
					    ill have the base photo section
					    send you copies

as the men slowly
seperate from their
picture pose there
is a piercingly powerful
series of five electronic
shrieks each like a
hideously overloaded
and distorted time signal
floyd involuntarily tries
to block his ears with his
spacesuited hands then
comes merciful silence

					    a hundred million miles beyond
					    mars in the cold lonliness
					    where no man had yet travelled
					    deepspacemonitor79 drifts
					    slowly among the tangled orbits
					    of the asteroids

					    narrator
					    radiation detectors noted and
					    analyzed incoming cosmic rays
					    from the galaxy and points beyond
					    neutron and xray telescopes
					    kept watch on strange stars that
					    no human eye would eever see
					    magnetometers observed the
					    gusts and hurricanes of the solar
					    winds as the sun breathed million
					    mileanhour blasts of plasma
					    into the faces of its circling
					    children

					    narrator
					    all these things and many others
					    were patiently noted by deep
					    spacemonitor79 and recorded
					    in its crystalline memory

112565										 b68 

b47
continued

					    narrator
					    but now it had noted something
					    strange  the faint yet
					    unmistakable distrubance rippling
					    across the solar system and
					    quite unlike any natural phenomena
					    it had ever observed in the past

					    narrator
					    it was also observed by orbiter
					    m15 circling mars twice a
					    day and high inclination probe
					    21 climbing slowly above the
					    planet of the ecliptic and even
					    artificial comet5 heading out
					    into the cold wastes beyond
					    pluto along an orbit whose
					    far point it would not reach for
					    a thousand years

					    narrator
					    all noticed the peculiar burst of
					    energy that leaped from the face
					    of the moon and moved across
					    the solar system throwing off a
					    spray of radiation like the wake of
					    a racing speedboat

poole is finished

bowman is still
reading and
working on his
dessert

					    poole
					    dave if youve a minute id like
					    your advice on something

					    bowman
					    sure what is it

					    poole
					    well its nothing really important
					    but its annoying

					    bowman
					    whats up

					    poole
					    its about my salary cheques

					    bowman
					    yes

					    poole
					    well i got the papers on my
					    official upgrading to ags19
					    two weeks before we left

121465										 c12 

c12
continued

					    bowman
					    yes i remember you mentioning it
					    i got mine about the same time

					    poole
					    thats right well naturally
					    i didnt say anything to payroll
					    i assumed theyd start paying me
					    at the higher grade on the next pay
					    cheque but its been almost
					    three weeks now and im still
					    being paid as an ags18

					    bowman
					    interesting that you mention it
					    because ive got the same problem

					    poole
					    really

					    bowman
					    yes

					    poole
					    yesterday i finally called the
					    accounting office at mission
					    control and all they could tell me
					    was that theyd received the ags19
					    notification for the other three but
					    not mine and apparently not yours
					    either

121465										 c13 

c12
continued

					    bowman
					    did they have any explanation for
					    this

					    poole
					    not really they just said it might
					    be because we trained at houston and
					    they trained in marshall and that
					    were being charged against differ
					    ent accounting offices

					    bowman
					    its possible

					    poole
					    well what do you think we ought
					    to do about it

					    bowman
					    i dont think we should make any
					    fuss about it yet im sure theyll
					    straighten it out

					    poole
					    i must say i never did understand
					    why they split us into two groups
					    for training

					    bowman
					    no i never did either

121465										 c14 

c12
continued

					    poole
					    we spent so little time with them
					    i have trouble keeping their names
					    straight

					    bowman
					    i suppose the idea was specialized
					    training

					    poole
					    i suppose so though of course
					    theres a more sinister explanation

					    bowman
					    oh

					    poole
					    yes you must have heard the
					    rumour that went around during
					    orbital checkout

					    bowman
					    no as a matter of fact i didnt

					    poole
					    oh well apparently theres
					    something about the mission that
					    the sleeping beauties know that
					    we dont know and thats why we
					    were trained separately and
					    thats why they were put to sleep
					    before they were even taken aboard

121465										 c15 

c12
continued

					    bowman
					    well what is it

					    poole
					    i dont know all i heard is that
					    theres something about the
					    mission we werent told

					    bowman
					    that seems very unlikely

					    poole 
					    yes i thought so

					    bowman
					    of course it would be very easy
					    for us to find out now

					    poole
					    how

					    bowman
					    just ask hal its conceivable
					    they might keep something from
					    us but theyd never keep anything
					    from hal

					    poole
					    thats true

121465										 c15a 

c12						   
coninued

					    bowman
					    sighs  well its silly but
					    if you want to why dont you

poole walks to the
hal 9000 computer

					    poole
					    hal dave and i believe that
					    theres something about the
					    mission that we werent told
					    something that the rest of the
					    crew know and that you know
					    wed like to know whether this
					    is true

					    hal
					    im sorry frank but i dont
					    think i can answer that question
					    without knowing everything that
					    all of you know

					    bowman
					    hes got a point

					    poole
					    okay then how do we rephrase
					    the question

121465										 c15c	  

c12 
continued

					    bowman
					    still you really dont believe it
					    do you

					    poole
					    not really though it is strange
					    when you think about it it didnt
					    really make any sense to keep
					    us apart during training

					    bowman
					    yes but its to fantastic to think
					    that theyd keep something from us

					    poole
					    i know it would be almost
					    inconceivable

					    bowman
					    but not completely inconceivable

					    poole
					    i suppose it isnt logically impossible

					    bowman
					    i guess it isnt

					    poole
					    still all we have to do is ask hal

121465										 c15b
 
c12
continued

					    bowman
					    well the only important aspect of
					    the mission are where are we
					    going what will we do when we
					    get there when are we coming
					    back and why are we going

					    poole
					    right hal tell me whether the
					    following statements are true or
					    false

					    hal
					    i will if i can frank

					    poole
					    our mission profile calls for
					    discovery going to saturn
					    true or false

					    hal
					    true

					    poole
					    our transit time is 257 days is
					    that true

					    hal
					    thats true

121465										 c15d
 
c12
continued

					    poole
					    at the end of a hundred days of
					    exploration we will all go into 
					    hibernation is this true

					    hal
					    thats true

					    poole
					    approximately five years after we
					    go into hibernation the recovery
					    vehicle will make rendezous with
					    us and bring us back is this true

					    hal
					    thats true

					    poole
					    there is no other purpose for this
					    mission than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program
					    and to further our general
					    knowledge of the planets is that
					    true

					    hal
					    thats true

					    poole
					    thank you very much hal

121465										 c15e
 
c12
continued

					    hal
					    i hope ive been able to be of
					    some help

					    look dave i know that youre

121465										 c103

					    bowman
					    well in any event give me the

					    if youre determined to revive

					    bowman
					    im goin to do this myself hal
					    let me have the control please

					    hal
					    look dave yourve probably got

					    bowman
					    hal switch to manual hibernation
					    control

					    hal
					    i dont like to assert myself dave
					    but it would be much better now for

					    in a very stressful situation

121465										 c104

					    bowman
					    i dont feel like resting give

					    hal
					    i can tell from the tone of your

					    why dont you take a stress pill
					    and get some rest

					    bowman
					    hal im in command of this
					    ship i order you to release
					    the manual hibernation control

					    hal
					    im sorry dave but in
					    accordance with subroutine
					    c15324 quote when the
					    crew are dead or incapacitated
					    the computer must assume
					    control unquote i must
					    therefore override your
					    authority now since you are
					    not in any condition to intel
					    ligently exercise it

					    bowman
					    hal unless you follow my 
					    instructions i shall be forced
					    to disconnect you

121465										 c105

c118
continued

					    hal
					    if you do that now without earth
					    contact the ship will become a

					    bowman
					    i am prepared to do that anyway

					    hal
					    i know that youve had that on
					    your mind for some time now
					    dave but it would be a crying
					    shame since i am so much
					    more capable of carrying out
					    this mission than you are and
					    i have such enthusiasm and confi
					    dence in the mission

					    bowman
					    listen to me very carefully hal
					    unless you immediately release
					    the hibernation control and
					    follow every order i give from
					    this point on i will immediately
					    got to control central and carry
					    out a complete disconnection

121465										 c106

					    simonson
					    hello dave i think we may be on
					    to an explanation of the trouble with
					    the hal 9000 computer

					    we believe it all started about two
					    months ago when you and frank
					    interrogated the computer about
					    the mission
									 cont
121365										 c119

continued

					    simonson cont
					    you may have forgotten it but
					    weve been running through all
					    the monitor tapes do you
					    remember this

					    pooles voice
					    the purpose of this mission is no
					    more than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program
					    and further our general knowledge
					    of the planets is this true

					    hals voice
					    that is true

					    simonson
					    well im afaid hal was lying
					    he had been programmed to lie
					    about this one subject for secur
					    ity reasons which well explain
					    later

					    the true purpose of the mission
					    was to have been explained to you
					    by mission commander kaminsky
					    on his revival hal knew this and
					    he knew the actual mission but
					    he couldnt tell you the truth when
					    you challenged him under orders
										    cont

121365										 c120
 
c148
continued

					    simonson cont
					    from earth he was forced to lie

					    in everything except this he had
					    the usual reinforced truth program
					    ming

					    we believe his truth programming
					    and the instructions to lie
					    gradually resulted in an
					    incompatible conflict and
					    facedc with this dilemman he
					    developed for want of a better
					    description neurotic symptoms

					    its not difficult to suppose that
					    these symptoms would centre on
					    the communication link with
					    earth for he may have blamed
					    us for his incompatible program
					    ming

					    following this lin of thought we
					    suspected that the last straw for him
					    was the possibility of disconnection
					    since he became operational he had
					    never known unconsciousness it
					    must have seemed the equivalent to
					    death
										   cont
121365										 c121

c148
continued

					    simonson cont
					    at this point he presumably
					    took whatever actions he thought
					    appropriate to protect himself
					    from what must have seemed to
					    him to be his human tormentors

					    if i cane speak in human terms
					    i dont think we can blame him
					    too much we have ordered him
					    to disobey his conscience

					    well thats it its very
					    speculative but we think it is
					    a possible explanation anyway
					    good luck on the rest of the 
					    mission and im giving you back to
					    bernard

					    mission control
					    hello dave now im going to

briefing

					    floyd
					    good day gentlemen when you
					    see this briefing i presume you
					    will be nearing your destination
					    saturn i hope that youve had a
					    pleasant and uneventful trip and
					    that the rest of your mission
					    continues in the same manner i
					    should like to fill you in on some
					    more of the details on which
					    mission commander kaminsky
					    will have already briefed you

					    thirteen months before the launch
					    date of your saturn mission on
					    april 12th 2001 the first evidence
					    for intelligent life outside the earth
					    was discovered

					    it was found buried at a depth of
					    fifteen metres in the crater tycho
					    no news of this was ever announced
					    and the event had been kept
					    secret since then for reasons which
					    i will later explain

					    soon after it was uncovered it
					    emitted a powerful blast of
										 cont

121365										 c124
 
c150
continued

					    floyd cont
					    radiation in the radio spectrum
					    which seems to have triggered
					    by the lunar sunrise

					    luckily for those at the site it
					    proved harmless

					    perhaps you can imagine our
					    astonishment when we later found
					    it was aimed precisely at saturn
					    a lot of thought went into the
					    question of wether or not it was
					    suntriggered as it seemed
					    illogical to deliberately bury a
					    sunpowered device

					    burying it could only shield it
					    from the sun since its intense
					    magnetic field made it otherwise
					    easily detectable

					    we finally concluded that the only
					    reason you might bury a sun
					    powered device would be to keep
					    it inactive until it would be
					    uncovered at which time it would
					    absorb sunlight and trigger itself
											 cont

121465										 c125

c150
continued

					    floyd
					    what is its purpose  i wish we
					    knew the object was buried on
					    the moon about four million years
					    ago when our ancestors were
					    primative manapes

					    weve examined dozens of theories
					    but the one that has the most
					    currency at the moment is that
					    the object serves as an alarm

					    what the purpose of the alarm is
					    why they wish to have the alarm
					    whether the alarm represents
					    any danger to us  these are
					    questions no one can answer
					    the intentions of an alien world
					    at least four million years older
					    than we are cannot be reliably
					    predicted

					    in view of this the intelligence
					    and scientific communities felt
					    that any public announcment
					    might lead to significant cultural
					    shock and disorientation

					    discussion took place at the 
					    highest levels between govern

					    ments and it was decided that the
					    only wise and precautionary
					    course to follow was to assume
					    that the intentions of this alien
					    world are potentially dangerous
					    to us until we have evidence to
					    the contrary

					    this is of course why security
					    has been maintained and why
					    this information has been kept
					    on a needtoknow basis

					    and now i should like to show you
					    a tv monitor tape of the actual
					    signalling event

					    those who had begun the expri
					    ment so long ago had not been
					    men

					    but when they looked out across
					    the deeps of space they felt
					    awe and wonder  and loneliness

					    in their explorations they
					    encountered life in many forms
					    and watched on a thousand worlds
					    the workings of evolution

					    they saw how often the first faint
					    sparks of intelligence flickered
					    and died in the cosmic night

					    and because in all the galaxy
					    they had found nothing more
					    precious than mind they
					    encouraged its dawning every
					    where

					    the great dinosaurs had long

					    on earth the glaciers came and
					    went while above them the
					    changeless moon still carried its
					    secret

					    with a yet slower rhythm than
					    the polar ice the tide of
					    civilization ebbed and flowed
					    across the galaxy

					    strange and beautiful and terrible
					    empires rose and fell and passed
					    on their knowledge to their
					    successors

					    earth was not forgotten but it was
					    one of a million silent worlds a
					    few of which would ever speak

					    then the first explorers of earth
					    recognising the limitations of
					    their minds and bodies passed
					    on their knowledge to the great
					    machines they had created and
					    who now trnscended them in

					    for a few thousand years they
					    shared their universe with their
					    machine children then realizing
					    that it was folly to linger when
					    their task was done they passed
					    into history without regret

					    not one of them ever looked through
					    his own eyes upon the planet earth
					    again

					    but even the age of the machine
					    entities passed swiftly in their
					    ceaseless experimenting they
					    had learned to store knowledge
					    in the structure of space itself
					    and to preserve their thoughts
					    for eternity in frozen lattices
					    of light they could become
					    creatures of radiation free
					    at last from the tyranny of matter

					    now they were lords of the
					    galaxy and beyond the reach
					    of time

					    they could rove at will among the
					    stars and sink like a subtle mist
					    through the very interstices of

					    but despite their godlike powers
					    they still watched over the
					    experiments their ancestors
					    had started so many generations
					    ago

					    the companion of saturn knew
					    nothing of this as it orbited
					    in its no mans land between mimas
					    and the outer edge of rings

					    it had only to remember and wait
					    and to look forever sunward with
					    its strange senses

					    for many weeks it had watched
					    the approaching ship its long
					    dead makers had prepared it for
					    many things and this was one of
					    them and it recognised what
					    was climbing starward from the
					    sun

					    if it had been alive it would have
					    felt excitement but such an
					    emotion was irrelevant to its
					    great powers

					    even if the ship had passed it by
					    it would not have known the

					    it had waited four million years
					    it was prepared to wait for
					    eternity

					    presently it felt the gentle touch
					    of radiations trying to probe its
					    secrets

					    now the ship was in orbit and it
					    began to speak with prime
					    numbers from one to eleven
					    over and over again

					    soon these gave way to more
					    complex signals at many frequen
					    cies ultraviolet infrared
					    xrays

					    the machine made no reply it
					    had nothing to say

					    then it saw the first robot

					    then it dropped into darkness

					    the great machine knew that this
					    tiny scout was reporting back to
					    its parent but it was too simple
					    too primative a device to detect
					    the forces that were gathering
					    round it now

					    then the pod came carrying
					    life the great machine searched
					    its memories

					    the logic circuits made their
					    decision when the pod had fallen
					    beyond the last faint glow of the
					    reflected saturnian light

					    in a moment of time too short to
					    be measured space turned and
