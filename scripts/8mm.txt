                             mrs christian 
                 apparently mr longdale has
                 something he feels he simply must
                 say before you and i speak

                             longdale 
                 yes i do have something to say  i
                 insisted on being here as soon as i
                 heard mrs christian contacted you

                 as mr christians attorney and one
                 of the executors of his estate it
                 concerns me that a meeting of this
                 sort should take place without my
                 being asked to attend 

                             welles
                 of what sort 

                             longdale
                 you are a private investigator 

                             welles 
                 thats right 

                             longdale 
                 well whatever reasons mrs
                 christian has for engaging the
                 services of a private investigator
                 i should certainly be a party to
                 but since she feels differently i
                 can only go on the record as having
                 expressed my adamant disapproval 

                             mrs christian 
                 yes how theatrical  so youve gone
                 on the record and now perhaps you
                 should just be gone 

     longdales irritated but has no choice  he walks away 

                             mrs christian 
                 have a pleasant evening

                 he was a good man  notorious as an
                 eccentric but that was something he
                 cultivated  hewantedto be
                 legendary

                             welles

                             mrs christian 
                 we were married fortyfive years
                 hard even for me to imagine  we had
                 our troubles  there were plenty of
                 places for him to be other than
                 here but he was always loyal to me
                 and i to him  i loved him deeply

     welles waits 

                             mrs christian

                             welles 
                 i wear a gun when i can tell a
                 client expects me to  other than
                 that theres never any reason 

                             mrs christian 
                 just curious 

     mrs christian crosses to take down a picture revealing a
     wall safe  the safe is ajar burnt and scarred broken into

                             mrs christian 
                 my husband was the only one with the
                 combination to this safe  i knew
                 about it but as far as i was
                 concerned it was none of my
                 business  not till now that is 

                             welles 
                 you hired someone to open it  ill
                 bet the lawyer loved that

                             mrs christian 
                 there was nothing he could do  my
                 husband left everything to me
                       looks at safe
                 i prevented anyone from seeing the
                 contents  i felt these were my
                 husbands private things  i
                 didnt i didnt realize 

                             welles 
                 do you want to tell me what you
                 found 

                             mrs christian 
                 cash stock certificates and this

     she takes something from her pocket puts it on the desk a
     plastic bag containing a short 8mm film on a plastic reel

                             mrs christian 
                 its a film of a girl being
                 murdered 

                             welles 
                 im afraid i dont 

                             mrs christian 
                 this is a movie showing a girl being
                 murdered  shes sitting on a bed
                 and a man rapes her and he begins
                 to cut her with a knife
                       pause
                 i only watched what i could

     welles picks up the film looks at it 

                             mrs christian 
                 i didnt know what to think  i
                 cant tell you how horrible its
                 been to know this belonged to my
                 husband  to know that he watched
                 this this atrocity  but i cant
                 go to the police

                             welles
                 mrs christian please will you
                 sit down a moment 
                       leads her to a chair 
                 i want you to listen carefully
                 what youre talking about is a
                 snuff film  but from what i
                 know snuff films are a kind of
                 urban myth  like red light
                 district folklore  theres no such
                 thing i can assure you 

     mrs christian shakes her head 

                             welles 
                 please believe me  this is
                 probably a stag film  simulated
                 rape  hard to stomach and it might
                 seem real but there are ways of
                 making it look realistic fake
                 blood and special effects

                             mrs christian 
                 no 

                             welles 
                 if you were to study it youd see
                 the camera cutting away youd see
                 the tricks they can play

                             mrs christian 
                 im telling you its not that 

                             welles 
                 im sure it is 
                       smiles 
                 its probably something your husband
                 was given as a bad joke  more than
                 likely he never even watched it 

                             mrs christian 
                 will you watch it and see for
                 yourself 

                             welles 
                 of course  but im certain its
                 nothing to worry about 


     int  christian house dining room  night 

     an 8mm projector faces a wall  welles looks back to mrs
     christian in the doorway  mrs christian leaves shuts the
     door  darkness  welles turns on the projector and sits
     the projector clatters shooting bright images

     on the wall flash frames over exposure then the grainy
     film is hand held constantly in motion showing a skinny
     girl 16 or 17 in a negligee sitting on a bed in a
     nondescript room with little furniture  looks like a hotel
     room  we only ever see three walls  the once beautiful
     girl looks worn drugged dark circles under her eyes
     staring blankly  the cameras tungsten spotlight casts
     long shifting shadows as the camera moves but the girl
     still stares oblivious  the bed is wrapped in plastic and
     duct tape  the floor is covered by plastic sheeting

     welles watches crossing his arms already uncomfortable

     on the wall a door opens behind the girl looks like a
     bathroom and a masked man enters

     the masked man wears a garish mexican wrestling mask with
     eye holes and a mouth  the mask covers his entire head
     hes naked except for red shorts his body scrawny oiled
     pale  the man goes to stand in front of the girl  he seems
     to be saying something to her but the film is silent and
     the only sound is the projectors loud sprocket hole
     clatter  its all one long take  the camera moves to favor
     the girl

     welles sits straight in his chair wary

     on the wall masked man raises his open hand and slaps the
     girl knocking her back on the bed

     welles grimaces

     on the wall masked man pulls the girl back to a seated
     position  the girls like a rag doll face reddened eyes
     closed but she remains upright  masked man uses his thumbs
     to open her unseeing eyes  he touches her mouth with his
     fingers presses his lips to hers  then masked man backs
     away leaving frame till the camera moves to find masked
     man standing at a table with three large bowie knifes laid
     out  masked man runs his fingers over the blades

     welles rises slowly still watching

     on the wall masked man selects a huge bowie knife and moves
     back towards the girl

     welles crosses his arms tight disbelieving fearfulwe will never see what happens next in the film but welles
     does  in the flickering reflected light welles backs
     involuntarily away from the horrible images holding his
     fist to his mouth breathing hard

     welles keeps backing away till hes backed against a wall
     the projectors clattering  welles is sickened sweating
     still watching till he finally shuts his eyes

     int  christian house adjoining room  night

     silence  mrs christian sits waiting troubled
     the door to the dining room opens and welles enters from the
     dark visibly shaken  mrs christian watches him her
     sorrow now shared

                             welles
                 you you need to go to the police 

                             mrs christian 
                 i told you i cant not yet 

                             welles
                 you dont have any other choice 

                             mrs christian 
                       stands shakes her head 
                 no  for me to live with the ruin of
                 my husbands name i need know that
                 whoever did this will be punished
                 if you can find them i will take
                 their names to the police  ill say
                 my husband confessed on his death
                 bed ill say i didnt have courage
                 to come forward at first

                             welles 
                 it wont work like that

                             mrs christian 
                 any evidence you collect can be
                 given to the police later
                 anonymously  ive thought about it
                 and theres no other way  if you
                 cant find them if the only thing
                 that comes from this film is that
                 this is all my husband will be
                 remembered for well i cant let
                 that happen  im telling you i
                 wont  if theres no chance that
                 poor girls memory can be served
                 then ill just have to spend my last
                 days trying to forget her 

     welles sits rests his head in his hands 

                             welles 
                 i deal in divorce cases  corporate
                 investigations

                             mrs christian 
                 youve found missing persons before 

                             welles 
                 nothing remotely like this 

                             mrs christian 
                 i know what im asking  your
                 compensation will be appropriate to
                 the risk  youll need cash to buy
                 information and ill provide it
                       pause
                 i feel responsible mr welles
                       pause
                 you saw what he did to her

     welles stands torn apart and uncertain looks back to the

                 looked homeless seemed about
                 eighteen maybe  they convinced her
                 to let them buy her a meal in the
                 city  nice kid mature didnt have
                 much to say but they got a sense

                 ate her food excused herself

                 often but sometimes theres real

                 know im not here to create any
                 false hope

                             mrs mathews
                 they hired you  youre like a
                 private detective

                             welles
                 thats exactly what i am

     mrs mathews chews staring off into the distance

                             mrs mathews
                 i didnt think there were private
                 detectives anymore except on tv

                             welles
                 you probably expect me to be wearing
                 a trench coat and a hat  drinking
                 whiskey chasing women and getting
                 beaten up by guys with broken noses
                 want to know what its really like 
                 its sitting in a car and staring at
                 a hotel window for three days
                 straight pissing in a plastic
                 bottle pardon me because some guy
                 thinks his wifes cheating on him
                 glamorous huh  and the guy who
                 hired you he has a hairlip
                 dandruff and crooked teeth and you
                 could have told him the minute you
                 laid eyes on him his wifes
                 cheating and you dont blame her

     mrs mathews smiles

                             welles
                 its refreshing to actually sit down
                 and meet someone face to face
                 someone nice like you

     welles smiles  mrs mathews takes out a cigarette  welles
     lights her joins her in smoking refers to his clipboard

                 never gave any indication where she
                 might go before she left

                             mrs mathews

                 she didnt seem herself  for months
                 there never was any way to get her
                 to talk about it  one night we went
                 to bed the next morning she was
                 gone  she took some clothes

     int  mathews house kitchen  morning

     welles sits at the kitchen table  mrs mathews makes
     coffee  the homes decor is cheap and flowery

                             mrs mathews 
                 we werent religious  we never
                 forced religion down her throat
                 like ive seen some parents do to
                 their kids  we never made her go to
                 church  but after mary was gone
                 thats when i got religious

     mrs mathews brings two cups of coffee sits

                             mrs mathews
                 doesnt make much sense does it
                 when everythings happy when lifes
                 fine and you have every reason to
                 believe theres a god you dont
                 bother  then something horrible
                 happens thats when you start
                 praying all the time  thats when
                 you start going to church

                             welles
                 were all like that

                             mrs mathews
                 are you religious

                             welles
                 no

                             mrs mathews
                 you should be

     mrs mathews drinks coffee stares into the cup

                             welles
                 ive got what i need for my report
                 there is there is one thing that
                 bothers me though

                             mrs mathews
                 what 

                             welles
                 its not really my place but its
                 not easy for me to set aside the
                 private detective part of me either
                 see i know a little about missing
                 persons  when kids run they almost
                 always leave a note  its guilt
                 they want to say goodbye

                             mrs mathews
                 there wasnt one  the police looked

                             welles
                 do you think the police did a good
                 job

                             mrs mathews
                 i dont know  i think so

                             welles
                 it is possible and i know this
                 isnt something you want to hear
                 your daughter may have tried to hide
                 a note where she thought you would
                 eventually find it but where she
                 knew your husband would never find
                 it  she might have wanted to tell
                 you something

                             mrs mathews
                 no  you dont have any reason to
                 think that

                             welles
                 if the police focused their search
                 inherroomherbelongings well
                 thatd be only natural but they may
                 have been looking in the wrong place

     mrs mathews is getting upset

                             mrs mathews
                 how how can you say that to me

                             welles
                 will you let me look

                             mrs mathews
                 my husband never laid a hand on her
                 she would have told me she would
                 have told me

                             welles 
                 youre probably right and i
                 probably wont find anything
                 i dont have a right to ask this
                 and you can kick me out of your
                 house if you want but this is my
                 profession and theres a part of me
                 that cant let it go  police are
                 just as human as you or i  they
                 could have missed something  they
                 probably didnt
                       pause
                 wouldnt you rather know

     mrs mathews thinks about it tortured shakes her head sadly

                             mrs mathews
                 go ahead and look if you want  i
                 dont care what you do

     quiet  about fifteen card tables are set up in rows  the
     men behind the tables and the thirty or so customers
     looking through the merchandise make those in the previous
     porn shops look like high society

     these are middleaged men most balding some with pot
     bellies in shorts and tube socks in sweatpants and members
     only jackets plain men but with a look of desperation in
     their eyes glancing around nervously greasy and afraid

                             one dealer
                 were shutting down in fifteen
                 minutes  fifteen minutes

     welles makes his way to the tables wary  one table is
     covered in dirty cardboard boxes filled with hundreds of
     photos of young children mostly boys naked  each photo is
     wrapped in plastic censored by masking tape

     welles swallows back disgust

     the next table is piled high with used pornographic
     magazines  there are baggies with colorful pills laid out
     xrated polaroids wrapped in rubberbands

     max follows behind unaffected smokes a cigarette

     another table offers video tapes with no identifying marks
     other than hand written labels with numbers written out
     two sixteen five  and many bootleg videos with
     grainy homemade labels showing women in extreme bondage

     welles watches out the corner of his eye as the plump man
     beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures
     welles waits till the man moves on addresses the angry
     looking dealer whos counting money

                             welles
                       points to numbered videos
                 what are these

                 there aint no such thing as snuff
                 why dont you fuck off 

     the dealer sits and keeps counting cash
     welles moves on beyond the tables theres a curtained
     doorway  welles walks to it enters

     inside the curtain

     folding chairs face a screen  a projector shows a silent
     movie a buxom woman in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag
     and tube  a hairy overweight man lays face down on an
     examination table naked arms tied behind his back

     in the darkness a man shifts in his chair grunting
     obviously masturbating  a few chairs away a man is bent
     over moving his head in the lap of someone in a blonde wig

     a large man approaches welles from the dark

                             large man

                 tonight arent gonna last much
                 longer  its too risky one and
                 two everythings going on the
                 internet  anyone with a computer
                 and enough patience can find
                 anything he wants  its heaven for
                 those degenerate chickenhawks
                 theyre swapping pictures back and
                 forth as fast as their modems can
                 zap em  but theres still some
                 weird shit under the counter where
                 i work sometimes  no one knows where
                 it comes from  thats local
                 underground where information
                 spreads by word of mouth  those are
                 zombies hardcore junkies  their
                 hands are permanently pruned  they
                 go out in the sun they dont burn
                 they blister  other than that all
                 i know about is the mail
                 classified ads in the paper with
                 hidden codes  secret couriers
                 credit card orders to dummy
                 corporations  interstate wire
                 transfers  revolving po boxes
                 but if youre asking me who do you
                 go to to get illegal shit who
                 knows  thats the whole point 
                 the seller stays as far away from
                 the buyer as possible and vice
                 versa and cops cant trace the
                 deal  theres ways to do it so
                 nobody knows who anybody is

     dino pulls arrows from the target

                             dino velvet
                 he was saying how fascinated he is
                 by their simple ability to be sharp
                 the ability of a piece of metal to
                 be so thin that it is almost
                 nothing

     dino walks back to the table replaces the arrows in the
     quiver cueing another arrow in is bow

                             dino velvet
                 so close to nothingness that it cuts
                 with minimum effort because its so
                 nonintrusive  flesh is fooled  it
                 blooms open as the blade widens but
                 by then its too late because the
                 knifes already doing its pure
                 simple damage

     dino shoots another arrow to the target

                 you everything but we cant tell

                 know

     amy runs her fingers through his hair bends down to rest
     her head on his back holding him with her eyes closed
     welles holds tighter

                             welles
                 youre all ive got  youre all
                 ive ever had
                       pause
                 youre the only one who can save me
