the death artist 1995

remake of cormans classic bucket of blood


int jabberjaw  night

the cavernous club is packed with a cross section of artists poets 
actors models rockers grungers punks addicts and other 
assorted characters standing at the bar and seated at tables  
bizarre paintings and sculptures adorn the walls 

close on a boom box on a stage  the tape rolls and soon strange 
industrial music begins to blare from the box 

maxwell an eccentric  looking man with a goatee and various 
piercings on his face stands on the stage in front of a microphone 
 an abstract portrait hangs on the wall behind him 

				maxwell
		i will talk to you of art for
		there is nothing else to talk
		about for there is nothing
		elselife is nothing but
		homeless traveler on the rtd
		of art

we pull back to see patrons sitting at tables amid various 
sculptures paintings and displays of questionable artistic promise 


				maxwell
		burn gas on the freeways and whip your
		sour cream of circumstanceflip at
		your channels and plod at your monitors

soon we see walter paisley a meek unassuming bus boy work his way 
around the tables taking empty drinks emptying ashtrays all the 
time listening to the performer on
stage 

				maxwell
		creation is all else is not
		what is not creation is meatless
		sausage and rice cake let it
		all crumble to feed the artist 

walter passes a table where an upscale art dealer with a ponytail 
interrupts his prospective client to answer his
cellular phone 

				maxwell
		the artist is all others are not a
		canvas is a canvas or a painting a
		rock is a rock or a statue a sound
		is a sound or it is music a preacher
		is a preacher or an artist 
walter passes art seated with two attractive women  he rolls 
himself a cigarette nodding in approval to maxwell 

				maxwell
		where are john joe jake jim jerk
		dead dead dead they were not born
		before they were born they were not
		born where are leonardo mozart
		shakespeare alive alive alive they
		were born 

walter continues to bus the room  he pauses to stop and listen to 
maxwell  he then looks over a mans shoulder  he is sketching  
walter observes the sketch 

pov it is a fairly good sketch of the room 

leonard the artsy manager of the club notices walter pausing to 
listen 

				maxwell
		bring on the multitudes and the
		multitude of fishes  feed them
		that you will be satisfied
		nourish the artist stretch their
		skin upon an easel crush their
		bones into a paste so that he may
		mold them let them die and by
		their miserable death become the
		clay in his hands that he might
		form an ashtray or an ark  that he
		might take you in his magic hands
		and wring from your marrow wonder 
		all that is comes through the eye
		of the artist 

walter moves on  sees an attractive woman carla who opens a 
manila envelope and removes some head shots of herself 

				maxwell
		the rest are blind fish swimming
		in the cave of aloneness swim on you
		mortal and muddling maddened souls 
		and dream of one bright and sunny
		island  some artist will bait a hook
		and let you bite upon it bite hard and
		die 

walter looks at carlas picture 


				maxwell
		in his stomach you will feed
		creation

maxwell turns off the tape and the audience applauds 

carla then looks up to see walter looking at her picture  he 
awkwardly smiles at her and she smiles back 

leonard then approaches walter 

				leonard
		walter what are you doing

				walter
		i was just looking at carlas
		picture

				leonard
		well thats not what i pay you for
		now is it

				walter
		well i was uh just looking

				leonard
		well do some looking around the room
		i see cups ashtrays  lets go

walter slinks away  leonard gets close to carla very close all 
the time admiring her head shot 

				leonard
		ah your new head shot
			beat
		i like it very much

				carla
		do you have to be so cold to him

leonard smiles and strokes carlas hair 

walter watches this the turns and walks away 

at the entrance of the club stands lou a man in a designer suit no 
tie  he scans the room as walter passes him 

				lou
		how ya doin

				walter
		uh hi

walter slinks away and lou looks around some more 

art sees lou 

lou subtly gestures to art and heads into the club 

art gets up addressing the two girls 

				art
		im out of here

art and lou head toward the mens room 

int mens room  night

art and lou check the stalls to see the room is empty 

				art
		alright were clear

				lou
		anything new

				art
		not really  one girl who fit the
		descrip came in kinda skinny brunette
		didnt see much changing hands

				lou
		is the manager cooperating

		thats about it for tonight

				lou
		alright i got you man  its my
		turn for freak patrol

				art

			beat

art heads out and lou checks himself in the mirror 

int jabberjaw  night

maxwell sits at a table with carla mayolia a skinny yet buxom 
woman and charlie a longhaired hangeron  maxwell is looking at 
carlas head shot 

				carla
		so do you like it



				maxwell
			bored
		its perfectly adequate as far
		as those type of things go

walter approaches with a tray of glasses in his hand 

				maxwell
			changing subject
		i dont think anyone gets what
		i said their blank faces staring
		mute unfeeling 

				walter
		i liked it very much mr brock
		i liked it very much

				maxwell
			condescending
		well im overjoyed

				walter
		let them die and by their miserable
		death become the clay in his hands
		that he might form an ashtray or an
		ark 

carla looks at walter 

				carla
		thats word for word

				maxwell
		is it  ive forgotten

				mayolia
		you mean you dont remember your
		own poem

				maxwell
		i refuse to say anything twice 
		repetition is death

				charlie
		what do you mean

				maxwell
		when you repeat something you
		are reliving a moment wasting
		it looking at a shed skin  i
		only want new impression new
		sensations 


				walter
		i thought you believed that life
		is a homeless traveler riding on
		the rtd of 

				maxwell
			interrupting
		i know that  i know that i also
		believe in burning the creative
		candle you understand down to
		the end  to be uncreative you
		might as well be deada walking
		machine toiling in a factory

				walter
		i worked in one of them  back in
		alaska
			smiles meekly

the people at the table look at walter then laugh
cynically 

in the background leonard glares at walter 

				carla
		walter leonards looking at you
		again

walter grabs up a cup and saucer off the table almost spilling the 
contents before heading off 

				charlie
		that guys a classa cracker

				maxwell
		walters got a clear mind  probably
		something will enter it feel lonely
		and leave again

everyone at the table laughs weakly 

at another table two eccentrically dressed artists cuff and link 
talk to an upscale older couple  cuff has a series of matted 
photographs in his hand 

				older man
		ive heard you can find some
		cutting edge pieces here if you
		keep an eye out 

				older woman
		id like to find something for
		our den something unusual 

				cuff
		well maybe these works might
		interest you 

cuff shows the woman the photographs  she reacts to them with 
disdain 

pov they are pictures of various road kills  squirrels skunks 
possums 

				cuff
		its our road kill series  i take
		the pictures

				link
			proudly
		i do the research

the woman hands back the photographs 

				older woman
		not quite what i was looking for

				older man
		yes were interested in something
		with some investment potential 

				cuff
		hey this is no supermarket
		there are no aisles its all
		in the attitude 

walter approaches 

				link
		yeah thats a dead soul way to
		look at it 

				older woman
		nonsense  we have developed many
		a rapport with struggling artists 
		were very supportive 

				walter
		all that is comes through the eye
		of the artist  the rest are blind
		fish swimming in the cave of
		aloneness

the four people stare at walter 

				older woman
		thats very deep and coming from a
		bus boy too 
				walter
		feed them that you will be satisfied 
		the artist is all others are not 

				older man
		where have i heard that before

				older woman
		are you a poet also

				walter
		uhno  no im not

				older man
		what do you do

				walter
		well uh imworking ive
		been working on something its
		not ready yet

				cuff
		what is it a crying clown

				walter
		huh

				link
		walter must have bought himself
		some crayons

leonard approaches looking exasperated 

				cuff
		get out of here man  were
		negotiating a deal

				walter
		i am working on something  im
		going to show you soon

				leonard
		walter

leonard gets close to him 

				leonard
			under his breath
		youre starting to try my
		patience

walter sheepishly heads off  the two artists laugh 

the older woman looks at leonard 
				older woman
		is he uh

				leonard
		about to be out of a job

walter returns to maxwells table where carla mayolia and charlie 
are still sitting  he gestures to some empty glasses 

				walter
		are you done with these

				maxwell
		yes get rid of them

in the split second when no one is looking walter snatches up one 
of carlas head shots keeping it under his tray as he cleans up 
the empty glasses 

									dissolve to
ext jabberjaw  night

walter passes an alley where a group of thugs hastily strips down a 
car parked on the street 

ext street  night

walter walks the streets alone  soon he stops and looks ahead 

there is a parked car with the windows open  a couple is making out 
in the front seat 

walter smiles meekly 

soon the man in the car a meanlooking character spots walter  the 
two stop making out and the man stares at walter 

				man
		what are you looking at  you want
		to get shot

walters smile fades and he stuffs his hands in his pockets and 
heads down the street alone inadvertently bumping into some 
garbage cans 

ext courtyard apartments  night

walter unlocks a creaky iron gate covered with dead ivy 



ext courtyard  night

as walter heads in he runs into mrs swicker the
landlady 

				walter
		oh hello mrs swicker

				mrs swicker
		hello walter  i want to tell
		you the super fixed the leaky
		pipes and sealed up that hole in
		your wall

				walter
		oh ok

				mrs swicker
		walter you look awful pale
		what did you have to eat today

				walter
		i had a salami sandwich mrs swicker

				mrs swicker
		if you were my sonwhy dont you
		let me fix you a nice hot bowl of
		soup it wont take but a minute

				walter
		oh no thats ok i can fix myself
		something  besides i got something
		important to do

walter goes to unlock his door 

				mrs swicker
		oh by the way did you happen to
		see frankie out here by any
		chance

walter thinks for a second 

				walter
		uh no i didnt see him at all

				mrs swicker
		whats got into that cat  well if
		you do see him tell him ive got
		a nice fat piece of oceanfresh
		halibut for him 

				walter
		ttell him that

				mrs swicker
		if you see him

				walter
		ok mrs swicker

mrs swicker heads off 

				mrs swicker
		good night walter

				walter
		good night mrs swicker 

walter opens his door and heads in 

int walters room  night

walter closes the door and turns on a light hanging over a kitchen 
table  a cloth covers an object roughly the size of a bowling ball 
on the table 

he removes carlas head shot tucked inside his shirt and places it 
on the table after looking at it for a beat 

walter heads over to the stove stopping to notice a freshly 
plastered area on the wall a bag of plaster still on the ground 

walter opens himself up a can of beans  he looks around and finds 
an old dented metal pot pouring the beans into the pot 

he throws the empty can in the direction of an overflowing garbage 
can lights the stove and puts the pot on the
burner 

walter then takes a seat at the table  he lifts the
cloth revealing a mound of clay 

a cat meows in the distance as walter looks at carlas picture 
appreciating her beauty 

				walter
		now i have my muse

walter then turns and begins to mold the clay 

									dissolve to
int walters room

a halfhour later  walter has attempted to sculpt a bust  he looks 
at carlas picture then back at his sculpture 

walters pov it is a badly sculpted head that not only looks 
nothing like carla but has a hard time passing for anything human 

walter looks at it knowing that much work is needed on his creation 


he grabs a blob of fresh clay from an adjacent pile and begins to 
form a nose  the cat meows again  walter looks around 

				walter
		frankie

walter continues enthusiastically sculpting the blob of
clay 

				walter
		a canvas is a canvas or a painting
		a rock is a rock or a statuea
		sound is a sound or is music

walter looks at the sculpture 

walter then attaches the nose  smoothing it on 

it looks ridiculous something out of grammar school art class  
hes having difficulty forming anything that resembles a nose 

				walter
		come onyoure supposed to be
		a nose

the malformed face stares dumbly back at him as he fights to shape 
the nose 

the cat meows again  walter is getting increasingly frustrated  he 
backs up to look at the head 


pan the photograph of carla over to the sculpture  one of the ears 
falls off 

walter squints at the head failing to convince himself its looking 
better  frustrated walter yanks the nose off and grabs a little 
more clay 

				walter
		why cant i make a nose

on the stove the beans begin to boil 

walter shapes the clay and sticks the nose back on his tongue 
sticking out of his mouth as he fumbles with it 

the nose has changed shape and juts perpendicularly off the head 
resembling pinocchio 

walter begins to sculpt with increasing fury 

he grabs up more clay starts mushing the face 

soon the object begins to lose resemblance to anything close to a 
human head or anything for that matter 

walter stands up and backs up looking at the sculpture  getting 
angry he begins to mush the sculpture 

				walter
		no no no no 

the cat meows again louder  walter looks around irritated  he 
begins to squash the sculpture 

finally losing his patience walter kicks back the chair grabs the 
clay head and hurls it across the room 

the clay hits the wall with a dull thud stays there for a beat 
then falls to the ground 

walter pushes back his hair with his hand  the cat meows 

the beans begin to overflow on the stove 
walter runs toward the stove smacking his head on the overhead 
light 

the light swings back and forth as walter rushes over to the pot 
grabbing it hastily off the stove before shrieking in pain and 
dropping the pot into the sink splattering beans in all directions 


walter clutches his hand in pain as the light swings the cat 
meowing louder 

walter begins to look around furiously 

				walter
		frankie shut up

walter then focuses his frustrated mind toward the direction of the 
patched up wall 

walter gets closer 

he hears the meowing coming from inside the wall 

				walter
		frankie

walter puts his ear to the wall  he hears scratching
noises 

walter turns away from the wall 

				walter
		i dont believe this
			yelling at the wall
		how did you get stuck in the wall

the meowing persists 

				walter
		alright alright  calm down
		ill get you out 

walter looks around goes toward a drawer by the sink and produces 
a long narrow carving knife  he heads back to the wall 

				walter
		hang tight frankie ol walters
		gonna get you out

walter then feels the wall as if he does this type of thing 
professionally  when the determines the proper area of entry he 
carefully aims the knife and  wham 

screech  frankie makes a comical screech of pain which ends 
abruptly 

walter freezes  his eyes wide open with panic  he stands back 

the wall is silent 

				walter
		frankie

there is no response 

				walter
		frankie howre ya doin in there

there is no response 

walter begins to beat the wall until the thin material begins to 
give way 

he rips a big chunk of the wall off confirming the worst 

the knife impaled frankie into a wooden stud in the wall  the cat 
is no more 

walter pulls and tugs at the knife until it is freed from the wall  
he gingerly cradles frankie still impaled by the knife 

				walter
		what have i done

walter walks over to the kitchen table 

				walter
		oh frankie im so sorry

he lowers the cat down 

				walter
		poor mrs swicker
			beat
		she had a nice fat piece of
		oceanfresh halibut for you

walter walks backward toward the kitchen looking forlornly at the 
cat 

he reaches for another can of beans but his eyes focus on the clay 
head on the floor 

walter picks up what used to be a head and sits back down at the 
kitchen table 

he looks at carla looking back at him from the picture  he then 
stares blankly ahead 

				walter
		repetition is death frankie
									dissolve to

ext los angeles  dawn

silhouetted buildings in the early light 

int walters room  dawn

still dressed walter tosses and turns on his bed 

				maxwellvo
		nourish the artist stretch their
		skin upon an easel crush their
		bones into a paste so that he may
		mold them let them die and by
		their miserable death become the
		clay in his hands that he might
				maxwell cont
		form an ashtray or an ark  that he
		might take you in his magic hands
		and wring from your marrow wonder 
		all that is comes through the eye
		of the artist 

walter bolts upright waking from his dream 

				walter
			beat then almost
			 imperceptibly
		where are the john joe jake jim
		jerk

walter gets up out of bed  he heads toward the kitchen table 

he looks at a now stiff frankie 

				maxwellvo
		deaddeaddead

walter stares at frankie for a beat and turns off the overhead lamp 
 he then looks up as if getting an idea 

he looks over at the floor 

sees the bag of plaster 

ext street  day

walters feet are visible as he walks down the street  as we pan 
up we see walter cradling a package wrapped in brown paper and 
string 

ext jabberjaw  day

leonard stands very close to carla who is wearing tight red velvet 
bellbottoms  she flips through several canvases of scribble 
paintings she has brought over 

				carla
		im trying to find a style of
		my own  do you really like them

				leonard
		oh yesvery nicevery very
		nice

walter then approaches with his package 

carla sees him  so does leonard 

				carla

				walter
			enthusiastically

walter lowers it to the ground and undoes the string  he then opens 
the paper and reveals what he brought 

it is frankie encased in plaster along with the knife 

walter grins like a simpleton at his creation but carla is 
impressed 

				carla

walter heads into the back 

int jabberjaw  night

the scene is happening strange music plays in the background 

art walks into the club  walter passes him 


				walter
		did you see my cat

				art
		why is he lost

				walter
		no i uh

walter walks away 

in the alcove sits dead cat   a young man wearing a beret and 
leather jacket inspects the work  he seems zonked out on some 
chemical  walter approaches him

				walter

				leonard

walter heads off   leonard lights a cigarette and looks at the 
sculpture 

walter busses a table 

				charlieos

walter heads over to a table  seated are maxwell carla charlie 
and another attractive blonde woman  maxwell appears clearly 
intoxicated 

				charlie

charlie laughs  maxwell stares at walter then staggers to his feet 
 looks at the room 

				maxwell
		attention everyone  everybody

some people pay attention 

				maxwell
			drunkenly
		as you pass through these yellow
		portals i am sure you noticed
		on your right a small plaster
		figure and assumed this
		transfixed effigy to be the work
		of a master sculptor  indeed
		so it is  and that bright new
		creator is in our midst  hes
		none other than walter paisley
		our very own bus boy whose
		undiscovered hands of genius have
		been carrying away your empty
		cups of frustration

people look at walter who sheepishly accepts the praise 

				maxwell
		remember him  his is the silent
		voice of creation  within the
		dark rich soil of humility he
		blossoms as the hope of our
		nearly sterile times

charlie and carla clap 

				maxwell
			to walter
		bring me a gimlet

maxwell sits back down 

walter passes a table where cuff link and mayolia are sitting 

cuff stops him 

				cuff
		hey congrats on the cat walter
		i wonder where you got the idea
		of dead animals

				walter
		huh 

				link
		yeah can you say plagiarism

				cuff

		soobvious

mayolia then looks up at walter 

				mayolia
		i get it walter  i get it

				walter
		what do you get

				mayolia
		your work the layers of
		irony

just then several people approach walter and begin asking him 
questions 

art watches the commotion 

leonard also watches the commotion with a completely dumbfounded 
expression on his face 

art dealers talk to walter as well as artists 

just then lou walks in stands next to art 

				lou
		what the hells going on

				art
		everyone wants to meet the
		bus boy

				lou
		what did he do

				art
		he made a cat

lou looks at art who returns the stare 

				art
		outta plaster

lou walks in 

				lou
		see you later 

				art
		righto

art leaves  leonard looks at walter 

walter uncomfortably enjoys the attention 

just then the old couple chimes in  the older man looks around 

				older man
		wheres my mocha latte double
		grande

leonard drops his cigarette and crushes it with his foot 
he heads over to walter and escorts him away from the
people  walter accepts someones business card 

leonard takes him aside 

				walter

		everyones really crazy about

walters hand 

				leonard
		go home

				walter
		okgood night mr de santis

				leonard
		good night walter
				
				mayoliaos
		wait  walter

walter begins to head out the door but is stopped by
mayolia  walter turns around and faces her  she gets
close 

				walter

				mayolia

		with your work tonight

				walter
		with dead cat


				mayolia

		of fresh air  i could just 
		babble on about it for hours

				walter

mayolia gives him that look 

				mayolia

mayolia gets closer making her heaving cleavage more accessible to 
walters eyes 

				mayolia

mayolia presses herself against walter who awkwardly
reacts 
				mayolia

art sits at a table watching the encounter

walter watches perplexed as mayolia reaches into her cleavage 

lou watches the transaction carefully 

mayolia takes out a cameo necklace takes it off her neck 

				mayolia

		inspiration change your
		perception of reality

mayolia looks around and hands the necklace to walter 

				mayolia

		will let you think of me

she wraps walters hand around the necklace 

				mayolia
		if you have to go go

walter backs out 
				mayolia
		go and dont look back

walter leaves 

lou waits for a beat then gets up 

ext jabberjaw  night

walter leaves the club passing some incoming people 

when he leaves lou exits the club 

he heads over to the payphone and picks up the receiver about to 
make a call 

suddenly he changes his mind  he hangs the receiver up and 
decides instead to follow walter 

int walters room  night

walter closes the door and turns on the overhead lamp 
he looks at the medallion mayolia gave him and places it on the 
table  he then picks it up again inspects it 

he notices the medallion has a clasp 

ext walters window  night

lou is outside watching walter 

he then checks his 45 handgun and stuff it back in his shoulder 
holster under his jacket 

int walters room  night

walter notices the medallion has a clasp  he pops it open and 
notices a twistedoff corner of a plastic bag containing a white 
powder inside  he opens the bag and smells the powder no knowing 
what it is  he dabs his finger in it and puts it on his tongue 
grimacing at the taste of the substance  he puts the open medallion 
down on the kitchen table 

ext walters window  night

lou heads off 

int walters room  night

walter heads over to the dresser looks at himself in the mirror


				walter

walter then picks up the picture of carla looks at it for a beat 

				walter
		and i love you too carla

walter sighs then heads over to his cabinets opens them
up 

a box of pancake mix is the only item 

walter takes out the box and grabs a round sharpedged griddle out 
of the lower cabinets 

soon the door knocks  walter walks over to the door carrying the 
griddle

lou springs for walter 

whammm walter sinks the griddle into lous skull   lou grunts and 
crashes to the floor 

walter cringes back in terror  as he steps back we see the bloody 
edge of the griddle 

walter staggers back witnessing what he has done 

soon there is a knocking on his door 

				mrs swickeros
		walter

at first walter is too shocked to hear the knocking but soon he 
does and a horrible realization forms in his mind 

ext courtyard  night

mrs swicker knocks on the door listening intently 

				mrs swicker
		walter

she knocks again 

				mrs swicker
		walter are you alright  i thought
		i heard some shouting a minute ago

mrs swicker waits for a beat  soon she hears banging and clanging 
through the door 

				mrs swicker
		walter

the banging and clanging continues 

mrs swicker knocks again  the banging reaches comical proportions 


				mrs swicker
		walter open this door 
the clanging continues  mrs swicker jiggles the door handle  the 
door opens 

int walters room  night

mrs swicker walks in and walter hides the bloody griddle in the 
nick of time staggering back 

				mrs swicker
		whats all the noise in here

				walter
		noise mrs swicker  what noise

mrs swicker closes the door behind her 

				mrs swicker
		dont tell me i didnt hear a
		racket  im an older woman and
		i dont need to be upset and
		disturbed in this manner

				walter
		i was just straightening up the
		place

				mrs swicker
		straightening up indeed  are you
		sure youre not alone

				walter
		im always alone mrs swicker
		you know that

mrs swicker begins to snoop around the place 

				mrs swicker
		walter have you been talking to
		yourself again

				walter
			wringing his hands
		well yes i guess i have been mrs
		swicker  somebodys got to

mrs swicker continues to snoop around  she then turns and looks at 
walter 

				mrs swicker
			exasperated
		walter you know what you need is
		a girl

mrs swicker continues to inspect the place with walter following 
close behind her 

				mrs swicker
		she doesnt have to be pretty
		just as long as she takes good care
		of you
		
				walter
		uh i can take real good care of
		myself mrs swicker

mrs swicker continues to look around the cluttered room 

				mrs swicker
		yeah i can see that look at
		this place

at that moment lous bloody arm drops into view in the background 
having been stuffed in a crawl space above the sink 

				mrs swicker
		its terrible  why dont you
		ever clean it up

walter notices the arm as mrs swicker directs her attention in the 
opposite direction grabbing a sheet 

				mrs swicker
		and when did you change these sheets
		last  it looks like theyre alive

walter panics and gently leads mrs swicker to the door 

				walter
		uh mrs swicker i got to meet some
		friends later and i have to take
		a shower

				mrs swicker
		well why dont you clean up this
		dump

mrs swicker resists as walter opens the door and pushes her out 

				walter
		i will  good night mrs swicker

				mrs swicker
		whats the matter with you

walter shoves her out the door and closes it behind him 

pressing his back against the door he looks ahead 

blood begins to trickle down lous arm 

walter approaches the bloody arm caught in a total panic 

blood begins to drop on the floor 

walter looks around frantically and finds a big metal pot 

he places it under the dripping blood lowering it to the ground 

he then steps back listening to the rhythmic trickle of blood 
hitting the pot 

walter staggers back grabbing a sponge 

he heads over to a puddle of smeared blood on the floor 

he gets on his knees and begins to wipe up the blood 

				walter
			crying
		i didnt mean to hurt you sir
		if you had shot me youd be
		mopping up my blood now

walter continues to mop up the stain 

				walter
		i couldnt help it if i got scared
		i didnt mean it

walter stops to listen to the trickling blood  something dawns on 
him 

				walter
		its crazyits crazy
			beat
		i didnt think i had it in me
		howd ya do it walter

walter gets up faces lous off camera corpse and addresses it 
				walter
		he said go home and make something
		walter  make another cat

walter looks down at the pot filling with blood 


				walter
		but i told him i didnt have
		another cat

walter then gets an idea and looks up toward lous body 

walters expression changes from one of panic to one of new 
inspiration 

ext payphone  day

int jabberjaw  day

leonard enters and closes the door  he begins lifting shades and 
getting the place ready to open 

he heads over to the alcove something catches his eye 

it is the dead cat sculpture 

leonard stops to look at it laughing faintly to himself  he then 
picks it up and inspects it shaking his head 

he puts it back positioning it just so  as he turns his back the 
cat leans forward and crashes to the ground 

leonard turns around and sees what happened  he picks it up and 
examines it 

there is a fracture in the plaster  leonard runs his finger over it 


close on leonards face he notices something 

as leonard traces his finger over the fracture he discovers some 
cat hairs protruding from the sculpture 

taken aback by the discovery leonard puts the sculpture
down 

he then pokes it almost as if he expects a response 
leonard slowly breaks into a knowing smile

the joint is jumping as the audience listens to a musician  playing 
assorted garbage from the scrap yard 

several patrons examine the dead cat sculpture 

cuff and link sit at a table noticing the commotion wit contempt 

				cuff

		my art because thats what i am
		you know  im an artist  im not

				cuff
		i mean screw them you know  im

just then art enters the club 

cuff and link see him come in  walter busses an adjacent table 

				cuff
		and man who is this dude  hes

a shady  looking couple behind cuff and link notice art  also and 
decide to hastily leave 

				link
		i wonder what his deal is

				cuff
		i think hes looking for you man
		its all finally catching up with you

link sees walter 

				link
		no i think theyre looking for walter
		cause hes wanted for stealing 

walter leaves with the tray pretending not to have heard the comment 
 he nevertheless crashes into a leonard spilling the contents of 
the tray 

				cuff
		jeez take it easy walter

walter crouches and picks up the items 

leonard looks down at him with disdain  walter then stands
up 

				walter
		sorry about that mr de santis

leonard says nothing for a beat 

				leonard
		thats alright walter

leonard then gestures to a table 

				leonard

the comment takes walter by surprise 
				walter

cuff and link watch as walter sits down 

				walter

carla sits down and listens 

				leonard
		a man came in here and wanted to
		pay me fifty dollars for the cat
		in fact he took it home to show
		to his wife in case youre wondering
		where it was

carla looks at walter 

				leonard
		you know what that proves

				walter
		what mr de santis






				leonard
		it proves ive underestimated
		walters ability  his work has
		hit a nerve in the collective
		zeitgeist of the art community				
		it has enormous realism  you can
		hardly tell it from the real
		thing

				link
		sounds like hes busting your
		chops walter

				carla
		are you trying to be funny

				leonard
		im totally serious

leonard gets close to walter  puts his hand on his
shoulder 

				leonard

cuff drops a chunk of whole wheat bread onto his plate 

leonard composes himself

leonard heads off 

				carla
		i think he really is sick

				link
		so who isnt around here

leonard heads over to the other end of the club 

a plump man enters the club looking around 

he spots leonard and makes his way toward him 

leonard takes a deep breath  the plump man approaches 

				plump man

leonard looks at her for a beat then nods 

onstage the industrial musician finishes up his song and the crowd 
applauds 
									dissolve to
int walters room  night

the door opens and walter walks in followed by carla and leonard 

walter turns on the overhead lamp  int the center of the room is a 
tall object covered by a sheet 
leonard closes the door behind him 

carla looks at the object 


				carla
		look at the size of it

				walter
		its not really that big i got
		it on kind of a stand

				carla
		lets see it

				walter
		uh well im a little nervous
		i never did a person before

				carla
		you can do anything you want if
		you set your mind to it

leonard leans back against the door and swallows 

				leonard
		its hot in here

				walter
		you want me to open a window or
		something

				carla
		come on walter take off the
		sheet

walter obliges pulling down the sheet to reveal his creation 

it is lou standing upright and looking down at the three spectators 
 his skull is cleaved right down the middle from the top of his 
head to the bridge of his nose 

leonard and carla stare in dumbstruck silence 

walter looks at their expressions clutching the sheet 

				walter
		dont you like it

carla continues to stare for a beat 

				carla
		like it
			beat
		its a masterpiece  ive never
		seen anything like it before
		and i hope i never see anything
		like it again
walter smiles and looks at his creation 

				walter
		me too

				leonard
		i have to sit down

carla walks around the statue 

				carla
		take it inin its eloquence
		modern man in all hisself
		pity

leonard drops down onto a hardwood chair 

				carla
		how did you ever find it all
		in yourself walter

				walter
		it wasnt easy

carla looks back at leonard who has an ashen look on his
face 
				carla
		whats the matter with you

				leonard
		nothingnothing at all

				carla
		ive never seen anyone so
		squeamish
			beat
		well whats your opinion
		leonard

				leonard
		dont ask

				carla
		oh come on  even you can see
		its value

the head stares back at the two 

				carla
		do you think you or i could have
		conceived of such a thing much
		less have executed it

leonard says nothing 

				carla
		well then admit it its a work
		of genius

				leonard
		i admit it

walter heads over to leonard 

				walter
		we can bring it down to the
		jabberjaw

leonard gets up 

				leonard
		no  why dont you cover it up
		walter

				carla
		why not

				leonard
		why dont you cover it up walter

walter throws the sheet back over the sculpture 

				carla
		whats wrong with you why do
		you want to hide it

				leonard
		well ive been thinking
			beat
		i didnt realize how muchtalent
		walter actually had  it would be
		wrong for us to show them one at
		a time
			beat
		dead wrong

				carla
		youre right  we should build a
		collection first

leonard backs up looking at the two of them 

				leonard
		thats itthats the idea
		maybe when its big enough we
		can have a show

walter rushes over to leonard 

				walter
		a show  like this sunday

				leonard
		nno  not exactly i mean you
		take years and years

leonard looks at the sculpture composing himself 

				leonard
		it will take years to make that
		many statues
			beat
		but your work would be featured

				carla
		thats the idea walter  its the
		only way to gain recognition all
		the big art critics and art dealers
		would be there it would be an
		event

				leonard
		yeah then you could unload  sell
		this stuff for a lot more

				walter
		a showhow soon can we go

				leonard
		these things take time walter
		but for now youve got to break
		out of this oneavenue youre
		on

leonard heads over to carla 

				leonard
		carla and i will guide you help
		develop and evolve your workmaybe
		lead you toward something more abstract

				carla
		abstract  with his talent for realism

				leonard
		you see the direction his realism
		takes its unhealthy

				walter
		look you said i was a genius  if
		im a genius i dont want to be a
		bus boy anymore
				leonard
		well maybe you have a point there
		you shouldnt keep working at the
		jabberjaw  look

leonard digs into his pocket and peels off two hundred
fifty dollars 

				leonard
		now look  dead cats money in
		the bank im sure that mans going
		to buy it so heres your half
		in advance  twenty five dollars

leonard hands the money to an ecstatic walter 

				leonard
		and if you need more ive got it
		dont worry
			beat
		i have faith in you walter

walter heads over to carla holding up the money and smiling like a 
simpleton 

				walter
		geetwenty five dollars for
		something i made

				carla
		now youre a professional

leonard heads over to the door and opens it 

				leonard
		lets go

carla gives a look of attraction to walter and heads toward the door 


				carla
		good night walter  and keep
		up the good work

walter smiles at her as leonard gently takes her arm 

				leonard
		but dont burn yourself out walter
		youve got all the time in the
		world
			beat
		lets go

leonard pulls carla into the courtyard 

walter heads over to the door 

				walter
		good night

walter closes the door and gazes at the money again  he is truly 
thrilled and begins to jump around the room hooting and hollering 


ext courtyard  night

mrs swicker walks by walters door overhearing him carrying on 

int walters room  night

mrs swicker opens the door watching walter jumping around 
				
				mrs swicker
		whats going on

walter spins around and stops jumping  he runs over to mrs swicker 
holding the money 

				walter
		im an artist mrs swicker  a
		professional artist

walter yanks the sheet off the statue 

mrs swicker stares at the apparition looking as if shes about to 
lose her lunch 

she gently back up into the hall 

				mrs swicker
		good night

mrs swicker closes the door abruptly 

walter turns around and gleefully continues to stare at the money 
									dissolve to

int jabberjaw  night

another busy night at the club  a dj spins a hybrid assortment of 
records resulting in a most irritating sound 

leonard sits close to carla smoking as she nurses a glass of wine 


art arrives again looking around the room 

he passes maxwell who sits at a table with mayolia charlie and an 
attractive blond girl  once again maxwell is somewhat intoxicated 


				maxwell
		one of the greatest advantages
		to modern poetry is the overload
		of sensations from which to draw
		everywhere in our minute lives
		our tvs and our information
		traffic jam  the goal is to
		filter those sensations to
		articulate our awareness  and				
		im proud to say my poetry is
		understood only by that small
		minority which isaware

				attractive girl
		aware of what

				mayolia
		not of anything stupid  just
		aware

art passes cuff and link sitting at a table smoking cigarettes 

				cuff
		theres that weird dude again

				link
		man if this place doesnt cool
		out im gonna hang out somewhere
		else

the singer continues to sing his song  link then sees something 

				link		
		get a load of this 

then walter walks through the front door  his look has changed 
considerably  hes dressed like an eccentric artist wearing 
unusual clothes and looking somewhat ridiculous  he strides into 
the club 

people notice him and greet him as he nods to various
people 

a couple points and talks about him 

he passes leonard and carla  leonard does a doubletake 

				carla
		hi walter

				walter
		carla

walter sits down at a table next to leonard and carla  a waiter 
approaches 

				walter
		ill have a taftssorrel mineral
		water a piece of papaya cheese
		cake and and a grande cappuccino

walter lights up a small cigar looking at carla
confidently  a piece of tobacco gets stuck on his lip which he has 
to spit off 

maxwell approaches walters table and extends his hand 

				maxwell
		walter

walter shakes his hand 

				walter
		maxwell

				maxwell
		i see the rewards of achievement
		have come your way

maxwell sits down 

				walter
		well i am starting to have some
		success now with my pieces

cuff and link witness the encounter 

				cuff
		man look at that get up 

				link		
		looks like that cat paid
		off in spades

				cuff
		lets check out the scene

cuff gets up 

				link		
		im with you

leonard stands and addresses maxwell and walter 

				leonard
		i was just suggesting to walter

the two of them  leonard sits back down with
carla

		jabberjaw

				walter
		who do you think youre talking
		about

alice laughs condescendingly 

				alice
		look at you  who do think you
		are  youre just a poser trying
		and failing to fit into the scene

				maxwell
		strong words
			under his breath
		for such a simple mind

				alice
		i think this bit about him being
		this discovered sculptor is a
		bunch of baloney and a cry for
		help		

				walter

alice picks up a piece of cake 

				alice
		prove it  make something out
		of this

walter smushes the cake onto alices palm 

				walter

maxwell bellows with laughter  alice wipes off her hand 

				alice
		if you were an artist you could
		have created something

				walter
		im going home

walter gets up and leaves 

carla turns and raises her glass to alice smiling 

				carla

dejected walter makes his way out of the club storming past 
mayolia 

mayolia watches walter leave 

									dissolve to


ext jabberjaw  night

off

to leave 

when the coast is clear he begins to follow her

ext bungalow  night

alice enters the courtyard  she walks over to the front door of her 
bungalow enters and closes the door behind

closing the door 

just then mrs swicker opens her door down the hall poking her head 
out 

int walters room  night

alice begins to undress 

				alice
		you could use a little more
		heat in this place 

walter drags a big bag of plaster out of a closet  he drags it to a 
new addition in the room a large trough 

				walter
		its bad for the clay youll
		get used to it

walter then props up a chair 

				alice

walter heads over to the lump of clay on the table 

alice sits down back to camera totally nude 

				alice

walter does a double take and swallows hard at the voluptuous 
figure before him 

				walter

walter nervously kneads the clay 

				alice

this comment stings walter  he clenches his jaw and gets up 

				walter

				alice
		ill pose any way you want

walter then grabs up a scarf and approaches alice 

walter then hands the scarf to alice 

				walter
		i want you to put this around
		your neck

alice takes the scarf and places it around her neck 

				walter
		just like thatthats right

walter then steps behind alice grabbing the ends of the scarf 
gently 

then suddenly walter pulls the ends hard choking alice 

alice clutches the scarf and struggles panicking and gasping for 
air 

walter tugs at the scarf with all his might 

alice kicks and tries to free herself to no avail 

walter continues to strangle her clenching his jaws

flabbergasted 

int jabberjaw  night

a loud band wraps up a song and the singer crashes into the drum 
set  people applaud 

walter sits in a big wooden chair with a paper crown on his head and 
a paper star on his lapel looking a little tipsy  in one hand is a 
goblet in the other a plunger

his hands 

scattered applause erupts

		order  order

the crowd quiets down as maxwell puts his hand on walters shoulder 


				maxwell
		walter
			booming voice
		the bird that flies now pays
		later through the nose of
		ambidextrous apathy 

walter strains to understand 

				maxwell
		necrophiles may dance upon the
		placemats in an orgy of
		togetherness 

walter looks around the room as maxwell gathers steam 





				maxwell
		the highway of life cuts sharply
		through the shady ghettos and the
		ivycovered tombs and laughter
		rains from every capsule in the
		starspangled firmament 

cuff link and mayolia listen from an adjacent table 

				maxwellos
		and in the deep freeze it is the
		childrens hour 

maxwell punches holes in the air with his finger 

				maxwell
		and no one knows that duncan is
		murdered and no one knows that
		walter paisley is born 

maxwell slaps his hand on walters shoulder spilling some of 
walters champagne  walter smiles and looks at maxwell through his 
drunken haze 

				maxwell

leonard listens with a blank expression on his face 

art slouches at a table and looks at maxwell like hes a jerk  he 
shifts unable to take much more of this

wood then turns it off

only to be startled by walter

boozy breath 

				carpenter

the carpenter turns the saw back on 

walter spins the man around by his shoulder 

				walter
			loud slurred
		all else is rice cakes

the carpenter shoves walter hard  he lands on his ass 

				carpenter
		get out of here you god  damn

walter staggers to his feet and takes a few steps back  the 
carpenter gives him a wary look for a beat and then continues sawing 


walter then pounces on the man choking him 

the carpenter tries to fight back but walter is possessed with a 
psychotic strength 

walter begins to gain the upper hand forcing the mans neck closer 
and closer to the sawblade 

the carpenter sees the blade and struggles with all his might to 
get free 


				carpenter
		nono

walter forces the mans face down on the metal 

				carpenter
		stopnonoooooo


the saw makes a cutting noise 

				carpenter
		aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
