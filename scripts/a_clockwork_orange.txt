on she suddenly came with a burst of singing and it was like for a 
moment o my brothers some great bird had flown into the milkbar and i 
felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise athe 
shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again 
because i knew what she sang it was a bit from the glorious 9th by 
ludwig van
dim makes a liptrump followed by a dog howl followed by two fingers 
pronging twice in the air followed by a clowny guffaw

under my bed and behind my gulliver the trumpets threewise silver

heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a space ship gravity all 
nonsense now as i slooshied i knew such lovely pictures there were 
veeks and ptitsas laying on the ground screaming for mercy and i was 
smecking all over my rot and grinding my boot into their tortured 
litsos and there were naked devotchkas ripped and creeching against 
walls and i plunging like a shlaga into them

laughs derisively and rises deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass 
of water on the night table and fails to notice a set of false teeth 
soaking in them he drinks from the glass the clink of the teeth 
sounding like icecubes

priest
i ask you friends whats it going to be then is it going to be in and 
out of institutions like this or more in then out for most of you or 
are you going to attend the divine word and realise the punishment that 
awaits unrepentant sinners in the next world as well as this a lot of 
idiots you are selling your birthright for a saucer of cold porridge 
the urge to live easy i ask you friends is it worth it when we have 
undeniable proof  yes my friends incontrovertible evidence that hell 
exists i know i know my friends i have been informed in visions 
that there is a place darker than any prison hotter than any human 
flame of fire where unrepentant criminals sinners like yourselves
a convict burps
all laugh

priest
dont you laugh damn you dont you laugh i say like yourselves  
scream in endless and unendurable agony their nostrils choked with the 
smell of filth their mouths crammed with burning ordure their skins 
rotting and peeling a fireball spinning in their screaming guts i 
know oh yes i know
a convict lets rip some lip music  prrrrrrrp there is laughter chief 
guard moves forward  points 

chief guard

i did not love my shepherds voice
i would not be controlled

chief guard

singing
i was a wayward child
i did not love my home
i did not love my fathers voice
i loved afar to roam

alex vo
it had not been edifying indeed not being in this hell hole and human 
zoo for two years now being kicked and tolchocked by brutal warders 
and meeting leering criminals and perverts ready to dribble all over a 
lucious young malchick like your storyteller 
 
int priests library  day
alex reading the bible

alex vo
it was my rabbit to help the prison charlie with the sunday service he 
was a bolshy great burly bastard but he was very fond of myself me 
being very young and also now very interested in the big book
priest walks by and nods pleasantly

alex vo
it had been arranged by the prison charlie as part of my further 
education to read him the bible i didnt so much like the latter part 
of the book which is more like all preachy talking than fighting and 
the old inout i liked the parts where these old yahoodies tolchock 
each other and then drink their hebrew vino and then getting on to the 
bed with their wives handmaidens that kept me going
 
bible fantasy  fighting  day
biblical fighting shot alex slashing away blood spurting
 
handmaiden fantasy in tent  day
alex lying with three seminude handmaidens
 
ext biblical street
christ being whipped on by alex dressed as a legionary

alex
move on there move on

alex vo
i read all about the scourging and the crowning with thorns and all 
that and i could viddy myself helping in and even taking charge of the 
tolchocking and the nailing in being dressed in the height of roman 
fashion
 
back to the library
alex sits with his eyes closed
priest comes over and squeezes his shoulder
alex looks up at him and smiles

priest
reading from alexs bible
seek not to be like evil men neither desire to be with them because 
their minds studieth robberies and their lips speak deceits

alex
if thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress thy strength 
shall be diminished

priest
fine my boy fine fine

alex
father i have tried have i not

priest
you have my son

alex
ive done my best have i not

priest
indeed

alex
and father ive never been guilty of any institutional infractions 
have i

priest
you certainly have not 655321 youve been very helpful and youve 
shown a genuine desire to reform

alex
father  may i ask you a question in private

priest
certainly my son certainly is there something troubling you my son 
dont be shy to speak up remember i know all the urges that can 
trouble young men deprived of the society of women

alex
no father its nothing like that father its about this new thing 
theyre all talking about about this new treatment that you out of 
prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again

priest
where did you hear about this whose been talking about these things

alex
these things get around father two warders talk as it might be and 
somebody cant help overhearing what they say then somebody picks up a 
scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about 
it how about putting me in for this new treatment father

priest
i take it you are referring to the ludovico technique

alex
i dont know what its called father all i know is that it gets you 
out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again

priest
thats not proven 655321 in fact it is only in the experimental 
stage at this moment

alex
but it is being used isnt it father

priest
it has not been used yet in this prison the governor has grave doubts 
about it and i have heard that there are very serious dangers involved

alex
i dont care about the danger father i just want to be good i want 
for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness

priest
the question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good 
goodness comes from within goodness is chosen when a man cannot 
chose he ceases to be a man

alex
i dont understand about the whys and wherefores father i only know i 
want to be good

priest
be patient my son and put your trust in the lord

alex
instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to 
thy soul

priest
amen
they cross themselves

very new broom well these new ridiculous ideas have come at last and 
orders are orders though i may say to you in confidence that i do not 
approve an eye for an eye i say if someone hits you you hit back 
do you not why then should not the state very severely hit by you 
brutal offenders not hit back also but the new view is to say no the 
new view is that we turn the bad into good all of which seems to be 
grossly unjust hmmmmmm

dr branom
something like that you are a little undernourished so after each 
meal were going to give you a shot roll over on your right side 
please loosen your pyjama pants and pull them halfway down
he does somewhat reluctantly she gives him a shot in the bum

alex
what exactly is the treatment here going to be then

dr branom
its quite simple really were just going to show you some films

alex
you mean like going to the pictures

dr branom
something like that

alex
well thats good i like to viddy the old films now and again
 
int audio visual ludovico centre  day
auditorium setting alex is bound in a examination chair in front of a 
large video screen a whitecoated technician is strapping alexs head 
to a medical device
he then carefully attaches the eyelid locking to alexs eyes

alex vo
and viddy films i would where i was taken to brothers was like no 
cine id been in before i was bound up in a straightjacket and my 
gulliver was strapped to a headrest with like wires running away from 
it then they clamped like lidlocks on my eyes so i could not shut them 
no matter how hard i tried it seemed a bit crazy to me but i let them 
get on with what they wanted to get on with if i was to be a free 
young malchick in a fortnights time i would put up with much in the 
meantime my brothers
at the back of the auditorium are ten or fifteen solemn medical 
professionals in white coats watching the proceedings and occasionally 
taking notes a film begins showing on the screen
the technician drops eyedrops into alexs eyes
 
violence film
man being beaten by four toughs wearing white
punches kicks grunts blood

alex vo
so far the first film was a very good professional piece of cine 
looked like it was done in hollywood
screams moans kicks punches

alex vo
the sounds were real horroshow you could slooshy the screams and moans 
very realistic and you could even get the heavy breathing and panting 
of the tolchocking malchicks at the same time and then what do you 
know soon our dear old friend the red red vino on tap the same in 
all places like its put out by the same big firm began to flow it 
was beautiful its funny how the colours of the real world only seem 
really real when you viddy them on a screen
more kicks punches groans thumps
girl being beaten raped by six toughs
screams music laughing grunts heavy breathing

alex vo
now all the time i was watching this i was beginning to get very aware 
of like not feeling all that well but i tried to forget this 
concentrating on the next film which jumped right away on a young 
devotchka who was being given the old inout inout first by one 
malchick then another then another this seemed real very real 
though if you thought about it properly you couldnt imagine lewdies 
actually agreeing to having all this done to them in a film and if 
these films were made by the good or the state you couldnt imagine 
them being allowed to take these films without like interfering with 
what was going on
girl being raped

alex vo
when it came to the sixth or seventh malchick leering and smecking and 
then going into it i began to feel really sick but i could not shut 
my glazzies and even if i tried to move my glazballs about i still not 
get out of the line of fire of this picture
alex squirming and retching
dr brodsky clears his throat and quietly addresses his colleagues 
seated in the back of the room

dr brodsky
very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death
like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness 
one of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death a 
sense of stifling and drowning and it is during this period we have 
found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his 
catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees
alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket

alex
let me be sick i want to get up get me something to be sick in 
stop the film please stop it i cant stand it any more stop it 
please please
 
int alexs room  ludovico  day

dr branom
well that was a very promising start by my calculations you should 
be starting to feel alright again yes dr brodskys pleased with you 
now tomorrow therell be two sessions of course morning and 
afternoon

alex
you mean i have to viddy two sessions in one day

dr branom
i imagine youll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day 
but we have to be hard on you you have to be cured

alex
but it was horrible

dr branom
well of course it was horrible violence is a very horrible thing 
thats what youre learning now your body is learning it

alex
i just dont understand about feeling sick the way i did i never used 
to feel sick before i used to feel like the very opposite i mean 
doing it or watching it i used to feel real horrorshow i just dont 
understand why how what

dr branom
you felt ill this afternoon because youre getting better you see 
when were healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear 
and nausea youre becoming healthy thats all by this time tomorrow 
youll be healthier still
 
int audio visual ludovico centre  day
alex retching and screaming  restrained again by a straightjacket

alex vo
it was the next day brothers and i had truly done my best morning 
and afternoon to play it their way and sit like a horrorshow co
operative malchick in the chair of torture while they flashed nasty 
bits of ultraviolence on the screen though not on the soundtrack my 
brothers the only sound being music then i noticed in all my pain and 
sickness what music it was that like cracked and boomed it was ludwig 
van  9th symphony 4th movement

alex
stop it stop it please i beg of you its a sin its a 
sin its a sin please
brodsky leans forward and turns down the sound

dr brodsky
whats all this about sin

alex
that using ludwig van like that he did no harm to anyone 
beethoven just wrote music

dr branom
are you referring to the background score

alex
yes

dr branom
youve heard beethoven before

alex
yes

dr brodsky
youre keen on music

alex
yes

dr branom
quietly
what do you think about that dr brodsky

dr brodsky
softly
it cant be helped heres your punishment element perhaps the 
governor ought to be pleased im sorry alex this is for your own 
good youll have to bear with us for a while

alex
you neednt take it any further sir youve proved to me that all this 
ultraviolence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong ive learned my 
lesson sir i see now what ive never seen before im cured praise 
bog

dr brodsky
youre not cured yet my boy

dr brodsky
you must take your chance boy the choice has been all yours

alex
but sir missus i see that its wrong its wrong because its 
like against like society its wrong because everybody has the right 
to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed

dr brodsky
no no boy you really must leave it to us but be cheerful about it 
in less than a fortnight now youll be a free man
 
int auditorium  day
vip audience including minister junior minister prison governor 
priest dr branom dr brodsky
dressed in street clothes alex enters led by a whitecoated technician
he is led onto stage and left standing there blinking into lights
the minister rises and walks to the front of the auditorium

minister
ladies and gentlemen at this point we introduce the subject himself 
he is as you will perceive fit and well nourished he comes straight 
from as nights sleep and a good breakfast undrugged unhypnotized 
tomorrow we send him with confidence out into the world again as 
decent a lad as you would meet on a may morning what a change is here 
ladies and gentlemen from the wretched hoodlum the state committed to 
unprofitable punishment some two years ago unchanged after two years 
unchanged do i say  not quite prison taught him a false smile the 
rubbed hands of hypocrisy the fawning greased obsequious leer other 
vices prison taught him as well as confirming him in those he had long 
practised before our party promised to restore law and order and to 
make the streets safe for the ordinary peace loving citizen this 
pledge is now about to become a reality ladies and gentlemen this is 
an historic moment the problem of criminal violence is soon to be a 
thing of the past but enough of words  act
he returns to his seat and leans close to his junior minister

junior minister
our necks are out a long way on this minister

minister
i have complete faith in brodsky if the polls are right we have 
nothing to lose

alex on floor  still retching
a beautiful nude girl enters
alex looks up slowly

alex vo
she came towards me with the light like it was the like light of 
heavenly grace and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was 
that i would like to have her right down there on the floor with the 
old inout real savage but quick as a shot came the sickness like a 
detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to 
make his arrest
alex retching minister rises

minister
thank you very much thank you my dear 
girl bows and exits to loud applause

minister
not feeling too bad now are you

alex
pulling himself together
no sir i feel really great

minister
good

alex
was i alright sir did i do well sir

minister
fine absolutely fine you see ladies and gentlemen our subject is 
you see impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward 
evil the intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings 
of physical distress to counter these the subject has to switch to a 
diametrically opposed attitude any questions
priest rises and moves to alex

priest
choice the boy has no real choice has he self interest fear of 
physical pain drove him to that grotesque act of self abasement its 
insincerity was clearly to be seen he ceases also to be a creature 
capable of moral choice

minister
padre these are subtleties we are not concerned with motive with the 
higher ethics we are concerned only with cutting down crime and with 
relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons he will be your true 
christian ready to turn the other cheek ready to be crucified rather 
than crucify sick to the very heart at the thought even of killing a 
fly reclamation joy before the angels of god the point is that it 
works

int home  living room  night

alex vo

your faithful narrator being held helpless like a babe in arms and 
suddenly realising where i was and why home on the gate had looked so 
familiar but i knew i was safe i knew he would not remember me for 
in those carefree days i and my socalled droogs wore our maskies 
which were like real horrorshow disguises

julian

horrible new technique

mr alexander

prison then thrown out to be tortured by the police my heart goes out 
to you poor poor boy oh you are not the first to come here in 
distress the police are fond of bringing their victims to the 
outskirts of this village but it is providential that you who are 
also another kind of victim should come here but youre cold and 
shivering julian draw a bath for this young man

julian

he carries alex off

alex

alexander bites his hand
 
int home  bathroom
alex soaks eyes closed in a hot tub
after a while he begins softly singing to himself singin in the 
rain
 
int home  living room  day
mr alexander is hunched over the phone talking in hoarse whipsers 
the door to the bathroom is right behind him while he speaks mr 
alexander throws nervous glances over his shoulder

mr alexander
i tell you sir they have turned this young man into something other 
than a human being he has no power of choice any more hes committed 
to socially acceptable acts a little machine capable only of good 
he can be the most potent weapon imaginable to ensure that the 
government is not returned at the next election the governments great 
boast as you know sir is the way they have dealt with crime in the 
last few months recruiting brutal young roughs into the police 
proposing debilitation and willsapping techniques of conditioning oh 
weve seen it all before in other countries the thin end of the wedge 
before we know where we are we shall have the full apparatus of 
totalitarianism this young boy is a living witness to these diabolical 
proposals the people  the common people  must know must see 
there are rare traditions of liberty to defend the tradition of 
liberty means all the common people will let it go oh yes  they 
will sell liberty for a quieter life that is why they must be le
trembling with excitement and madness mr alexander hangs up the 
phone his eyes shiny with anticipation then suddenly he becomes 
aware of alexs voice coming from the other side of the door

if we could be of any help

dolin
but first wed like to find out a few things about you

alex
what would you like to know sir

dolin
well shall we get down to it

alex
yes sir
rubinstein takes out a notebook

rubinstein
the newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned 
against acts of sex and violence youve inadvertently been conditioned 
against music

alex
well er i think that was something that they hadnt planned for you 
see missus im very fond of music and always have been especially 
beethoven ludwig van beethoven b e e
he leans over and looks at her writing in notebook

rubinstein
its alright thank you

alex
and it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly 
bad film of like a concentration camp the background music was 
playing beethoven

rubinstein
so now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and 
violence

alex
oh well its its not all music you see missus its just the 9th

rubinstein
you mean beethovens 9th symphony

alex
thats right er i cant listen to the 9th any more at all when i 
hear the 9th i get like this funny feeling

rubinstein
when you say this funny feeling you mean the state of mind brought on 
by the treatment they gave you

alex
that is correct sir and then all i can think about is like trying to 
snuff it

rubinstein
i beg your pardon

alex
snuff it sir um death i mean missus er i just want to 
die peacefully like with no pain

rubinstein
do you feel that way now

alex
um oh no sir not exactly i still feel very miserable very much 
down in spirits

rubinstein
do you still feel suicidal

alex
um well put it this way i feel very low in myself i cant see 
much in the future and i feel that any second something terrible is 
going to happen to me
he pitches forward face into the plate of spaghetti

rubinstein
well done frank julian get the car will you please
 
int hifi room  dawn
alexander sits looking up rubinstein julian and dolin also listening 
to beethoven played loudly on tape recorder
 
int dolins house  prisoner bedroom  day
the 9th symphony booming up through the floor
alex slowly regains consciousness

alex vo
i woke up the pain and sickness all over me like an animal then i 
realised what it was the music coming up from the floor was our old 
friend ludwig van and the dreaded 9th symphony
he staggers to the door it is locked he kicks and tugs the door

alex
open the door turn it off turn it off
cut to
 
the billiard room below
hifi gear laid out on the table large speakers facing upwards mr 
alexander trembles and twitches he is now completely mad the others 
merely wait coolly
 
int dolins house  prisoner bedroom  day
alex on his knees his hands cupped over his ears banging his head on 
the floor
then he stops and slowly straightens up staring at the window

alex vo
suddenly i viddied what i had to do and what i had wanted to do  and 
that was to do myself in to snuff it to blast off forever out of this 
wicked cruel world one moment of pain perhaps and then sleep  forever 
and ever and ever
 
ext window  dawc
alex leaps out of the window
 
int hospital ward
alex in bed camera slowly tracks along length of his body everything 
is bandages and plaster splints wire cages blood drips

alex vo
i jumped o my brothers and i fell hard but i did not snuff it oh no 
if i had snuffed it i would not be here to tell what i have told i 
came back to life after a long black black gap of what might have 
been a million years
we hear alex moan and then another moan alex and the other  a few 
times
suddenly some curtains which have been drawn around another bed in the 
ward are parted and a nurse hurries to alex hastily buttoning up her 
uniform she is trailed by a young intern fumbling with his trousers

nurse

i can tell you that i and the government of which i am a member are 
deeply sorry about this my boy deeply sorry we tried to help you we 
followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be 
wrong an enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs we 
want you to regard us as friends weve put you right youre the best 
of treatments we never wished you harm but there are some that did 
and do and i think you know who those are there are certain people 
who wanted to use you for political ends people who would have been 
glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame 
it all on the government i think you know who those are there is also 
a certain man  a writer of subversive literature  who has been 
howling for your blood hes been mad with desire to stick a knife into 
you but youre safe from him now weve put him away he found out 
that you had done wrong to him  at least he believed you had done 
wrong he had formed this idea in his head that you h

after your interests we are interested in you and when you leave here 
you will have no further worries we shall see to everything a good 
job on a good salary

minister
you must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as 
adequate not only for the job which you are going to do and in 
compensation for what you believe you have suffered but also because 
you are helping us

alex
helping you sir

minister
we always help our friends dont we
smiles
it is no secret that the government has lost a lot of popularity 
because of you my boy there are some that think that at the next 
election we shall be out the press has chosen to take a very 
unfavourable view of what we tried to do

alex
well who can blame them sir

minister
mmmm possibly yes but public opinion has a way of changing and you 
alex if i may call you alex

alex

minister

changing the public verdict do you understand alex have i made 
myself clear

you can rely on me fred

our new understanding an understanding between two friends
