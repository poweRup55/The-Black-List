	dips a strip of newspaper into a bowl of paper mache mix

	closeup  the wetted paper

	is applied to a paper mache surface and a popsicle stick is 
	pressed into place  we are too tight to see the object being 
	constructed

	closeup  kristen parker

	kristen 16 is strikingly pretty despite the dark tired circles 
	under her eyes  shes exhausted but desperately trying to stay 
	awake  she wears pajamas and robe

	her head nods her eyelids close  she snaps herself awake

	the door closes shutting kristen into darkness  she lies in bed 
	blinking back angry tears  she turns on her side her gaze 
	falling on

	the paper mache object

	it is a miniature house glowing weirdly in th moonlight  a crude 
	homemade replica of the elm street house

	closeup  kristen

	staring at the tiny house hearing her mothers faint laughter 
	downstairs

	kristen begins to nod off though shes fighting it

	a breeze starts up rustling her hair  leaves fall across her 
	pillow and face  her mothers laughter fades out replaced by teh 
	eerie giggling of small children  she awakes with a start

	camera slowly pulls back craning up to reveal

	kristens bed sits in the middle of the dark deserted street in 
	front of the elm street house

	small children are playing on the lawn  the boys are dressed in 
	suits the girls in party dresses  they are jumping rope and 
	chanting a singsong

						children
			one two freddys coming for you 
			three four better lock your door
			five six grab your crucifix

	kristen

	gets out of bed and approaches the children transfixed

	except for one eerily pretty little girl sitting on her red 
	tricycle near the front door hair billowing in the breezes as she 
	stares at kristen

						little girl
			hello  whats your name

						kristen
			kristen  whats yours

	the little girl giggles and smiles shyly but doesnt answer

						kristen cont
			what is this place

	the wind kicks up moaning  we hear the sound of wind chimes

	the wind chime

	tinkling in the wind  the chimes are long razors

	kristen

	reacts

	another angle

	the front door of the house creaks open behind the little girl  
	darkness within

						little girl
					sadly
			i have to go now  bye

	ringing the bell on the handlebar she pedals her tricycle through 
	the door and is swallowed by the darkness inside

						kristen
			wait  dont go in there

	too late  kristen stands alone  fighting her fear she 
	approaches the house

	int elm street house  night

	kristen enters  the place is barren empty  broken windows 
	flaking paint rotted walls  leaves skitter across teh floor

						kristen
			little girl

	the children

	they sense her presence and turn their vacant staring eyes toward 
	her  they scatter vanishing into the shadows

	she hears the jingling of the tricycle bell and the giggling of 
	the little girl echoing faintly from deep inside the house  then 
	silence again  kristen tries to follow the sounds

	another angle

	kristen comes around a corner just in time to see

	her pov

	a quick glimpse of the little girl vanishing around the corner at 
	the far end of a long twisted corridor  the walls are streaked 
	with rustor perhaps dried blood

	kristen

	she keeps following  being led

	another angle

	kristen comes around a corner and finds herself facing a heavy 
	steel door that is just closing wiht a solid metallic clang  the 
	riveted metal seems out of place in the rotted wood house

	kristen goes to the door and pulls it slowly open  a stairway 
	leading down into darkness

	stairway

	kristen carefully makes her way down the metal steps

	int boiler room

	kristen fearfully enters freddys decrepit lair  ancient rusted 
	boilers stand cold and silent in the shadows

	the soft jingle of the tricycle draws kristens attention

	another angle

	the little girl pedals out of the darkness and comes to a stop 
	before kristen

						little girl
			this is where he takes us

	there is a screech of metal  kristen whirls and sees

	a boiler

	the rusted furnace door is swinging open metal grating on metal  
	inside the charred bones of children lie in heaps of cold ash  a 
	tricycle lies in the carnage identical to the little girls  
	only charred

	kristen

	horrified  suddenly a metal door slams loudly in the darkness  
	thudding footsteps approach booming closer

	the little girl

	looks up at kristen with sad eyes

						little girl
					eerily calm
			freddys home

	the boiler furnace

	now alive with roaring flames  the tricycles paint bubbles and 
	scorches in the intense heat

	kristen

	scoops the little girl into her arms and runs in blind terror  
	she glances back over her shoulder to see

	freddy

	looming from the row of boilers an indistinct silhouette in the 
	hellish smoke and flames  his maniacal laughter echoes through 
	the chamber

	kristen

	ducks through a doorway into another room still carrying the 
	little girl

	int room

	a hundred teenage bodies hang from teh ceiling strung up in the 
	darkness like butchered meat

	kristen

	gazes in horror  she looks down at the little girl cradled in her 
	arms  she is now a horribly charred brittle corpse  suddenly 
	her tiny mouth bursts open emitting a ghastly earsplitting 
	scream

									     shock cut to

	as she sits bolt upright in bed panting in terror face bathed in 
	sweat  she looks around recognizing her own room

	she gets out of bed and walks unsteadily to the bathroom

	int  bathroom

	she clicks on the light and looks at her reflection in the mirror  
	still trembling she runs water in the sink and splashes her face 
	trying to calm down

	the water becomes too hot  steam rises

	she tries to turn the water off but the pressure increases  more 
	steam

	closeup  kristen

	she fiddles with the handle confused

	as she turns it the fourpronged handle suddenly springs to life 
	grasping her hand

	kristen

	gasps and looks up  freddys face grins out at her from the 
	mirror  she screams  steam billows up

	the sink

	the other faucet handle begins to flex and stretch turning into 
	freddys claw hand  finger razors grow

	kristen

	screaming struggling to break free

	leering from the mirror laughing  the claw hand rises up into 
	frame poising to slash kristens exposed wrist

	in tight on her face  we hear the distant ghostly jingling of a 
	tricycle bell  her eyes slowly open

	kristen watches terrified as a tricycle rolls into the room by 
	itself leaving bloody tire tracks  the same tricycle that 
	belonged to the little girl

	the tricycle

	the door swings open  kristen emerges from a solid wall of water 
	and steps into the room  she is magically dry

	reverse angle

	it is the elm street living room foreboding and nearly barren of 
	furniture

	a large lump forms under the rug at the far end of the room and 
	undulates toward her sinuously  a long tubular shape

	kristen backs away

	the shape circles her aimlessly then slithers up the wall  a 
	huge writhing entity traveling within the wall surface

	the shape arcs back down toward the carpet and disappears below 
	the floorline

	kristen turns about apprehensively searching for the mysterious 
	entity  beat

	suddenly the creatures erupts through the floor directly beneath 
	her in a shower of wood splinters engulfing her legs as it 
	rockets straight up  it slams back down like a whale surfacing 
	kristen locked firmly in its jaws

	the creature

	is a gigantic serpentworm version of freddy ribbed and organic 
	encrusted with mucous and slime  its slavering jaws dislocate 
	like a snakes the skin stretching grotesquely as it begins to 
	swallow kristen from the legs up
