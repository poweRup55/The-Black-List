	and the kids take to their freedom like they were just sprung from 
	leavenworth

						kids
			gnight joehave a good weekend etc

	the bus driver doesnt answer but nods and smiles as they deboard  
	he is a pleasant looking elderly man wearing a khaki work shirt 
	a matching cap and chewing on an unlit twentyfive cent stogie

	the doors fold shut the gears grind and the bus continues along 
	its route

	int school bus  day

	while there are only about a dozen kids on the bus the noise 
	level is deafening  girls are yapping guys are horsing around 
	someone is fiddling with a ghettoblaster trying to decide among 
	several loud stations

	the bus turns a corner taking them out of the development and 
	past some older less identical looking residences spaced more 
	widely apart

	int school bus  day

	the driver downshifts the old heap pulls the wheel over to the 
	curb and reaches over to push the door lever open

	kids file out down he aisle some of them wishing him well as they 
	leave

	as the gears grind again and the bus pulls away  we see that 
	there are only a few kids remaining  two girls sit together 
	toward the center and a lone nerdylooking boy sits at the rear

	the driver is in front of an aluminum divider and except for the 
	top of his cap cannot be seen

	the two girls are pretty teenfashionable and just a little 
	immature  one of them turns back to look over her shoulder

	closer angle  the boy

	poor kid  about 17 foureyes bad skin lousy posture and an 
	obvious inferiority complex  hes sweating profussely and he 
	stands slightly to unlatch and lower the window  he pulls down on 
	it with all his strength but it is hopelessly stuck

	he sits back down and sighs  suddenly he feels the girls stare  
	he doesnt turn but sends his eyes over to see whos goggling at 
	him

	on girls  jesses pov

	the first girl turns back to her friend to whisper something  the 
	friend turns around to see for herself

	int bus

	the boy stares forward now and catches her glance directly

	the girls shift quickly in their seats to face forard and let out 
	with an uncontrollable rush of mean giggles

	the boy is clearly embarrassed now and looks down at the books in 
	his lap

	we hear the engine revving  the bus seems to be picking up speed

	one of the girls stands ready to get off

	girls pov out window ext street

	a mother her preschool child on a tricycle and their dog wait 
	for the bus to discharge the girl

	ext street

	the bus speeds past the waiting group to their amazement

	int bus

	the standind girls jaw drops open as they shoot by a familiar 
	looking intersection and continue to pick up speed

						first girl
					to her friend
			hey
					calling to driver
			hey that war our stop

	the bus turns a sharp corner and the first girl almost falls  the 
	second girl grips onto the seatback and lifts herself to her feet

						second girl
					calling to the driver
			hey joe  our stop

	her pov  the front of the bus

	the unseen driver ignores the calls and continues picking up 
	speed  we might notice that his hat has changed in place of the 
	cap we can see the top of a battered old fedora

						second girl oc
			hey let us off

	ext twolane street  day

	the sky has suddenly turned a wave of threatening clouds sweeps 
	overhead and the wind is churning a planting of roadside weeping 
	willows into a tangled mess of yellow tendrils

	the bus whines near the top end of third all of its flashers are 
	going like the dashboard was having a major coronary  it passes 
	the last house and heads into open terrain

	in the bus

	the second girl steps into the aisle and starts making her way 
	toward the front of the coach

						second girl
					under her breath
			deaf old fart

	she stops suddenly and gasps as she watches

	the drivers arm

	emerge to throw the floorshift into fourth  his hand is clad in a 
	strange glove that tip his fingers with a menacing set of razor
	sharp steel talons  his sleeve is charred and smoking

	the bus swerves wildly as it skids around a corner throwing its 
	few passengers into collision courses with the walls and each 
	other

	a flash of lightning crashes through the air

	ext desert landscape

	as the lightning subsides the sky is dark  the bus screams 
	along banging through rocks and ditches crashing through a wall 
	of overgrown brambles  thick clouds of steam pour out from under 
	he hood and stream back along toward the rear of the vehicle

	on the boy

	holding o to his seatback and watching out the window in terror as 
	trees tear loose from the ground i the buswake

	we hear a loud rumbling and the bus begins to shake as if the 
	planet itself is splitting in two

	on the bus

	skidding across the desert landscape being thrown to and fro 
	laterally at the mercy of the shuddering landscape

	on a front wheel

	as the tire smacks into a jagged boulder snapping the wheel from 
	its axle

	on the front end

	bouncing to a violent halt the bumer digging a long trench into 
	the earth

	in the bus

	the kids pick themselves up from the floor  it is very hot and 
	smoky inside  they have moved closer together now sweating 
	scared frantically the boy tries to open a window but it will 
	not budge

	he looks out the window and gasps

	ext pov from window

	the ground below begins to split apart and tumble into a deep 
	fissure that is encirling the bus

	on the moor the bus center

	the land is imploding all around it huge chunks of the earths 
	crust are shearing themselves loose from the edges of the fissure 
	and tumbling into oblivion

	in moments the bus is stranded on the narrow tip of a towering 
	ridge of crumbling stone

	the bus teeters precariously tasting the smoky abyss in every 
	direction

	inside

	the second girl is on al fours in the aisle  she looks up toward 
	the drivers seat

						second girl
					seeing something
					 hideous
			jesus

	she scrambles to her feet and begins backing off  the floor of 
	the bus shifts dangerously throwing the girl into the edge of one 
	of the seats

	on the driver

	as he makes his way toward the back  we dong see his face but he 
	is dressed in a filthy green and red sweater  in the bg the 
	dashboard instruments are sparking and sending thick black fumes 
	toward the ceiling  smoke is rising off his body as if he just 
	stepped out of some horrible fire  a small patch of skin on his 
	hand sizzles and pops and drips a molten glob of flesh that burns 
	a small hole in a seat cushion

	his razortalons sweep along the tops of the seatbacks cutting 
	deep gashes into the green vinyl upholstery and scraping horribly 
	over the tubular steel support poles

	on the boy

	terrified  lookign first at the awful talons then out the window 
	at the deadly drop and back at the bus driver

	on the girls

	sweating panicking  they back away going from window to window 
	trying desperately to pull them down  theyre all locked tight  
	one reaches for the emergence door leer at the rear of the bus  
	it comes off in her hand

	the kids huddle together petrified screaming as the driver is 
	upon her

	cu driver

	he lifts the awful talonned glove in fg  behind obscured by 
	smoke we see for an instant his fce  the face of freddy  he 
	raises his weapon arm higher and strikes

	see that it is mom slicing a tomato at the kitchen counter

	and a kid sister named ngela and they ll are having breakfast 
	together

	a moment later there is a muffled offcamera scream  mom looks 
	up  we can also make out the ringing of an alarm clock in another 
	part of the house

	elevenyear old genuinely cute not precocious

	jesse walsh 17 is sitting up in bed  hes sweaty and scared and 
	disoriented as he slams his hand down on the alarm and tries to 
	shake the nightmare out of his head

	we see that hes the boy on the bus only hes not halfbad looking 
	 far from nerdy  he has no skin problems and he doesnt wear 
	glasses and his bodys in good shape

	as he gets out of bed still shaky from the dream and we see that

	and halfempty  he trips over a carton on his way to his jeans

	pointing to a bowl of his product with one of his long sharp 
	fingernails  theres a burst above the product name that reads  
	free inside  fuman fingers and shows a drawing of a hand 
	wearing several extralong red plastic fingernails on its

	she grabs onto the prize at the botto of the box and gives a yank  
	a bagful of fu man fingers come out in her hand along with half

	int walsh house  foyer  day

	as jesse opens the front door to lisa poletti 17  she is facing 
	the street and she turns around when she hears the door open  not 
	a knockout but real pretty with an intelligence and sweetness 
	about her  she is truly lovely

						lisa

					gratefully

						jesse
			ah nothing

	jesse opens lisas car door for her  she steps in and sits down

	in the car

	the interior is worse than the body  the upholstery is torn to 
	shreds the dashboard is cracked and peeling and theres a big 
	hole where the radio used to be  a cheap am transistor radio 
	hangs by its wrist strap from the rearview mirror

	jesse hops in and shifts around to get comfortable and reaches 
	under the dash to pull out a couple of bare wires

	lisa watches him routinely twist the wires together amused

						lisa
			arent you afraid somebody could
			steal your car like that

						jesse
					preposterously
			look at this car  are you kidding

	he sits up again and reaches for a toggle switch that has been 
	crudely drilled into the dash  he flicks the switch

	jesse moves his finger to another alien button in the dash and 
	pushes it  the starter turns over slowly the engine backfires 
	and the car starts noisily

	jesse gives her the thumbs up as if he were a world war i ace 
	and puts the car into gear  it bucks and farts and rumbles up the 
	street

	ext pool  rear walsh house  day

	dad floats on a foam chair in the middle of the rather rundown 
	pool sipping coffee from a mug bearing the word dad  he looks 
	over his domain with satisfaction and inhales a deep breath of 
	fresh suburban sir

	mom comes out the back door  she looks just a bit worried

						mom

	an intramural softball game is in progress  coach schneider a 
	nasty looking exmarine stands behind home plate as an umpire

	jesse is covering second base

	ronny grady a toughlooking wiseass type steps up to the plate

	stance

	point draws back the bowstring and lets the arrow go

	on the target

	crack

	grady gets hold of a perfect pitch and sends it flying over the 
	head of the pitcher

	back to jesse

	boom

	the ball skids off the side of his head and the kid collapses 

	his teammates rush to his side and help jesse to his feet  hes 
	more embarrassed than hurt and he waves away any overattention  
	coach shneider joins the circle of bodies around him

						schneider

	his skull  hes standing just off the bag harassing jesse while 
	waiting to be hit home

						jesse
					flipping him the bird
			knit this grady

	grady sneers and gives him the jackoff sign

	jesse tosses an italian salute slapping one hand into the crook 
	of his arm and throwing up the finger for good measure

	grady grabs his own crotch and points to it obscenely

	on the pitcher

	he sends one over the plate the batter catches it deadcenter and 
	pounds it back to left field
 
	grady makes a break for third only to be forced back by teh left 
	fielder tossing the ball to the third baseman

	on jesse

	his glove up to receive the throw as grady steams towards him

	the ball snaps into jesses mitt and grady turns on his ankles to 
	shoot back to third

	jesse and the third baseman toss the ball between each time 
	moving closer in toward grady  grady switches directions with the 
	ball trapped between them

	grady dives into a headfirst slide trying to sneak past jesse

	jesse swoops down and tags him out

	thorougly aggravated grady rises to his feet by reaching out and 
	grabbing onto jesses gym shorts and yanking them down to his 
	ankles revealing jesses bare bunsinajockstrap to the world

	jesse lunges for grady trips over his shorts and the two of them 
	begin rolling around in the dirt duking it out

	on the girls in the next field

	watching the wrestling match with ausement

	on lisa and kerry

	lisa tries like hell to repress some laughter

						kerry
			cut ass

	on scneider

	pushing his way through a crowd of laughing cheering spectators 
	and jumping in to break up the scuffle

	he lifts both boys up by their necks

	jesse and grady side by side in the center of the baseball 
	diamond  they are in frontleaning rest position the cruel and 
	painful frozen pushup that ends halfway to the ground with elbows 
	bent

	we dont know how long theyve been out there but its probably 
	hours  it seems just a little darker out and a lonely wind is 
	blowing around their arms and legs

	in the bg kids are filing out of the building  some sop to 
	look out at the two boys point and snicker

	angle

	we see lisa among the kids  she stops for a moment and views the 
	scene with concern

	on jesse and grady

	they are dirty their shirts are ripped and jesse has a tiny 
	bruise over his cheek

	and theyre tired too  the muscles in their arms are twitching 
	convulsively and they talk to each other between groans and 
	through teeth clenched with pain

	we hear the offcamera sound of several busses pulling out

						jesse
			how much longer you figure hell keep

	int boys locker room  day

	jesse and grady stand at opposite ends of a row of lockers and 
	change into their street clothes  their movements are slow and 
	cumbersome  like a pair of creaky old men

	couple of times

						lisa

	and punches up his pillow a couple of times stares into space and 
	finally sits up

	he gets out of bed pulls on a pair of pants and exits

	kitchen

	he enters  the room is lit only by the glow of a three quarter 
	moon

	he regains his composure and steps over to the sink to pull off an 
	absurd length of paper toweling

	we see it just when jesse does  a grotesque face has been peering 
	into the window all this time  it disappears from view on jesses 
	double take

	jesse stops for a moment to slow down his heart  he takes a deep 
	breath and steps up to the back door

	we hear an awful sound from somewhere  wood rippigng

	jesse makes his way cautiously along the side of the house

	he notices a redorange light is flickering from behind a cellar 
	window  he gets down on his hands and knees to investigate

	the cellar  his pov

	an intruder is bent over by the furnace lit only by a raging fire 
	in the firebox  he puts his hand right into the flames and 
	begins digging for something way in the back of the furnace  we 
	cant see his face but he is dressed in a filthy green and red 
	striped sweater and a battered hat

	he pulls out a bundle of rags sets it on top of the furnace and 
	proceeds to unwrap it

	on jesse

						jesse
					petrified
			holy shit

	he stands up and looks around frantically  he doesnt know what 
	to do

						jesse
					near tears
			holy shit

	int walsh house  night

	jesse enters the house and scans the foyer  he heads toward the	 
	cellar door  it is ajar  the lockhas been splintered as if by a 
	huge wrecking bar  and we can hear the roar of the furnace from 
	below

	he sticks his head inside the cellar door and peeks down

	his pov

	the shadow of a figure movement on the cellar walls

	on jesse

	breathing heavily  brain whirring

	he pulls the basement door closed and holds it shut tight 
	practically hyperventilating

						jesse

	something inside starts to pull the cellar door open  jesse tries 
	to hold it shut but the inexorable force continues to inch it 
	open

	jesse lets go and bolts toward the foyer  freddy is standing in 
	his path a sick smile on his scarred face  he flashes his razor
	knives at jesse

						freddy
					sinisterly
			daddy cant help you now

	jesse tries to make a break for it but freddy is too fast  his 
	untaloned hand gets an iron grip on jesses shirt collar

						freddy
			ive been waiting five years for you
			jesse  we got special work to do you
			and me  things are really gonna heat
			up

	jesse struggles to get free  freddy tightens his iron grip and

	the chocking pain

						freddy

	freddy hurls jesse against the wall

						freddy
			you got the body

	a particularly ugly and ferocious looking snake is wrapping itself

	close on jesse

	as he wakes up slowly and looks down groggily toward his arm

	the snake

	opens wide and emitsa long demonic hiss

	jesse screams and hastily begins pulling the reptile away from

	he spots grady grinning widely

	int the walsh house  living room  early evening

	comfortable and very suburban  a major color tv takes up the 
	wall opposite a pair of his and hers barcaloungers

	dad is watching the six oclock news on the tube and fanning 
	himself with a tv guide

	mom sits on the couch with angela helping her with a jigsaw 
	puzzle

	two parakeets are fluttering around inside a cage near the entry 
	into the dining room

	jesse bounces down the stairway a rolled towel tucked under his 
	arm

	dad stares at him angrily then turns back to the game

	jesse crosses in front of the set on his way out of the room

						dad
			where are you going

						jesse
			just out for a while

						dad
					shaking his head
			i told you i want that room unpacked

						jesse
					begging
			oh come on dad

	jesses about to protest but dad cuts him off

	jesse turns around mumbles something under his breath and stomps 
	back upstairs

	ext lisas house  poolside early evening

	a pair of glass sliders lead from the house onto a stretch of 
	patio that surrounds a gorgeous builtin swimming pool  the patio 
	is dotted with all the amenities of backyard recreation a gas 
	barbque grill a wetbar plenty of pipe furniture and even a 
	pair of freestanding cabanas  the entire setup is contained by 
	a sixfoot chain link security fence

	lisa steps out of the cabana wearing a swim suit  she tosses her 
	towel onto a nearby chair and crosses to the diving board

	on the board

	she bounces lightly and jumps off cutting gracefully through the 
	water and coming up in the center of the pool

	mrs poletti a pleasant looking woman in her late 40s slides 
	open the patio doors and pokes her head out

						mrs poletti
					calling
			theres a jesse on the phone

						lisa oc
			okaythanks

	lisa swims to the edge of the pool and hoists herself up  she 
	throws the towel over her shoulders and picks up a wireless phone 
	from a low table

						lisa
			jesse hi
					a beat diappointed
			ohthats okay  sorry you cant
			make it
					a beat
			no i understand  parents can be
			real painsill see you in the 
			morning then

	she hangs up and frowns

	int walsh house  jesses room  night

	jesse stands at the foot of the bed surveying the job unhappily 
	and trying to figure out where to start

	finally he pulls a shoe box from inside a larger carton places 
	it on his desk and lifts the lid

	its full of cassette tapes  he rifles through them selecting 
	one and popping it inot a portable cassette player on the desk

	he pushes the play button  the tape is rock and roll

	the music gets him moving a bit  he surveys the room then goes 
	to a carton near the bookshelves  he reaches deep into the near
	empty carton and pulls out a stack of books which he plops on the 
	shelves next to other books already unpacked  he tosses the 
	carton aside

	hes getting into the music now as he spins around to face the 
	bureau  he opens a small pox on the bureau while bebopping along 
	and pulls out a pair of sunglasses which he puts on practically 
	dancing  he dumps the contents of the box haphazardly into a 
	bureau drawer

	jesse opens a large bureau drawer  he grbs a nearby box and dumps 
	it into the large drawer smoothing it over perfunctorily with his 
	hands  a stetson cowboy hat is on top  he drops it on his head 
	and pulls it down low over his eyes

	on a full length mirror

	jesse steps into frame to get a look at himself  he likes what he 
	sees as he mimes a guitar riff along with the music

	in one smooth move in rhythm with the music he seings around and 
	moves to the desk  he dumps a small box of pencils and supplies 
	into the desk drawer  as an afterthought he grabs a couple of 
	pencils out of the drawer and drums a few beats on the desk with 
	them

	he shoves the pencils up his nostrils tucks his thumbs under his 
	armpits and waves his elbows like hes doing the funky chicken  
	silly stuff that one owuld only do behind closed doors

	he spins around throwing his arms out and stopping ddead in his 
	tracks

	his pov

	lisa and mom are standing in his doorway  mom looks horrified  
	lisa represses a giggle

	mom reaches over and knocks timidly on the open door

	jesse hastily pulls the pencils out of his nose and dives for the 
	stereo to turn it off  beetred he tosses the hat and sun 
	glasses onto the bed and tries to look nonchalant

						jesse
					embarrassed
			hi

	jesse looks to mom who takes the hint and turns to leave  lisa 
	takes a step into the room

						lisa
					when mom is out of
					 range
			i told her you invited me over  i
			guess i should have called huh

	behind the embarrassment hes glad to see her  he puts the 
	pencils in the desk drawer and shuts it

						jesse
			no thats okay  i was justunpacking

						lisa
			i know

	lisa casually steps over to a carton and peeks in

						lisa
			i figured you might like some help

						jesse
					pleasantly surprised
			yeah

	jesses room  later

	the room is shaping up nicely with only a few boxes remaining

	jesse pulls a bundle wrapped in newspapers from a carton  he 
	tears away the paper revealing a baseball trophy

	he places it on a conspicuous corner of his dresser

	lisa reaches into the box retrieves an aerosol can and looks at 
	it

	on the can

	a medicated spray for jock itch

						lisa oc
			where does this go

	jesse grabs the can from her hand and puts it down on the dresser 
	behind the trophy

						jesse
					mortified
			theres a box of sweaters over there 
			if you want to put them up in the 
			closet

	lisa is anxious to pitch in  she nods goodnaturedly and steps 
	over to her assignment

										     cut to

	inside the closet

	as lisa opens the door and pulls an overhead chain to switch on 
	the light

	another angle

	as she drags a chair over lifts a pile of sweaters from an open 
	box steps up on the chair and stacks them on a shelf  she starts 
	to step back down when something catches her attention in  the 
	back corner of the shelf

	she reaches in and pulls out a small red leatherbound book

						lisa
			whats this

	jesse steps over to look at it

	on the book

	about twothirds the size of an average paperback it has a 
	matching leather thong that snaps into a small latch on the front 
	and opens the book

						lisa
					reading

	continue unpacking

	lisa leafs through a few more pages stops and begins reading with

	jesses voice trails off on claw and a chill of vague 
	recognition goes through him  he checks the cover of te book and 
	flips back a few pages

	lisa moves closer to read over his shoulder

	jesse composes himself and looks back at the book

						jesse

	int walsh house  living room  night

	mom wraps the nightcover over the bird cage  she steps past 
	angela on the couch and crosses in front of dad in his recliver 
	vegetating in front of the tube  she sits and loosens her collar 
	a bit

	on dad

	he shifts uncomfortably and wipes some beaded sweat from his upper 
	lip

						mom
					to dad
			a little warm in here huh

	dad gets up from his chair  his shirt is sticky with 
	perspiration

	jesse steps in from the dining room a glass of milk in his hand

	on angela

	looking up at jesse  she puts a finger to her lips

						angela
			shhhthe birds are sleeping

	jesse notices the intense heat in the room immediately  his eyes 
	widen portentiously

	on dad

	at the thermostat

						dad
					astounded
			its 97 degrees in here

	he pulls off the coverplate and starts fiddling with the coil

	suddenly a loud squawk from the other side of the room makes 
	everyone look up

	jesse puts his milk down on he tv and hurries over to the cage 
	ripping the cover away

	on the bird cage

	another series of horrible cries as one of the budgies proceeds to 
	rip up the neck of the other one with his sharp beak

	longer angle

	jesse throws open the door and tries to pull the attacking bird 
	off his victim  the vicious one continues the rabid attacks on 
	jesses hand drawing blood

	as jesse pulls his arm out the bird flies out into the living 
	room roaring a repetitive warcry that is eerie and unnatural for 
	something that size

	mom and dad jump to their feet  angela starts screaming at the 
	top of her lungs

	on the bird

	it circles around the ceiling and then dives for dad cutting a 
	deep gash under his eye  it seems much larger than it was before 
	 maybe twice its original size

						dad
					screaming
			get a broom or something

	angle living room

	mom dashes out of the room

	the bird swoops down heading for angela but crashing into the 
	shade of a table lamp knocking it to the floor

	it flutters to the ceiling and hovers near a light fixture  its 
	beak and most of its head is covered in blood and it opens its 
	mouth to emit a gutteral growl

	mom returns with a broom and hands it to dad

	as dad approaches and lifts the broom to his shoulder the bird 
	screams agai and dives for jesse
	
	jesse throws his arm out to block the attack  the bird reverses 
	direction and dad swings in midair with the broom

	he misses demolishing the remaining table lamp instead

	on the bird

	it hovers again in the air seemingly without any means of 
	support puffing up growing angrier more demonic  then just as 
	it seems ready for a last lethal attack there is a loud bang and 
	the bird literally explodes into flames in midair

	the family looks at one another in horror and disbelief  the only 
	sound in the room is angela attached to her mothers leg and 
	whimpering quietly

	int walsh house  kitchen  night

	crash

	dad 	dumps an odd assortment of home handyan tools on the kitchen 
	table  he picks through them selecting a pipe wrench and a screw 
	driver

	he crosses to the stove  we see mom in the bg standing not 
	quite cowering still in shock from the bird attack

	jesse is leaning on the counter next to the range watching his 
	fathers determined moves

	dad leans into the appliance and attempts to pull it away from the 
	wall probably tearing six or seven ligaments in the process

	after several tries he stops and looks up at his son

						dad
			help me with this thing

						jesse
			its not the gas dad

						dad
					angrily
			dont tell me its not the gas

	he yanks on the stove with more vehemence

						dad

			mother thought she smelled gas

						mom
					timidly
			i wasnt sure ken

						dad
					to mom
			alright then what is it  bird rabies

					resenting that
			oh please

						dad
			what is it then  theres got to be an
			explanation  animals just dont burst
			into flames for no reason

						jesse
			well it sure isnt leaky gas pipes

	dad stands up suddenly cracking his head on the edge of the range 
	hood

						mom
					concerned
			ken

	as he groans in pain hes suddenly hit with a revelation  he 
	points an accusatory finger at jesse

						dad

			of your sick jokes

						dad
			you know what im talking about  what

	int walsh home  second floor hallway  night

	jesse emerges from his room and eases the door shut as quietly as 
	possible  he stops to listen for any signs of his parents being 
	awake

	sound over snores from behind their bedroom door

	he steps lightly past their room adn toward the head of the 
	stairs

	we follow jesse as he descends the stairs into the darkened foyer

	the cellar door

	jesse stops there momentarily losing his nerve

	he finally turns the knob and opens the door

	int walsh home  cellar  night

	jesse pulls an overhead chain flooding the cellar with light

	its just as he saw it in his dream but devoid of any intruders

	he steps up the the furnace squats down and opens the firebox 
	door  he reaches in  to his horror he feels something and pulls 
	out an object wrapped in rags

	on the object

	as he unwraps it  an old beat leather glove with a row of rusty 
	knife blades protruding from the fingers

	suddenly the furnace switches on with a roar

	flames are leaping out of the firebox

						freddy oc
					laughingly
			hot enough for you

	jesse reels around

	freddy is just across the room

						freddy
					re the glove
			go ahead jesse  try it on for size

	jesse looks at the glove  the blades are no longer rusted but 
	gleaming and sharp

	he throws the weapon to the floor  freddy moves in closer

						jesse
			what do you want

						freddy
			i need you to finish my work  let me
			teach you jesse  well have fun  
			you like my little trick with the

					laughing
			cmon jesse  come to freddy

	jesse pushes over a stack of cartons in his path and dives for the 
	steps

	halfway up he misses his footing and slips tumbling back down

	another angle

	as jesse comes to at the foot of the cellar steps  the furnace 
	has stopped and freddy is gone  as he gets to his feet he 
	notices

	the glove

	on te floor where he dropped it as shiny and new as the day it 
	was made

	he pours himself a cup and turns abound to face his family

	jesse and dad are making an extra effort to avoid each others eye 
	contact

	shes still feeling bad drawing little circles in a puddle of 
	maple syrup with a corner of her waffle

	ext abandoned power plant  day

	an old generating plant big enough to have served what was once a 
	small town but rundown and obsolete now  the place is charred and 
	the grounds are littered with rubble  as if thered been a fire 
	there long ago

	the entrance to the plant is boarded up and plastered with no 
	trespassing signs  many of the boards are missing providing 
	easy access for the scores of vandals who had torn through there 
	at one time or another

	there are no windows at ground level but the top of the building 
	is lined with many multipaned frames all of them are either 
	cracked or missing

	jesses car pulls into frame and he and lisa get out and look the 
	place over

	int entranceway abandoned powerplant  day

	jesse and lisa climb between a pair of boards and step inside

	on lisa

	she walks toward the center of the plant fascinated

	int powerplant

	we can see the remnants of a large boiler room  big steel pipes 
	jut out of the floor in a tangle of elbows and valves and a 
	clutter of debris  a onestory holdig tank rises above a concrete 
	pit and is met on top by a mze of catwalks just under the 
	windows

	although most of the ceiling has burned away the interior is 
	surprisingly intact for a derelict building and the overhead light 
	distracts form any intrinsic creepiness the place would possess 
	after dark

	jesse steps in behind her

						lisa
					solemnly
			he kidnapped twenty kids and brought
			them all here to die

	she gives herself a chill but shakes it off and turns to jesse

						lisa
			so you feeling anything

						jesse
			what do you mean

			i thought you might be able to make
			a connection

	jesse shrugs his shoulders and puts his hands to the side of his

	eyes

						jesse

	jesse walks around in a small circle keeping hsi head up and his 
	eyes closed

						lisa
			anything

						jesse
					shakes his head
			uhuh
					a beat
			wait

	he walks slowly across the room almost in a trance until he 
	comes to a board leaning up against the foot of the meshiron 
	stairway that leads up to the catwalks

	on the board

	as his hand reaches over to touch it

	on lisa

	stepping over next to jesse

	another angle

	he pulls the board away

	a large rat in her nest with her young snarls at him

	jesse and lisa jump into each others arms

	ext abandoned powerplant  late afternoon

	jesse and lisa walk along the outskirts of the building to a 
	pretty cluster of shade trees nearby  lisa hoists herself up on a 
	boulder and looks at the building

						jesse
			disappointed

						lisa
			about what

						jesse
			about not finding any bogey men

						lisa
					smiles
			ill get over it

	she is disappointed  she wanted to find some bogey men

	jesse comes up close to her and they stare at each other

						lisa
					finally
			you are sensitive  i mean you sensed
			that the rat was there  and i can
			feel something about you  sometimes
			i feel like i know what youre thinking

	jesse moves in closer an puts his arms on her shoulders

						jesse
					suggestively

						lisa
					ignoring the 
					 suggestion
			maybe it only happens when youre
			sleeping  thats the way it was with
			nancy wasnt it

						jesse
			now theres an idea we can take off 
			on  maybe we should drive out to the
			beach tonight and lay out a couple
			of blankets and
					winks
			until i fall asleep

						lisa
					slyly
			maybe we can do that  strictly 
			scientific of course

	jesse moves in until their lips are almost touching

						jesse
			nancy went bonkers from this thing
			you wouldnt be afraid of being out
			on the beach with a potential 
			lunatic

						lisa
			ghostbusters are fearless

	they kiss  not little friendly pecks like before  this is the 
	real thing  jesse drops his arms to her waist and she opens her 
	legs so that he can get in real close

	suddenly jesse groans in pain and stands upright tearing from 
	their embrace  for the briefest instant we can see protrusions 
	grow and subside on his forehead and the side of his face

						lisa
			what is it  whats wrong

						jesse
					holding his stomach
			whoa

						lisa
			what is it

						jesse
			i dont know  a sharp pain

	lisa watches his helplessly  finally the agony lifts from 
	jesses face  he straightens up

						jesse
			its gone now

	drenched with sweat and continues to perspire profusely as he sits 
	up and turns on his bedside lamp

	a thunderhead is rumbling somewhere nearby

	the plastic shade of the lamp is melting

	he scans the room picking out various indications of the intense 
	heat that is surrounding him a candle on his bookshelf collapses 
	into a puddle of wax the laminated top of the nighttable is 
	bubbling an unsheathed record album hangs over the corner of the

	as jesse opens it  inside the glove fingers moving 
	independently unattached scraping little cuts in the bottom of

	from inside  he opens the door

	with prostitutes pimps traveling salesmen a couple of

	jesse enters and crosses to the bar amid a few stares  he sits on 
	a stool

	the bartender draws a cold beer and presents it to jesse  as the 
	bartender turns away jesse reaches for the glass

	a hand slaps down on his wrist and holds it tightly

	scneider turns to a huge padlocked cabinet on the wall

	he unlocks it and opens the doors  it is filled with a variety of 
	athletic equipment  dumbbells jumpropes and volley balls etc

	schneider selects a pair of jumpropes from the cabinet and sets 
	them down on his desk

	a distinct ping makes him look up  he goes to the door and looks 
	out into the hall

	jesse continues showering

	int coachs office

	schneider turns back to his office  there is another ping

	a tennis racquet hanging on the wall has two broken strings  two 
	more strings smoke then snap with a ping

	a basketball leaps off a shelf of the equipmnt cabinet and bounce 
	on the floor at schneiders feet

	schneider bends down to pick it up and two more balls jump out 
	onto the floor

	a fourth ball flies out and knocks over a trophy on his desk

	schneider hits the deck when a dumbbell streaks across the office 
	and slams into the window cracking the thick wired glass

	on schneider

	he makes his way to the cabinet by crawling along the floor as 
	basketballs volleyballs even a medicine ball fly over his head

	he reaches up to close the cabinet doors

	another angle

	a jumprope on the desk unravels like a harpoon line and wraps an 
	end of itself around schneiders wrist  the other end pulls hard 
	and yanks schneider off balance

	he reaches up to close the cabinet doors

	another angle

	a jumprope on the desk unravels like a harpoon line and wraps an 
	end of itself around schneiders wrist  the other end pulls hard 
	and yanks schneider off balance

	as he reaches with his free arm to unwrap his wrist the second 
	rope rockets off the desk top and secures itself to his other

	are on spewing water and steam

	we hear schneiders screams as he is dragged into the room 
	through great puddles of water and against the tiled wall opposite 
	jesse  the showers on this side are off

	the boy watches in horror as the ropes shoot up to two adjacent 
	shower nozzles and hoist the coach into a helpless spreadeagle 
	facing the wall  his clothes shear from his body like sheets of 
	tissue paper

	a stack of towels

	comes to life snapping in midair at schneiders butt and back  
	as they hit him they draw blood

	on jesse

	as the room fills with great clouds of steam until he is nearly 
	obscured just a dark human form in the corner of the shower room

	another angle on schneider

	as a figure in a green and red sweater and a battered fedora cuts 
	through the clouds cackling and throwing his weaponarm back like 
	a world series pitcher about to lob a fast ball

	schneider screams painfully as the knives cut four long tears in 
	him starting at the top of his naked back cutting through his 
	flesh

	the weapon arm strikes again  schneider screams goes limp

	blood begins to flow out of all the shower heads on schneiders

	jesse slumped in a nearby chair asleep

	grady switches off the tv with the remote

						grady
			sweet dreams buddy

	grady turns off the reading light by the bed  he gives a final 
	look at jesse before he pushes the whole thing out of his mind 
	with a disgusted wave of his arm and lays back down

	on jesse

	suddenly his eyes open widely

						jesse
			grady

	grady mumbles an obscenity and turns over on his side to face 
	jesse

						grady
			what
	
						jesse
			its happening again

	grady turns the reading light back on in time to see jesse double 
	over and curl up in obviously incredible pain falling to his 
	knees  he flails out as if 1000 volts were going through his body 
	and begins to choke on his tongue

	grady scrambles out of bed and dances around jesse not knowing 
	what to do

	on jesses hand

	as he raises it and his fingers spread widely apart

	four steel razorknives tear out from withing the tips of jesses 
	fingers like long bloody switchblades

	grady stands by helplessly as jesse writhes

	and then it is like some crazed beast in jesses gut tearing its 
	way out of his skin like someone stepping through a thick latex 
	film

	as his skin peels away thousands of capillaries pull apart 
	spraying blood everywhere in a fine almost powdery mist

	the transformation is almost complete when fred kruegers body 
	steps out of the red cloud  all that is left of jesse is his 
	screaming face plastered like a grisly ruber mask over freddys 
	own disfigured features

	grady backs away toward the door

	freddy cackles evilly as he cuts off gradys screams by grabbing 
	his throat with his unarmed hand  he pushes grady up against the 
	door and lifts him off the floor like he was hanging a picture

	we hear muffled calls from outside the door  the offcamera cries 
	of concerned parents

	the doorknob rattles

	as they try to get in the room to check on their son

	boom boom boom

	a fist hammering against the door behind gradys head  his 
	father trying to get in

						mr grady oc
			whats going on  open the door ronny

	freddy draws back his knifehand and prepares to plunge it into 
	gradys stomach like he was spearing a pot roast

	outside the door

	her hands over her mouth as mr grady grabs the know again and 
	bangs his fist repeatedly against teh door

	on freddy

	throwing force into his cutting arm  we cut before impact to

	outside the door

	we hear grady scream as the steel blades cut through his body and 
	poke out through the door like it was made of balsa  they wiggle 
	slightly to pull free and are retracted with an ungodly squeak

	mrs grady screams

						mr grady
			my god

	mr grady throws his shoulder with all his might against the door  
	a second excruciating scream inside and the knives cut through 
	the door inches from mr gradys head  when they pull out blood 
	is soaking through the knife holes  it looks as if the door 
	itself is bleeding

	on grady

	breathing his last few gasps

	on gradys parents

	they watch in stunned horror

	on grady

	he sinks slowly to the floor dead

	freddy watches as his victim slides into a heap on the floor  
	only we see now that it isnt freddy anymore but jesse again 
	panting exhaustedly and dripping gradys blood from just under his 
	elbow to the sharp points of the razortipped glove he wears on 
	his hand

	the door is budging open against gradys body  a little more with 
	each crash of mr gradys shoulder against the other side

	jesse is coming to  himself again and he views what he has done 
	to his best friend with terror crazed eyes

	is eye catches his own reflection in a full length mirror on the 
	wall  the image reflected is of freddy

						jesse
			no
					backing away from 
					 the body
			no  no  no
					screaming toward the
					 mirror
			you son of a bitch  you killed him

	mocking image however remains  the last sound we hear is a 
	demonic mix of jesses own screams and freddys cackling laugh

	she looks at the makeshift switches and tries to remember how 
	jesse

	she flicks the toggle and pushes the starter button  nothing

	she remembers the two wires under the dash and twists them 
	together  she pushes the starter button

	the starter groans  it doesnt seem like its going to start

						lisa
					frantically
			please work please

	the car backfires and starts  she puts it into gear and pulls

	as the old falcon tears down the highway

	int jesses car

	lisa is at the wheel squinting through the darkness trying to 
	hold the road

	ext abandoned powerhouse  night

	lisa pulls up to the building and shuts the engine off

	inside

	she hastily tears a strip of cloth from her shirt and ties it 
	around the wound on her leg  she gets out of the car

	she steps up to the front of the building

	her pov

	the entrance is ringed by a pair of mangy wild dogs with eerie 
	unnatural faces who growl threateningly as she approaches

	she shows no fear as she steps right up to the enterance  they 
	snap at her hands but she doesnt pull them out of the way  they 
	part allowing her to pass through

	int powerhouse  night

	lisa walks in cautiously  the powerhouse looks fare different 
	than it did in daylight  mysterious dangerous brewing almost 
	alive  steam is leaking from between rusty rivets and torn 
	gaskets and we hear the pounding of ancient expansion tanks 
	belching out rancid air

	the interior is bathed in an electric blue light that 
	intermittently washes pale as hot white arcs flash in distant 
	corners of the building

	she walks in deeper carelessly touching her fingers to a large 
	steam pipe and retracting her hand quickly from its blistering 
	sting

	she stops at the center of the room  suddenly a twinge of pain 
	on her face and she looks down at ehr leg

	now serious pain as she bends over and frenziedly pulls up on the 
	makeshift bandage

	on her wound

	it is swarming with big black carpenter ants

	she screams and brushes them away with her hands quaking with 
	disgust

	as abruptly as they appeared they are gone the bloodsoaked 
	bandage is intact covering the wound

	she bhacks away from teh sump and begins climbing the rusted metal 
	stairway up to the catwalk

	sound over  scraping metal

	she stops midway and looks around frightened

	a few seconds to regain her courage and she steps onto the 
	walkway

	a rat

	 the one she met before  scurries at her  it stops stares at 
	her evilly hisses unnaturally

	lisa screams

	suddenly a cat pounces on the rat

	the cat looks up at lisa with only the tail of the rat sticking 
	out of its mouth  its eyes are demonic its teeth crooked yellow 
	fangs  it growls like a beast five times its size  the cat takes 
	another chomp on the rat and the rats tail disappears down its 
	gullet

	another angle

	lisa jumps down off the sairway onto the catwalk and starts to 
	run  she clangs over the steelmesh flooring

	a section of the catwalk gives way beneath her feet and 

	lisa plummets as if she were dropped through a trap door  her 
	arms flail over her head but her hand manages to grab around a 
	section of handrail thats still solid

	another angle

	we see the catwalk is intact  it looks as if her knees just gave 
	out but she continues to hold on to the railing for dear life

	she tests the flooring by feeling it before attempting to rise ore 
	release her grip

	she rises and turns around

	freddy is there

	lisa screams

						freddy
			had your chance
					raising his talons
			die now

	he slashes at her  she ducks and runs back toward the stairway

	the stairway is red hot smoking

	freddy closes in

						freddy
			come to me lisa  im waiting for you

	lisa stops short looks around desperately  there is nowhere to 
	go

						lisa
			oh god jesse  i know youre there
			stop him

						freddy
			jesses dead lisa  freddys here

	freddy strikes cutting lisas shoulder

						lisa
					screams
			jesse

	freddy closes in on her  she is trapped finished

						freddy
					smiles perversely
			wanna join your little friend

						lisa
			wheres jesse

						freddy
			there is no jesse  im jesse now

						lisa
			i want him back  jesse talk to me
			jesse

	freddy raises his talons for the kill  the sharp oints are within 
	an inch of her eyes  lisa terrified summons up all her energy 
	all her might and looks freddy in the eye

						lisa
			i love you jesse

	freddy stares at ehr talons frozen in midair  the horrible hand 
	quivers as if against an unseen force  and then 

	the wounds on freddys shoulder and chest rip open

	he looks down at them surprised  they bleed real human blood

	longer angle

	lisa breaks past him and starts to run but stops suddenly a few 
	paces from freddy  she turns to look at him leaning weakly 
	against the railing with an expression of confusion on his face 
	that is almost pathetic  he touches his wounds surprised

	lisa is no longer afraid  shes angry now  she looks him 
	straight in the eye

	his razorknives click together like theyre running low on 
	batteries

	freddy beckons her over with the knife on his index finger

						freddy
					jesses voice	
			come and get me lisa

	freddy laughs wickedly

	lisa moves a step toward freddy

						lisa
			im not afraid of you  you couldnt
			kill mehes in there and i want
			him back  im gonna take him away
			from you and youre going straight 
			back to hell you sonofabitch

						freddy
					getting angry

	lisa moves closer to freddy

						lisa
			come back to me jesse

	she locks her gaze on freddys eyes and looks right through him

						lisa
			i love you jesse  come back to me

						freddy
			hes dead you bitch

	freddy seems to be in a good deal of pain  he drops to one knee  
	lisa moves closer  he tries to move away from her

						freddy
					threateningly
			ill kill you now

						lisa
					ignoring him
			he cant hold you jesse  hes losing
			his grip  you can get out

						freddy
			hell die with me

	she kneels beside freddy takes off his hat and begins to lovingly 
	stroke his head  he seems to be writhing a bit and emits several 
	frightened moans

						freddy
			hell die with both of us

	she gathers all her nerve and moves in closer

	he lifts his deadly hand and presses it into her chest  she 
	flinches in pain but continues to come in close until her mouth is 
	almost touching his

	he moves his blades onto her back trying to push them into her 
	flesh but he is too weak to do much damage

	tighter angle

	locked in this strange embrace she presses her lips against his 
	with as much passion as she can muster and kisses him

	longer angle  freddy  lisa

	there is a moment of quiet  then smoke starts to rise off of 
	freddy  he pushes her away with an excruciating scream

	the sound of the pounding machinery is becoming deafening  the 
	electric flashes are firing more rapidly and arcing across the 
	power plant  the room is rapidly heating up

	a small flame shoots along the railing

	small fires begin to break out on the catwalk around freddy

	angle painted surface

	the paint begins to smoke and bubble with the heat  as the heat 
	increases it into flame

	on pipes 

	steam begins shooting up from every pipe joint

	another angle  pipes

	steam shoots out of the valves  heavy iron valve wheels spin off 
	their stems and roll down the flaming catwalks

	on lisa

	surrounded by flames and smoke she watches it all with fear and 
	amazement

	close on freddy

	his flesh is starting to melt

	longer angle  freddy

	he bursts into dense allengulfing flame

	the power plant is going crazy  the steaming smoking and 
	flaming all reach their high peak  pipes are bursting with steam  
	valve wheels flying off

	andthen everything begins to slow down ease off

	the flames are dying down around the charred corpse and we can 
	see it is no longer moving

	the little fires around him are also dying down

	and the smoke the steam and the deafening noise abate

	on freddys corpse

	the fires are out now  there is only some smoke  and the 
	terrible heat has turned to cool blue light

	the still smoldering corpse with its back to us begins to stir

	longer angle catwalk

	lisa backs away terrified  the corpse turns to her  it is 
	jesse his clothes smoldering his body singed and blackened with 
	soot  but alive coming around as if it were all just a bad 
	dream

	lisa moves to him and cradles him in her arms

	about unpleasant things  jesse smiles again  shes right  he 
	kisses her

	jesse moves his head away from hers for the big kiss  lisas eyes 
	are closed ready to receive it
