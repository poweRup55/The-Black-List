               being negatives a lot more work

close on parsonage front door

swinging open reverend sullivan looming tall ichabod
crane in a collar

ext parsonage porch  wider  next evening

landon gives a cheery little wave hes very sweaty his
bike teeters on its kickstand in the bg

                         landon
               hey landon carter

landon offers his hand the reverend shakes reluctantly
eyeing him closely landons army boots torn jeans
dirty tshirt aloof manner

                         rev sullivan
                    surprised

                         landon

jamie slides out the door she looks good in jeans and a
white tshirt almost normal in the bg landons bike
crashes over he bounds down the porch steps

                         landon
                    explaining bike
               they took my license for 30 days
               but nobodys pressing charges

the reverend looks at jamie concerned landon tries the
kickstand then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed
bush not the best place

                         jamie
               ill get something for us to
               drink 

                         landon
               dont bother

but shes already gone the reverend gestures toward the
open front door

int sullivan living room  moments later

dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade landon
pokes around then stares at a photo of little girl jamie
with her parents he looks up aware that the reverend is
studying him closely

                         landon
               you know our planet would not
               suffer for one nanosecond if
               humans died off but if ants
               disappeared that would be
               catastrophic

the reverend waits letting landon suffer the silence

                         landon
                    confidence flagging
               apropos of nothing so so so
               so so

and jamie is there carrying glasses of lemonade all
cheerful

               deciding how to spend my time and
               my life

int hallway

jamie peers into her fathers room hes sleeping she
tiptoes to the staircase and down sneaking out

ext rear access road to cemetery  ten minutes later

landon is waiting when jamie appears he has scripts in
his back pocket they smile at each other laugh

                         jamie
                    re her father

she grins skeptical

                         jamie
               this way

another angle

jamie leads landon toward the cemetery rear gate

                         jamie

pause landons caught offguard by her frankness

                         landon
               yeah but that can be good

ext cemetery  rear gate  night

jamie quickly scales the fence landons right after her

                         landon
               why are we here

int cemetery

jamie drops down takes a flashlight from her bag

                         jamie
               cuz its dark and quiet and you
               can see into another world

                         landon
                    on top of gate
               the world of the dead

                         jamie
                    being mysterious
               could be

he drops down not sure what she means shes already
walking away he follows

                         jamie
               my mothers buried near here

                         landon

               my fathers alive but its like
               hes dead

she looks at landon feeling his sorrow then unlocks a
storage shed opens the door enters returns a moment
later carrying several pieces of an oddlooking homemade
cylindrical device

                         landon
               what is that

                         jamie
                    proud
               that is my telescope

same scene  minutes later

the teninch dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky
the eyepiece is at the end of the long scope the scope
rests on a plywood base landon looks through the eye
piece

pov through telescope  close on golden planet

a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad flat
ring system

widen

                         landon
                    impressed
               saturn beautiful

                         jamie
               before voyager we expected maybe a
               dozen rings 

                         landon
               but there are thousands of them
               made of floating ice 

                         jamie
               maybe debris from a moon that
               broke apart

                         landon
               or building blocks for a world
               that never formed

she looks at him he smiles embarrassed

                         landon
               im not smart just a sponge

she smiles disagreeing then looks through the telescope
and changes its view

                         jamie

               sometimes i come here and just
               scan the heavens

                         landon
                    joking
               looking for intelligent life

                         jamie
               looking for something  someone

pause he doesnt know what to say

                         landon
               do you believe youll see your
               mother again

                         jamie
               i hope so
                    beat
               i think maybe she sees me now

their eyes meet she looks away changes the subject

                         jamie
                    re telescope
               im building a larger one to see
               the nucleus of haleys comet 

                         landon
               the dirty snowball at its core

                         jamie
               yeah
                    beat

                         landon
               in 76 years me neither

each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars

                         jamie

               own

               her

                         jamie
               dont you

                         landon

               not really

pause

                         jamie
               when you do how do you

landon could joke or he could reveal something

                         landon
               like in a church painting i see
               this giant hovering over the
               ground hes wearing a robe and
               has long flowing hair and hes
               pointing his finger at something

                         jamie
               do you ever wonder why things
               happen the way they do

                         landon
               no

                         jamie
               i know theres a plan for
               everyone but sometimes i dont
               understand what the message is 
               or what the point is

                         landon
               there is no point you live you
               die the end

                         jamie

               maybe were not supposed to
               understand but were supposed to
               have faith that someone else sees
               the big picture

                         landon
               you have to believe to have faith

                         jamie
               you dont believe in anything

                         landon

               bunch of dumb stories about some
               ancient guy who supposedly worked
               miracles

                         jamie
               interpreted by another guy like my
               father

                         landon

                         jamie
               that sounds like horseshit

                         landon

               which part

                         jamie
               all of it

                         landon
               its not

                         jamie

                         jamie

               you lack honor you lack
               compassion you lack honesty
               you lack humanity

she heads to the old pontiac landon jogs after her

                         landon
               okay maybe some of that is
               true 

                         jamie
               you dont know the first thing
               about being someones friend 

                         landon
               i dont want to be just your
               friend

               you dont know what you want 

                         landon
               you dont either take a look at
               yourself maybe youre scared
               that someone might actually like
               you 

                         jamie
               and why would that scare me

                         landon
               because then you couldnt hide
               behind your books and your
               telescope and your sweater and
               your god

she gets into her car slams the door starts the
engine she recognizes the truth

                         landon

               certain theres a god

                         landon

they reach the end of the dock she turns to face the
wind it blows her hair she turns his face the same

               its like the wind i cant see
               it but i feel it

he closes his eyes feeling the wind opens them again
rejecting the idea

                         landon
               we can measure wind

                         jamie
               uncertainty makes you
               uncomfortable

               when youre feeling love youre
               feeling god
                    beat
               i think talking about these things
                threatens their very beauty and
               mystery

her tone is matteroffact but landons got a serious and
tender look on his face he touches her hair

                         jamie
                    almost a whisper
               i dont understand

                         landon
               maybe youre not supposed to

she looks down shy

                         jamie
               i might do it wrong

                         landon
                    tenderly
               not possible

he touches her neck her cheek her mouth then leans in
and kisses her a tender soft kiss he pulls away
they look at each other a moment

                         landon
               i love you jamie

there he put it out there risked looking and feeling
foolish not the old landon jamie looks away mixed
emotions happy and sad

                         landon

                    gently
               nows when you say something

                         jamie
                    overwhelmed
               i cant
                    beat
               i cant  explain

she turns back to him her eyes shining she touches his
face and they kiss again deeply

but after a few moments she drops her chin onto his
shoulder smiling glowing even but slightly aloof
staring at the water he pulls away slightly to study her
face he touches her cheek and brings her back from
wherever shes been

                         jamie
               you make me feel

                         landon

                         jamie
                    smiling

his thumbs attributing them to happiness

               this

               she talking to you bout this
               stuff

landon doesnt answer she puts the list on the table
smoothes it gently discouraging

                         cynthia
               honey some of this is
               farfetched you take after me
               people skills and common sense
               good dependable qualities

                         landon
               i could take after dad too

                         cynthia

               charming

               thats eight years of school and
               training  after college and
               all that doesnt necessarily make
               you a better human being

                         landon
               i could do it if i tried even
               kelly thinks so

                         cynthia
               thatd be something

she doesnt want to discourage him but she wants him to
be practical and realistic

                         cynthia
               but if it doesnt happen grab for
               something within reach lifes
               tough enough without causing
               yourself disappointment 

                         landon

               are silent i shall go down to the
               pit like the rest hear my voice
               raised in petition as i cry to you
               for help as i raise my hands my
               lord toward your holy of holies

                         rev sullivan
               she did but hardly anyone does
               anything truly alone

                         landon
                    serious

                         landon

she peers into the telescope eyepiece she pulls back
wipes her eyes then looks again she swings the
telescope into the correct position

streamers of gas dust and debris that form the comets
hazy head and long tail

back to scene

she steps back so he can see he looks quickly then
moves aside so she can keep looking shes completely
engrossed a long quiet moment then

                         landon

she leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him  yes

                         landon
               will you do something for me

                         jamie

                         jamie

               away my daughter but i can no

as words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged the
camera moves across the faces of those at the altar 
jamie landon dr carter

to the first row of the congregation  cynthia carter
josh eric clay

then back row by row as the reverend begins reading a
passage from the book jamies mother made for her his
voice soft and melodious like a poet reading his own
work

                         rev sullivan os
               love is always patient and kind
               it is never jealous love is
               never boastful or conceited it
               is never rude or selfish it does
               not take offense and is not
               resentful love takes no pleasure
               in other peoples sins but
               delights in the truth it is
               always ready to excuse to trust
               to hope and to endure whatever
               comes

and the camera moves out the double doors to find

parchment thin

the two men embrace stiff uncomfortable uncertain

               she taught me  everything she
               saved my life

landon stops faces the wind lets the air swirl over
him

                         adult landon vo
                and in the mystery of all
               things you cant see but feel
