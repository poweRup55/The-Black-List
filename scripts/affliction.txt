                         i think your first response to the 
                         twombley shooting was the correct 
                         one

                                     wade
                         which is

                                     rolfe
                         that it wasnt an accident

                                     wade
                         then who shot him

                                     rolfe
                         well your friend i think jack 
                         hewitt

                         money

                                     wade
                         whod pay him that kind of money 
                         not the mob they got their own guys 
                         specialists

                                     rolfe
                              agreeing
                         they wouldnt deal with a guy like 
                         jack who else benefits if twombley 
                         is suddenly dead

                                     wade
                              swigs
                         i dont know you tell me

                                     rolfe
                         okay its likely there are people 
                         in the union who dont want twombley 
                         to testify they probably include 
                         his soninlaw whos vicepresident 
                         and will probably be the next 
                         president i read that in the papers 
                         whats his name mel gordon

                                     wade
                         yeah the guy with the bmw i told 
                         you about i did didnt i

                                     rolfe
                         heres my theory twombley unaware 
                         of illegal union loans or whatever 
                         starts nosing around cause of the 
                         investigation and finds out finds 
                         out his soninlaw is involved

                                     wade
                         so mel gordon wouldnt want a 
                         professional hit thatd make the 
                         feds dig deeper he wants an accident

                                     rolfe
                         a hunting accident is perfect

                                     wade
                         shit around here you shoot somebody 
                         in the woods you say it was an 
                         accident you get fined fifty bucks 
                         and your hunting license lifted 
                         jacks probably saying the guy shot 
                         himself cause he aint got his deer 
                         yet and dont want his license pulled

               the truck sputters stops wade pulls the keys

                         neat it makes me mad that somebody

               ground he gathers up his rifles

               suddenly a whiskey bottle slams against the back of his 
               head he drops to his knees the guns scatter he looks up 
               with childs fear and guilt at his father

               glen whitehouse hovers over him huge and ferocious a 
               colossus lifting the bottle like a jawbone

               wade cringes scrambles for the dropped rifle he grabs it 
               by the barrel and twisting around swings it in a slow motion 
               arc smashing the edge of the wood stock against his fathers 
               head a cold hard crack of bone

               glen whitehouse  shriveled again no longer mythic  flies 
               back like a stuffed dummy he collapses beside the empty 
               cc bottle

               wade bleeding from the head stands staggers off pops 
               inert body aims his rifle at the old mans face

               he kneels down lovingly touches the old mans face caresses 
               his lips cheeks nose brows smoothes back his stiff gray 
               hair

               pops eyes are clouded blood suddenly drips from his ear to 
               the ground

               wade rests the rifle against the truck he bends over slips 
               his hands under his fathers body lifts him up he carries 
               pop over to the workbench lays him out

               groping beneath the bench wade finds the kerosene lamp he 
               unscrews it pours kerosene the length of pops body

               wade takes out his cigarette lighter ignites it holds it 
               for a moment places it to glen whitehouse

               fire spreads the length of pops body bursting like a shroud 
               of yellow flame the oilstained bench crackles flames shoot 
               up the old weathered wall

               burning flesh and heat drive wade backwards
