               fade in

               int c130 hercules turboprop  night

               eighteen combatready special forces wearing assault black 
               jump packs and combat gear stare down the deep end of a 
               greasy ramp into the night sky  village lights flicker 19000 
               feet below

               the strike force leader signals to his team

               without a moments hesitation they dive into the darkness 
               and plummet toward earth

               ext mansion  night

               a military guard old sovietstyle uniform rounds the corner 
               of the large estate toting an ak47

               a red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and after a 
               beat the red dot seems to bleed  the guard collapses dead  
               two other guards are dispatched with single silenced shots

               a strike team member at a junction box awaits a signal

               through infrared binoculars the strike force leader watches 
               his assault troops as they take positions

                                     strike force leader
                              into headsetin

                         go

               on the estate  as the power goes out  the team on the 
               mansions front porch pops the door and pours in

               int mansion  night

               following  the five team members as they rush a stairway in 
               phalanx formation  they nearly knock over an old lady who 
               in turn lets out a blood curdling scream

               upstairs corridor 

               the team kicks open a door  rushes into the room

               int bedroom 

               assault weapons pointed at the bed  the soldiers yank back 
               bedsheets to reveal ivan stravanavitch a middleaged man 
               and his halfnaked 18yearold concubine

                                     soldier
                              in russian
                         get up now  up

               the soldiers pull stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out 
               of the room

               following   as they push down the hallway

               mansion security guards rally with haphazard gunfire

               out come the strike forces flashbang grenades  exploding 
               everywhere disorienting stravanavitchs men

               ext field  night

               signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position  
               the strike team evacuates across the field and forces a 
               struggling stravanavitch into the lowhovering copter

               the commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of 
               stravanavitchs guards break into the clearing  they open 
               fire

               and the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return

               one of the strike team members takes a bullet to the neck  
               hes pulled by his comrades into the chopper as it lifts 
               into the sky its guns spitting lead

                         the sounds of a dinner banquet  
                         forks clanking against plates and 
                         the din of a hundred conversations 
                         broken by

               the ding ding ding of a spoon tapping against a wine glass

               super title   moscow  three weeks later

                         despite strong international 
                         criticism

               at the front table 

               a translators words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man 
               in his midforties  worry lines crease his forehead and the 
               touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult 
               years in office

               this man is james marshall and he is the president of the 
               united states of america  he busily makes last minute changes 
               to his speech

                         states of america

               mr president

               thunderous applause as marshall rises and approaches the 
               podium

               at the back of the room doherty a senior policy adviser 
               whispers to the presidents chief of staff ed shepherd

                                     doherty
                         maybe we should consider running him 
                         for reelection instead of the us

               the applause dies as marshall begins to speak

                                     marshall
                              in russian with 
                              subtitles
                         good evening and thank you  first i 
                         would ask you to join me in a moment 
                         of silence for the victims of the 
                         turkmenistan massacres

               the room remains silent a few beats  most guests respectfully 
               bow their heads

               marshall begins again but this time in english  the young 
               woman translates simultaneously for the russian audience

                                     marshall
                         as you know three weeks ago american 
                         special forces in cooperation with 
                         the russian republican army secured 
                         the arrest of turkmenistans self
                         proclaimed dictator general ivan 
                         stravanavitch whose brutal sadistic 
                         reign had given new meaning to the 
                         word horror  i am proud to say our 
                         operation was a success

               applause from the audience  marshall turns the page on his 
               speech

                                     marshall
                         and now yesterdays biggest threat 
                         to world peace today awaits trial 
                         for crimes against humanity

               during the applause marshall pulls a page from the speech 
               folds it and slides it into his pocket  he removes his 
               glasses and looks out into the crowd  his tone becomes more 
               personal

               hes not reciting the speech anymore

                                     marshall
                         what we did here was important  we 
                         finally pulled our heads out of the 
                         sand we finally stood up to the 
                         brutality and said weve had enough  
                         every time we ignore these atrocities 
                         the rapes the death squads the 
                         genocides every time we negotiate 
                         with these these thugs to keep them 
                         out of gig country and away from gig 
                         families every time we do thise 
                         we legitimize terror

               terror is not a legitimate system of government  and to 
               those who commit the atrocities i say we will no longer 
               tolerate we will no longer negotiate and we will no longer 
               be afraid  its your turn to be afraid

               shepherd exits as marshall settles into his leather chair 
               and dives into work  he punches a button on the speakerphone

               swallow her  jory a steward passes

                         back at the fishbowl

               alice eyes the swirl of aides who are pretending to work 
               nearby

               but its obvious that theyre eavesdropping  alice smiles 
               and waves at them dramatically

                                     rose

                         as you  for most girls seeing the 
                         bolshoi ballet would be the experience 
                         of a lifetime

                                     alice

                         it was great really

               rose nods smiling a halfsmile  after a thoughtful beat 
               alice gets up and crosses to the presidential suite  she 
               exchanges words with the aide standing outside the door and 
               comes back covering her disappointment

                                     alice
                         hes in a meeting  he cant be

               joey the steward hands her her cocoa with a wink and a smile

               her eyes light up at the mound of whip cream on top

                                     alice
                         when i write my memoirs i think ill 
                         devote an entire chapter to the cocoa

                                     rose
                         your father never means to be so

                         breaks out in bangladesh  i mean it 
                         doesnt take a genius to figure which 
                         is more important

                                     rose
                         some kids were teasing you

                         thats not really the point

               a quiet pause then

                                     rose
                         youre right and ill tell you a

                         to newsweek

               the plane jolts forward as it begins to taxi

                         daddy

               alice points  and as if on cue marshall exits from his 
               office and checks his watch

                                     alice
                         oooooh im good

               alice nods

                                     alice
                              theatrically
                         it was the experience of a lifetime

                                     marshall

               alice rises and hugs her father  a white house photographer 
               snaps off a few shots for the papers  alice makes a face at 
               them  a second later shepherd comes up the corridor 
               breaking up the pair

                                     shepherd

                         sure

               as marshall moves toward the conference room he bends and 
               gives rose a quick peck on the cheek  it all reeks of 
               formality

                                     rose
                         may i speak to you for a moment

               rose shuts the door behind them  as she starts to speak 
               marshall pulls her into a long passionate kiss  rose pulls 
               away

                                     rose

               int corridor  night

               the terrorists move toward the nose of the plane leaving 
               nevsky to guard the conference room

               int baggage hold  night

               president marshall reaches the front stairway cautiously 
               climbs to the main cabin as he reaches the top stairs he 
               hears russian conversation approaching he ducks back into 
               the stairwell

               he cant see them but he can hear them

               the terrorists pass within a few feet as they ascend to the 
               mission communications center on the upper deck

               marshall waits a few beats listens to the silence then re
               mounts the stairs and almost runs into the back of

                                     viad
                         standing guard facing the opposite 
                         direction

               marshall freezes looks past viad down the corridor where 
               nevsky guards the main conference room floor

               unaware of marshall viad reaches into his pocket and pulls 
               out a cigarette lights it on the first puff he feels a 
               presence behind him

               vlad slowly turns around

               nothing there

               he smiles at his jittery nerves turns back round

               reverse angle 

               over vlads shoulder

               marshall flattened behind the edge of the galley divider 
               he creeps away from vlad toward the presidential suite  
               stepping gingerly over dead secret service agents

                         holding the president hostage is not 
                         something that slips your mind when

                         and if hes dead do you really think 
                         theyd risk telling us

                                     dean
                         there is a possibility were 
                         overlooking

               all eyes turn to dean

                                     dean
                         when i ran specops in nam i ordered 
                         the destruction of a vc  munitions 
                         dump during insertion the plane 
                         was shot down and the entire team 
                         was killed or so we thought two 
                         days later the dump

               blew and a week after that this 19

               yearold kid the pilot he walks out of the jungle in 
               pretty bad shape he survived the crash and finished the 
               mission alone

                                     general northwood

                                     dean
                         that kids name was jim marshall

               most of the presidents service record makes for dull reading 
               because most of what he did iarlz ulirn   history remembers 
               him for what he did aflar he got back to the states  the 
               protests the rallies  but he was a soldier once a damn 
               fine one

                                     dean
                         maybe hes alive on that plane and 
                         those bastards dont even know it

                                     vp chandler
                         mr dean may i remind you that the 
                         president is not 19 anymore

               int presidents stateroom  night

               marshall cautiously enters the room ready for action

               the room is empty but its been trashed by the firefight

               the sound of voices coming from the duke game which still 
               plays marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones

               its dead he tries the regular phone dead hangs it up in 
               disgust

                                     marshall
                         goddamnit

               he steps on some glass its a broken frame holding a 
               photograph of alice and rose he picks up the photo and lays 
               it on a table

               he thinks for a beat glances around the room searching

               then he crosses to the closet opens it and begins rifling 
               through his wardrobe

               int main conference room

               caldwell stands on the conference table the hostages have 
               removed one of the ceiling panels air supply ducts and 
               bundles of wiring run through the teninch space between the 
               ceiling and the shielding plates

                                     major caldwell
                         this is a dead end

               rose looks around the room hopeless her eyes land on the 
               carpet

               int corridor

               marshall opens the stateroom door and slowly slides into the 
               corridor

               vlad still faces the opposite direction

               marshall creeps down the hallway when

               beep beep beep

               marshalls watch alarm goes off

               marshall dives for the nearest doorway vlad swings round to 
               see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin

               vlad unsure of what he saw cautiously heads toward the 
               staff cabin as he nears he bends over a dead secret service 
               agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening 
               watch it wasnt marshalls after all no matter vlad 
               continues to the staff cabin

               int staff cabin  night

               marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a 
               weapon in the room some video monitors leather chairs and 
               phones stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of 
               the walls

               marshall throws the cabinet doors open revealing

               a fully stocked medical center folddown operating

               table highintensity lights equipped to deal with any 
               medical emergency the president might encounter

               but too late vlad kicks the door open

                                     vlad
                         get on the floor now

               marshall yanks down the operating table and it smashes into 
               vlad knocking him down marshall lunges with his knife but 
               vlad opens fire a half dozen rounds pump into marshalls 
               belly hes thrown back against the wall then slumps to the 
               floor

               vlad approaches the crumpled body leans down to examine his 
               victim he cups his hand under the mans chin and lifts his 
               head recognizes him

                                     viad
                              wonderment
                         the president

               but marshalls eyes flash open

                                     marshall
                         thats right asshole

               he springs shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket 
               and into vlads spleen vlad freezes unsure of what just 
               happened

               marshall is on his feet never letting go of the twisting 
               knife he grabs vlad by the back of the head and slams his 
               face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink the 
               mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorists 
               face the blood drips down into the white porcelain sink 
               swirling into the drain

               vlad elbows marshall in the neck stunning him momentarily

               he wipes the blood from his face spins and hits marshall 
               with a devastating right cross marshall reels back against 
               the wall and vlad follows shoving the mp5 into marshalls 
               throat marshall grabs the gun near the trigger

                                              vlad

               dont move or ill blow your head off

                                     marshall
                         i dont think so

               marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his 
               forefinger then knees vlad in the balls viad pulls the 
               trigger repeatedly as he goes down but nothing happens

               instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against marshalls 
               face like a bat hitting a baseball it knocks marshall into 
               the medical closet the gun goes flying skittering

               underneath a cabinet

               marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his 
               legs from buckling vlad grabs some iv tubing and wraps it 
               around marshalls neck marshall struggles for breath clawing 
               at the tube

               he spots a defibrillator reaches and switches it on low

               pitched hum and beeping

               marshall pulls his head forward straining against the plastic 
               tubing then slams back into vlads head viad releases his 
               grip just for a moment

               the beeping becomes a steady whine

                but a moment is all marshall needs as he grabs the def 
               ibs cardiac paddles turns and slams them on either side 
               of vlads head

               vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds his 
               eyeballs roll his hair stands on end  then he collapses to 
               the floor

                                     marshall
                         clear

               marshall catches his breath for a moment pulls open his 
               shirt beneath it he wears a bulletproof kevlar vest he 
               lifts the vest and a halfdozen angry welts have blossomed 
               across his skin the stuff may be bulletproof but each of 
               vlads shots sting like a motherfucker

               no time for remorse marshall tries the main conference room 
               door locked he knows the others will be coming so he 
               flattens himself against the corridor wall trains his gun 
               on the stairs

               just as the terrorists descend marshall squeezes off a few 
               rounds the terrorists edge back up the steps returning 
               fire

               marshall checks his clip not many bullets left he fires 
               off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the 
               corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some 
               gauze

               the terrorists seize the moment of quiet descending the 
               stairs to take position

               marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made molatov

               cocktail and throws it down the corridor the bottle crashes 
               into a ball of flame catching bazylev on fire he yells 
               drops and rolls fire suppressing foam immediately sprays 
               down from overhead

               serge hops bazylevs burning body and heads down the corridor 
               looking for this new wildcard korshunov grabs a fire 
               extinguisher from the galley and attends to bazylev

               int corridor toward the rear of air force one

               marshall retreats behind a divider sees serge coming fires 
               a few rounds then retreats to the next divider working 
               toward the rear of the plane

               serge picks his way through the rear cabins advancing 
               cautiously

               int rear galleybathrooms

               marshalls out of plane nowhere to hide in the galley

               marshall eyes the bathrooms doors flapping

               following serge

               as he reaches the rear galley and bathrooms marshall is 
               nowhere to be seen but the bathroom doors are all closed

                                     serge

                         okay have it your way

               time for a deadly version of the shell game serge fires 
               several rounds into the first closed bathroom door the 
               bullets slice easily through the thin doors he kicks the 
               riddled door open the stall is empty

               serge moves to the next one same procedure its empty

               moves to the last bathroom confident hes got him he wails 
               with his mp5 turning the hatch into swiss cheese waits a 
               beat then

               kicks it in its empty too

               serge reluctantly returns to his group

               int lower galley baggage level 

               marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter 
               breathing heavy he slumps against the bulkhead and slides

               down to the ground

               he takes a moment to pull himself together to clear his 
               head he hefts the mp5 refamiliarizing himself with the 
               weight and texture of a gun he checks the clip only a 
               handfull of rounds left he slaps it back in and switches 
               from automatic fire to singleshot then pantomimes firing

               int front baggage hold

               marshall frozen near the bottom of the steps to go up would 
               be to betray everything he believes in and lose any chance 
               to save the others but if he stays

                                     korshunov

               int front baggage hold

               for marshall this is the hardest decision of his life his 
               face a mask of anguish as he wrestles with his conscience

                                     korshunov
                         eight

                         nine

               int front baggage hold

               it takes every bit of training and will to stop marshall 
               from going up those stairs he knows whats going to happen 
               he closes his eyes tight as if that will stop it from 
               happening

                                     korshunov

               int main conference room

               hostages hold each other tight for comfort a mournful silence 
               fills the room

               int front baggage hold

               marshall silhouetted in the half light craddles his head 
               head in his hands the shaft of light disappears as the main 
               cabin hatch closes sealing him off once again

               here because if you get the wrong ones youll cut the engine 
               feeds and stall the plane

                                     marshall

               marshaiji hello hello

               nothing he tosses the dead phone aside

               marshall stares cross the green wires with the what

               red white blue or the yellow his choice is obvious he 
               cuts the yellow wire and crosses it with the green leaving 
               the red white and blue standing

               he waits the engines continue to groan he allows himself a

               beneath the plane a trickle of gasoline appears and grows 
               into a strong steady stream

               int flight deck  night

               a red warning light flashes on the planes panel

                         go take serge and watch your backs

               zedeck nods and dashes out of the cabin

               int main cabin

               zedeck pulls open the hatch cover to the forward front stairs 
               descends into the dimly lit underneath

               serge descends right behind zedeck

               int forward baggage compartment  night

               zedeck spooked by the dark shadows senses hes being 
               watched

                         hes down here i can feel it

                         shut up and do your job

               zedeck hastens toward the avionics compartment gun at the 
               ready serge sweeps the area behind

               they hear a metallic clank echo and reverberate around him

               they both check left right behind them

               nothing

               its creepy being a walking target

               from behind a water storage tank marshall watches down the 
               barrel of his mp5 with all the equipment in the way its 
               almost impossible to line up a clear shot

               and theyre both well armed he looks toward the stairway 
               instead

               zedeck enters the avionics compartment serge takes a 
               defensive position outside the door

                         knew what he was doing

               serge hears a noise and opens tire

                         erring on the side of caution

               int avionics compartment 

               zedeck opens a panel and rips out some wiring

               int bedroom  night

               a sleepless petrov paces back and forth smoking a cigarette

               the phone rings he looks up expectantly as his aide answers

                                     aide
                         sir the president of the united 
                         states wishes to speak with you

               petrov stops in midpace considers his cigarette for a moment 
               and then walks over to the phone

                                     petrov

               int prison cell  night

               a guard walks down the cold steel hallway he rattles the 
               bar of a darkened cage he pulls out a set of keys and unlocks 
               the door

                                     guard
                         stravanavitch

               stravanavitch awakes and leans forward into the light he 
               and the guard trade looks after a beat the guard turns and 
               retreats down the the hallway

               stravanavitch rises from his bunk and approaches the cell 
               door he leans against it and it swings open

               int mcc  night

               rose stares at marshall her look is hard to read distant  
               cold perhaps

                                     rose
                         can my husband sit next to me

               korshunov considers the pair hands taped behind their back

               theyre harmless korshunov nods

               marshall rises and joins her on the pilots rest bunk

                                     rose
                         i dont know why you stayed

                         please dont start with me

               rose moves closer to him and speaks in a low voice

                                     rose
                         theres something i need to tell 
                         you and god knows if ill ever 
                         get another chance

               from behind we see her push his taped hands away

               he looks at her quizically

                                     rose
                         no matter what happens you have 
                         been and always will be my hero

               he feels the wall behind him a dull edge of metal twisted 
               slightly from the earlier cockpit door explosion

               he understands

                                     marshall
                         and you have always been my guardian 
                         angel

               she smiles back at him

                                     rose
                         i will never regret my life with 
                         you

               behind marshalls back he begins to cut away at the duct 
               tape

               int moscow central prison hallway  night

               ivan stravanavitch walks down the long prison hallway other 
               prisoners see him and begin banging on their bars in rhythm

               as he parades down the corridor the banging grows until it 
               becomes deafening stravanavitch smiles a cocky smile

               one by one guard doors swing open in front of him in fact 
               a few of the hacks salute stravanavitch as he passes

               int mission communication center  air force one

               the communication board beeps and zedeck picks up the line

               he exchanges some words with the caller in russian then 
               hangs up the phone

                                     serge
                         its confirmed stravanavitch is on 
                         his way out our men are waiting 
                         outside

               korshunov smiles and puts his hand on zedecks shoulder

                                     rose
                         you got what you wanted you going 
                         to release us now

                                     korshunov
                         youre very valuable and our nation 
                         needs so many things

               marshall leans his head against the wall just as he expected

                                     marshall
                         could i could i have some water

               korshunov nods motions zedeck to take care of it zedeck 
               reluctanty descends to the main cabin

                                     korshunov
                         the taste of defeat is bitter no

                                     marshall
                         one thing ive learned as

               president all defeats are temporary and all victories are 
               temporary today 5 conquerers are tomorrows vanquished

                                     korshunov
                         e                    very poetic

               zedeck arrives with a glass of water

                                     marshall
                         and theres one thing ive learned 
                         from being a sports fan

               zedeck brings the cup of water to marshalls lips marshall 
               tips his head back to receive it

                                     korshunov
                         and that is

               water spills over marshalls face he shakes it off

                                     marshall
                         it aint over til its over

               with blinding speed marshall leaps to his feet and swings 
               his arm around zedecks throat he snaps zedecks neck with 
               quiet efficency

               gibbs fires at marshall but marshall using zedeck as a 
               shield grabs hold of the terroristsmp5 and lets loose  
               mowing down the former secret service agent

               the rest of gibbs shots pelt against the cockpit controls 
               sending showers of sparks flying

               korshunov whips out his gun and lines up a clean shot at 
               marshalls head

                                     major caldwell
                         mr president

               korshunov fires at marshall but

               major caidwell dives in front of the bullet spray taking the 
               rounds in his chest

               marshall turns his aim to korshunov but korshunov grabs 
               alice and presses his pistol to her head

               standoff

                                     korshunov
                         dont be hasty

               marshall holds korshunov in his sights slowly advancing

                                     korshunov
                         you love your daughter mr

               president and i love my country

               its a fair trade

               korshunov backs away to the steps marshall does not lower 
               his gun korshunov disappears down the staircase

               marshall slowly descends the steps to the main cabin as 
               soon as shepherd gets her hands loose rose rushes to

               when the men sees stravanavitch they come to attention and 
               salute him stravanavitch returns the salute and then starts 
               his march toward his limousine

               marshall holds the yoke in one hand and unclips the snatch

               the last red light on the engine control panel starts to

               the clasp starts to bend

               in slow motion

               on the end clasp he hangs on for dear life
