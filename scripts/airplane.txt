         dont worry about that its perfectly
         normal you must watch your airspeed
         closely dont let it fall below 520 both
         your rudder pedals and elevator trim will
         have additional play due to increased
         drag but you can compensate by lowering
         manifold pressure below 154 now theres
         one other thing have you someone up there
         who can work the radio and leave you free
         for flying

                        striker
         yes the stewardess is here with me

elaine rises the autopilot is on her back its hands
clinging to her breasts she removes it and seats it at
