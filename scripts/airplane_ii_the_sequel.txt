jammed with two hundred wheelchairs bumping into each other
patients falling out total wheelchair chaos

ted walks down the aisle checking overhead panels  he spots
a panel that is half open  a sign on the door reads
danger  vacuum  ted opens it and a hoover falls out on
his head cutting him  he holds a hanky to the wound and
passes by stellas seat

                        stella
         youve been hurt

                        ted
         im getting over it  if a relationship
         isnt working you cant force it

                        stella
         no i mean your head  sit down  ill
         take a look at it  im a nurse

ted sits down and stella starts patching him up

                        stella
         do you want to talk about it

                        ted
         i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner
         hit me

                        stella
         no  i mean your relationship

                        ted
         we were in love but im not sure i know
         what love is anymore

                        stella
         loves the same as it always was  its
         people who change

                        ted
         people change in relation to each other
         love changes on its own

                        stella
         not if the people change together in
         relation to that love

                        ted
         sure  but thats only when the love
         itself goes unchanged

                        stella
         then the relationship remains the same and
         the love changes only when theres change
         in the two people who share that love

                        ted
         i just wish it was that simple  we really
         were in love  you know how it is when you
         laugh all the time

joe bolts  passengers panic  ted tackles him  the case
flies into the air in slow motion  it turns slowly hanging
for the longest time as we cut still in slow motion to
horrified faces watching it  this slow motion sequence
lasts for about 60 seconds  people put on makeup do
macrame read etc  while the case is still in the air
suddenly scraps leaps high into the air in slow motion and
comes down with the case between his teeth

alpha beta neon sign is visible


int alpha beta communications room

kramer sits in a large swivel chair  like captain kirks
on the enterprise bridge  as he talks he nonchalantly
swivels so his back is to the huge window  we see the
mayflower approaching on the screen

                        kramer
              on radio
         now striker there are a few things you
         have to keep in mind as you get close to
         the planets atmosphere

they watch in horror as the mayflower comes shooting at
them

                        kramer
              on radio
         first and foremost you have to make one
         very important decision

it  kramer still has his back to the screen and doesnt
notice what has happened  the room behind him has been
totally demolished

                        kramer
              on radio

plays the series of notes from close encounters  suddenly
the mayflower appears over a hill  they all jump for cover
as it crashes through the synthesizer
