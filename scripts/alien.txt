        vacant
        two space helmets resting on chairs
        electrical hum
        lights on the helmets begin to signal one another
        moments of silence
        a yellow light goes on
        data mind bank in bg
        electronic hum
        a green light goes on in front of one helmet
        electronic pulsing sounds
        a red light goes on in front of other helmet
        an electronic conversation ensues
        reaches a crescendo
        then silence
        the lights go off save the yellow

        the lid on a freezer pops open
        slowly groggily kane sits up
        pale
        kane rubs the sleep from his eyes
        stands
        looks around
        stretches
        looks at the other freezer compartments
        scratches
        moves off

        int galley

        kane plugs in a silex
        lights a cigarette
        coughs
        grinds some coffee beans
        runs some water through

        parker looks at her
        snaps on the laser weld
        starts to join another section of the duct

        all wear gloves boots jackets
        carry laser pistols
        kane touches a button
        servo whine
        then the inner door slides quietly shut
        the trio pull on their helmets

                                 dallas

        ash descends companionway to blister
        punches up screens and instrumentation

        int main air lock  dawn

                                 dallas
                  open the hatch

        another servo whine
        ponderously the outer lock hatch slides open
        clouds of dust and steam swirl before the three crew members
        a mobile gangway slides out the open hatch
        burnt orange sunlight beyond

        ext planet  dawn

        the trio walk down the gangplank
        arrive at surface level
        their feet striking onto a thick layer of lava rock
        the wind at gale force

                                 dallas
                  which way

        lambert walks into the storm
        followed closely by the others

        ash leaning over his console
        watches them beneath him
        corresponding images on the screen in front of him

                  keep the line open

        ext planet  dawn

        the three crew members push their way along
        like divers at the bottom of a dark sea
        the wind and dust continues driving down in dark sheets
        lambert repeats

                                 lambert
                  cant see more than three meters
                  in any direction

        they wade on following lambert
        she halts abruptly
        confused

        ash watches intently
        images on each screen of the trio

                  starting to get some fade on the
                  beam

        ext planet  dawn

        the trio moves through a dark limbo

                                 lambert
                  this way

        lambert indicates left
        moves in that direction
        the others follow
        the storm growing

                                 kane
                  its close

        they approach a towering rock formation
        the transmission stops

                                 lambert
                  its gone again

                                 kane

                                 dallas
                  not unless its underground
                  lets take a break

        they shelter with the rock formation
        storm howls round them
        dallas adjusts headset
        the signal starts

                                 dallas
                  ive got it again  lets go

                                 lambert

                  no lets move on while weve
                  got the signal again

        dallas gets up

        they stand for a moment

        then move away from the rock formation
        fossilized into the other side of the rock is a shape
        fifteen feet tall
        unseen by the members of the party

        int blister  dawn

        ash receiving the video transmission
        notices something within the formation
        freezes the image
        enlarges it
        enlarges again

        ext the nostromo  sunrise

        atmosphere turning the color of blood
        then the sun is up

        ext the nostromo  sunrise

        brett and parker still at work

        ash still working on the video image
        enhances the enlargement
        transfers the image to cathode ray
        the image reveals itself to be a giant form  indistinct

        ripleys voice comes over

                         voice over

        hits the intercom

        dust clearing
        three tiny figures against the landscape

        ext planet  day

        empty landscape
        then kane comes up over a rise startled by what he sees
        suddenly the transmission is deafening

        clearly of nonhuman manufacture

        dallas shuts off his receiver
        sudden quiet
        a long moment

                                 dallas
                  it looks pretty dead from here
                  well approach the base

        they move toward the ship

        int blister  day

        ash still adjusting image of form in rock
        it suddenly resolves
        a skeleton  fifteen feet long
        he enlarges the image

                  looks like an entrance

                                 dallas
                  yeah lets move inside

        they climb up to one of the apertures and enter

        int chamber  day

        they move into a highceilinged chamber
        walls covered with shadowy lattices
        ghostly light filters dustfilled air
        a few meters in an opening appears
        dallas leans over and looks into the hole
        only blackness
        he unclips the light from his belt
        shines it down into the hole

                                 dallas
                  it just goes down smooth walls
                  i cant see the bottom light
                  wont reach

        kane and lambert come over
        dallas begins unclipping gear from his belt

                                 dallas
                  lets take a look around here
                  first

        kane and lambert exchange a glance
        dallas shines his light about sees
        a large glossy urn tan coloration
        round opening at the rop empty within
        then dallas shines his light on nearby lattice
        moves closer

                                 dallas
                  over here

        they approach
        train their lights along the floor
        a machine
        on the mechanism a small bar moves steadily back
        and forth
        sliding noiselessly in the grooves

                                 kane
                  still functioning

        lambert looks down at her direction finder

                                 lambert
                  automatic recording

        dallas snaps it off

                                 dallas
                  now for a look down below
                         looks at kane
                  this is your big chance

                                 kane
                  okay

                                 dallas

                  cable  be out in less than ten
                  minutes  read me

                                 kane
                  aye aye

        dallas rigs a tripod over the opening in the floor
        unspools a couple of feet of wire
        kane attaches the end of it to his chest unit
        climbs over the lip and drops it into the hole
        now hanging by the wire
        head and shoulders out of the opening
        kane activates the climbing unit
        lowers himself into the fissure

        int structure opening

        kane braces his feet against the wall of the vertical shaft
        switches on his light points it into the depths
        the beam penetrates only thirty feet or so then is lost in
        darkness

                                 kane
                  hotter in here  warm air rising
                  from below

        he starts down playing out the line
        descending in short leaps
        stops to catch his breath
        breathing rasping loudly in his helmet
        a little sunlight filters from above
        looking up kane can see the mouth of the hole
        a glowing spot of light

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  you okay in there

                                 kane
                  havent hit bottom yet
                  this is work  cant talk now

        he kicks off and continues down
        taking longer and longer hops as he gains confidence
        pausing for a moment to regain his breath he shines the
        light on his instruments

                                 kane
                  im below ground level

        int bridge

        ripley at her console still working on transmission
        gets a readout

                  that the noise is some kind of

                                 ash
                         voice over

                  lost contact  the transmission
                  around the ship is killing all
                  communications

        pause

                  im going out after them

                                 ash
                         voice over

                  spare the personnel  weve
                  got minimum takeoff capability
                  right now  thats why dallas
                  left us on board

                                 ripley
                  i still think we should go after
                  them

                                 ash
                         voice over
                  whats the point  in the time
                  it take to get there  theyll
                  know if its a warning

        ripley looks steadily at ash on her monitor
        his screen not visible to her shows blowup of helmeted
        skeletal head  not human

        int structure

        kane resumes his downward climb
        suddenly his feet lose their purchase as the walls of the
        shaft disappear
        the tunnel has reached its end
        below him is a dark cavernous space
        deep breaths due to his violent exertion

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  see anything

                                 kane
                  notunnels gone  cave or
                  something below me  feels like
                  the goddamn tropics in here

        he consults his instruments
        helmet instrumentation strobing softly in the darkness

                                 kane
                  high nitrogen content no
                  oxygen

        still puffing he releases his purchase on the stone walls
        begins to lower himself on power
        now kane is dangling free in darkness
        spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds
        then his feet hit bottom
        kane grunts in surprise almost loses his balance
        he flashes his suit lights
        the beams reveal that he is in a large hold
        row after row of extrusions stretch from floor to ceiling

                                 kane
                  this is weird

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  what do you mean

                                 kane
                  theres something all over the
                  walls

        kane walks across the chamber
        examines the organic protrusions

        int chamber above

        dallas and lambert

                                 dallas
                  how long till sunset

                                 lambert
                  twenty minutes

        a look from lambert

        int hold

        kane approaches the center of the room
        on the floor are rows of leathery ovoid shapes
        he walks around them
        shines his light on one

                                 kane
                  its like some kind of storage
                  area  is anybody there  do
                  you read me

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  loud and clear

                                 kane
                  the place is full of leathery
                  things sealedsoft to the
                  touch

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  can you see whats in them

                                 kane
                  ill give it a look

        he tries to open one of them
        it wont open

                                 kane
                  strange feeling to it

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  dont open it  you dont know
                  whats in it

        kane peers closely at the leathery ovoids
        turns away
        raised areas begin to appear where he touched it
        he moves his light along the rows
        turns back to the one he was examining
        something has changed
        the opaque surface begins to clear
        object becoming visible within
        kane shines his light on the floor at the base of it
        he studies it

                                 kane
                  jesus

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  what

        viscera and mandible now visible
        the interior surface spongy and irregular
        kane shines the light inside
        with shocking violence a small creature smashes outward
        fixes itself to his mask
        sizzling sound
        the creature melts through the mask
        attaches itself to kanes face
        kane tears at the thing with his hands
        his mouth forced open
        he falls backward

        int chamber above

                                 dallas
                  kanekane can you hear me

                  we better haul him out

                                 lambert
                  itll yank him right off his feet
                  if hes not expecting it

                                 dallas
                  try him again

                                 lambert
                  kanekanegoddamn it  answer
                  me

        dallas begins to fiddle with the wench mechanism

                                 dallas
                  the lines slack

        pause

                                 lambert
                  he doesnt answer
                         pause
                  do you think he could have unhooked
                  himself

        dallas switches on the winch motor
        with a whine it begins to reel the line in
        after a moment the line tightens with a jerk
        the motor slows laboring under added weight

                                 dallas
                  it caught

                                 lambert
                  is it hooked on something

                                 dallas
                  no its coming

                                 lambert
                  i cant see anything

        dallas shines his light down into the hole
        shakes his head

                                 dallas
                  lines still moving

        a long moment
        dallas shines his light again

                                 dallas
                  here he comes

        the winch labors heavily

                                 dallas
                  get ready to grab him

        kane appears at the top of the opening
        dangles limply from the wire
        dallas reaches for him then recoils

                                 dallas
                  look out  theres something on
                  his face

        lambert attempts to help

                                 lambert
                  what is it

        kane appears to be completely unconscious
        the life form is still wrapped motionless around his face

                                 lambert
                  oh jesus

                                 dallas
                  dont touch it

        they grapple with kanes limp body
        lift him from the hole

        int entrance to derelict  sunset

        kane is now pinioned between dallas and lambert
        the storm raging through and beyond the entrance
        dallas begins to assemble travois

        ext the nostromo  sunset

        atmosphere turning the color of blood
        and the sun is down
        the ring of floodlights on the ship comes to life
        feebly combatting the darkness and continuing storm

        int bridge

        jones the cat staring through a port opening at the storm
        ripley waiting on the bridge
        ash stares at his inactive monitors
        suddenly

        ripley stares at the screen

                                 ash
                  ill go

        ash moves from the room
        ripley remains seated at her console

        ext landing leg  night

        dallas and lambert dragging kane on a travois towards landing
        leg

        int passageway near air lock

        ash comes down the steps
        hurries to the inner door lock
        presses the wall voiceamp

        ash shrugs
        brett appears at the top of the companionway
        puzzled look on his face

        int bridge

        ripley seated alone in the room
        dallas appears as a huge image on all screens
        lambert behind him
        kane pinioned to dallas

                                 dallas

                  i read you  the answer is negative

        ash hits the emergency switch
        a red light goes on
        servo whine
        followed by a solid metallic chunk

                                 ash
                  inner hatch open

        int bridge  night

        ripley staring at the console
        she cant believe what she sees
        turns to the viewscreens
        watches dallas kane and lambert enter

        int passageway near air lock

        the servo again turns over
        another clunk
        the outer door has closed
        red light off
        the inner door slides open
        dallas and lambert stagger into passageway
        carry kanes body between them
        dallas pulls off his helmet

                                 dallas
                  stay clear

        ash and parker move back

                                 ash

                                 parker

                                 brett
                  right

        ash and brett move in carefully to help with the limp burden

        int infirmary

        kanes helmet
        hands begin to open it with a laser cutter
        the helmet separates easily
        the two halves part
        the life form slowly pulsing on kanes face
        dallas hesitates then puts his hand on the small creature
        tries to pull it free
        unsuccessful
        the alien remains anchored to kanes tissue

                                 ash
                  let me try

        ash takes a pair of pliers from a rack
        carefully grasps the tip of the creature
        squeezes tightly
        leans back

                                 dallas
                  youre tearing his face

        a trickle of blood appears on kanes cheek

                                 brett
                  its not going to come off without
                  pulling his whole faceoff at the
                  same time

                                 dallas
                  let the machine work on him

        the ash presses a switch
        the machine lights up
        kane is sucked into a slot on the wall
        visible inside through the glass layer
        a blinding colored light performs antisepsis
        two video monitors pop on

        angle on the doorway

        ripley appears
        dallas turns and looks at her
        a long moment

                                 dallas
                  when i give an order i expect
                  it to be obeyed

                                 ripley
                  even if its against the law

                                 dallas
                  thats right

        lambert steps forward and slaps ripley across the face
        ripley slowly puts her hand to her cheek

                                 lambert
                  you were going to leave us out there

                                 parker
                  maybe she should have  who the
                  hell knows what that is

                                 brett
                  right

        ripley looks at lambert
        a moment

                                 ripley
                  lets call it settled

        lambert gives her a curt nod
        ash turns attention to the instrumentation

                                 ripley
                  somebody fill me in

                                 dallas
                  he went into the structure alone
                  we lost radio contact  when we
                  pulled him out it was on his face

                                 ash
                  where did it come from

                                 dallas
                  somewhere inside that ship

                                 parker
                  how the hell is he breathing

        they study the monitors

                                 ash
                  bloods throughly oxygenated

                                 dallas
                  how  his nose and mouth seem
                  to be blocked

                                 ash
                  we better look inside his head

        ash punches three buttons
        an xray image appears
        a color depiction of kanes head and upper torso
        the alien is clearly visible
        a maze of complicated biology
        kanes jaws are forced open
        the creature has extruded a long tube down his mouth and
        throat
        the appendage ending at the base of the esophagus

                                 brett
                  its got something down his goddamn
                  throat

                                 ash
                  that must be how its getting
                  oxygen to him

                                 ripley
                  it doesnt make sense  it paralyzes
                  him puts him into a coma then
                  keeps him alive

                                 parker
                  lets kill it  we cant leave the
                  damn thing on him

                                 ash
                  i dont know  at the moment the
                  creature is keeping him alive
                  if we remove it we might
                  terminate kane

                                 dallas
                  i dont think so  lets take the
                  chance and cut it off him

                                 ash
                  youll take the responsibility

                                 dallas
                  thats right

        slips into surgical gloves
        presses a switch kane slides back out of the booth

                                 dallas
                  give me the knife

        ripley takes a surgical laser blade from the case
        carefully passes it to dallas
        he manipulates the knife until he has a comfortable grip
        flicks a small button with his thumb
        the blade begins to hum
        dallas advances on kanes prostrate form
        touches the scalpel to the creature
        the electronic blade slices effortlessly downward
        suddenly a urinelike fluid begins to drip from the wound

                                 dallas
                  starting to bleed

        the liquid flows onto the bedding next to kanes head
        starts to hiss
        smoke curls up from the stain
        next the yellow fluid eats a hole through the bunk bed
        then drips onto the deck below
        metal bubbling and sizzling
        more smoke rising sending the crew into a coughing jag
        the crew jostle their way out of the cabin
        huddle in the passageway outside still coughing
        dallas frantically applies pressure to the wound
        in the process smoke of the fluid gets on dallass gloves
        they begin to smoke
        dallas leaps back pulls them off
        then runs out into the corridor

        int passageway outside infirmary

                                 brett
                  shit  its going to eat through
                  the decks and go out the hull

        he starts to run for the companionway

        int passageway  b deck

        dallas wrenches an emergency lamp from a socket
        hurls himself down a companionway
        the others follow

                                 dallas
                  there

        a droplet of fluid is sizzling on the ceiling bulkhead
        it oozes down
        drips to the deck
        continues to bubble
        then goes through the bulkhead

                                 ash
                  what can we put under it

        ripley and parker charge down the companionway below

        int second level  c deck

        ripley and parker move cautiously down the passageway
        look up to the ceiling bulkhead

                                 parker
                  dont get under it

        int passageway  b deck

        dallas brett and ash crouch by the spot where the acid
        sizzles
        ash fishes a pen out of his pocket
        probes the hole in the deck

                                 ash
                  its stopped penetrating

        ripley comes charging back up

                                 ripley
                  whats happening

                                 ash
                  i think its lost steam  no
                  longer active

        ripley checks the opening
        ash straightens up
        starts to put the pen back in his pocket
        changes his mind and stands holding it by the end

                                 ash
                  ive never seen anything like that
                  except molecular acid

                                 brett
                  this thing uses it for blood

                                 ash
                  its the asbestos that stopped it
                  otherwise it would have gone straight
                  through

                                 dallas
                  wonderful defense mechanism
                  you dont dare kill it

        parker comes up the companionway

                                 parker
                  its stopped bleeding

                                 dallas
                  yeah  after it penetrated two
                  levels

                                 ripley
                  what about kane

        starts up companionway

        int infirmary

        they return
        kane still motionless on the bunk
        the alien remains secured to his face
        wound completely healed over

                                 parker
                  any of the acid get on him

        dallas approaches peers at kanes head

                                 dallas
                  doesnt look like it

                                 brett
                  is it still dripping that crap

                                 ash
                  healed over

                                 lambert
                  there must be some way we can get
                  it off

        and look at dallas

                                 ash
                  i dont think you ought to try
                  again  it didnt work out too well
                  last time

        dallas gives him a look in return
        ripley presses a button
        kane slides back into the diagnostic coffin
        more buttons pressed
        display lights up again showing the different parts of
        kanes body

                                 ash
                  i better get some intravenous
                  feeding started  so far i cant
                  tell what the alien has absorbed
                  from his system

        the machine begins to process kanes body

                                 ripley
                  whats the stain on his lungs

        the xray reveals a spreading dark blot in the chest cavity
        at the center the stain is completely opaque

                                 ash
                  whatever it is its blocking
                  the xray

        a long moment
        the stain spreads

                                 brett
                  what happens now

        ash sets aside his partially melted pen
        looks at dallas

                                 dallas
                  you go back to work

        int engine room cubicle

        brett at work in the cubicle
        parker supervising him

                                 brett
                  i think ive got it  give it a
                  try

        parker pushes a button
        negative reaction on his monitor

                                 parker
                  nothing

                                 brett

                                 brett
                  right

        adjusts several toggles

                                 ripley
                         voice over
                  whats happening

                                 parker

                  this ship

        derisive laugh from parker through the speaker

                                 ripley
                  i have to listen to your bullshit

                  module is fixed

        she clicks off
        parker turns away

                                 parker
                  smart mouth broad

        int infirmary

        ash running test on the equipment
        kane respirating on the view screens above
        still deep within a coma
        all instruments recording his life processes
        the aliens position unchanged
        ripley approaches
        sits near ash

                                 ripley

                                 ash
                  its got an outer layer of protein
                  polysaccharides  a lot of amino
                  acids for prolonged reistance to
                  adverse environmental conditions
                  that enough for you

                  his only chance at staying alive
                  was to get into the infirmary

                                 ripley
                  by breaking quarantine procedure
                  you risk everybodys life

                                 ash

                  a science officer  not exactly out
                  of the manual

        dallas listening to a primitive tape
        his foot tapping with the rhythm
        beep
        an interruption on the communicator

        dallas exits

        int corridor outside imfirmary window

        ash stares through window
        dallas joins him
        ripley appears behind
        a long pause

                                 dallas
                  its gone

        kanes prone form
        the alien is no longer on his face
        kane still unconscious but continues to breathe
        face covered with sucker marks

                                 ripley
                  the door is closed  it must still
                  be in there

                                 ash
                  we cant open the door  we dont
                  want to let it out

                                 ripley
                  yeah i remember  we cant grab
                  it  we cant kill it

                                 dallas
                  maybe we can catch it

                                 ash
                  as long as were careful not to
                  damage it

        int infirmary

        they enter cautiously
        dallas begins moving slowly around the room
        picking up a stainless steel tray
        looking
        ash and ripley do the same
        ripley bends down and peers under the bunk
        nothing
        accidentally kicks over a tray
        she stands
        doesnt see the alien on a ledge above her
        her shoulder brushes against the creature
        it drops on her
        she screams  twists
        the alien drops to the floor
        then lies motionless
        its skin faded to a deadlooking grey
        ripley doesnt raise her eyes from the creature
        prods the alien
        no response

                                 ash
                  i think its dead
                         looks to ripley
                  you okay

                                 ripley
                  yeah

        she carefully touches the creature with a metal probe
        fishes the motionless lifeform into the tray
        quickly closes the lid
        lifts it onto a stainless steel table
        bright light trained on the alien
        the creature in a supine position
        ash touches at the alien with a surgical instrument

                                 ash
                  look at those suckers  no wonder
                  we couldnt get it off him

                                 ripley
                  wheres its mouth

                                 ash
                  its this tubething up in
                  here
                         carefully extracts
                         the end of the organ
                  its hardening
                         slips the creature
                         under a fluoroscope
                  its dead  no life sign whatever

                                 ripley
                  lets get rid of it

                                 ash
                  this has to go back  this is
                  our first contact with a
                  specimen like this  all kinds
                  of tests need to be run

                                 ripley
                  that thing bled acid  god
                  knows what itll do when
                  its dead

                                 ash
                  i think its safe to assume
                  its not a zombie dallas we
                  have to keep this specimen

        pause

                                 dallas
                  youre the science officer  its
                  your decision

                                 ash
                  then its made ill seal it
                  in a stasis tube

        pause

                                 ripley
                  what about kane

        ash turns back to the bunk
        studies the life support gauges
        kane continues to breathe steadily

                                 ash
                  running a fever  and still
                  unconscious  the machine will
                  bring his temperature down
                  his vital functions are strong
                  who knows he may make it

        ash begins to seal the alien in a large vacuum tube

                                 ripley

                                 dallas

                  with another science man  then
                  two days before we left thedus
                  replaced him with ash

        she looks at him

        the ship clears the top of the cloud layer
        bursts out into starsprinkled space
        trailing a wake of glimmering dust flecks
        attached itself to the hovering refinery

                                 lambert
                  according to my calculations
                  based on the time spent getting
                  to and from the planet and the
                  speed at which its moving away
                  from the other

                                 dallas
                  give me the short version

                                 lambert

                  see him

        int corridor outside infirmary window

        what they see isnot what they expect
        kane is sitting up in bedwide awake
        they enter

                                 lambert

        instantly ash brings him a plastic cup and water
        kane gulps it down in a swallow

                                 kane
                  more

        ripley quickly fills a much bigger container
        hands it to kane
        he greedily consumes the entire contents
        then sags back panting on the bunk

                                 dallas
                  how do you feel

                                 kane
                  just some horrible dream
                  about smothering  where
                  are we

                                 ripley
                  were on our way home

                                 brett
                  getting ready to go back into
                  the freezers

                                 kane

                                 parker
                  im pretty hungry myself

                                 dallas
                  one meal before bed

        int mess

        the entire crew is seated
        hungrily swallowing huge portions of artificial food
        the cat eats from a dish on the table

                                 kane
                  first thing im going to do when
                  we get back is eat some decent
                  food

                                 parker

                  what i mean

                                 lambert

                  christ youre pounding down this
                  stuff like theres no tomorrow

        pause

                                 parker
                  i mean i like it

                                 kane

                  make this stuff out of

                                 parker

                  so what  its food now  youre
                  eating it

        suddenly kane grimaces

                                 ripley
                  whats wrong

        kanes voice strains

                                 lambert
                  whats the matter

                                 kane
                  i dont know im getting cramps

        the others stare at him in alarm
        suddenly he makes a loud groaning noise
        clutches the edge of the table with his hands
        knuckles whitening

                                 ash
                  breathe deeply

        kane screams

                                 kane
                  oh god it hurts so bad
                  it hurts  it hurts
                         stands up
                  ooooooh

                                 brett
                  what is it  what hurts

        kanes face screws into a mask of agony
        he falls back into his chair

                                 kane
                  ohmygooaaaahh

        a red stain
        then a smear of blood blossoms on his chest
        the fabric of his shirt is ripped apart
        a small head the size of a mans fist pushes out
        the crew shouts in panic
        leap back from the table
        the cat spits bolts away
        the tiny head lunges forward
        comes spurting out of kanes chest trailing a thick body
        splatters fluids and blood in its wake
        lands in the middle of the dishes and food
        wriggles away while the crew scatters
        then the alien being disappears from sight
        kane lies slumped in his chair
        very dead
        a huge hole in his chest
        the dishes are scattered
        food covered with blood

                                 lambert
                  no no no no no

                                 brett
                  what was that  what the christ
                  was that

                                 parker
                  it was growing in him the whole
                  time and he didnt even know it

                                 ash
                  it used him for an incubator

                                 ripley
                  that means weve got another
                  one

                                 dallas
                  yeah  and its loose on the
                  ship

        slowly they gather around kanes gutted corpse
        then they all look at one another
        then at kane
        dead on the table

        int corridor  a deck

        empty
        parker and brett descend companioway
        they join ash lambert ripley and dallas

                                 dallas
                  any signs

                                 lambert
                  nothing

                                 ash
                  nothing

                                 parker
                  didnt see a goddamn thing

                                 brett
                  didnt see anything

                                 ripley
                  we cant go into hypersleep with
                  that thing running loose  wed
                  be sitting ducks in the freezers
                  we have to kill it first

                                 lambert
                  we cant kill it  if we do it
                  will spill its body acids right
                  through the hull

                                 brett
                  sonofabitch

                                 ripley
                  we have to catch it and eject
                  it from the ship

                                 ash
                  our supplies are based on us
                  spending a limited amount of
                  time out of suspended animation
                  strictly limited

                                 ripley
                  first we have to find it

                                 dallas
                  no  first weve got something
                  else to do

        he looks at kanes body through mess doorway

        int air lock

        kanes body wrapped in a makeshift shroud

        int bridge

        the crew looking at kanes body on view screens
        silent
        depressed

                                 dallas
                  inner hatch sealed

        ripley nods

                                 dallas
                  anybody want to say anything

        nothing to say
        he nods to ripley
        she presses a button

        int air lock

        the outer hatch opens
        yawning space outside
        kanes body shoots out into eternity
        the hatch closes

        int mess

        the crew is assembled

                                 ripley
                  ive checked on the supplies
                  for about a week we can stay
                  out of hypersleep

                                 brett
                  then what

                                 lambert
                  we run out of food and oxygen

                                 dallas
                  all right thats what weve got
                  a week  its plenty of time

                                 parker
                  i say we put on our pressure
                  suits and blow all the air out
                  of the ship  that might kill it

                                 lambert
                  what a swell idea

                                 parker
                  whats wrong with it

                                 ash
                  weve got fortyeight hours of
                  air in our pressure suits and
                  it takes six months to get home

                                 lambert
                  other than thata swell idea

        parker wont give up on this idea

                                 parker
                  maybe we could cut some kind
                  of special lines to the tanks
                  brett and i are pretty good
                  practical engineerswe got
                  us back up you know

                                 ripley
                  all by yourselves

                                 ash
                  i hate to point this out but
                  it might be better off without
                  oxygen  it lived that way long
                  enough

                                 ripley
                  theres another problem  how
                  do we find it  theres no
                  visual communication on b and
                  c decks  all the screens are
                  out

                                 dallas
                  were going to have to flush it
                  out

                                 ash
                  sounds greatbut how

                                 dallas
                  room by room corridor by corridor

        one of those suggestions that nobody likes

                                 lambert
                  and what do we do when we find it

                                 ripley
                  trap it somehow

                                 brett
                  if we had a really strong piece
                  of net we could bag it i could
                  put something together  a long
                  metal rod with a battery in it
                  only take a few hours

                                 lambert
                  why do we listen to this meathead

        dallas turns it over

                                 dallas
                  he might be right

        ext outer space

        the nostromo continues through the vortex

        int infirmary

        dallas enters
        ash working at a readout section

                                 dallas
                  i want to talk

                                 ash
                  im a little busy at the
                  moment

        pause

                                 dallas
                  i dont care

        pause

                                 ash
                  all right go ahead

                                 dallas
                  why did you let the alien survive
                  inside kane

                                 ash
                  im not sure youre getting
                  through to me

                                 dallas
                  mother was monitoring his body
                  you were monitoring mother  you
                  must have had some idea of what
                  was going on

                                 ash
                  what are you trying to say

        a long moment

                                 dallas

                  talking about  and i dont like
                  any of the insinuations  the

                  lifei dont want it to stay
                  alive any more than you do

                                 dallas

                                 ash
                  yeah im sure  you should be
                  too

        dallas walks out
        ash watches him go
        stares in his direction a long while

        int narcissus

        dallas seated in the shuttle craft
        staring at the myriad lights of outer space
        ripley climbs beside him

                                 ripley
                  i thought id find you here

        dallas continues to stare

                                 dallas
                  are the nets finished

        pause

                                 ripley
                  weve got an hourlook i
                  need some relief

                                 dallas
                  why did you wait until now

        ripley leans forward

                                 ripley
                  let me tell you something  you
                  keep staring out there long
                  enough theyll be peeling you
                  off the wall

        ripley begins taking off her boots

                                 dallas
                  were the new pioneers ripley
                  we even get to have our own
                  special disease

                                 ripley
                  im tired of talking

        she rises and removes her upper garments

                                 dallas
                  you waited too long

                                 ripley
                  give it a try anyway

        clothing removed
        his arms move around her

        int bridge

        the crew has assembled
        brett unfolds several yards of asbestos netting
        hands out five thin rods
        each of them like metal broom handles

                                 brett
                  i put portable generators in
                  each of these  theyre insulated
                  down here  just be goddamn careful
                  not to get your hand on the end

        he touches the tip to a metal object
        a blue spark leaps

                                 brett
                  it wont damage the little bastard
                  unless its skin is a lot thinner
                  than oursitll just give it a
                  little incentive

                                 lambert
                  now if we could only find it

        ash picks up a portable unit

                                 ash
                  ive taken care of thattracking
                  device  you set it to search for
                  a moving objectit hasnt much
                  range but when you get within a
                  certain distance it starts beeping

        ripley takes the tracker from ashs hand

                                 ripley
                  whats it key on

                                 ash
                  micro changes in air density
                  keep it pointed ahead of you

                                 dallas
                  well break into two teams
                  whoever finds it first catches
                  it in the net and ejects it
                  from the nearest air lock
                         pause
                  for starters lets make sure
                  the bridge is safe

        parker turns on his unit
        scans it around the room

                                 lambert
                  we seem to be okayif this
                  damn thing works

                                 dallas
                  ash and myself will go with
                  lambert  brett and parker will
                  make up the second team  ripley
                  you command it

        they start doling out the equipment

                                 dallas
                  channels are open on all decks
                  well be in constant touch

        int passageway  a level

        lambert and dallas carry the net
        ash walks directly behind carrying the tracking device
        he continually scans from side to side
        lambert stops by a stairwell

                                 lambert
                  anything down there

        int another passageway  b level

        parker and ripley move silently along
        ripley ahead of them with the tracker by the stairwell

                                 ripley
                  nothing

        the move on
        a small light flashes

                                 ripley
                  hold it  ive got something

        parker and brett grow tense
        start looking around

                                 brett
                  wheres it coming from

        ripley peers closely at the tracker

                                 ripley
                  machines screwed up  i cant
                  tell  needles spinning all
                  over the dial

                                 brett
                  goddamn malfunction

        ripley turns the tracker on its side
        the needles stabilize

                                 ripley
                  no just confused  its
                  coming from below us

        they all look down at their feet

        int maintenance  c level

        ripley parker and brett come down ladder onto an endless
        oily corridor
        they stop at the foot of the companionway
        they move down corridor into darkness

                                 ripley
                  okay

        looks at the tracker
        nods down the passageway  stops

                                 ripley
                  back this way

        they begin to walk in that direction
        entering drab section of the ship
        surrounded by deep shadows
        footsteps clanging on the metal deck

                                 ripley
                  i thought you fixed 12 module

                                 brett
                  we did

                                 parker
                  circuits must have burned out

        they switch on lights
        move around two turns

                                 ripley
                  wait

        they stop quickly almost stumbling

                                 ripley
                  its within five meters

        parker and brett heft the net
        ripley has the prod in one hand tracker in the other
        moves with great care
        almost in a halfcrouch ready to leap back
        prod extended ripley constantly glances at her tracker
        the device leads her up to a small hatch in the bulkhead
        perspiration rivers down her face
        she sets aside the tracker
        raises the prod grasps the hatch handle
        yanks it open
        jams the electric prod inside
        a nerveshattering squall
        then a small creature comes flying out of the locker
        eyes glaring claws flashing
        instinctively they throw the net over it
        very annoyed
        they open the net and release the captive
        which happens to be the cat
        hissing and spittingit scampers away

                                 ripley
                  god damn ithold it

                                 parker
                  we should have killed itnow
                  we might pick it up on the
                  tracker again

                                 ripley
                  go get it  well go on

                                 brett
                  right

        ripley and parker move down the passageway
        brett follows the direction taken by the cat
        moves across passageway into equipment maintenance area

        int equipment maintenance area  c level

        brett walking between rows of shadowed equipment
        looking for the cat
        nervous

                                 brett
                  joneshere kittyjones
                  goddamn it jones

        scratching noises
        a reassuring cat yowl
        brett moves on

        int passageway  c level

        ripley and parker walk along
        tracker signal weakens
        finally stops

                                 ripley
                  nothing here

                                 parker
                  lets go back

        int undercarriage room  c level

        brett enters
        still looking for jones
        another yowl followed by a hiss
        two eyes shining in the dark
        jones
        relieved brett moves toward the cat

                                 brett
                  here kittycome on jones

        brett reaches for jones
        jones hisses
        an arm reaches for brett
        the alien
        now seven feet tall
        hanging from the undercarriage strut in reverse position
        grabs brett and swings up into darkness
        brett screams
        to no avail
        in the doorway ripley and parker
        they witness the horror

        int mess

        the remaining crew assemble
        long faces

                                 lambert
                  now what

                                 parker
                  blast the rotten bastard with
                  a laser and take our chances

                                 ripley
                  no  at its present size its
                  holding enough acid to tear a
                  hole in this ship as big as this
                  room

                                 ash
                  it wouldnt do any good  its
                  selfregenerating  you saw that
                  when we operated on it

                                 ripley
                  the only plan thats going to
                  work is the same one we had
                  before  drive it into an air
                  lock and blow it out into space

                                 parker
                  drive itthe sonofabitch
                  is huge

                                 lambert
                  for once he has a point  how
                  do we drive it

                                 ripley
                  the science department should
                  be able to help

                                 ash
                  according to mother hes a
                  primitive form of encephlepod

                                 lambert
                  how come its a he

                                 ash
                  just a phrase  as a matter of
                  fact hes both bisexual or
                  hermaphrodite to be precise

                                 dallas
                  skip its sex life  how do
                  we kill it

                                 ash
                  it seems to have adapted to
                  an oxygenrich atmosphere and
                  its certainly adapted well for
                  its nutritional requirements
                  the only thing we dont know
                  about is temperature

                                 ripley
                  curious isnt itthat the
                  alien is an encephlepod

                                 ash
                  whats so curious about that

                                 ripley
                  its curious because lower
                  species cant adapt as quickly
                  as higher ones  and this ones
                  doing very well  a real survivor
                  might even have as good a chance
                  as we do

                                 ash
                  youre getting paranoid again

                                 ripley
                  all right  what about the
                  temperature  what happens
                  if we change it

                                 ash
                  lets give it a try  most
                  animals retreat from fire

        pause

                                 parker
                  i can hook up a couple of
                  incinerating units in about
                  fifteen minutes

        pause

                                 dallas
                  anybody got any better ideas

        nobody does

                                 dallas
                  okay  when parkers ready
                  well work our way back down
                  to c deck

        ext outer space

        nostromo at light plus four

        int passageway  b level

        parker and dallas lead
        armed with flamethrowers
        they descend from companionway
        suddenly both tracking devices beep frantically
        sound of rending metal up ahead
        the move forward cautiously

                                 dallas
                  its in that food locker

        ext food locker number 12

        more rending noises

                                 lambert
                  jesus  it must be huge

                                 parker
                  its got to be using the
                  airshafts to move around

        dallas raises flamethrower

                                 dallas
                  do these things really work

                                 parker

                                 ripley
                  thats what worries me

        dallas indicates door handle
        parker reluctantly takes it

                                 dallas
                  now

        parker wrenches open door
        dallas fires a long blast  another
        another and anothersilence
        they move inside

        int food storage locker number 12  b level

        charred wreckage
        packages have been ripped to shreds
        foodstuffs scattered over the floor
        carefully they poke through the smouldering garbage

                                 ripley
                  we didnt get him

                                 dallas
                  this is where he went

        on the wall a ventilator grill has been ripped open
        they move to the shredded ventilator
        shine their lights inside the shaft

                                 dallas
                  this could work for us  the
                  duct comes out at the starboard
                  air lock  theres an exit on
                  the way  but we can close that
                  off  then we drive it into the
                  air lock and blast it into space

                                 lambert
                  yeah  all you have to do is
                  crawl in the vent with it find
                  your way through the maze and
                  hope its afraid of fire

                                 dallas
                  well parker you wanted an
                  equal share

                                 parker

                  your full share

                                 parker
                  no way

                                 ripley

                  air lock  parker and lambert
                  cover the exit

        no doubt as to whos going inside the vent

        int starboard air lock  vestibule

        ripley stands in vestibule
        looks through the bulkhead door to air lock
        she throws a switch
        watches airshaft entrance into air lock open
        the trap is ready

        int maintenance level

        parker and lambert get set

        int food storage locker number 12  b level

        ash hands dallas the makeshift flamethrower
        he fires a couple of short bursts

                                 dallas
                  its still working

                                 ash

                  harder on the rest of us if
                  we lose you

                                 dallas

                                 ash
                  i dont agree

                                 dallas
                  the decision is final

        he removes the master computer key
        hands it to ash

                                 dallas
                  if i dont take it back
                  ripley will need this

        ash nods
        dallas turns and climbs into the ventilator opening
        just large enough to crawl through

        int air shaft

        completely dark
        dallas turns on his helmet light
        flips switch on throat mike

                                 dallas
                  do you receive me  ripley
                  parker  lambert

        int equipment maintenance area

        the hum of vast cooling plants
        large air shafts run off in different directions
        parker and lambert stand ready by a duct
        lambert hits the wall amp button

                                 lambert
                  were in position  ill try
                  and pick you up on the tracker

        parker hefts his flamethrower

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  parker if it tries to come
                  out by you make sure you drive
                  it back in  ill push it forward

                                 parker
                  right

        int air lock vestibule

        near the starboard air lock
        ripley pops open the hatch
        the air lock now open and ready
        she moves to the air duct opening

                                 ripley
                  air lock open

                                 dallas
                         voice over
                  ready

                                 ripley
                  ready

        int air shaft

        dallas begins to crawl forward
        the tunnel is narrow
        only a foot or two wider than his shoulders

                                 dallas
                  im under way

        turns a corner
        several more tight turns
        instinctively dallas pulls back
        raises the flamethrower
        fires a blast around the corner into the darkness
        it roars loudly in the confined tube
        smoke drifts back into his face

        int maintenance level

        a large rectangular duct in one wall

                                 parker
                  thats where its got to come
                  out if it leaves the main shaft

        he throws a switch
        a metal pane rises and seals off the opening

                                 lambert
                  lets keep it open  id like
                  to know if anythings coming

        reluctantly parker again throws the switch and raises the
        metal pane

        int air lock vestibule

        ripley waiting

        int air shaft

        dallas still crawling on hands and knees
        ahead the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn
        he moves toward the corner
        fires another blast from the flamethrower
        then starts crawling down head first

        int equipment maintenance area

        lambert sees something on the tracker

                                 lambert
                  beginning to get a reading on
                  you

        int air shaft

        the shaft makes yet another turn
        puts dallas into an almost immobilized position

        int food storage locker number 12

        ash staring at the ventilator opening

        int air shaft

        dallas against a wall of the shaft
        clutching his flamethrower
        whispers into his throat mike

                                 dallas
                  ripley

        int air lock vestibule

                                 ripley
                  read you clear

        int air shaft

                                 dallas
                  i dont think this shaft goes
                  much farther its getting hot
                  in here

        he readies the flamethrower

        int equipment maintenance area

        parker readies his weapon

        int air shaft  doubletiered passageway

        the air shaft tributary opens into a larger twotier air
        tunnel
        dallas crawls out and stands
        moves to a catwalk floor  looks about
        moves forward  reaches a repair junction
        sits

        his feet dangle beneath the catwalk floor to the next level

                                 dallas
                  lambert what kind of reading
                  are you getting

        int maintenance level

        lambert huddled over her tracker
        puzzled

                                 lambert
                  im not sure  there seems
                  to be some kind of double
                  image

        int air shaft doubletiered passageway

        dallas sitting
        his feet still dangling in the dark beneath the catwalk

                                 dallas
                  it may be interference  ill
                  push on ahead

        dallas begins to rise
        from below a gentle movement toward the hanging feet
        a hand reaches up
        misses his leg as dallas moves ahead

        further on

                                 dallas
                  lambert am i coming in any
                  clearer

                                 lambert
                         voice over
                  its clear all right but im
                  still getting two blips
                         pause
                  im not sure which one is
                  which

        dallas stops
        turns around
        looks back down through the catwalk
        lowers the nose of the flamethrower his finger on the
        trigger
        from behind him the hand reaches up
        the alien is the front signal

        int air lock vestibule

        ripley bends forward
        hears the sounds of the struggle
        and dallas screams
        she cries out

                                 ripley
                  dallasdallas

        int equipment maintenance area

        lambert and parker
        hearing it all

                         voice over
                  oh my god

        then silence

        int mess

        dallas flamethrower on the table surface

                                 parker
                         voice over
                  we just found it laying there
                  no sign of him  only a hole
                  torn through to the central
                  cooling complex

        the remaining crew standing at the table

                                 ripley
                  this puts me in command

                                 parker
                  okay

        for the first time hes dropped his bullshit

                                 ripley
                  unless someones got a better
                  idea about dealing with the
                  alien well continue with the
                  last plan

        silence

                                 ripley
                  how are our weapons

                                 parker
                  theyre working finewe could
                  use more fuel for that one

        indicating dallas flamethrower

                  get it

                                 parker

        he leaves
        ripley turns to ash

                                 ripley

                                 ash
                  thats the way it looks

                                 ripley
                  i cant believe that

                  go back to mother and keep
                  asking questions until you

                  all rightill try

        he starts to go

                                 ripley
                  dallas didnt leave the master
                  computer key with you

                                 ripley

                  well we probably wont need
                  it anyway

        he leaves

                                 ripley
                  i know ash has got the key

                                 lambert
                  why should he lie

                                 ripley
                  he knows i want to check up on
                  himwithout that key weve got
                  no access to command priority
                  information

                                 lambert
                  swell

        lambert shrugs
        they start to leave

        int maintenance area  c deck

        parker selects two full methane cylinders
        he tests them
        moves out

        int corridor to bridge

                                 ripley
                  did you ever sleep with ash

                                 lambert
                  no  what about you

                                 ripley
                  no

                                 lambert
                  i never got the impression he
                  was particularly interested

        int passageway  b level

        parker returning with methane cylinder
        turns a corner
        comes to an abrupt halt
        a movement in front of him beyond the air lock
        he hesitates
        then another shadowy movement

        int bridge

        ripley and lambert
        parkers voice on voiceamp
        muffled
        ripley hits a toggle

                  keep it down

        up the corridor the movement stops

        int bridge

        int blister

        ash listens

        int bridge

        ripley hesitates
        starts to reply
        throws switch

        int air lock  b deck

        low servo whine
        door opens
        slowly
        green light throbbing inside air lock
        creature looks curiously at it
        moves onto the threshold

        int passageway  b level

        parker watches

        int bridge

        as ripley moves to throw switch

        int air lock

        suddenly from out of nowhere a klaxon wails
        the creature leaps back across the threshold of the air lock
        bewildered
        screams as the inner hatch closes on an appendage
        acid boiling out
        the appendage crushed
        the acid bubbles
        metal boils in door

        int passageway  b level

        parker watches
        frozen
        the alien wrenches itself free
        comes flying outward
        smashes parker down
        flees
        on the wall a green light goes on

                                 inner hatch closed

        int air lock

        metal still boiling
        the outer hatch begins to open

                  parker

        pushes a switch
        pushes it again

                  whats happening parker

        in front of her a green light blinks
        inner hatch closed

                                 ripley
                  inner hatch sealed  the outer

        ripley bolts out of the bridge

        air lock open

        int passage near air lock  b level

        parker unconscious

        int air lock

        the inner hatch still closed
        metal boils
        the hole growing deeper

        int passageway  a level

        ripley runs toward the air lock corridor

        int air lock

        metal boiling in door

        int passageways  b deck

        ripley slams to a momentary halt against a bulkhead
        regains her balance
        starts running

        int passage near air lock  b level

        parker now half conscious
        ripley arrives as the hole in door blows open
        escaping air shrieks
        flashing sign comes on
        critical depressurization
        emergency klaxon
        simultaneously vestibule doors close either end
        sealing in ripley and parker
        door nearest to parker halfclosed on one of the methane
        cylinders
        leaving large gap
        windstorm begins as hole in air lock grows
        ripley reaches for other cylinder
        begins smashing the jammed cylinder out of door
        blood froths at their noses and ears
        cylinder finally is driven out
        the door slams closed

        int bridge

        lambert watches
        emergency light readings

                       hull breached
                       emergency bulkheads closed

        int passageway near air lock  b level

        ripley staggers toward an emergency panel
        at far end of corridor
        pinging sound
        misty atmosphere
        tries to activate the door
        cannot
        lambert appears other side of bulkhead
        activates door from outside

        int passage near air lock  b level

        repressurization sounds
        parker regains consciousness
        struggles to breathe
        ripley unable to move
        breath coming in shallow pants
        lambert with an oxygen tank
        ash follows
        oxygen administered to ripley and parker

        finally

                                 ash
                  you all right

                                 parker

                  went off and it jumped back in
                  the ship

                                 ash
                  who hit the warning

                                 ripley

                                 ash
                  what does that mean

                                 ripley
                  i guess the alarm went off by
                  itself

                                 ash
                  if youve got something to say
                  say it  im sick of these coy

        sullen silence

                                 ripley

        ash and parker leave
        ripley turns to lambert

                                 ripley

                  computer key i could prove it

                                 lambert
                  youre still accusing him of
                  stealing the key

                                 ripley
                  you think im wrong

                                 lambert

                  thanks

        int blister staircase

        ripley cautiously descends the stairs to the blister
        carrying a flamethrower

        int ashs blister

        looks around the blister
        satisfied its deserted
        she puts down the flamethrower
        methodically begins to search for the key
        faint tapping sound
        then stops
        she looks around
        sees nothing
        resumes searching near blister window
        ripley finds key
        tapping sound
        she whips around to see
        kanes disfigured face slapping against the plexiglass
        she stifles a scream
        drops the key onto the curved surface of the blister
        fishes for it
        kanes bloated face swings in
        beneath her
        she grabs the key and bolts up companionway

        int computer annex

        ripley plugs the key into the board
        data banks come to life
        she sits at a console
        thinks for a moment
        then punches up a code
        nothing happens
        punches another combination
        nothing happens
        frustration
        another combination
        one screen comes to life
        another combination
        she moves to the second keyboard
        screen one spells out the question
        question  who turned on air lock 2 warning system
        response  ash
        another code
        question  is ash protecting the alien
        response  yes
        new code
        question  why
        response  special order 937 science eyes only
        she starts a new code
        a hand slams down next to ripleys arm
        it sinks elbow deep into the computer
        she whips around in her chair
        faces ash
        ripley lashes out with her foot
        kicks him in the middle
        no effect
        ripley twists away
        ash throws a punch at her
        misses
        she pushes a chair at him
        overturns the desk
        and runs through bridge into mess

        he moves after her
        gets her
        parker and lambert burst into the mess
        lambert falls on ashs back
        ash turns to lambert
        tosses her across the room
        returns to ripley
        again choking her
        parker lifts the tracker
        steps behind ash
        swings the trackerwallop
        tears his head off
        wires ascending from ashs trunk
        where his head used to be
        ashs hands release ripley
        search above his neck for his missing head
        he walks backward
        all eyes on ashs headless body
        he walks the room
        still feeling for his missing head

                                 parker
                  a robot a god damn droid

        ash turns on him
        starts to advance
        parker hits him again with the tracker
        again
        again
        no avail
        ash begins choking parker
        ripley picks up one of the prod sticks
        closes on ashs back
        tears away the fabric
        lambert pulls at ashs legs
        ripley tears at the controls buried in the cavity once
        covered by his head
        parkers eyes bulge in pain
        ash headless choking choking choking
        ripley finds the wires stabs the prod home
        ashs grip lessens
        another stabelectrical flash
        the grip lessens
        another stabflash of circuits
        the headless body collapses
        parker trying to regain his breath

                                 parker
                  damn you

        kicks the headless body
        lambert looks at ripley

                                lambert
                  tell mewhat the hells going on

        pause

                                 ripley
                  lets find out  wire him back up

                                 parker
                  what kind of crap is that

                                 ripley
                  do it

        they set to work
        begin to reassemble the wiring in ashs head

                                 ripley
                  ash let it on board  ash let it
                  grow inside kane  ash blew the
                  warning signal

                                 lambert
                  why

        ashs head is placed on the table
        his eyes flicker into consciousness

                  what is special order 937

                  special order 937 in essence
                  asked me to direct the ship to
                  the planet investigate a life
                  form possibly hostile and bring
                  it back for observation  with
                  discretion of course

                                 ripley

                                 ripley

                  alien  no matter what happened

                  the alien is a perfect organism
                  superbly structured cunning
                  quintessentially violent  with
                  your limited capabilities you have

                  human life

                  you but i think i prefer a
                  painless peaceful death to any
                  of the alternatives on offer

        as she reaches for him jones jumps off the console
        moves away

                  come on jones

        she moves after the cat
        we hear parker and lambert over the communicator
        from the coolant locker

                                 lambert
                         voice over
                  how much do you think well
                  need

        ripley still in pursuit of the cat

        jones moves away

        int food locker number 6  b deck

        arms full parker moves out of the locker
        lambert is still making her selection
        a faint light on the tracker
        unnoticed

        int bridge

        ripley finally corners jones
        finds his box
        tries to put him in it
        jones resists
        ultimately futile

        int food locker corridor  outside

        parker attempts to pick up the flamethrower
        cant manage it and the food
        drops some of the packages

                                 parker
                  goddamn

        in the locker lambert gathers food

                                 lambert
                  whats the matter

                                 parker
                  nothing  just hurry up

        the tracker flashes faster
        now its noticed
        parker picks up the flamethrower

                                 parker
                  lets get out of here

                                 lambert
                  right now

        the alien appears out of the air shaft ventilator
        lambert turns
        screams
        unfolding the alien grabs for her

        int bridge

        ripley freezes as she hears lamberts screams

        int corridor  outside

        parker looks back into the locker
        unable to use the flamethrower without hitting lambert
        he hesitates for a moment then strides into the locker
        wielding the flamethrower like a club

                                 parker
                  goddamn you

        int foor locker number 6

        the alien drops lambert
        parker lands a blow with the flamethrower
        no effect
        the alien strikes him once
        killing him instantly
        he now moves to lambert

        int bridge

        ripley listening on the communicator
        lamberts dying shrieks
        then the voiceamp goes dead
        silence

                                 ripley
                  parker  lambert

        she waits for a response
        but her expression shows that she expects none
        a long moment
        expectation fulfilled
        nightmare without end

        int b level  companionway

        ripley descends cautiously holding flamethrower
        jones left above squalling

        int corridor  b deck

        ripley moving warily carrying flamethrower
        nears entrance to food locker looks in
        sees carnage

        int oily corridor  c deck

        ripley running toward engine room
        out of breath
        exhausted she stops gulps for air
        suddenly ahead of her the sound of human weeping
        she moves quietly ahead until the source of the sound is
        directly under her feet
        she is standing on a round metal plate
        ripley starts to remove the disc

        int undercarriage maintenance room number 4

        the round opening illuminates a dakr ladderway
        still carrying flamethrower ripley starts downwards
        pitch black
        ripley arrives at deck level
        shines her light
        its arc reveals the aliens layer
        bones shreds of flesh
        pieces of clothing shoes
        bizarre extrusions on the wall

        something moves in the darkness
        ripley spins turns her light toward the movement

        hanging from the ceiling is a huge cocoon
        woven from fine white silklike material
        flamethrower ready ripley approaches
        sees that the cocoon is semitransparent
        the body of dallas inside

        unexpectedly his eyes open
        focus on ripley
        his voice is a whisper

                                 dallas
                  kill me

                                 ripley
                  what did it do

        dallas moves his head slightly
        ripley turns her light
        another cocoon dangles from the ceiling
        but of a different texture
        smaller and darker with a harder shell
        almost exactly like the ovoids in the derelict ship

                                 dallas
                  that was brett

                                 ripley
                  ill get you out of there
                  well get up the autodoc

        a long moment
        its hopeless

                                 ripley
                  what can i do

                                 dallas
                  kill me

        ripley stares at him
        raises the flamethrower
        sprays a molten blast
        another blast
        the entire compartment bursts into flames
        ripley turns and scrambles back up the ladderway

        int oily corridor  c level

        ripley emerges from below
        gasps for breath
        regains control of herself

        ext outer space

        at light speed
        the nostromo and refinery appear to hang motionless
        star clusters rolling past in the infinite distance

        int engine room  cubicle

        ripley enters the power center
        stares at the massive lightplus engines
        approaches the main control board
        begins closing the switches one by one
        a long moment
        sirens begin to honk
        mother speaks

        ripley running toward the b deck companionway

        int b level  corridor

        ripley starts toward narcissus
        remembers jones

        int a to b levels  companionway

        jones howling
        in his box
        ripley reaches up and grabs him

        int b level  corridor leading to air lock

        ripley carrying jones holding flamethrower
        jones hisses
        fur rises
        ripley stops and stares down corridor toward narcissus
        the alien can be heard thrashing about the shuttle craft
        ripley turns and bolts toward the engine room leaving
        jones on b level companionway

        int companionway to oily corridor  e level

        ripley bounds down the companionway
        her footsteps clanging metallically throughout the ship
        a final sprint towards the engine room

        the door crashes open ripley comes pounding in
        the chamber filled with smoke
        engines whining dangerously
        ripley breaks out in perspiration from the intense heat
        she runs to the controls
        begins throwing the cooling unit switches back into place
        the sirens continue sounding

                  minutes thirtyfive seconds

        a moment
        the ripley turns and runs from the engine room

        int oily corridor  companionway

        ripley runs back down the corridor
        up the companionway exhausted stumbling

        she reaches companionway
        picks up jones

        int b level  corridor leading to narcissus

        ripley staggers towards the air lock
        the narcissus berthed beyond
        she drags jones and raises the flamethrower
        turns to see if the creature is behind her
        then advances down the passageway
        goaded on by the computer

        looks into the shuttle

        int narcissus

        ripley scans the narrow deckempty

        int vestibule

        she turns and dashes back
        grabs the cat box
        runs back toward the shuttle

                                 mothers voice

                  explode in sixty seconds

        int narcissus

        ripley enters on the run
        hurls the cat box toward the front
        she dives into the control chair
        hits the launch button

        ext nostromo  outer space

        the retainer clips drop away
        a blast of ram jets
        the shuttle is launched from the mother ship

        int narcissus

        ripley frantically straps herself in
        gforces from the shuttles acceleration pulling against her

        ext space

        the narcissus continues to power away from the mother ship
        the larger bulk of the nostromo quietly receding
        all is strangely serene

        int narcissus

        ripley finishes strapping herself in
        reaches and grabs the cat box
        the cat yowling within
        ripley hugs the box to her chest
        hunches her head down over the container

        ext space

        the nostromo drifts farther away from the shuttlecraft
        finally becomes a small point of light
        then it blows up
        transforms into expanding orange fireball
        pieces of metal flying in all directions
        and then the refinery explodes
        200000000 tons of fuel blasting silently into the cosmos

        int narcissus

        the shockwave hits the shuttle craft
        jolting and rattling everything within
        then all is quiet
        ripley unhooks herself from her straps
        rises and goes to the back of the escape craft
        stares out through the porthole
        face bathed in orange light

        ext space

        piece of debris float past
        the boiling fireball fades into nothingness
        the nostromo has ceased to exist

        int narcissus

        ripley watching the final destiny of her ship and crew mates
        a very long moment
        then behind her the lethal hand emerges from deep shadow
        the alien has been in the shuttlecraft all along
        the cat yowls

        ripley whirls
        finding herself facing the creature

        ripleys first thought is for the flamethrower
        it lies on the deck next to the alien
        next she glances around for a place to hide
        her eye falls on a small locker containing a pressure suit
        the door standing open
        she begins to edge toward the compartment
        the creature stands
        comes for her
        ripley dives for the open door
        hurls herself inside
        slams it shut

        int locker

        a clear glass panel in the door
        the alien puts its head up to the window
        peers in at ripley
        their faces only two inches apart
        the alien looking at ripley almost in curiosity
        the moaning of the cat distracts it

        int narcissus

        the alien moves to the pressurized cat box
        bends down and peers inside
        the cat yowls louder as his container is lifted

        int locker

        ripley knocks on the glass
        trying to distract the creature from the cat
        the aliens face is instantly back at the window
        getting no more interference from her the creature
        returns to the cat box
        ripley looks around
        sees the pressure suit
        quickly begins to pull it on

        int narcissus

        the alien picks up the cat box
        shakes it
        the cat moans

        int locker

        ripley is halfway into a pressure suit

        int narcissus

        the creature throws the cat box down
        very hard
        picks it up again
        hammers it against the wall
        then jams it into a crevice
        begins to pound the container into the opening
        the cat now beyond all hysteria

        int locker

        ripley pulls on the helmet latches it into place
        turns the oxygen valve
        with a hiss the suit fills itself
        a rack on the wall contains a long metal rod
        ripley peels off the rubber tip
        revealing a sharp metal point

        int space suit locker

        ripley inhales
        kicks the door open

        int narcissus

        the creature rises
        faces the locker
        catches the steel shaft through its midriff
        the alien clutches at the spear
        yellow acid begins to flow from the wound
        before the fluid can touch the floor
        ripley reaches back and pulls the switch
        blows the rear hatch
        the atmosphere in the shuttle immediately sucked into space
        the bleeding creature along with it
        ripley grabs a strut to keep from being pulled out
        the alien shoots past her
        grabs ripleys ankle with an appendage

        ext narcissus

        ripley now hanging halfway out of the shuttlecraft
        the alien clinging to her leg
        she kicks at it with her free foot
        the creature holds fast

        int narcissus

        ripley looks for any salvation
        grabs the hatch level
        yanks it
        the hatch slams shut closing ripley safely inside

        ext narcissus

        the alien still outside the shuttlecraft
        within the vacuum of space
        the top of its appendage mashed into the closed hatch

        int narcissus

        acid starts to foam along the base of the hatch
        eats away at the metal
        ripley stumbles forward to the controls
        pushes the ram jet lever

        ext narcissus  outer space

        the creature struggling
        jet exhaust located at the rear of the craft
        the engines belch flame for a few seconds
        then shut off
        incinerating the alien tumbles slowly away into space

        int narcissus

        ripley hurries to the rear hatch
        peers through the glass

        ext outer space

        the burned mass of the alien drifts slowly away
        writhing smoking
        tumbling into the distance
        pieces dropping off
        the shape bloats then bursts
        spray of particles in all directions
        then smoldering fragments dwindle into infinity

        int narcissus  later

        now repressurized
        ripley is seated in the control chair
        calm and composed almost cheerful
        cat purring in her lap
        she dictates into a recorder

        she switches off the recorder
        stares into space

        the shuttlecraft narcissus sails into the distance
