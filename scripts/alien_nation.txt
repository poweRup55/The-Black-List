fade in

ext  mojave desert  day television image

a long lens shot of a far distant metallic object hovering
just above the ground  maybe two or three miles away
the heat waves and the light refraction off the desert
scape make the object undulate rhythmically keeping its
true shape and appearance indistinct

the video camera recording this scene zooms back then
pans over  revealing a semicircle of us army vehicles
and personnel  army engineers with their tripodmounted
scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the
armed infantry  everyone stares off at the same point on
the horizon  waiting

the video camera movements are handheld unsteady as it
moves through the line of army personnel to reveal a
second less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards
behind the army  locals from nearby towns perch in truck
beds and on car roofs budweiser and fritos at hand eyes
glued to the distant object

the video camera image climbs up onto the roof of a parked
local tv van finds the object again in the distance
zooms in and waits like everyone else

abruptly the video image contracts becoming a box
chromakeyed behind cnn reporter duncan crais

			crais
	that was the scene in californias
	mojave desert three years ago today
	 the historic first view of the
	newcomer ship upon its dramatic
	arrival  as with the assassination
	of john kennedy who among us does
	not remember exactly where he was
	that october nineteenth morning
	when news first broke that people
	have landed from another star

we pull back from a large television set to reveal


int  a crowded bar  los angeles  night

the hollowpoint lounge  a cop bar

the offduty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly
ignoring the tv except for two detectives fedorchuk and
alterez who are waiting for the ball scores

			fedorchuk
	i remember where i was  pissing
	off my balcony at the neighbors
	dog

others laugh

			alterez
		   yells at crais on tv
	get to the goddamn ball scores

on the tv screen an onlocation interview with a caltech
professor comes up  her name and title appear across the
bottom of the screen

			caltech professor
	from the time mankind first gazed up
	at the stars there had been
	speculation about a visit by people
	from out there  how ironic that
	when that first contact was made
	the two hundred and sixty thousand
	occupants aboard the craft were as
	surprised as we were about their
	arrival  that they awakened from
	frozen hibernation to find their
	malfunctioning autopilot had landed
	them here by mistake

the cnn reporter duncan crais appears again

			crais
	these newcomers we soon learned
	were a geneticallyengineered race
	adapted for hard labor in almost any
	environmental condition  in effect
	their ship was a slave ship
	washed ashore on earth with no way
	to get back to where they came
	from

a dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses cuts across
frame and we pan with it as it is slammed down on the
countertop

now an interview with a fresno housewife standing outside
a supermarket comes on the tv screen

			fresno housewife
	when the newcomers were first let
	out of the ship they were
	quarantined in a camp not ten miles
	from the town here  you can imagine
	how the people around here felt
	about that  but once they were
	releases from the camp and we got a
	chance to know them we saw what
	nice quiet people they really are

wider

revealing a massive alien figure in a filthy white
busboys uniform  his back is to us as he picks up two
trays from the counter  the bartender is dwarfed by this
newcomer but works around him without apparent concern
fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy

			fedorchuk
	hey henry how you doin tonight
	workin hard

the newcomer turns  his face is humanoid but
disturbingly alien

			fedorchuk
	you got your green card buddy  you
	didnt leave home without it

the cops at the bar crack up  henry looks at fedorchuk 
his eyes carrying no malice or pain  he merely blinks

				    cut to

int ext  slugmobile  street  night

an explosion of color and movement as opening titles play
very quickly  were traveling the streets in a nd
sedan getting moving glimpses of the aliens living among
us now

 a coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables

 a newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of
books

 a city park where a number of alien families have
gathered to play some arcane alien game

			sykes
	jeez they call that gangbang a
	game

 a billboard for pepsi featuring an alien

 the sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light
suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to sykes
head and alien hand  sykes jumps  its a newcomer
derelict standing there weaving mumbling in his own
language  in one filthy hand holds a quart carton of
milk  we know immediately what he wants  sykes rolls
down the window

			sykes
	take a hike

sykes gets a whiff of the derelicts breath as the light
changes and the sedan pulls away leaving him in the
street  sykes grimaces at the smell

			sykes
	whys it have to be sour milk that
	these guys get wasted on  what the
	hells wrong with jack daniels or
	thunderbird for chrissakes
		   beat disgusted
	slagtown  shit

 aliens hanging around outside their homes

 alien hookers plying their trade

			sykes
	hope their plumbings the same

			tuggle
	it is
		   and sykes gives him
		    a look

 a newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slugmobile

 an alien couple exit a theater playing terminator
iii

 an alien wig shop

angle

titles end and we start to pull back into the slugmobile
and hear

			tuggle os
	so you gonna go or you not gonna
	go


int  slugmobile  night

the dashboard is littered with fastfood detritus and two
coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the
windshield  a hand picks up one of the coffees and we
follow it to a face a fortyyearold cop face thats seen
some wear and tear  behind the wheel is matt sykes
beside him is his partner of nine years bill tuggle
tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks

			sykes
	how can i go

			tuggle
	put on your washandwear suit and
	your clipon tie have your landlady
	tie your shoes for you and show up
	at the church  simple
		   beat
	me and carol are going

			sykes
	what

			tuggle
	hey look  weve known kristin
	since since she was conceived in
	that cabin up in big bear
	remember  you and edie banged the
	wall so hard me and carol were
	picking plaster out of our hair for
	a week

			sykes
	goddammit tug  i want to see
	kristin get married okay  but

			tuggle
	but youre bummed because your ex
	and her new husband are paying for
	the whole thing

			sykes
	shit if kristin had to get married
	where i could afford it wed be
	holding the reception at buddys
	burgers

sykes stares out the window wallowing in his pissedoff
mood  then he spots something that twinges his streetcop
radar

			sykes
	uhoh check it out

through the window tuggle sees what sykes sees two aliens
in long coats moving down the sidewalk entering a mom
andpop minimart on the corner  one of them wears dark
glasses and a red bandana kipling the other has on a
black vinyl raincoat

			sykes
	does that look at all suspicious to
	you

			tuggle
	whatever gave you that idea


ext  street  night

sykes continues up a quarter of a block pulls to the curb
among other parked cars


int  sedan  night

sykes is already pulling his gun  tuggle quickly reaches
for the radio in the glovebox

			tuggle
	this is onehenryseven weve got a
	possible twoeleven in progress at
	porters minimart corner of court
	and alvarado  requesting backup

impulsive sykes is already opening his door and climbing
out

			sykes
	lets do it partner

tuggle drops the radio mike and follows sykes as the radio
dispatcher confirms the call


ext  street  night

the two cops guns in hand move along the row of parked
cars across the street from the minimart  through the
store window they see the old alien proprietor behind the
counter  his eyes go wide as kipling whips back his coat
and yanks out a short combat pumpshotgun and aims it
right at him  the raincoat alien pulls an identical gun
and covers the door

sykes and tuggle react to the firepower inside

			sykes
	you got your vest

			tuggle
	of course  right in the trunk of
	the car

			sykes
	yeah thats comforting  mine too

through the store window the robbery continues in
pantomime  kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun
yelling orders in the alien language  the proprietor is
quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register
the proprietors wife a middleaged alien woman stands
in the doorway from the back frozen in fear  the
raincoat alien dances from foot to foot antsy wired

sykes and tuggle crouch at the car directly across the
street from the store entrance

			tuggle
	watch the driver  im going for a
	better angle on the door

			sykes
	i got him  dont get pinned

tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car runs cater
corner across the intersection

through the store window sykes sees kipling grab the bag
of cash shove it in his coat pocket  bills fall out but
he doesnt care  then without warning kipling whips up
the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the proprietors
chest  the proprietor slams back against the shelves
slides to the floor  kipling leans over the counter and
fires another round into the proprietor

			sykes
		   under his breath
	aw shit

tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the
shots

the human driver of the getaway car parked at the curb a
few doors down from the minimart glances up spots
tuggle  he leans on the horn reaches for a machine
pistol on the seat next to him


int  minimart  night

kipling and raincoat alien react to the horn honk  they
spot tuggle through the store window and open fire 
blasting through the glass

a civilian car enters the intersection  the engine is hit
by shotgun fire and the car skids to a stop in the
intersection steam rising from the radiator


ext  street  night

tuggle dives behind a lamp post

the driver is out of the car now brings up the machine
pistol to fire at tuggle  sykes sees this and opens fire
at the driver  the driver turns and fires at sykes
sykes ducks down and the car hes hiding behind is
sprayed with bullets

a fortyfoot moving van pulls down the street between
sykes and the driver  once the truck is past sykes is
standing behind the bulletriddled car gun ready  he
rapidfires  creaming the human driver

tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the
shotgun fire from kipling and raincoat alien

			sykes
	get outta there

			tuggle
	i cant  do you mind

			sykes
	ill cover you  get outta there

sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway
car firing toward the store as he goes

kipling and raincoat dodge behind cover

tuggle seizes the opportunity jumps from behind the lamp
post and runs to the stalled civilian car  he slides
across the hood and drops behind the car for cover
tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car
window  his gaze is met by the face of the old man driver
who is still inside the car

			old man
	can i get out now

			tuggle
	move it

sykes doesnt have a clear firing line on the aliens in
the store  as he considers his next move

tuggle fires at the two aliens  they return fire and he
slides down to safety behind the car  or so he thinks
glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by
the shotgun blasts  he flinches as another blast hits the
car  he looks over  theres a big exit hole in the
fender beside him  the shot went right through the car
another exit hole is blasted inches from his shoulder

panicked he scrambles along the side of the car  blasts
and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of
the car  he has nowhere left to go and

 a blast comes through the car and catches him squarely
in the chest throwing him back onto the street

sykes head jerks around  in time to see his partner of
nine years blown away

kipling keeps firing in tuggles direction until his
shotgun clicks empty


int  minimart  night

kipling grabs raincoat and throws him toward the back exit
of the store  the shotgun falls from raincoats hands
the two of them run out the back


ext  street  night

sykes runs to tuggles spreadeagled body  one glance is
enough  nobody ever looked deader

			sykes
	aw shit tug jesus  goddamn it

he stares shocked and incredulous  he cant find a way
to think or feel about this  then we see him going crazy
right before our eyes the rage revving  he takes off
toward the store as sirens are heard rapidly approaching
in background


int  minimart  night

sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken
glass bangs through the exit


ext  alley  night

sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round
the corner at the far end of the alley  he takes off
quickly cranking up to full speed


ext  back street  night

sykes rounds the corner  doesnt see them anymore  he
slows moves along this street with some caution  lots
of shadows lots of hiding places  sykes hears a noise
looks up just in time to see raincoat on a high huge
billboard  he cuts loose with the shotgun  sykes dives
huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the
night  sykes on his belly scrambles deeper among the
crates

raincoats shotgun clicks empty now  he drops it swings
down off the fire escape runs off

sykes is up again in a flash pounding after him


ext  tunnel street  night

sykes rounds this second corner races down the street
the only route they couldve taken is through a tunnel up
ahead  sykes approaches the tunnel all senses wide open


int  tunnel  night

the murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves
through the mouth  he tries to control his breathing so
he can hear  the only sound is his own shoes scuffing
along the asphalt

then he hears  another set of footsteps  rapid
footsteps coming toward him echoing  he cant tell from
which direction  he spins just as a large shape lunges
for him with an alien cry

its the wired raincoat alien  sykes gets his gun up just
in time and fires  once twice three times  raincoat
alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the
blasts  sykes approaches the body slowly  with an
inhuman roar the alien snaps forward lunging at sykes
with outstretched arms  sykes jumps back startled and
fires twice more at the pale figure  raincoat goes down
and stays down

sykes relaxes for the briefest moment  then he hears
it a distinctive clicking sound metal on metal  sykes
looks up and  kipling drops down on him from directly
above  sykes goes down in a heap  hes managed to hold
onto the gun and as kipling comes for him he swings the
gun hand around  kipling sees it lashes out slamming
the gun from sykes hand  sykes tries to get to his feet
but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel

a siren is heard approaching in background

kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace  as he
draws near sykes hears that distinctive clicking sound
again

sykes pov

though his vision is blurred sykes still gets a good look
at an exotic silver bracelet on the aliens wrist  the
strands of this bracelet are what make the clinking noise

angle

the alien rears back and as he does the approaching
siren suddenly wails louder as a backup patrol car swings
onto the street heading this way  kipling sees this and
leaves sykes running off down the dark tunnel

on sykes

dazed struggling to rise  we hear running footsteps
approaching  sykes turns his eyes wild and unfocused

sykes pov

an outoffocus alien face looming over him

angle

sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his
weight on it pistoning his fist straight into the alien
face  the alien caught by surprise and off balance
sprawls backward out of frame  sykes is grabbed by a
human uniformed cop as he tries to swing again

			human cop
	whoa whoa hold it  take it easy
		   to alien on the
		    ground
	you okay

sykes stops struggling and his eyes focus  he looks at
the alien he just decked sprawled on his ass ten feet
away  the alien is a uniformed cop his name is jetson

			jetson
	i am all right

he gets up  a trickle of purple blood runs from his nose

			human cop
	i better call in

he moves off  jetson moves toward sykes and the raincoat
aliens body  sykes tenses thinking jetson might
retaliate in some way  but jetson simply steps past him
to kneel beside the dead alien  he checks for a pulse on
the underside of the dead aliens upper arm  nothing
sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain  he
struggles to rise  jetson gets an arm around him to help
him up

			jetson
	your hand will require attention

sykes roughly jerks himself free of jetsons grip

			sykes
	get the hell away from me  i dont
	need your goddamn help

he almost loses his balance and has to steady himself
against the tunnel wall  sykes leans there the picture
of impotent rage and frustration  jetson looks at him
with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit
when trying to understand human nature


ext  minimart  night

open on tuggles body as the body bag is zipped up over
his face and the litter is lifted into the back of the
coroners wagon

widen to reveal sykes standing nearby watching  the
wagon pulls out and sykes turns moving past all the lapd
blackandwhites and forensics wagons and cops two of
them aliens and detectives and rubberneckers some
alien  he moves into


int  minimart  night

the crime scene team is checking for prints digging slugs
out of the wall photographing everything  several
uniformed cops mill around  sykes moves aimlessly around
the room like a stranger at a party

the proprietors wife stands near the body in a strange
rigid posture a thin mournful keening sound coming from
her lips  a harried female uniformed cop is trying to get
her away from the body but cant get her to budge

minkler a ballistics guy is tagging the pumpshotgun the
raincoat alien dropped here  natuzzi a meanlooking
veteran uniform cop is with him

			natuzzi
	looks like a standard combat pump
	action

			minkler
	it is

			natuzzi
	so what punched holes clear through
	that car out there

minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box
inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells

			minkler
	bri sabot slugs  these puppies are
	nasty  two plastic sabots fall away
	in flight leaving a fiftycaliber
	slug going two thousand feet per
	second  tug might as wellve been
	hiding behind a rosebush

minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him
he looks  its sykes

			natuzzi
	pretty heavy artillery for knocking
	over a liquor store

a new voice enters the conversation

			jetson os
	an identical round was used in the
	shooting of a newcomer named
	hubley two days ago

sykes turns  surprised and not especially pleased to
see the voice is jetsons

			minkler
	yeah  so why the extra fire power

			jetson
	perhaps because even the larger
	caliber handguns arent always
	effective against my people

			sykes
		   mulls this then
	you saying theres some connection
	to this other homicide

before jetson can say the female cop who was talking to
the proprietors wife steps up

			female cop
	hey give me a hand with this woman
	will ya jetson  weve got to get
	her to division for her statement
	and she wont budge

			jetson
		   to sykes
	excuse me

and he moves off with his partner  sykes calls after him
but jetson is already approaching the woman and doesnt
turn

			sykes
	so you think theres a connection
	or what  hey

				    cut to

ext  sykes apartment building  night

the slugmobile pulls up  a drained sykes moves up the
walk to his front door


int  sykes apartment  night

sykes enters his apartment an untidy bachelor place
decorated with negative taste  its obviously the maids
decade off

by rote he hits the rewind switch on the answering
machine on his way into the kitchen  the tape rewinds
he opens the fridge  not much here  leftover takeout
pizza carton  leftover takeout chinese food cartons
leftover takeout burger wrappers 

the answering machine message begins  he glances over
his shoulder as he hears his daughters voice  during the
following he reaches the fridge  brings out a milk
carton thats in his way sets it on the counter  reaches
in again and this time brings out a bottle of stoly  then
searches for a semiclean glass

			kristins voice

the machine beeps and hisses  sykes take the glass and
the bottle of vodka crosses back toward the living room
switching off the answering machine as he goes

then he stops turns back takes the message tape out of
the machine and tosses it into a drawer

				    fade to

int  detective squad room  day

continued grumbling from the detectives  sykes standing
to one side absently watches warner return to his glass
walled office  waiting inside are a balding man and an
alien in a grey suit  sykes reacts  the alien in the

sykes grimaces at the mention of newcomer housing

			sykes
	terrific  a real pillar of the
	community
		   beat
	was hubley missing anything when
	they found him  was he ripped off

			jetson
		   checks file
	there was no wallet but he was
	still wearing a watch and two rings

			sykes
	the guys at the minimart last night
	made a halfassed stab at the money
	in the till  but i dont think
	thats what they were there for  i
	think we got us a couplea
	executions on our hands george

			jetson
	the murder at the minimart is not
	our case  the captain said

sykes looks over at jetson pissed

			sykes
	look you want to fit in here
	right  you want to learn how to get
	along

			jetson
	yes

			sykes
	well theres a thing about
	partners about being somebodys
	partner  you do for each other
	and other peoples rules dont mean
	shit  its the rules set up between
	the two of you thats all that
	counts  understand
		   jetson nods
	okay  well my friend and partner
	was shot last night and im after
	the shitbag that did it  as my
	partner im asking you to respect
	me and help me find him

jetson considers this several moments then

			jetson
	and as my partner i ask you to
	respect me and my desire not to
	break with procedure

sykes stares at him exasperated  without warning he
slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy
traffic puts it in park jetson who is already a
little too close to the dashboard bangs up against it
horns instantly go crazy behind them

			jetson
	what is wrong

			sykes
		   very calm
	nothings wrong  i just want to get
	something straight  you agree that
	theres a good chance these two
	shootings are somehow related
	right

yelling joins the horns outside  jetson is visibly
unsettled by the chaos

			jetson
	well yes quite possibly

			sykes
	possibly  good  well would you be
	willing to accept the theory
	george that possibly by
	examining the evidence from one case
	we might shed some small ray of
	light on the other  does that sound
	unreasonable to you

			jetson
	yes no it is not unreasonable
	although i

			sykes
	great
		   a relieved sigh
	well im sure glad thats settled
	arent you

and with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly
out

			sykes
	i think were really starting to
	click now george  hmmm

jetson doesnt know what to think  he just holds on

int  hallway  la county morgue  day

winter a deputy medical examiner human is leading
sykes and jetson along the hall  he reads on the fly from
a case file in his hand

	come on  you got nothin better to
	do cushy county job like yours

they enter briskly through a swinging door  they move
among the tables some occupied some not during

	yeah right  dont push your luck
	anyway according to the sheet the
	guy you nailed outside by the car

			sykes
	the human

			winter
	yeah he was one martin helder

	robbery conviction a couple for
	sale of a controlled substance
	oh yeah and he was wired on coke
	when you stopped his clock

they have reached a table holding a covered body  winter
unceremoniously throws back the cover  there lies the
pale naked body of the raincoat alien

			jetson
	have you identified this one

			winter
	so far hes a john doe  or a sam
	slag if you like

jetson smiles slightly out of politeness

			winter
	no id on him and  well you
	know no fingerprints  so it could
	be tough  your buddies this morning
	went through the mug book but
	couldnt make a facial match

			sykes
	fedorchuk couldnt find his ass with
	his hands in his back pockets

jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while winter
and sykes continue talking off to one side

			winter
		   referring to
		    raincoat alien
	you took this gut out too didnt
	you

			sykes
	yeah

			winter
	lucky for you you got him in both
	of his well what we loosely
	refer to as hearts

			sykes
	lucky nothing  i had to empty my
	damn gun into him

			winter
	thats the way these people are
	you dont hit both pumps you just
	piss them off

during this jetson has turned the dead aliens hand over
 sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his
face  he leans closer examining the palm carefully
then he peels back the aliens upper lip

jetson frowns anew with concern this time  he looks
around spots a newcomer lab assistant nearby  bentner
jetson motions him over  jetson begins questioning him
using the alien language  sykes and winter nearby remain
oblivious

			winter
	oh heres an extra headshot if you
	need one
		   hands sykes a
		    polariod of dead
		    aliens face
	were just about to start cutting
	in  youre welcome to stick around
	if you want  its really
	fascinating stuff

			sykes
	yeah ill bet

sykes looks over now noticing jetson and bentner in
earnest conversation  he only catches snatches of the
alien language  bentner appears very unsettled by what
jetson is telling him  in response to jetsons final
statement bentner nods  as if agreeing to do something
jetson has requested  sykes goes over to jetson

			sykes
	whats this  whats going on

			jetson
	nothing

			sykes
		   really suspicious
		    now
	nothing

jetson moves off leaving sykes there wondering

int  property room  county morgue  day

two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents
onto a formica counter  sykes looks through the dead
aliens effects while jetson goes through the humans
ortiz the college girl working the property counter sits
nearby doing homework

jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown

			jetson
	what is this

			sykes
		   looks then
	a rubber  a condom  you know
	coney island whitefish

	get the picture

			jetson
		   frowning
	and that fits

			sykes
	well yeah its rubber  it
	stretches

	and still it fits

sykes looks at jetsons serious expression  he tosses the
condom and packet back into the counter and continues
searching  a beat then he cant stop himself  he
steals a glance at jetsons crotch

still searching sykes picks up one of the dead aliens
wellworn heavy work boots  he grimaces the sides and
soles are painted with a viscous black substance  he very
tentatively sniffs it and is grateful that its not
what he thought it might be

			sykes
	what is this stuff

sykes gets some on his hands doesnt know where to wipe
it  jetson glances over

			jetson
	it is a resin

sykes looks at him surprised that he knows

newcomer workers move in and out through the door during

he honks the horn  jetson looks up then moves to his
wife and kisses her goodbye  moves to his son kisses him
on the top of his head

sykes watches all this and as he does slowly his
derisive expression softens  as corny as this tableau may
be theres something very appealing about the innocence
of it even to an unrepentant cynic like sykes

close on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug
dispensers from a tuxedo pocket  as the hand brings the
dispenser toward the face we immediately recognize the
exotic silver bracelet worn by kipling the night before
it makes that distinctive clinking noise  we pan with the
hand to reveal kiplings face sans bandana and
sunglasses now  he wears a black tuxedo  he lets a small
dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his
tongue  he swallows and reacts as the rush from the
drug hits him

	the founder of the first newcomer
	owned and operated corporation in
	southern california he certainly
	has come quite far in the last few
	years  granted not as far as he
	came in the years before reaching
	los angeles

there is laughter from the vips  kipling slides into a
seat at one of the front tables  he leans over and
whispers something into the ear of the person seated to
his right  we see this close up and dont see who he is
whispering to yet  whoever it is nods

			mayor
		   continuing
	as mayor of this city it gives me
	great pleasure to introduce someone
	who has so readily made our city
	his home and all of us who live
	here his friends  ladies and
	gentlemen william harcourt

the vips applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front
table  at first it hits kipling then it adjusts to
capture william harcourt seated to kiplings right
harcourt is an exemplar of the successful newcomer
entrepreneur handsome charming with cool blue eyes
that glint with his piercing intellect  he rises smiling
warmly steps past his striking alien date seated to his
right to make his way to the podium  he shields his eyes
somewhat from the bright spotlight

once behind the podium he slips his notes from a breast
pocket as the applause ebbs

			harcourt
	thank you all for that very warm
	reception
		   pauses smiles
	im particularly grateful because i
	actually had the gall to write that
	in my notes thank you all for that

sykes and jetson walk into the almost total blackness of
this allnewcomer place

a few nearinfrared indigo lamps dot the blackness

			sykes
	i cant see dick in here

we can dimly make out booths along one wall some tables
and the bar  there are maybe twenty figures seated or
standing in the darkness  the room falls silent in a wave
as sykes presence becomes noticed

sykes saunters forward commanding the space with his
unhurried movements

			sykes
		   calling into the
		    dark silence
	which onea you slags is porter

		   from the back of
		    the bar
	who wants to know

sykes squints into the darkness then

			sykes
		   aside to jetson
	who said that

			jetson
		   tilts his head to
		    indicate
	at the end of the bar

sykes nods starts in that direction

			sykes
	my name is sykes  im

			alien voice
	ssai kss

the whole place roars with laughter  too late sykes
remembers what his name sounds like to them  he continues
down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his
leg out and trips sykes with his size 16 work boot  sykes
stumbles then recovers and pivots on the offender  hoots
and derisive laughter  he sees only shadows

			offender
		   merely a voice in
		    the dark
	careful ssloka you might hurt
	yourself

more laughter  sykes gives the darkness where the
offender sits a hard stare then turns and shoulders his
way to the end of the bar  jetson follows  sykes stops
behind a big newcomer in greasy work clothes

angle

the punk newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head
down trying to be inconspicuous

he glances over at the two cops his expression shifting
to recognition as he spots jetson

back to scene

sykes speaks to the big newcomers back

			sykes
	you porter

the big newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk
doesnt turn  sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns
him around  the alien grabs sykes hand off rising to
his full height  he and sykes lock eyes  meanwhile  the
punk newcomer porter has started to slip away unnoticed
jetson spots him reaches out with one arm and grabs him
by the jacket

			jetson
	no matthew  i believe this is the
	one you want

he pulls porter back into play  now jetson sees porters
face and he too reacts with recognition

sykes gives jetson a sour look releases the big newcomer
and turns his malice on the punk newcomer

			sykes
	your name wouldnt happen to be
	porter would it

			jetson
	uh matthew

			sykes
		   over his shoulder
		    to jetson
	back off george

			jetson
	but i know this man

			sykes

jetson backs off letting him handle it

			sykes
		   to porter
	jesus are the questions too tough
	for you already  lets try again
		   slowly

			porter

	seem to be getting much cooperation
	from you porter  so i guess were
	gonna have to take this little
	session down to my office ya

and instantly sykes whips out this flashlight snaps on
the beam and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around
him  jetson gets a blast of it too  the aliens are
momentarily blinded

sykes has porter pinned to the bar the flashlight in his
face as he starts to handcuff him  but porter gets a
hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight
darkness falls along with sykes expression of
satisfaction

porter hurls sykes back slamming him into a table  the
crowd hoots and cheers  sykes finds his way to his feet

			jetson
	matthew you dont have to do this

			sykes
	stay back  im okay

he charges porter brandishing the flashlight like a club
the two of them battle then sykes sees his opportunity
and brings his knee up viciously into the aliens groin
porter doubles over in feigned agony then slowly rises
again  smiling

			porter
	dont they teach you anything about
	us in cop school little ssloka

porter grabs sykes by the shirt front is about to deliver
a crushing blow when another arm cuts into frame locking
with porters blocking the punch  it is jetson

			jetson
	enough

			porter
		   eyeing jetson
	sstangya tssorentsa  youre a

jetson says something to him in the alien language
porter gives him a hard stare then moves toward the back
exit  sykes stumbles over to jetson

			sykes
	you know that guy

			jetson
		   nods
	from quarantine when my people

			jetson
	in the camps we were lodged four to

well


int  encounters  night

an upscale mostly yuppiehuman dance club  the
antithesis of the x bar  a human hostess in a slit
dress has just finished seating sykes and jetson at a
table  she moves off  the two cops look up at the stage

reverse angle

revealing the exotic alien dancer named cassandra  she
moves with a feline blend of strength and grace  framing
her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a
mane as she undulates to the music

sykes watches with fascination  the music ends and
cassandra steps down from the stage to be replaced by a
human dancer as the next song cranks up  sykes and jetson
quickly intercept her as she heads backstage

			jetson
	you are cassandra

			cassandra
	thats right

			jetson

assuming they will follow


int  backstage  night

she moves along the narrow corridor

	oooh  hardball  that sounds

			cassandra
	youve got me all wrong  i dont

	myself find pleasurable

finally jetson gets what sykes is trying to tell him  he
says in the uncertain stagy voice of a bad liar

			jetson
	i am going out to the car  i will
	meet you there

sykes rolls his eyes as jetson exits into the corridor
cassandra emerges from the stall wearing a long stylish
lowcut dress

			cassandra
	look i dont know where mr
	strader might be  he comes and he
	goes

			sykes
		   starting to feel a
		    little uncomfortable

	straders assistant somebody named
	watson  maybe he knows

			cassandra
		   tensing slightly
	todd  todd doesnt know either

she is very close to sykes now  she fingers the lapel of
his jacket

corridor scoping things out  he tries a door  locked
tries another one  open  he eases it wider then enters
the darkened office


int  office  second floor  night

jetson moves into the office  looks around  makes his
way to the cluttered desk top  pushes things around
all the usual stuff  he starts to turn away then his eye
catches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger
books  he reaches for it  a small dispenser  of the
kind we saw being filled at the refinery  jetson studies
it his suspicions growing  opening it he finds only the
barest trace of a viscous substance

he smells it not enough to tell for certain what it is
but enough that he is very concerned about what it could
be


int  cassandras dressing room  night

cassandra is practically melting herself into sykes now
she takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her
facial ridges  she shudders with pleasure  sykes begins
to perspire

			sykes
	theres lots of things i havent
	done but his aint high on the
	list  dont take it personally

			cassandra
	i think youre just a little scared
	now about what you might find once
	the lights go out  a little
	scared and a lot curious  maybe
	more than you want to admit  but
	doesnt that turn you on that
	curiosity and fear swirling
	together
		   coos
	think of it as broadening your
	horizons

			sykes
	i like my horizons narrow

			cassandra
		   pressing herself
		    into him
	your voice is saying no but your
	body is saying yes

he quickly disengages from her

			sykes
	my voice body and everything else
	is saying ill be back in two hours
	for strader and he better damn well
	be here

he shoves a business card at her then retreats through
the door


int  corridor  night

sykes closes the door and lets out his breath


int  cassandras dressing room  night

cassandras expression instantly turns to worry and she
quickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom
button


int  office  second floor  night

jetson looking through a desk drawer hears the intercom
buzz in the next room  through the wall

			watson os
		   tentatively
	yes

			cassandra os
		   over the intercom
		    breathless
	todd its me  the police were just

	asking about you

jetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office
drawing his gun  the floor squeaks beneath his feet  he
looks down then continues toward the door


int  office  second floor  night

jetson eases open the door  its the managers private
office  jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the
desk the desk lamp on a lit cigarette in an ashtray 
but no one behind the desk  jetson eases through the door
and

 a chair crashes down on him from behind the door
jetson goes down his gun skittering out of his hand

hard  hes a newcomer in a snappy armani suit  this is
todd watson  jetson on the floor starts to rise

suddenly somebody flies at sykes from the side knocking
him sideways down the corridor  its cassandra  watson
seizes the moment and shoves the offbalance jetson into
some furniture and dives for the door


int  second floor corridor  night

watson runs down the corridor ducking onto a fire escape
meanwhile sykes wrestles with cassandra  shes as strong
as he is but he has the edge in experience

jetson disheveled appears in the private office doorway
ready to chase watson but not knowing which way he went

			sykes
		   struggling with
		    cassandra
	fire escape  end of the hall

jetson nods takes off down the corridor  sykes manges to
get one handcuff on cassandras wrist the other cuff
around a pipe sticking out of the wall  she screeches at
him in the alien language as he collects the casull and
charges down the corridor


ext  fire escape  outside encounters  night

jetson pounds down the fire escape  below him he sees
watson reach the ground and take off running for the
parking area

jetson reaches the ground and gives chase


ext  encounters parking lot  night

watson zigzags through the parked cars jetson cutting
down other rows trying to make up the distance between
them

gun aimed  but he hesitates to shoot  in that split
second hesitation watson floors it jetson jumping to
avoid being hit


int  alfa romeo  night

watson throws the car into drive looks up and sees sykes
standing right in front of the car  he hits the gas
sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car
watson with sykes face on the other side of the glass
panics and


ext  encounters parking lot  night

 plows the alfa into some parked cars

sykes is up in a flash  yanks watson out of the car

watson rears back to swing at sykes when sykes swings his
arms around in two wide arcs his fists landing two direct
hits in the nerve centers under watsons arms  watson
folds over with a ooowwph sound and drops to his knees

			sykes
		   breathing hard
	ill be damned  it worked
		   sees jetson run up
	howd you like that huh  whammo
	both barrels  dropped him like a
	bag of cement

jetson picks up watsons fallen wallet  he looks at the
id

			sykes
	who is he

			jetson
	todd watson  the assistant manager

watson is still doubled over just trying to draw one
agonized breath

			watson
	i dont believe this  look at my
	suit  look at what you made me do
	to my car

			sykes
		   laughing
	your girlfriend put up a better
	fight than you did pal

			sykes
		   to jetson

			sykes
	through his ass
		   to watson
	next time you see him tell him to
	call me unless you want us to
	keep coming back on you like a bad
	case of herpes

sykes shoves a business card in watsons breast pocket
they walk away and watson slumps against his car

angle  moving with sykes and jetson

as they walk wearily to the slugmobile

	george you can handle the women

ext  encounters parking lot  night

watson is alone surveying the damage to his alfa when he
hears footsteps  he turns with a what now expression
and  a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead  he
goes down  kipling stands over him flanked by four human
thugs  one of these is quint senior human in harcourts

ext  zuma beach approach  night

harcourts private limo glides down the narrow access
road passing a lookout car attended by two alien thugs
the limo moves down to the beach parking near an nd
van

harcourt exits the limo walks onto the sand to the back
of the van  here he finds kipling and quint and the three
human thugs

they have watson chained to the vans rear bumper facing
the sea and have been working him over with a tire iron
hes bruised and bloody but still conscious

			harcourt
	any progress

			kipling
	it is something you couldnt
	comprehend quint

harcourt approaches watson kneels beside him careful to
keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand

			harcourt
	i understand you have been resisting
	my offer mr watson  your sense of
	duty to mr strader is noble but 
	no longer an issue im afraid

harcourt signals and the two thugs drag an alien body from
the back if the van a middleaged alien strader shot
twice through the front of his silk suit  watsons eyes
widen in fear

			harcourt
		   continuing
	i will not make this offer again  i
	want you to work for me to manage
	the nightclub as straders successor
	if you do you will know a wealth
	and comfort our people never dared
	imagine

watson stares at harcourt scared but defiant

			watson
	ssska ta

harcourt studies watson a moment perhaps even admiring
his resolve  then

			harcourt
	it is such a pity to die for an
	outmoded value
		   rising
	mr quint i believe its time for
	our friends swimming lesson

watson freaks out howling and lashing against the chains

			harcourt
		   to watson
	its important to learn new skills
	essential to your growth as a
	person

quint and the thugs free watson from the bumper  he bucks
and lunges as they drag him toward the surf  quint
addresses one of the thugs a new guy

			quint
	you never seen this before have
	you billy  oh man you aint
	gonna believe it seawater is like
	battery acid to these guys i
	dont know what it is some kinds
	chemical reaction  whatta you think

		   a wave breaks
		    outside the foam
		    rolls in
	what i love about the surf is you
	can never tell how far up its going
	to come until it whoops got a
	little wet there

the wave just sloshes over watsons lower legs  he
screams  flailing one of his hands dips below the
surface of the water  he howls and yanks out his hand
we see the alien hand dripping seawater then a thousand
droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the
hand  the thugs get watson swinging

			quint
	last call sucker  one two
	three

watson is flung into the surf

angle

harcourt and kipling have walked down almost to the
waterline  we hear watsons gurgles and screams then
nothing  kipling is very nervous this close to the water
harcourt seems unperturbed

			kipling
	when we picked him up he was
	talking to those two cops  the two
	who came to question you about
	hubley

			harcourt
	this is getting out of hand  i want
	you to deal with it  immediately

a wave rushes up the sand  kipling quickly steps back
harcourt stands firm staring it down and the foam stops
six inches from his dress shoes

			harcourt
		   continuing
	we must learn to embrace the things
	we fear and from that grow
	strong

a moment then he turns and starts back toward the limo
he motions to straders body and the surf  the thugs grab
the body and heave it into the waves

int  sykes apartment  night

jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the
kitchen wall phone  sykes foreground takes the bottle
of vodka from the refrigerator throws some ice in a
glass pours himself a shot  as jetson is talking he
spots the carton of milk that sykes inadvertently left out
of the refrigerator two nights ago

he sniffs it his eyebrows do an involuntary movement
he finishes with his wife and hangs up  he watches sykes
take a long pull on the vodka

			jetson
		   holds up milk
		    carton
	would you mind

sykes shrugs tosses him a glass  jetson pours the semi
lumpy milk and takes a big swallow  sykes grimaces
then

			sykes
		   indicates phone
	so she keeps you on a pretty short
	leash does she

			jetson
	my wife  she worries about me

sykes leans against the counter getting comfortable his
voice more weary then bitter

			sykes
	yeah i know the routine

			jetson
	you are married

			sykes
	was  divorced

			jetson
	we mate for life  divorce is a
	strange concept to us

			sykes
	its like having an eleventh finger
	removed  it hurts like hell but
	you never really needed the damn
	thing in the first place

jetson nods  even though he doesnt really understand
this  they drink jetson gazes around

			jetson
	your home is quite disordered  i
	thought perhaps you had been
	burglarized when i walked in

			sykes
		   growling
	i appreciate your honesty george

he smacks his glass against jetsons  they drink


int  sykes apartment  later

sykes has his wallet out showing jetson a dogeared

			sykes
		   uneasy

jetson looks at him  sees something he never thought
possible in sykes  vulnerability  trying to break the
melancholy mood jetson reaches for his wallet

			jetson
		   upbeat
	i must show you
		   flips open wallet
		    shows four crisp
		    photos of his wife
	and this is richard  my son  hes
	four years old  we named him after
	the former president richard nixon

sykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table
and has to laugh  he looks up at jetsons sincere face
he may be starting to like this guy

			sykes
	you open to a piece of advice  tell
	people you named him after richard
	burton the actor  just take my
	word for it

and he clacks his glass against jetsons sitting on the
table and


int  sykes apartment  later

they are quite a bit drunker  jetson has doffed his
jacket and tie leans in listening intently to sykes

			sykes
	 and so and so the doctor says
	if this is the thermometer then
	whered i leave the pen
		   laughs raucously
		    jetson doesnt
		    react
	youre not you dont think thats

jetson shrugs apologetically  sykes pours them each
another round

			sykes
		   continuing
	your health

			jetson
	ta sstrakyona

they clack glasses and


int  sykes apartment  later still

the party has moves into the living room floor around the
coffee table  its a quieter moment

			jetson
	there is so much our two peoples
	dont understand about each other

			sykes
	no shit holmes  youre only from
	another goddamn planet for
	chrissakes

			jetson
	you humans are very curious to us
	you invite us to live among you in
	an atmosphere of equality weve
	never known before  you lay before
	us a beautiful green world full of
	freedoms and opportunities you
	give us ownership of our lives for
	the first time and you ask no
	more of us than you do of
	yourselves to live by the rules
	rules that arent made to keep one
	people subordinate to another but
	rules that exist to preserve
	equality  you aspire to very high
	ideals here

sykes is watching jetson mesmerized  the guys never
said this much at one time before

if he wasnt drunk jetson would never let himself open up
to a human like this

			jetson
		   continuing
	i hope you can understand how
	special your world is how unique
	a people you humans are  so it us
	all the more painful and confusing
	to us that so few of you seem
	capable of living up the the ideals
	you set for yourselves

			sykes
	dont count on me george  i never
	had any ideals

jetson smiles a little  he knows thats bullshit

			jetson
	we dont understand the hatred the
	contempt  but we must bear it we
	must not react in anger because
	our situation here is still fragile
	the separationists would see us
	returned to the quarantine camps
	the fundamentalists say we have no
	more human rights than dogs or cats
	but the prejudice we face here is so
	insignificant compared to the pain
	that weve known before  and that
	is why we are so grateful

sykes studies him a long time through heavylidded eyes
finally

			sykes
	yeah well except i did hear you
	eat your dead

jetson looks at him a long beat then

			jetson
		   deadpan
	only on fridays

sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then
explodes with laughter

			sykes
	you sonofabitch  youre okay

jetson stands unsteadily and announces

			jetson
	im going home

			sykes
	yeah go home  get some sleep  you
	do sleep dont you

jetson going out the front door just waves over his
shoulder without turning around  hes gone

			sykes
	what a wildman

sykes stands there wobbling then he collapses backward
onto the sofa unconscious  and we match dissolve to


int  sykes apartment  dawn

the first hues of dawn stream through the window  sykes
remains passed out on the sofa where we left him


ext  street  front of sykes building  dawn

the slugmobile parked at the curb  silence then the
rumble of a heavy truck and a tow truck turns onto this
street at the corner

the tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug
mobile  the driver stays inside as his passenger alights
carrying a tool kit and a paper bag  the human is quint

quint uses a slimjim to open the slugmobile door then
slides behind the wheel


int  slugmobile  dawn

quint slides the contents from the paper bag  it is a
packet of c4 plastic explosives with a primer cap and
two lead wires with their ends bared  quint bends down
starts to work under the dash  as his head disappears
from frame suddenly another head appears above the
seats george jetson sitting up groggily in the back
seat  a blanket slips off his head and shoulders  he
sits there blinking rubbing his eyes feeling lousy

under the dash quint starts to whistle as he works
mistake

jetson with a puzzled expression leans forward and sees
this guy in the front seat  before he can jumpstart his
brain quint sits up sees him and hammers him in the
face with his fist  jetson is knocked back holding his
face  that was the last thing he needed


ext  street  front of sykes building  dawn

meanwhile quint is shouting and bailing out of the car
he runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck

it is sliding around the corner out of sight just as
jetson stumbles out of the car  he whips out his gun from
the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand
jetson sags against the side of the car mumbles an alien
phrase clearly the equivalent of fuck it

int  sykes apartment  day

sykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left
him  someone is pounding on the door  he regains
consciousness reluctantly

			sykes
	this better be good news or money

he shambles to the door and gets it open admitting
jetson  jetson holds the c4 charge in a handkerchief
with one hand and gives it to sykes

			jetson
	hold this
		   lurching to the
		    sink
	i feel very terrible

sykes registers what hes holding  he moves to jetson
who is running his head under the tap

open the sealed envelope  the message inside is written

winter shrugs indicates the message jetson reads as if
to say maybe it says in there

	we all did

			sykes
	where did he get it  was there any
	of it on the ship

oneal recognizes sykes and doesnt wait around for the

finger along the inside comes up with some residue of the

mesmerized for several moments his expression that of a
former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so

a beat than jetson explodes  he sweeps a rack of
equipment off the worktable savagely wipes the drug from

the bugeyed oneal to the wall

lasciviously as they brush past  she is about to enter
herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her covering
her mouth pulling her backward away from the door

it is jetson  he had been hiding behind some crates
stacked here in the corridor  he pins cassandra
powerfully to the wall keeping one hand over her mouth
she struggles until she sees who it is

nod toward the office door

int  conference room  night

the large suitcase rests on the expansive conference
table  a manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens
it  inside are fifty onekilo glass tubes full of the
viscous blue drug  also several of the small individual
dispensers  it is harcourt standing behind the table in
a pool of light who has opened the suitcase  he is
flanked by kipling with quint elsewhere in the room
the room is lit by track light creating pools of light
and dark

the two alien dealers eyes widen at the sight of the
drug  the human dealer doesnt know what it is

			harcourt
		   to alien dealers
	its been a long time hasnt it
	gentlemen

			human dealer
	what is it

			harcourt
	a sweet indulgence from out past
	resurrected for our future

harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien
dealers faces smiles knowingly  he slides one of the
dispensers from the suitcase

			harcourt
		   continuing to
		    alien  dealers
	please feel free to sample the
	quality  the experience will be
	everything you remember it to be

one of the alien dealers takes the dispenser brings it to
his tongue  the other alien dealer turns to harcourt

			alien dealer
	whered you get it

			harcourt
	i arranged to spend some time with
	three very resourceful men  with a
	certain amount of coaxing one of
	them was able to reconstitute the
	formula for me
		   beat
	they worked very well together
	unfortunately they are no longer
	with us but i was fortunate
	enough to reap the benefit of their
	endeavor

he indicates the drug  the first alien dealer sways
gently enjoying the sensation  the second alien dealer
takes his hit shudders as the first rush washes over
him  the human dealer is no fool he grabs the
dispenser

			human dealer
	let me try some
		   he does
		    immediately spits
		    it out
	jesus  tastes like detergent

			harcourt
	and thats all the effect it will
	have on you  but when my fellow
	newcomers learn they can obtain it
	here they will work very hard to
	make as much money as they can to
	give it to me

suddenly a voice from the shadows near the open door to
the other office

			voice
	you havent told him all of it

harcourt and the others react  quint leaps to his feet
caught off guard  kipling reaches for his shoulder
holster  a silhouette beside the open door to the outer
office nudges cassandra into the light of the room then
steps out himself  it is jetson

quint gets his gun out is about to aim when his eyes
go wide at the sight of something jetson holds

it is the plastic explosive charge that quint was wiring
to the slugmobile  the wires are connected and jetsons
finger squeezes down hard on the detonation pushswitch

			quint
	hes got the c4 charge

jetson moves forward slowly holding the bomb in front of
him  he is sweating rivers  the others quickly join him
he nudges cassandra ahead of himself keeping her where he
can see her

			quint
		   continuing
	just take it real casual buddy
	keep your finger on that button and
	dont do nothing squirrely

			harcourt
	if you release that button you not
	only kill us but yourself

			jetson
	to get you and that
		   indicates drug in
		    suitcase
	 i would do it

he says it with such straightforward eye contact that
harcourt and we know he isnt bluffing

			jetson
	everyone up against that wall
	very slowly
		   to harcourt
	except you

harcourt remains behind the desk  cassandra stays where
she is near jetson  the others move to the wall
kipling in particular is going nuts letting this happen

jetson takes the sample dispenser from the table tosses
it into the suitcase then closes the lid and locks it
all the while keeping his eye on harcourt and the others

			harcourt
	one small matter seems to have
	escaped your attention  that
		   indicates suitcase
	 is not on any books as a
	controlled substance  legally it
	might as well be fifty kilos of
	grape jelly

			jetson
	the charge is murder and
	conspiracy to commit murder
	hubley porter strader probably

theres a flicker of concern behind harcourts icy blue
eyes

cassandra stares at harcourt

			cassandra
	you you killed strader

cassandra runs to harcourt grabbing his jacket

			cassandra
	wheres todd  did you do something
	to todd

harcourt looks down at her totally uninvolved

			harcourt
	todd  who is todd
		   then remembers
		    smiles
	ah poor mr watson

cassandras eyes go wide as the horror of what he said
sinks in  jetson nudges harcourt with the suitcase  they
start out  cassandra wild with rage grabs quints 357
and with a keening wail brings it up toward harcourts
face

			jetson
	nooo

jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun  he
manages to knock it away just as she fires  the bullet
going into the wall behind harcourt  striking like a
mongoose kipling leaps forward grabbing the two lead
wires on the bomb in jetsons hand and jerking them apart
jetson reacts an instant late releasing the switch
and nothing happens

			kipling
	i got it

kipling tackles jetson and they both go crashing to the
floor  quint grabs the gun from cassandra and hammers her
with it hard  she drops to her knees and quint viciously
hits her again

meanwhile jetson struggles to regain his feet  kipling
rears back and delivers a crushing blow under jetsons arm
 to the nerve plexus  jetson instantly folds over
forward and kipling savagely brings up his knee into
jetsons face flipping him back  kipling slams him into
the wall facefirst pinning him there

			harcourt
	kill them both

			kipling
	here

			harcourt
		   raging
	do it

quint brings the gun up places the muzzle against the
base of cassandras skull starts to squeeze the trigger
theres a loud blam  and cassandra flinches then looks
up

quint is blown backward away from her

sykes stand in the doorway from the private office the
casull smoking in his hand

quint hits the wall behind him  only its not a solid
wall but the huge window overlooking the club  he
crashes through it

angle from dance floor

as the wall of mirror explodes in slow motion and quint
cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds

angle  in the office

kipling shoves jetson aside draws his gun and fires at
sykes

sykes dodges into the private office for cover

the three dealers dive behind any available furniture

harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door
leading into the adjoining outer office

sykes swings around the edge of the private office door
straightarms the casull into the office and fires
kipling fires back crossing toward the outer office door
covering harcourts back  sykes ducks back down

an unsteady jetson rises from the floor sees harcourt and
kipling escaping and takes off after them

sykes straightarms the gun into the room again sees
jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door  he
moves into the room as the three drug dealers arms up in
surrender rise from behind the furniture

			alien dealer
	dont shoot man  were unarmed 
	look

sykes looks at these harmless wimps then at cassandra

			sykes
	you okay

			cassandra

and he charges out the adjoining office door

is ten feet above them  sykes flies out onto the fire
escape a few steps behind jetson  a police car siren is
heard arriving os


ext  alley  behind encounter  night

two uniformed officers bound from their unit and run into
the back entrance of the club leaving the unit running

two seconds later harcourt and kipling leap down from the
fire escape find themselves near the unit

			harcourt
	here

he throws the suitcase into the passenger side door jumps
in  kipling dives in behind the wheel slams it into gear
and floors it

jetson and sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels
out  sykes raises the casull and fires at the fleeing
car  one slug shatters a tail light others pepper the
rear of the trunk but the car keeps going

			jetson
	this way

he indicates the slugmobile parked nearby  they race to
it jump in sykes driving  he burns rubber as he pulls
out

a second arriving police unit pulls into the alley
heading straight for the slugmobile  sykes has to grate
between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get
past


ext  west side street  night

harcourt and kipling in the first police unit come
thundering down the street zigzagging through traffic
the slugmobile is threequarters of a block behind them

inside the blackandwhite

harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and
siren blast on


ext  west side street  night

it looks like a backwards chase the slugmobile chasing
the howling police car through traffic

jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic  calls it
out to sykes the way he was trained at the academy

			jetson
	slow traffic on your right youre
	clear at the left rear
		   sykes changes lanes
	careful red light ahead

with jetsons help sykes is able to dice through the
crosstraffic without incident


ext  west side street  night

the traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response
to the approaching lights and siren  kipling dodges
around the stopped traffic easily

the same traffic that has pulled over for the police car
now starts easing back onto the street cutting off the
slugmobile


int  slugmobile  night

sykes expression tells us hes slipped into the same
juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley

			jetson
	yellow light ahead turning red

but sykes doesnt slow  instead he floors it

			jetson
		   continuing wide
		    eyed
	red light  red light


ext  west side street  night

sykes peels around the merging traffic cuts across the
intersection and continues the chase  on the wrong side
of the road headon into traffic

headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along
the wrong side  they eventually catch up to the police
unit racing parallel to it but with the divider between
them

sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the casull
with the other  he brings it up and around right in front
of jetsons nose pointing it through the passenger window
at kipling

at that moment kipling glances over and reacts to the
bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser

jetson reacts to the gun in his face then reacts to
something else he sees beyond it

			jetson
	green light matthew
		   sykes doesnt
		    respond
	green light

now sykes looks  the light at the intersection has just
turned green  and the rows of the cars that were waiting
start coming  its a wall of headlights coming right for
the slugmobile

			sykes
	shit

			jetson
	ssai


ext  west side street  night

sykes locks up the brakes  kipling veers around a couple
of cars and speeds away

because of the other traffic sykes has only one course of
action  he skids a left onto a side street


ext  side street  night

sykes burns rubber down this quieter street squeals a
right onto another street that parallels the street the
police unit is on  at the first street available he cuts
back in behind the police unit


ext  first street overpass  night

sykes car tears along below the overpass  with the
police unit directly above them  an onramp approaches
for the slugmobile and sykes floors it


int  blackandwhite  night

harcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug
mobile airborne as it flies from the onramp landing a
few feet behind the blackandwhites bumper


ext  first street overpass  night

with the slugmobile now the police unit hangs a right
cuts through a parking lot and bounces onto


ext  second street and tunnel  night

the police unit hangs a uturn into the second street
tunnel  it clips one of the civilian cars causing a
pileup of traffic behind the police unit

the slugmobile skids to a stop blocked by the clog of
traffic in the tunnel  sykes is out of the drivers door
in a flash stand on the door frame and yells

			sykes
	move your goddamned cars

people climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered 
ignoring sykes  sykes slides behind the wheel bangs his
bumper into the car in front of him and pushes the car
far enough forward to get around  he speeds off


int ext  blackandwhite  freeway  night

kipling rockets up a freeway onramp  harcourt smiles
with satisfaction  theres no sign of the slugmobile
behind them  kipling eases off blends into the flow of
traffic


ext  freeway  night

sykes slaloms the slugmobile through the civilian
traffic like mario andretti lapping the pack at
indianapolis


int  slugmobile  night

jetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead

			jetson
	there

sykes sees it  thinking fast he eases off using another
car as a blind  he waits until the police unit is
parallel to an offramp then guns ahead and swings right
directly for the police unit

kipling looks over reacts just as the slugmobile
broadsides the police unit  sykes forces the police unit
up the offramp


ext  intersection  night

door handle to door handle the two cars slue to the
right  the police unit breaks out in front but sykes
stays right on its ass  they charge up onto


ext  vincent thomas bridge  night

the police unit and slugmobile  bumper to bumper at 80
mph


int  slugmobile  night

as the cars scream along jetson cranes out the side
window looking in distress at the inky seawater flashing
past below


ext  vincent thomas bridge  night

they reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto


ext  henry ford boulevard  night

a clear two lane straightaway near the ocean  sykes
pushes the slugmobile to its limits pulls alongside the
police unit  the two cars trade blows at 90 mph
kipling manages to send sykes onto the dirt shoulder
slowing him down


int  blackandwhite  night

kipling watches the slugmobile in the rearview mirror
then looks back out the front to see the end of the road
coming up fast  harcourt bellows to kipling who slams on
the brakes


ext  end of boulevard  night

the police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain
link fence where the road ends  an abandoned drawbridge
and the ocean are on the other side of the fence

with nowhere else to go harcourt yells something at
kipling and kipling floors it back the way they came


ext  henry ford boulevard  night

the two cars are racing for a full headon  at the last
instant sykes wrenches the wheel throws the slugmobile
sideways passenger side first  the police unit smashes
into the rear door and fender of the slugmobile both
cars skidding madly to a stop  a fire ignites under the
hood of the police unit


int  slugmobile  night

sykes sits stunned behind the wheel  disoriented but
conscious he raises his head looks over sees jetson
out cold his forehead gashed and bleeding  then he looks
over and sees the fire growing under the police units
hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug
mobile  near the gas tank


ext  henry ford boulevard  night

sykes slides out of the drivers door stumbles to
jetsons door wrenches it open and drags the huge
unconscious alien away from the cars

hes still dragging jetson away when he spots harcourt
pulling himself through the smashed police unit window
bruised and bleeding harcourt reaches in for the
suitcase then starts to run with it

with jetson a safe distance away from the cars sykes
clambers to his feet draws the casull and starts off
after harcourt

harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the
closed drawbridge  he heaves the suitcase over then
starts to climb

sykes lumbers past the burning police unit  kipling is
still behind the wheel his head slumped forward  sykes
is just past the cars when they explode  sending hoods
and door panels and glass flying in all directions
harcourt on the other side of the fence grabs the
suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the
abandoned drawbridge

sykes reaches the fence  instead of climbing he simply
blows the lock to hell with the casull and kicks open the
gate


ext  abandoned drawbridge  night

the end of the bridge is in the up position a huge
asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky  harcourt
runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the
bridge the black seawater drifting past beside him  his
foot slips once and he almost goes over the side

sykes  backlit by the burning cars the big casull a
prominent part of the silhouette  just keeps coming

harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge 
and has nowhere to go  he is backed into a corner with
seawater on two side of him  harcourt pivots frantically
sees sykes coming this way  harcourt is a trapped animal
his chest heaves in panic  then his gaze falls on the
suitcase behind him and slowly finally a look of
resolve comes into his eye

on sykes

he eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows
harcourt is  theres some movement among the shadows and
sykes straightarms the casull his finger white against
the trigger

perspiration drips into sykes eye but he doesnt blink
a long moment then

angle  the shadows

harcourt emerges from the darkness  his face is composed
the superior glint is back in his eye  his arms are held
away from his sides at 30 degree angles clearly in
surrender

sykes catsteps forward slowly  harcourt stares at sykes
eyes and the desire there that harcourt will give him an
excuse  harcourt simply smiles

			sykes
	move a finger harcourt and youre
	history

			harcourt
	no sergeant  not history
		   beat
	eternity

and now sykes sees it  harcourt has been holding one of
the onekilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind
his arm  he brings it up over his head grins at sykes
then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open
the blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin  his
mouth fills

he looks back at sykes making eye contact his eyes
mad defiant  and  he swallows  long hold  then the
wallop of the overdose hits him his face contorts in
agony as he begins to convulse  sykes wideeyed lowers
the casull and watches as harcourt drops to the ground and
goes into a massive violent seizure  his limbs hammer
against the deck his back arches fiercely  it is a
brutal agonizing ten seconds  then finally his body
becomes still

sykes stunned at what hes just witnessed slowly goes to
him and takes his pulse the way he saw jetson do it

high angle shot  the entire area

sykes stands  he notices the suitcase nearby latches it
and hefts it  he carries it with him back toward the
inferno of the wrecked cars the casull hanging heavy and
cold in his hand

angle following sykes

he approaches the burning cars heading for jetson  as he
passes the burning cars we have a halfsecond to register
that the drivers door of the police unit is now open
before

 a dark figure hurtles at sykes back from os  sykes
is thrown forward  the suitcase crashes to the ground
and the casull goes skittering off  sykes looks up  to
be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of
kipling  kipling reaches down for the suitcase then sykes
hears it  the telltale clinking sound  he looks  and
sees the exotic silver bracelet on kiplings wrist  it
connects for him this is the bandana alien  the one who
killed bill tuggle

kipling brings the suitcase above his head  he is a half
second from hurling it down on sykes skull when  a gun
roars  kipling is thrown back by the chest wound  sykes
looks

angle

jetson half sitting up holds the smoking casull

kipling recovers enough to come at sykes again with the
suitcase again  jetson shaking but determined fires
again and again and again

kipling is driven backward by the fusillade the suitcase
still over his head until he is blasted at last and
forever suitcase and all into the molten core of the
inferno

sykes rises makes his way to jetsons side  jetson has
let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground
sykes kneels beside him gently taking the gun from the
aliens hand  the two partners remain like this bathed
in the orange flickering glow of the fire

high wide shot

cops

angle through windshield

as they approach an eerie scene  the coroners wagon is
stopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection
headlights and roof lights cutting into the night the
back doors wide open  a patrol car is also here on the
other side of the wagon  there is no movement anywhere
near the two vehicles

wiltey pulls the car up his eyes like saucers at the
eerie scene  he reaches for the radio hand mike  jetson
quickly covers it with a large hand

			jetson
	no

jetson sykes and wiltey move warily forward their guns
drawn  they reach the van and sykes takes wilteys
flashlight shines it through the open back doors  the
doors are bent outward smashed half off their hinges
one of the body bags is ripped open literally split from
end to end  the blue and red lightbar on the other patrol
car can be seen through the wagons front windshield

jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car
sykes and wiltey follow  lights all ablaze it too is
abandoned  one door has been wrenched off its hinges and
lays in the street and the front windshield is smashed
our three cops approach the car then wiltey spots
something beyond the unit

			wiltey
	oh god

sykes and jetson look

the bodies of the coroner wagon driver and attendant as
well as the two officers from the patrol car are crushed
and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt  their arms
are twisted as though by a mad force  each pointing down
the street toward the dock warehouses ahead  wiltey
stumbles away backward

			wiltey
	im calling for back up now

			jetson
	wiltey no

but wiltey is going  jetson starts after him but sykes
grabs his arm hard and spins him

ext  street near docks  night

one minute later  open close on a light shining into
camera then widen to reveal it is one of the doormounted
spotlights on wilteys patrol car  wiltey eases the car
down the center of the street  sykes and jetson guns
ready walk slowly along on either side of the car eyes
everywhere

moving pov

as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses watching
for any signs of movement

back to scene

sykes and jetson converse across the hood of the car as
they walk  their eyes everywhere

			sykes
	i never thought id say this but 
	for once in my life i think im
	willing to wait for backup

			jetson
	we cant let him get away

			sykes
	why the hell are you so dead set
	against backup

			jetson
		   a difficult
		    admission
	because because of what will
	happen if humans see what we are
	capable of becoming

			sykes
	but theres no more drug

			jetson
	you understand that  but how many
	others will

sykes looks across at jetsons troubled expression

just then wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across
his headlight beams fifty yards ahead  whatever it was
was large and fast  it darted into an open warehouse
door

			wiltey
	there he is

and wiltey floors it  sykes and jetson watch unable to
stop him

			jetson
	wiltey

he and sykes take off running  wiltey skids to the left
rockets in through the open warehouse door out of sight
sykes and jetson pour it on  they hear a screech of
brakes  they reach the warehouse door and race through


int  warehouse  night

low angle shooting across the underside of wilteys
stopped patrol car as sykes and jetsons feet appear
around the corner of the warehouse door  the car is still
running  the exhaust pipe still rumbling and expelling
fumes  the feet slow then cautiously start around the
car  we pan with them as they move around the side of the
car  a dark liquid begins dripping in extreme fg  we
move up to a close up of the car bumper  the dark liquid
is blood dripping deep red on the shiny chrome  we move
up farther and

 there is wilteys severed head  in close up resting
on the hood of the patrol car

sykes and jetson stop dead at the sight  wilteys body
lies in a heap on the floor near the car  they both
stare then sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the
warehouse his expression saying what the hell could have
done this so fast

their pov

there are two paths to go  both dark and scary as hell
the sound of a distant fog horn blends with the creaks and
drips of this waterfront building

angle  sykes and jetson

jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun
from the dash mount  he checks the chamber as sykes
checks the casull

they exchange a knowing look then wordlessly they
split up  sykes takes the path to the left jetson to the
right

with jetson

as he moves into a dark area  he slowly picks his way
along a long wall having to step over all sorts of piled
debris heading toward us  we pan slightly to the left to
hold a door in close up  the door already ajar eases
open slightly wider  jetson hears this  he reaches the
door sets himself then spins and kicks the door open all
the way  theres nothing inside now

jetson looks up sees movement in the distance  it is
sykes quite far away in another section of the
warehouse  sykes leaves jetsons field of view


int  warehouse  guards area  night

sykes walks around a corner  freezes and cocks his head
as he hears voices  followed curiously by laughter
he eases forward peers around a bend and sees  a table
and a chair  on the table is a minitelevision tuned to
some local late night talk show  theres a thermos a
steaming cup of coffee and a twinkie with a single bite
out of it beside the tv  the chair is empty except for a
jacket slung across the back the word security stitched
on the breast  the guard is nowhere in sight

sykes moves toward the table taking in this eerie sight
he looks around then continues on


int  warehouse  approaching stairs  night

jetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies comes to a
set of stairs leading to an upper floor  the top of the
stairs is pitch black  jetson adjusts his grip on the
shotgun slowly starts up the stairs


int  warehouse  at fish nets  night

sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets hanging
from the ceiling  he has no alternate route  he begins
pushing through them

sykes pov  moving through fish nets

because of the dimness he cant see much beyond each rack
of nets immediately before him  he keeps wading through
 its like a house of mirrors he cant tell now much
farther he has to go to get out of the nets and the
deeper in he gets the harder it would be to go back the
way he came  he pushes past one particular rack of nets
and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is

 a terrifying face

on sykes

he stumbles back gets tangled in the nets brings up the
casull is about to fire when he sees what the face is
its the maidens figurehead from the bow of an old ship
the wood is wormeaten and decayed creating a hideous
visage  sykes stands there a moment trying to jumpstart
his heart again


int  second floor landing  night

jetson moves along the rickety planks  he comes to a
door  he eases it open enters


int  second floor room  night

jetson moves into the shadowy confines  he hears an
incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner  he moves
to it  turns the spigot stopping the drip  other drips
are heard from a dozen other hidden recesses all around
him  he glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the
wall above the sink  suddenly he sees the movement of
something behind him  he spins with the shotgun  a huge
shadow moves along the wall  he pivots the shotgun again
 toward the source of the shadow

its a length of black tarp torn and flapping from the
ceiling  jetson lets out a deep breath


int  storage room  night

angle down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway
a strand of something hangs in frame in out of focus fg
it makes an indistinct rhythmic clinking sound  sykes
moves along the intersecting hallway  the clinking sound
catches his attention  he stops listens then starts
down the passageway toward us

he comes forward into the storage room having to get very
close to the strand of something before he sees what it
is  its a double strand of chain clinking gently
against itself  sykes reaches out steadies the chain
silencing it  he considers  it couldve been a natural
occurrence or something could have brushed against it
setting it in motion  he tightens his grip on the casull
backing away from the chain  he senses something behind
him and spins  nothing there  he relaxes  however

behind him now in soft focus we glimpse movement at the
other end of the short passageway  it is a figure moving
slowly forward down the passageway backlit by the
hallway light behind it its shadow filling the passageway
as it approaches sykes  it stops inside the room now
directly behind sykes  close enough to reach out and
touch him  it is an alien silhouette but larger more
powerful

suddenly sykes senses something is there  he turns
slowly and

shock cut  harcourt

as he steps from the shadows  just like he did the last
time sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge  only this
time it is a horribly transformed harcourt  his eyes are
redrimmed and piggish  his head is lumpen his skin
thick and hard  his neck muscles are corded  giving him
a kind of hellish cobras cowl  there is still
intelligence behind the eyes  but it is a feral
intelligence now

			harcourt
		   his voice a guttural
		    rumble
	looking for me sergeant

sykes stumbles back several steps wildly brings up the
casull and fires  the powerful casull round catches
harcourt in the shoulder jerking him back


ext  work shed area  night

jetson in another area of the docks hears the echoing
blast of the casull  he gauges as best he can the
direction it came from and takes off running


int  storage room  night

harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact  the
cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder
burned but the bullet couldnt pierce his plated skin
harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth starts
toward sykes

scared shitless sykes rapidfires  one of his shots
misses shattering a crate beside harcourts head  the
remaining shots strike harcourt full on  harcourt is
jerked by the impact of the bullets each time snarling in
anger  but none of the hits stop him  the casull is
empty and harcourt keeps coming

sykes stumbles back but harcourt is on him in a flash
harcourt grabs sykes arm holding the gun yanks hard  we
hear the pop as the shoulder dislocates  sykes hollers
and the gun jumps out of his hand


int  warehouse  guards area  night

jetson races in shotgun ready  the last of sykes shots
are still echoing  jetson looks around frustrated
unable to tell exactly where they are coming from  he
sees the likely path and charges that way


ext  dock  at stairs  night

on the cut sykes body is already tumbling down these
rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse
having been thrown ruthlessly from above  as sykes body
sprawls on the dock the massive figure of harcourt
appears at the top of the stairs

sykes scraped and bruised struggles to his feet
harcourt moves down the stairs then vaults over the
railing the last fifteen feet  harcourt lurches forward
and with a taloned grip on sykes shoulders propels him
down the docks


ext  street near docks  night

the first two arriving blackandwhites skid to stops at
the coroners wagon  the officers leap out flagging
other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses


ext  docks  night

sykes is on his feet but his knees buckle and he almost
collapses again  harcourt comes at him  then sykes sees
it

 a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of
the jetties  sykes makes a break for it


ext  warehouse  at stairs  night

jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs
frantically scanning for any sign of sykes  then in the
distance he spots the two figures running along the jetty
 sykes being chased by the reformed harcourt  jetson
gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive
look then gathers up his courage and races down the
stairs to help sykes


ext  jetty  night

sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty  the fishing boat is
already passing the end of the jetty  harcourt is fast
behind sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults
off toward the stern of the boat  landing on the fishing
net piled on the rear deck  he yells in pain as his ankle
twists under his weight

sykes lies there holding his arm breathing hard
relieved that he has escaped


ext  jetty  night

harcourt cant reach the boat from the same jetty sykes
did so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty then
onto a second jetty  and from here he vaults across the
seawater onto the boat


ext  fishing boat  night

sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the
cabin  the fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the
open sea


ext  docks  night

jetson sees this and is shitting bricks  suddenly the
stark beam of a police helicopter sungun stabs down from
above  jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low
the sungun washing over the docks


int  helicopter  night

the sungun hits jetson standing on the dock frantically
waving his badge at the copter signaling it down  the
pilot starts to take it down


ext  fishing boat  night

sykes is on all fours clawing his way up the fishing net
toward the back of the boat  harcourt gets one hand on
his leg  sykes jerks his leg away and harcourts claws
dig deep through sykes pants into his legs as he pulls
away  sykes bellows in pain


int  helicopter  night

jetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the
dock  he has to catch himself from falling out the open
door  below uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto
the dock

			jetson
	on that boat  out there

jetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth
of the channel  the helicopter tilts forward and goes


ext  fishing boat  night

sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging
over the stern of the fishing boat  he pushes to the back
of the dinghy as harcourts savage visage appears at the
bow  harcourt grins  the predator with his prey
trapped


int  helicopter  night

jetsons face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the
channel water racing past beneath  they come up on the
boat and the pilot plays the sungun onto the deck
looking for movement finally pinning sykes and harcourt
at the stern dinghy


ext  bridge of fishing boat  night

the captain reacts to the helicopter overhead looks back
at what the sungun spotlights  he sees harcourt standing
at the bow of the dinghy starting to clamber in

			captain
	hey


ext  fishing boat  night

harcourt turns sees the captain on the bridge above him
he reaches for a woodhandled gaff nearby  he rears back
with it and lets it fly like a spear


ext  bridge of fishing boat  night

the gaff impales the captain offcenter in his chest
the captain his face frozen in shock is thrown back
against the throttle  the boat lunges forward as the
engines rev loudly


ext  fishing boat  night

harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with sykes  as
harcourt recovers sykes spots the release for the tie
line on the dinghy  he lunges forward throwing the
ratchet  the line plays out and the dinghy slides
backward into water


int  helicopter  night

jetson watches this happen


ext  dinghy  night

the dinghy bangs along at the end of the ten foot tie
line in the wake of the speeding fishing boat

harcourt claws his way toward sykes  water is already
splashing in over the stern transom the dinghy is
sinking  harcourt grabs sykes leg and pulls him toward
him  sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his
might  harcourt yanks him free  sykes kicks wildly at
the ratchet release trying to free the remainder of the
line  harcourt is coming in for the kill when

 sykes foot connects with the ratchet lever  the rest
of the tie line snakes through the ratchet freeing the
dinghy from the fishing boat

the dinghy is rocking wildly sinking fast  a wave from
the fishing boats wake splashes in over the side  some
of it hits harcourt  he howls and falls away  sykes
sees this tries to clamber over the side but harcourt is
on him again  sykes body weight at the side of the
dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to
wash in over the transom


int  helicopter  night

jetson reacts to sykes and harcourt battling in the dinghy
below


ext  dinghy  night

harcourt who is getting more and more wet howls in
agony thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water
touches  sykes is taking one hell of a beating  harcourt
sweeps sykes up in a bear hug is about to crush his rib
cage when sykes shifts his body weight knocking harcourt
off balance  harcourt wobbles fear on his face for the
first time  then he finally loses it and the two of
them tumble overboard into the water capsizing the
dinghy


ext  water  night

sykes breaks the surface gasping for air frantically
clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still
above the water  suddenly behind him harcourts
partially melted form erupts from the water lunges on top
of sykes and drags him under


int  helicopter  night

jetson hangs in the open door watching in horror wanting
to help knowing he cant


ext  water  night

sykes breaks the surface harcourts misshapen lump of a
body unmoving but still on top of him  sykes shoves it
away struggling to stay afloat  his head keeps dunking
under  hes drowning


int  helicopter  night

jetson screws up his courage and turns to the pilot

			jetson
	take it down  take it down


ext  water and helicopter  night

the helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water
jetson hangs in the doorway watching sykes head dunking
under again  the helicopters skids are three feet above
the water

			jetson
		   to pilot
	all the way

			pilot
	i cant itll ditch

sykes outreached hand stretches up from the water but
the skid is just too high  jetson has no alternative and
he does the bravest thing he has ever done  he moves out
onto the narrow helicopter skid  hanging on three feet
above the water he reaches down for sykes up reaching
hand

the fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from
each other jetson stretches farther farther and the
two hands meet  jetson winces from the pain of the
seawater on sykes hand  he starts pulling sykes up
when

harcourts head breaks the surface a foot from sykes
face  his eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly
gone  the nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto sykes
breaking his grip from jetsons and dragging him under
again

jetson is frantic  he keeps waiting  but this time
sykes doesnt come up  jetson doesnt know what to do
finally  he leans down as far as he can his face a foot
from the water screams to block the pain and plunges his
own arm below the surface  he feels around gets hold of
something and pulls  it is sykes wrist  he pulls hard
bringing the sputtering sykes up out of the water

			jetson
		   to pilot
	take it up

the pilot does  sykes comes up out of the water  his
feet are just clear of the surface when  harcourts hand
and arm rocket out of the water grabbing sykes ankle
sykes looks down in horror  the helicopter keeps moving
up and before harcourts body breaks the surface the arm
tears away from the torso at the shoulder  sykes wildly
shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle and it
falls back into the water below

jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it
moves off toward shore


int  helicopter  night

sykes plops on the floor soaked battered holding his
limp arm  jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket
wrapping the dry part around his own arm wincing in pain
the pilot stare down at the circle of water where they
just pulled sykes from

			pilot
	what the hell was that down there
	it was weird

jetson looks at sykes wondering if he will say  sykes
looks at jetson a long moment then

			sykes
	looked like every other damn slag to
	me  just plain ugly

despite the pain jetson smiles

				 long dissolve to

int  church anteroom  day

we are close on sykes who is having a hell of a time
trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling  a
pair of alien arms reach into frame to help him  one of
the alien arms is also in a sling

angle widens to reveal the alien is jetson  both men wear
tuxedos

			sykes
	how do i look

			jetson
	you look very good

theres a knock at the door  sykes opens it  there
stands sykes daughter kristin twenty years old looking
radiant in her wedding dress  she is in a foyer and
behind her is the interior of the church with all the
assembled guests including mrs jetson  son

			kristin
	ready daddy

sykes heart melts  before moving to the door

			sykes
	george uh i want to apologize
	now in advance for all the rotten
	things ill ever say or do to you
	over the years

sykes moves to join his daughter  as he does

			jetson

	all you are only human

sykes caught off guard has to laugh

			sykes
		   under his breath
	what a wildman

sykes takes his daughters arm and the two of them start
down the aisle

				    fade out

			the end
