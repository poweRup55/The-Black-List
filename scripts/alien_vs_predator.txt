aliens vs predator

aliens

vs

predator

screenplay by peter briggs

ext  deep space

we open on total blackness a sea of stars spread across the infinite 
depths of space  as the titles roll we notice that three of these 
specks seem to be moving one of them picking up acceleration and 
racing toward us  our perspective changes and we catch a quick 
glimpse as it hurtles past and into the gravitational pull of a large 
brownish planet  kicking up sparks of friction as it hits atmosphere  
it seems to be manmade  or at least artificial

ext  planet surface  day

the planet is dead barren  death valley on a grand scale  we watch 
the object plummet through the wispy cloudcover emitting a few last 
burning embers before falling to ground wayoff in the distance  a 
booming echo resonates across the dusty plains before settling back 
into an eerie silence

ext  fissure canyon  day

were looking into a deep gorge dark and sinister  a howling wind 
whips dust into a sandstorm reducing visibility to almost zero  about 
seventy feet down theres a hole in the rockface that just might be a 
cave entrance and near is a peculiar shimmering in the air  we hear a 
mechanical beeping and the shimmering disappears replaced by five 
humanoid shapes clinging to the sheer rock  each well over seven feet 
tall  they are predators a race of intergalactic biggame hunters on 
permanent safari their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of 
aborigine and ultrahitech  in their hands are circular metal discs 
smart weapons which cut into the stone and give them purchase

predatorvision  

from their pov we see the fissure reduced to thermal heat sources  
the entrance registers as a black gaping void

int  fissure nest tunnel

the five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel out of the winds 
banshee wailing  the lead predator reaches up to his headgear pulling 
at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathingapparatus  
he removes the helmet clips it to his rear utility pack and takes a 
deep breath of the air  a curious speckled pattern runs across his 
wide forehead marking him 
different to the others in addition one of the fangs of his mandibles 
has been sheared away  well call him broken tusk hes the leader of 
the hunting party  he reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the 
tunnel

several feet in from the rim it changes from rock to a textured 
biomechanical surface a swirling mass of disturbing shapes  he 
hurries forward in response to the gurglinghiss of one of his team who 
has found something

the other predator holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny  skewered 
on the end is a shriveled form with eight spindly legs and a segmented 
tail its a facehugger the first stage of the deadly alien lifeform  
broken tusk hisses a caution to his party they respond by pulling 
spears and elaboratelyshaped swords  several shouldermounted plasma 
cannons slide up to firing position tracking with their owners 
helmets  thus armed they move cautiously aheadtaking no chances  
one helmeted predator pauses scanning the area

predatorvision  

he switches through a variety of different views infrared ultra
violet enhanced motiontracking  nothing

hes so preoccupied with this task he totally fails to notice the 
skeletal alien loom up behind him emerging from the biomechanical 
growth on the floor  a barbed tail skewers the predator straight 
through the neck splashing luminous blood across his chestplate  a 
gargled deathrattle issues from his throat the band of predators 
spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground  the 
band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid they 
themselves are set upon by a halfdozen alien warriors  the carnage is 
swift and terrifying a blur of motion

steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air alive 
with the cries and hisses of both adversaries  one predator is pinned 
against the tunnel wall his spear out of range  the alien claws away 
his face mask and he finds himself dodging the aliens toothed tongue 
extended toward him with piledriver speed  he reaches down grasping 
the smartweapon hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc 
that terminates at the aliens grinning face  big mistake  the two 
are in such close proximity that the aliens acidic blood sprays across 
the predators head  while their technology seems to be resistant to 
it their bodies arent  the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into 
the predators skin  he kicks the skeletal corpse away with a hideous 
piercing scream clawing at his seared face 

it all seems to be over as quickly as it began there can be no 
question as to who were the victors  the predators stand amidst a sea 
of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house  as his 
companions begin to carefully decapitate the alien skulls broken tusk 
steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades  the first 
predator to be attacked was killed instantly he crosses to the other  
what he finds causes him to react with
pity and disgust  his fallen comrade is only just alive mandibles 
clicking frailly half his head burnt away  broken tusk watches the 
ailing predator slide a steel blade from its sheath and offer it to 
him  he takes it knowing what has to be done  rolling the knife 
quickly over the back of his hand  the sort of elaborate trick 
seasoned green berets perform  he plunges it downward into the fallen 
hunter  this unpleasant task accomplished

broken tusk straightens up and activates his wristcomputer  a dark 
shape blots out the light coming from the entrance a small predator 
shuttlecraft sleek and elegant  it hovers in the air with little more 
than a loud hum and extends a ramp  the surviving predators leap 
aboard carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men 
returning from combat

one more thing need to be done  broken tusk bends down and flips a 
sequence of keys on the dead predators wrist  a countdown is 
displayed in some unknown characterset accompanied by a high pitched 
beeping  he then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes 
smoothly to the air its undergear retracting

ext  planet surface  day

a whitehot fireball erupts out of the fissure the result of the 
predators suicidedestruct mechanism  the shuttlecraft pulls quickly 
away disappearing into the clouds

ext  space

a large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet the 
predator mothership  the shuttle heads swiftly towards it 


int  predator mothership  docking bay

an airlock rumbles open and the predators file noisily into the 
motherships docking bay  an old predator crouched against a strut 
takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly 
look up at them  like the predators themselves the ship is a curious 
mixture of old and new  an elaborate frieze written in alien script 
runs around the wall with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed 
into it  hatches lead off to various parts of the ship we see broken 
tusk carry his alien head off down one of them 

int  predator mothership  viewing gallery

the gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship  
broken tusk enters pausing next to a kind of readout device  a 
cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which 
constantly changes its mass into shapes and alien text  he peers over 
the protective railing 

what he sees is magnificent  a captive queen alien the nucleus of the 
alien society fed by giant intravenous pipes  each of its limbs is 
tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement  to the rear 
its giant eggsac glows and throbs suspended by a juryrigged sling  
a scanning mechanism hangs above the eggs the queen lays seemingly 
defying gravity  as each egg is scanned by a blue triangular beam  
similar to a predator gunsight  it becomes translucent giving us a 
view of the pulsing facehugger inside  this done a manipulator are 
carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet which then sinks into a 
hatchway in the floor  its an assemblyline of almost frightening 
mechanical efficiency

ext  space

we see a pod ejected from the mothership rocketing away from the 
planet into deep space  the inference is obvious the predators are 
seeding worlds with aliens to hunt

int  predator mothership  viewing gallery

the blue beam slides across one of the eggs and suddenly changes to 
red beeping rapidly  broken tusk sees the flowing displaytank alter 
from a rotating simulation of an alien warrior skull to a 
representation of a queens head  the manipulator arm swiftly grasps 
the egg in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor  
the causes the queen to go
berserk straining at her bonds and shrieking ferociously  shes 
obviously been through this before and knows whats about to happen  
the protrusionsplits open spilling out an intense white light  an 
energyfilled blast furnace  the manipulator claw opens the egg drops 
in and is no more

int  predator mothership  living quarters

an orange light plays across a wall of skulls casting dark shadows 
into longempty orbs  broken tusk sprawls lizardlike across a flat 
slab of rock in the center of the room inspecting his formidable 
arsenal of weaponry satisfied he reaches out to run a finger across 
the jaw of his alien trophy in an almosterotic gesture  he regards it 
for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind before 
finally getting to his feet 

int  predator mothership  viewing gallery

the lights in the gallery are dimmer when broken tusk enters  he 
watches the cherryred beam of the gliding scanning mechanism lock onto 
one of the eggs then runs his hand in sequence over the control board  
the manipulator arm swings over seizing the egg and loading it onto a 
waiting pallet 

broken tusk points his finger at the queen and makes a guttural 
clicking sound from deep in his throat  the effect is not unlike that 
of a child firing an imaginary gun  as if reading broken tooths 
thoughts the queen lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous 
hiss of contempt

ext  space

in center frame the planet sits still and green awash with nebulous 
clouds a hulking metal form rolls righttoleft across our view 
sunlight glinting from its surface  its a rectangular satellite
construction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a 
latticework of steel tubing  we hear filtered human voices os  
subspace chatter

ext  ryushi station  midday

imagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of 
treetop foliage and youve just drawn yourself a picture of the planet 
ryushi

nestled amongst this lush rainforest is the yutanitemplin 
communications relay station  several invertedushaped suspension 
cranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of 
preassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on 
platforms much like a truncated oilrig  a navigation beacon flashes 
intermittently from a tall gantry tower above while dominating the 
view is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes 
high  off to one side of the platform is a gigantic manywheeled 
haulage vehicle  a flock of birdlike creatures fly past

int  ryushi station  command center

were in the dark womb of a splitlevel command center alive with 
clusters of video readouts somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air
traffic control tower  on the upper tier a large circular holo
display currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw  thin 
trailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air 
conditioning ducks though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of 
the people manning the consoled here  we move in on cassie dollander 
and rob parsons two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank  
cassie listens carefully to something on her headset 

cassie
ah negative on that request commercial freighter nanshan  ive 
already got an inbound on that approach pending a beaconfix  hold on 
my mark until i get back with some confirmation  rimward traffic 
control out

she thumbs a button and leans over to parsons

cassie contd
hows it looking

parsons worriedly shakes his head

parsons
thats the second time i ran it and it still reads the same

cassie
better tell the boss

parsons pulls out a coin

parsons
toss you for it

int  ryushi station  executive office

hiroko noguchi is sweating heavily a black forelock of hair falling 
across her oriental features  her eyes flicker warily from sideto
side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her trying to 
assess from where the next attack will come  she doesnt have to wait 
long two ninja swordsmen drop to the floor in front of her striking 
without hesitation

she expertly avoid the blows parrying relentlessly  a persistent tone 
begins to intrude os like a telephone ringing  she tries to ignore 
it but her concentration is clearly broken  a third swordsman appears 
from out of nowhere his sword swishing towards her chest  the blade 
plunges deep into her stomach emerging from her back  she glances 
down in annoyed disbelief

hiroko
fuck  holo off

the swordsmen immediately flicker and disappear  she sheathes the 
sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to 
her desk mopping her face with a towel she thumbs a stud  the 
ringing tone stops the corporate logo on her flatscreen desk panel 
replaced with a black girls face

hiroko contd
noguchi

cassie  os onscreen
something just came up on deep space tracking

hiroko
what kind of something

cassie   os onscreen
easier if you come down and look

hiroko
im on my way

ext  ryushi station  midday

an eightwheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain 
climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outposts empty 
mainstreet  a group of rhinos  brown twohorned quadrupeds 
indigenous to ryushi  restlessly stir in their corral at its 
approach  the crawlers pneumatics hiss gently as it comes to a halt 
while somewhere off in the distance a dog barks  

don kamen a lean man in his forties climbs down from the cab mounted 
five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna he 
adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the 
street towards one of the buildings ignoring a pepsi sign creaking in 
the gentle breeze  a glasspaneled door swishes automatically open 
before him 

int  ryushi station  command center

kamen steps into the command center nodding familiarly to the duty 
personnel  a longhaired labrador rushes up to kamen wagging its 
tail her name is brewster  shes the base mascot  kamen reaches down 
and ruffles its fur  he climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier 
pulling the frenchplaited hair of annie urioste an italian systems
mechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console

urioste
you didnt wipe your feet coming in

kamen
well its okay  you didnt tell me it was monsoon season going out

parsons looks up at kamen and grins

parsons
hey buenos dias cowboy  when dyou blow in

kamen places his hat on parsons head and thumps it down

kamen
just got back  missed anything

urioste   snorts
yeah  were almost out of beer

parsons
ahh dont pay any attention to urioste shes still pissed that 
noguchi wouldnt let her go off on your hunting trip

kamen pours himself a cup of coffee from a bubbling percolator

kamen
wasnt my trip i just did the driving sides freezing my butt off 
out in the wet taking potshots at the local wildlife isnt my idea of 
a good time either

he sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid

parsons
whered you leave them

kamen
camped out by the navibeacon out on linsons range  theyre making 
their own way back tomorrow

cassie
marsco went bellyup on the dow jones

kamen
shit  when

cassie
yesterday  we got the network feed from gateway it was the top story 
on sixty seconds  biggest market crash since twentyfour

kamen looks ill

kamen
fucking great  i invested some money in them

cassie
you win some you loose some

kamen
i lose em all thats why im still out here on this rock  anything 
else you wanna ruin my day with

cassie
no but i got something that might interest you

hiroko enters pulling on a leather jacket

hiroko
whatve you got

kamen nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble  they 
turn to watch the display clear replaced with a computer simulation of 
the neighboring solar system

cassie
a pair of incomings  they poppedup on the mediumrange about thirteen 
twentyfour local time

parsons
we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly but we ran a backtrace just 
to make sure

cassie
yeah  turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace

the simulation zooms in revealing two unidentified objects heading 
towards the planet in the center of the display  computer notations 
accompany them

cassie contd
curious thing is the mass detector says theyre too small to carry a 
deepspace drive

hiroko
sounds like a couple of escape shuttles

parsons
thats what we thought

hiroko
have you got an updated lloyds almanac to crossreff them through

parsons
done it already  nothing matches

cassie
and if you thought that was interesting watch this

hiroko watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change

kamen
jesus

parsons
yeah exactly  thosere preprogrammed course adjustments youre 
looking at

kamen
tactical nukes maybe

everybody gives him a quick look but nobody says anything  its 
obviously not an appealing thought

hiroko
wherere they headed

cassie
we ran a trajectory simulation  if they carry on along that path its 
possible theyll make intraorbital insertion

theres a great exhalation of breath and everyone swaps significant 
glances hiroko seems worried  she scratches her forehead

hiroko
i dont know what to make of this  get a copy of the telemetry relayed 
back to antarctica traffic control  better alert the nearest rimcorp 
base too

parsons nods suddenly serious

parsons
fort powell  what do we tell em

hiroko
just give them the facts  they can leap to their own conclusions

ext  linsons range  swamp  afternoon

down here in the swamp the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in 
gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk much like a louisiana 
bayou  a group of attentive lemurtype creatures suddenly bound for 
cover as a line of bullets thuds into the wood nearby  seconds later 
a loud humming noise intrudes os and a pair of mantarayshaped 
hoverbikes with sleek lines and garnish decals slams into frame 
suspended two feet above the mire their powerful turbines kickingup a 
swirl of spray  the two bikers skid to a halt and watch the creatures 
scatter  ackland and york  men who on earth might be called good ol 
boys  are both riding onehanded powerful hitech rifles gripped in 
the other

york   yelling
you missed em ackland

ackland
little fuckers move too fast  lets do a sweep and catch em on the 
other side

york nods his head pulling his goggles down over his eyes  the two 
bikes roar off in pursuit

ext  linsons range  encampment  afternoon

up on a mudbank at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two 
blinking blue lights atop it stands the camp  it looks a little like 
a bedouin bivouac but upclose we can see the technofitted details  
a hardfeatured woman seated next to a solidfuel burner sips from a 
mug while her vietnamese counterpart is manually loading largecaliber 
bullets into a beltfeed  they 
watch as ackland and york roar past whooping  minh scrambles out of 
the way as a beer can lobbed by york clatters to the ground near him 

minh
crazy idiots

beauvais cups her drink with both hands assessing him

beauvais
ahhh theyre just letting off some steam dont let em get to you  
ackland and york arent such bad guys when you get to know em  just a 
couple of weekend warriors

she peers curiously at the clunky cartridges minhs thumbing into the 
belt feed  on the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over
theshoulder guidance mechanism

beauvais contd
nice howitzer youve got there

minh
thanks

beauvais
good argument for guncontrol  what are you going after rhino

minh
nah  i just wanna squeeze off a few rounds  sides they tagged the 
rhinos for the migration project so theyre protected  theyll dock 
you a months pay for just mentioning it

he peers into the belt and blows out some dirt

minh contd
sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it 
though

ext  deep space

against a sea of stars a small metal shape hurtles towards us 
followed moments later by its identical twin

ext  ryushi station  big bertha  afternoon

a strand of hirokos hair falls forward into her face slick with rain  
she brushes up at the miserable weather  she and kamen are standing on 
one of the twelvefeetindiameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage 
vehicle we saw outside the base earlier  up on the side of the cab is 
painted a nordic valkyrie with an impressive bustline next to which is 
the legend big bertha  two mechanics jan guttierez and kevin 
diller watch kamen point something out to hiroko from the vantage 
point of kamens crawler parked in the swamp nearby

kamen
see that sheathing on the suspension eaten away  same thing with the 
pumps on the base air purifiers  the algae out here just isnt good on 
these new plastics

hiroko
we havent used big bertha since we relocated the generator module  
that was four months ago  i cant ask for them to keep bringing spares 
in on the shuttle its already costing too much as it is

kamen shrugs

kamen
if you want these things kept in working condition thats the only 
choice youve got

diller leans in to murmur quietly to guttierez

diller
maybe she wouldnt be so tetchy if she got laid every onceinawhile

guttierez
you offering

a buzzer inside the crawler goes off  diller gets up to answer

diller
nah  freeze my dick off

hiroko shakes her head dubiously at kamens comment

hiroko
i dont know  i think well have to run it on a rota one month down 
one month operational

diller leans out of the crawlers cab and calls across

diller
miss noguchi  youre wanted in admin

hiroko
thanks

she turns back to kamen

hiroko contd
let me sort this out and well go over the logistics in my office

int  ryushi station  command center

hiroko peers at the display with undisguised concern  a sense of 
urgency buzzes around the room

hiroko contd
when

cassie
seven minutes ago the third course change in an hour  those incomings 
are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too 
close for comfort

hiroko
can we move it to a different orbit in time

parsons looks up from his board in harassment

parsons
already working on it

hiroko
get off an allbands emergency distress and put it on a repeater

she meets kamens eyes

hiroko contd
looks like you were right  someones lobbed a pair of smartmissiles 
at us

kamen shakes his head

kamen
relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies why bother  
all youre gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control 
net  thatd be small potatoes even for terrorists

parsons and cassie are allbusiness at the control board

parsons
can you patch me a temporary loop on dcmgs

cassie
okay give me the numbers

she flips a switch  a nearby screen changes to display an orbital path 
sketched out in rectangular neon blocks

ext  space

a cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites 
and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move

ext  deep space

the two pods roar towards us at immense speed

int  ryushi station  command center

the two blips on the holoboard representing the pods make a marked 
alteration in their course

parsons
theyve changed their heading again

hiroko
compensate

parsons
punch me in a solution for their deltavee

cassie
what do you need

parsons
a threesecond burn to port on my mark

cassie
its on the board

ext  space

framed against the green backdrop of ryushi the predator pods rocket 
towards the communications platform

cassie
picking up velocity

hiroko
match it

a bead of sweat trickles down parsons temple

parsons
not gonna make it

ext  deep space

the pod speeds thunderously into camera blotting out our view

int  ryushi station  command center

one of the two blips on the holodisplay vanishes and threequarters 
of the monitors abruptly turn to static  parsons curses

parsons
goddammit

he pulls off his headset with weary resignation

parsons contd
weve lost the downlink  its gone

ext  space

the mass of the satellite tumbles endoverend  a gaping rent is torn  
through it something sparks and flashes within  the second pod 
accelerates off curving into the atmosphere

ext  linsons range  riverbank  dusk

a sonic thundercrack booms overhead york looks up in time to see an 
object sear across the dusk sky  he pulls his bike to a stationary 
hover

york
shit  whats that

ackland has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the 
ground  a booming echo resonates across the forest followed by a few 
plaintive screeches from the planets indigenous lifeforms before 
settling back into an eerie silence

ackland
meteor i guess

he raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face  through them 
he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops

ackland
dyou feel any impact shock

york   uncertain
not really

he lowers the binoculars and frowns

ackland
me either  i tell you i used to be with a mining outfit on callisto 
and when something like that hits believe me you know about it

york
do you wanna head back and call it in

ackland   hesitant
i dunno i dunno  something about this feels funny

he looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky

ackland contd
that is the damndest impact ive ever saw

ext  linsons range  impact sight  dusk

the earth around the craterrim is charred and cracked some of the 
surrounding brush still aflame  a scorpion scuttles inquisitively to 
the edge of the pit and stops its stinger twitching hesitantly  we 
hear a low hum and the sound of metalonmetal  before the scorpion 
can decide what to do its fate is sealed  a large metal claw comes 
down crushing it in an instant  a second claw emerges and a machine 
heaves itself out of the hole its surface smoking with heat  it 
pauses for a beat like some giant tarantula seeking prey them moves 
purposely outwards about twenty yards before halting  a hatch on the 
underside opens and a complex delivery mechanism extends  after a 
moment theres a low clunk and the mechanism retracts  in its place 
is an alien egg  the machine crawls off vanishing into the long 
reeds

ext  ryushi station  night

hiroko sits on the front wheel of kamens crawler her knees pulled up 
to her chin staring off into a thin mist that makes the night 
impenetrable  behind and above the lights of the cranes and the 
communications array strobe onandoff  above the bar on the main 
street is a flicking neon sign erected afterthefact emblazoned with 
the words torchys  the muffled sounds of merrymaking from within 
become momentarily louder and hiroko glances over to see its 
pressuredoor crash back disgorging several drunken people kamen 
follows them through  he spots hiroko and heads over

kamen
hey boss  wondered where youd gotten to

hiroko
i just wanted to be put on my own for a while  clear my head

kamen
didnt feel like whoopin it up with the rest of us blue collars huh

she shakes her head and manages a smile

hiroko
ive got a lot of thinking to do  sides the room was getting too 
crowded for me

kamen
not too much of the socializing type then

hiroko
no not really  more sort of the  claustrophobic type

kamen laughs  hiroko is straightfaced

hiroko contd
im serious  thats why i switched from orbiting to planetary 
installations

kamen
is that a fact

hiroko
uhhuh  used to get it pretty bad  id wake up in a cold sweat and 
want to claw open a vacuum hatch

kamen
how long you been out here for now anyway  three months

hiroko
four

kamen
and before that

hiroko
six month stint on datus

kamen
only six

hiroko
what is this  twenty questions

kamen
just curious  theres a lot of talk goes around

hiroko shrugs  thinks about it

hiroko
i dont know  i guess ive just never found anywhere i really felt at 
home

she hugs her knees again and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease  
kamen spots a square glass balanced on one of the tires wide treads

kamen
what is that

hiroko
real man drink

she offers the glass to him  he takes it and sniff cautiously

kamen
seltzer

hiroko
want some

kamen hands the glass back and raises his own bottle

kamen
ill stick with my own

he sits with her and stares into the darkness

hiroko
any luck raising acklands party

kamen
nothing  with the satellite down we cant transmit over the mountain 
range hes most likely sitting there wondering why he cant raise us

hiroko
first light well take a chopper out there and tell them to head back

kamen
we  you wanna fly out there with me

hiroko
sure  do me good to stretch my legs

hiroko takes a sip of her drink her brow furrowing

hiroko contd
this whole things got me spooked

kamen hops off the wheel

kamen
dont worry about it  if the network goes by the book like everyone 
figures they will a marine gunboat from powellll dropby for a look
see in fourorfive days  they can go poke around out there and find 
whatever it was hit us  all weve gotta do is sit tight

hiroko
do you think acklandll sit tight

kamen
thered have to be a helluva good reason for him not to

ext  space

a peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the 
incapacitated satellite examining every section  it comes to the rent 
torn through it and pauses

from the scanners pov we see the structure of the satellite made 
up from a series of blue geodesic shapes  the damage registers as a 
cold black mass

the beam switches off and the hovering predator shuttle turns smoothly 
on its axis thrusting towards the planet 

ext  linsons range  impact site  night

shafts of torchlight fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness  
york and ackland wade through the chinhigh reeds cursing

ackland
found anything

york looks down at his datastick a handheld torch with a multi
purpose readout screen

york
nada no radiation no movement nothing

ackland
well just keep looking  its gotta be whoa jesus

ackland falls toward onto something and york comes running

york
what is it

ackland steadies himself and the two men shine their torches at the 
rhythmicallybreathing shape on the ground

ackland
its a rhino

york
is it dead

ackland
no its still breathing  kinda clammy though  are you sure your 
sticks not broken

york looks at the datastick again

york
yeah its fine

ackland
god i hope that thing didnt bring down a virus

york
i told you we whats that

their torch beams pan across a threefoot high ovular shape

ackland
looks like a spore  fungus of some kind maybe

york
bloody big if it is  tops open

ackland steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside

york contd
careful

theres nothing inside  ackland looks disappointed

ackland
its hollow  think our rhino mustve ate something that didnt agree 
with him

a heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a 
banshee howl ruffling their hair

york
lets get back and call this in

ackland
wait a minute

york reluctantly follows ackland as he thrashes through the thinn ing 
foliage coming out at the rim of the impact crater  its beginning to 
partially collapse water seeping in  york runs his beam over 
something at the bottom of the shallow pit

york
what is that is that metal fragments

acklands maybe getting a little nervous now

ackland
this is very fucking weird

he sees the churned earth and the muddy trail leading off into the 
broken foliage

ackland contd
its like something came out of the crater and went that way

theres a tiny click and ackland looks over to see york taking the 
safety off his rifle  ackland wordlessly unshoulders his too  they 
step around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to

york
another one

ackland prods this second egg with his gun

ackland
yeah  thiss closed

theres a crackling noise and the top of the egg peels neatly open in 
four sections  the two men jump back in alarm and york laughs 
nervously something organic is pulsing inside  ackland cranes his 
neck forward for a better look

theres an explosion of movement  a spindly shape with a long 
segmented tail launches itself jackinaboxstyle at ackland  its a 
facehugger  ackland trips backwards caught offbalance  his finger 
involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls  a volley 
of shots describe and arc and  light up the night with a percussive 
boom and we

cut to
a short distance across the clearing  something is watching them 
from the trees something with a heatvision pov  a predator  we 
see the flare of acklands gunshots then snap in to see the multi
colored from of his body toppling over trailing a purplish facehugger 
before we 

cut back to
one of acklands bullets taking a meaty chunk out of yorks thigh as 
he races forward to help his friend  the huggers tail is already 
around acklands throat its fingers scrabbling for purchase  york 
pulls at one set of digits and manages to raise them for just an 
instant  what we see is horrific the look of terror on acklands 
face and the questing tendril on
the huggers underside trying to force its way between acklands lips  
in a second its all over the facehugger struggles free of yorks 
grasp and clamps itself firmly on acklands face with a faint sucking 
sound  york shivers then uses his good leg to propel himself a few 
feet away  he watches the hapless teamster go rigid then stop moving 
altogether

york
oh god oh shit oh god

the facehuggers tail slithers tighter around acklands neck and as 
york quickly retrieves his rifle we

cut to
a predatorvision shot watching the colorbloom of york dragging 
acklands body away from the crater  it closes in on the facehugger 
giving us a muted xraytype view of circulatory fluid pumping around 
the hugger and into ackland

yorks limping badly a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue 
trousers acklands not a small man and the physical effort of hauling 
him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely  theres movement on 
the ground and york sees why one of the lemurs has fallen victim to 
another facehugger which dwarfs its small furry body  the huggers 
fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens its hold the 
movement akin to somebody drumming their
fingers on a tabletop

ext  linsons range  river bank  night

as york hauls ackland onto one of the bikes he hears a ticking sound 
from the trees like an engine cooling on a warm summers day  york 
clutches his rifle and stares upward  there seems to be a vague 
shimmering form in the bough of a tree  although it might be a trick 
of the light he isnt sticking around to find out  york guns the bike 
to life and roars off above the swamp

ext  linsons range  impact site  night

predatorvision  
were looking at the site in colours  the cold blue of empty alien 
eggs and the warm reds of justbreathing animals rendered inert the 
facehugger parasites

a group of predators appear in threedimensional solidity their 
camouflage cloaks deactivated  the lead predator splashes across to 
the exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an animal corpse 
curled up there  most of it has been madly mutilated by something 
erupting from inside its body the predator looks up and scans the 
swamp ignoring the swarm of flies buzzing in the air

predatorvision  
this time an oscillating line appears to the left of our view and a 
band sweeps quickly across the screen synchronous to us hearing 
different levels of sound static  this abruptly stops as the 
oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys  the predator is 
picking up radio
waves  a human voice albeit grosslydistorted

ext  linsons range  encampment  night

we hear a rapid beeping movementsensors set up on tripods to warn 
against intruding animals  the sound brings beauvais out of her tent 
blearyeyed and fumbling with her pistol  shes suddenly wide awake 
when she sees yorks hoverbike lit by the sensors flashing red 
strobe  it skids to a halt against a mudbank sending up a spray of 
silt  york climbs off the bike and stumbles then starts to unfasten 
the straps holding acklands body

beauvais
jesus christ  what happened

york
give me a hand with ack

she races over to help york ease ackland up

beauvais
how bad is oh my god

as ackland is turned over beauvias gets her first look at a 
facehugger she shies away repulsed 

beauvais
what is that

york
dont uuh dont know  help me uuh help me get him inside  
shit

york grits his teeth but the leg injury is too painful  he slumps 
slowly to the floor

beauvais   yelling
minh  minh get out here

int  tent  night

a portable neon light in the tent flickers casting staccato bluish 
light over ackland and the facehugger  minh and beauvais stare at it 
in horrified fascination while york pulls a tourniquet around his 
thigh  he winces 

beauvais
have you tried prising it off

york shakes his head

york
i wanted to get him back here get him back to base

minh
forget it  we lost the satellite link its dead

theres a long pause while everyone considers the options

beauvais
weve got no option  were gonna have to get it off

minh
oh man

york
get real beauvais  that thing might chew his fucking face off for all 
be know

the motion sensor outside begins beeping again  minh catches beauvais 
headjerk

beauvais
minh

minh
yep

minh hefts his howitzer and leaves the tent  beauvais rounds on 
york continuing

beauvais
how do you know its not already

york
i dont but i think we should just wait and let the doc take a look

ext  linsons range  encampment  night

minh walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of 
the camp the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward  he 
studies the surrounding darkness  theres nothing out there  he 
shakes his head in 
disgust

minh   muttering
take a goddamn wrench to those things

he thumbs a stud on the top of the howitzer  theres a gentle whine 
and the hiss of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the 
weapon up it darts quickly toandfro a mechanical snake seeking a 
target  we see minhs hand in close up  in addition to the firing 
trigger theres also a thumb button  he squeezes it

the gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement tracking 
something automatically  theres a thunderous rumble as it firesoff 
three shots in rapid succession  something that was only yards from 
minh appears and is blown backwards to crash against a tree bole a 
mass of luminous green liquid and motion

minh contd  dumbstruck
god

minh watches the helmeted predator fall face down into the water with a 
splash then lie motionless  york and beauvais are out of the tent in 
an instant

predatorvision 
three humans in motion and hot  the triangular mechanism of the 
predators gun locks onto minh

a blast of plasmaenergy rips a gaping hole through minhs body 
spraying blood across york  he topples dead to the ground a look of 
pained surprise on his face  beauvais is there immediately racing 
across and scrabbling for the howitzer  she doesnt have time to 
take the harness off  she just slides her finger through the trigger 
guard and starts squeezing off random shots  the air shimmers as an 
unseen shape races at her  theres a loud

swish of sliding metal and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air  
it slams through beauvais body lifting her off the ground and 
impaling her against a tree

york watches in horror as beauvais arms thrash around  a moment later 
her struggles cease and shed dropped to the floor like a broken 
marionette theres a crackling sound and the hazy air around beauvais 
disappears  in its place is a predator a luminous green patch 
trickling from a wound on its arm  its head flicks around as it 
zeroesin on york the three red dots of the predators cannon 
following suit  yorks quick though already up and running when the 
plasma bolt explodes into the tree despite the pain in his leg

his options are limited  the hoverbike is nearby  he sprints for 
that and his luck holdsthe keys still in the ignition  he flips 
it  the engine coughs and then dies  york looks up  the wounded 
predator bounds across the clearing at frightened speed  york turns 
the key again but the predators almost upon him  the creature whips 
an ornatelyshaped lance from its back and thrusts itjust as the 
engine roars to life and the hoverbike rises from the mud  the blade 
slices into the bikes body and jams there while one of its manta
wings smacks into the predators jaw sending it reeling backwards into 
the swamp

york swivels the bike on its axis as another plasmabolt rips into the 
rear melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork  he sees a predator 
handing from a tree and the shimmering of two more predators in their 
camouflage nearby  hes not sticking around to argue though  york 
jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more 
cannonblasts blossom around him

the group of predators appear in the camp and cautiously survey the 
area the lead predator  the one with the distinctive armor  crosses 
to the tent and opens the entry flap

int  tent  night

predatorvision 
the extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing facehugger on 
ackland for a long moment but takes no further action

ext  linsons range  encampment  night

we pan slowly across the deserted campsite  there isnt a soul there 
human or otherwise  the wind whistles eerily through the treeboughs 

ext  rainforest airspace  dawn

first light the next day the sun rising on the horizon  a chopper  
actually a twinturbine helijet  flies in low above the veil of mist 
hanging over the treetops

int  chopper  dawn

the cockpit is small a twoseater with room for cargo in the back  
kamens in the pilot seat and hirokos riding shotgun  the controls 
moving by themselves on autopilot  a repetitive beeping causes kamen 
to look up from his magazine

kamens pov
from out of the window of the chopper we see the twin blue lights of 
the navigation beacon blinking onandoff above the trees

kamen nudges hiroko awake

kamen
wake up  were at the beacon

he switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down  
hiroko rubs the sleep from her eyes

ext  linsons range  encampment  dawn

twin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep 
across the clearing  the encampment has been wrecked much of is 
reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris  allterrain gear lowers 
from the chopper as it makes a watery landing in the swamp

int  chopper  dawn

kamen and hiroko stare at the site in disbelief  kamen hauls an 
automatic pulserifle from the rear 

kamen
looks like trouble

kamen reaches under the pilots seat and pulls out a handpistol  
passes it to her

kamen contd
used one of these before

hiroko coolly examines it

hiroko
fabrique nationale tactical autoloader uses twelve mill hollow o 
rounds with through the barrel smart lasersighting sure i can 
handle this

hirokos showboating and kamen knows it but he still cant help being 
a little bit impressed

kamen
okay  watch were you point it

ext  linsons range  encampment  dawn

the two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred 
canvas part of the bivouac has collapsed  one of the guide ropes has 
burned through

hiroko   quietly
somebody picked an argument

kamen
yeah  somebody won

hiroko
check out the tent

kamen nods and heads off that way while hiroko carefully inspects the 
wreckage dotted around the perimeter

int  tent  dawn

kamen opens the tent flap and peers inside  acklands on the cot 
sweating heavily  there is no sign of the facehugger

ext  linsons range  encampment  dawn

across the clearing hiroko turns a piece of charred plating over in 
her hands before discarding it

her foot slips on an object sunk into the soft mud  its minhs 
howitzer a dark slippery patch coats the metal  she crouches down 
and rubs her fingers through it  blood  kamens voice intrudes os

kamen   os
ive found ackland

hiroko
hold on

she begins to cross the camp and her foot catches on a taut length of 
rope something swings down from the trees hitting her squarely in the 
face and knocking her off her feet  hiroko cries out in fear and 
surprise then freezes at what she sees

two bloodied bodies dangle headfirst from the bough overhead beauvais 
and minh  each has been skinned and is beyond recognition  kamen 
hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant  he stops 
in his tracks

kamen
jesus palomino

ext  ryushi station  helijet pad  morning

its raining again at the base  under cover of an overhang hiroko 
watches as ackland is trundled away from the chopper on a paramedic 
trolley by guttierez and doc revna an indian woman in her late 
thirties  as kamen slams the choppers side door we see that hiroko 
has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat  kamen runs after 
revna clutching a clear plastic bag

kamen
wait a minute doc

he hands the bag over to revna  she peers at the contents curiously  
the facehugger is inside stiff and shriveled 

revna
is this it

kamen
yeah  found it curled up in a corner of the tent  any idea

revna shakes her head

revna
never come across one of these before maybe the original survey team 
did  ill run it through records and see what comes up

guttierez checks that acklands bodys secure on the trolley  kamen 
raps him on the back to get his attention

kamen
hey jan  see if you can get someone to check out the chopper

guttierez
whats the problem

kamen
she was running a little sluggish on the way back  think the turbines 
might be playing up

guttierez
give me twenty minutes and ill do it myself

kamen
appreciate that

revna interrupts

revna
wherere the bodies

hiroko
bagged and in the back  theyre not a pretty sight

ackland is wheeled into a freight elevator  as kamen and hiroko walk 
away across the rainswept platform a shimmering from detaches itself 
from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the helijet pad 

predatorvision
a newlyarrived predator scans the towers and modules of the relay
station with great interest  an oscillating red line appears to the 
left of the shot as the predator analyses hirokos voicepattern

predator   os distorted
not a pretty sight  not a pretty sight

he reaches down to his wrist computer and activates it

ext  linsons range  impact sight  day

under the cathedrallike light filtering through the trees above a row 
of metal spikes have been driven into the earth  four are topped with 
stillsmoking alien skulls  two and empty

predatorvision  
a newly decapitated alien head is turned around in another predators 
hands in admiration  this predator thrusts his trophy onto the next 
spike then stares at the vacant one for a long moment  his wrist 
computer bleeps for attention

int  ryushi station  command center

with nothing to do most of the screens are out and the remaining 
personnel bored  parsons is reading a magazine with his feet up on the 
console uninterested in hiroko and kamens conversation nearby 

hiroko
im going to need you to cosign the report  until we come up with 
something thisll be treated as first degree murder

kamen
agreed

hiroko
when we get the link back and i send this in iccll throw a fit

kamen
ah dont worry about icc  theyre the least of your problems right 
now

hiroko
what do you mean

urioste walks up very serious  she interrupts

urioste
sorry  can i have a word

hiroko
sure  whats up

urioste
threepump failed a halfhour ago  the algae must have clogged up an 
intake duct

kamen
think i spoke too soon

hiroko
again  how long before we start noticing the difference

urioste
i reckon itll be another day before the smell gets unbearable  
beauvais usually fixes it but ah

hiroko knows what she means  beauvais is dead

hiroko
can you handle it

urioste
sure i can manage  but im not going into the pit on my own

hiroko   to urioste
alright get somebody from the autoshop   to kamen   is that 
alright

kamen
yeah no problem  ask diller hes good with his hands

urioste exchanges a grin with cassie

cassie
ill go along with that

a shrill trilling from his console communicator makes parsons leap up 
to answer

parsons
parsons   long beat   yeah  hold on

int  ryushi station  infirmary

a close up of an eye bright blue and dilated  doc revnas shining a 
hand held light into acklands face  acklands regained 
consciousness but is far from happy  hes sitting on the edge of a 
cot in the base infirmary an antiseptic room full of automated medical 
equipment  the autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby a 
circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting 
blades and surgical paraphernalia

ackland
hey cmon doc i feel fine  really

revna flicks off the probe

revna
headache  dehydration

ackland
the heads okay but i could sink a sixpack

revna
forget that  i want you off alcohol for at least seventytwo hours  
ive got some toxin buildup tests still to run

revna shakes her head and turns to kamen

revna contd
hes broken a fever that would kill a mule but if he says hes alright 
im prepared to believe him  hes all yours

hiroko enters  she watches from behind kamen

kamen
what happened out there ack

ackland   consternated
what do you mean what happened  what am i doing back here  wheres 
york

hiroko   insistent
whats the last thing you can remember

ackland thinks hard

ackland
we watched a meteor hit over linsons

hiroko and kamen exchange significant glances

hiroko
a meteor

ackland
yeah it impacted really off  we went out to the crashsite and 
uh thats thats all

kamen
nothing else

ackland
no

kamen turns to revna

kamen
show him fido

revna pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack  she 
hands it to ackland  he studies the dead facehugger floating inside 
with morbid fascination

revna
ring any bells

ackland tries hard to think but its as if a walls slammed down hard 
on his mind

ackland
not really no  ugly little sonuvabitch what is it

kamen
we thought you might be able to tell us i found it by your cot at the 
camp  you were out cold

ackland
what did york say

hiroko
yorks vanished

ackland
vanished

hiroko
beauvais and minh are dead ackland  yorks gone awol unless you can 
help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion hes the prime 
suspect right now

the news hits ackland hard  he falters and leans back addressing 
revna

ackland
can i um have some water  please

revna
sure

she goes to fetch a cup

int  ryushi station  commissary

its lunchtime and the sound of machinery steaming food mixes with the 
chatter of the twentyorso personnel eating there  hiroko and kamen 
are deep in conversation across a table

kamen
do you believe him

hiroko
ackland  i dont know him well enough to say  if we were back on 
earth we could run him though an aldhoven test and find out for sure  
theres not much we can do out here

kamen stares hard at her  thats not much of an answer and hiroko 
knows it she capitulates

hiroko contd
alright then for what its worth yes i do

kamen digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork

kamen
you should try this seasoned stuff  its good

guttierez approaches the table carrying something

guttierez
got a present for you

he hands hirokos leather jacket over to her

hiroko
oh ive been looking for this  where was it

guttierez
you left it in the chopper  oh and before i forget don  i ran that 
test you wanted on the turbines

kamen
and

guttierez
and nothing  they checked out just fine

ext  ryushi station  platform  afternoon

a metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform  diller leans 
against it down by the access ramp smoking a cigarette and idly 
blowing rings into the air  brewster pricks up her years and begins to 
quietly snarl  diller glances down at her curiously

diller
whats the matter girl  you smell something

now the rhino are restless too  cassie walks across the concrete 
roadway to join them

cassie
rhinos look a little antsy

brewster stops snarls and progresses onwards to fullfledged barking

diller
yeah  never seem em act like this before

predatorvision  
cassie and diller are warm but the rhinos are brewster are hotter 
still  their voices and brewsters barks are filtered to the point of 
unrecognizability eerily distorted

cassies the first to hear the sound

cassie
do you hear that

diller straightens up looking out into the surrounding trees  its a 
faint hum getting louder every second

diller
yeah

a hoverbike appears trailing smoke from one of its turbine intakes as 
it hurtles towards the base  halfway between the trees and the ramp 
it clips a fallen log and spins endoverend  its rider flies through 
the air and hits the swamp facefirst  diller and cassie race down the 
ramp with brewster yelping excitedly in the lead

cassie
i dont believe it

diller splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the 
mire its york  blood has caked around his wounded leg

diller
he looks in a bad way  help me get him up to infirmary

cassie
wait a minute

something else has caught cassies eye  a something almost two 
metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike  
grasping the haft firmly she works it free  cassie examines the 
predator spear and slowly shakes her head

cassie contd
holy mary

predatorvision
the concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the 
weapon over in her hands

int  ryushi station  infirmary

revna sits at a desk and peers into a microscope  every so often she 
grunts in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal  
the stasis tube containing the dead facehugger stands to one side of 
the computer screen  the infirmary is very quiet and only the gentle 
throb of the airconditioning intrudes  ackland tosses uncomfortably 
on his cot  he finally sits up and massages his chest

ackland
oh  oh god

revna lowers her pen and looks across

revna
what is it

ackland
its nothing doc  just a touch of indigestion something

revna
do you want a tablet

ackland winces in pain  his breathings getting heavy  he nods

ackland
uhhuh

revna gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy  acklands 
beginning to cough now

revna
that sounds nasty  ill give you a couple of demazine

ackland nods again  his coughing has deepened and now hes banging 
his chest with a balled fist  revna hurries over with three red 
tablets and a disposable cup of water  ackland takes them gratefully 
and gulps them down the effect is almost immediate ackland quietens 
and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips

revna contd
better

ackland
yeah

before he has a chance to elaborate ackland coughs once more  a thin 
spray of blood and saliva dots revnas white smock and speckles her 
cheek acklands scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to 
hyperventilate she pulls away dragging him from the bed in the 
process  he falls to the floor his moans growing in volume

revna
hold on its alright  im gonna give  you a shot

her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical 
instruments she finds a pneumatic sprayinjector fully charged with a 
vial of amber liquid attached  ackland screams and fall backwards onto 
the floor his hands clawing at the air  revna fumbles with the 
injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm  ackland 
convulses once then goes still his eyes staring fixedly at the 
ceiling  the infirmary is deathly quiet once again

we hear a gentle cracking like twigs being snapped  revna watches in 
horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across 
the floor from below acklands corpse  revna shudders as the body 
moves a little then is rolled over by something underneath it

what she sees  acklands body slumps forward onto its front 
revealing a gaping cavity in his back  bits of spine and ribcage are 
just visible  a chestburster  the second stage of the alien lifeform 
 pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from its body with a pair of 
stillunderdeveloped arms

around its head is a distinctive nascent crest  it kicks away from 
ackland with a powerful push from its legs quickly gaining balance  
after a moment appraising its new environment it stalks off behind a 
table  revna thinks quickly  she leaps forward and thumps a large red 
stud next to the pressuredoor which promptly rumbles closed

the room is bathed in pools of shadows  plenty of hiding space for the 
creature  revna hears breaking glass making her start  she 
cautiously edges over to the autodoc and looks up into the forest of 
probearms 

theres a wicked looking blade there the kind used in major surgery  
revna reaches up and twists the base it detaches easily  now shes 
armed stooped over she begins to stalk the chestburster

theres a flurry of movement and suddenly the hunter becomes the 
hunted the chestburster vaults from the table at her with a shrill 
shriek and revna blindly swings her makeshift knife in defense  we 
hear a sizzle like frying bacon

int  ryushi station  infirmary corridor

hiroko sprints down the corridor and reaches the infirmary  diller 
cassie and a few others are crowded around outside  york lays 
unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door making 
access difficult  above them a hinged flap on the wall lies open 
revealing a circular mechanism beneath  brewster scratches at the 
bulkhead and whines  muffled thumps come from within

hiroko
what happened

diller
york just turned up outside  were trying to get him into infirmary

hiroko   astonished
york

hiroko leans over to examine him but a particularly loud crash from 
within the infirmary distracts her

hiroko contd
whats going on

cassie
the doors sealed from inside  doc revnas in there and it sounds 
like acklands going nuts

hiroko
force the door

diller
cant  its pressure sealed

guttierez races up and hands diller a wrench with a shaped tip

guttierez
here

diller
thanks

he inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard the physical 
effort showing on his face  the door grinds open about eight inches 

the bloodied chestburster forces itself through the narrow gap hissing 
vehemently  yellow fluid wells from a wound in its crested skull 
dissolving everything it comes into contact with  the small group 
gathered around fall back in panic jarring yorks trolley and knocking 
hiroko to the floor  brewster barks at the chestburster which tenses 
as if to leap
diller brings the wrench down but the chestburster evades his blow and 
takes flight  it strikes at hiroko who reflexively draws her head 
back and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek  
the alien disappears down the corridor leaving a trail of smeared 
blood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring  
guttierez bends down and
helps hiroko to her feet  shocked she mutters something to herself in 
japanese and regains some of her composure

hiroko
get after it dont let it get away

diller stands there with the metal bar  does she think hes nuts

hiroko contd
go on

this galvanises diller  he races off in pursuit

hiroko contd
jan give me a hand over here

hiroko and guttierez try to force the door but diller was right  it 
wont budge  hiroko slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around 
blindly  she must have hit the control knob because the door slides 
back  cassie looks inside

cassie
oh my god

she turns away and retches  hiroko steps through and goes pale  there 
are bloodsmears over everything and its all guttierez can do to stop 
brewster from getting in there

int  ryushi station  command center

parsons finger traces a path along a set of computer schematics 
displayed on a suspended glass screen

parsons
it left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here

hiroko
what is that

diller
secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system  i found the grating 
ripped right off  the little fucker was strong

hiroko
where does that lead to

parsons
central pumping  all the waste gets  treated brokendown and flushed 
out into the swamp  if it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked
out

hiroko
youve checked that end

guttierez
not yet no

hiroko
do it  i dont want that thing on my installation  i want it caught 
and destroyed

kamen
cornering it shouldnt be a problem  each part of this station is 
basically a selfsufficient deepspace transport module running off 
external couplers  if we disconnect them and seal off every section 
weve got a ceiling of about thirtysix hours on internal power  that 
should give us ample time to find it

hiroko
alright  pull some trackers and headsets out of stores and ill sign 
a release for the weapons  cassie organise a team roster and put it 
on the board

cassie nods soberly  hiroko looks at everybody and her words are 
carefully chosen

hiroko contd
i dont care how you kill this thing just be careful not to get in 
its way when it bleeds  you all saw what happened to doc revna

there are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round

hiroko contd
nobody wander off on their own until its found  keep in pairs  
diller once the first teams done their sweep i want you to go down 
with annie to threepump while she replaces it

diller
okay

hiroko
one final point  killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in 
itself  however just to add a little incentive im authorizing a 
hefty bonus in the next paypacket for whoever does

this seems to appeal to those assembled there  theres a palpable buzz 
in the air

hiroko contd
alright lets get to it  new york rules apply

int  ryushi station  executive office

york is recounting his story to kamen and hiroko in a hushed voice  
small beads of sweat stand out on his forehead and his eyes are haunted 
by remembrance  the mans a mess

york
i mean these these mothers were were huge  they look like 
bushmen but they had all this hitech shit strapped all over em  
they mustve wasted beauvais and minh inside thirty seconds  minh got 
off a couple of shots from that cannon of his but he might as well 
have been using a bb gun  i dont know how the hell i made it out of 
there alive

he nods toward the predator spear in hirokos hands

york contd
the one i clipped with the hoverbike shoved that at me  whatever its 
made of it went straight through a doublelayer of honeycomb polyalloy 
composite like it was butter

york shakes his head in fear

york contd
i dont wanna ever come up against those things again  ever

kamen claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him

kamen
dont worry about it yorkie  youre safe now  go get come rest

york nods  he gets to his feet and leaves the room  hiroko waits 
until the door slides shut behind him

hiroko
so what do you think

kamen
what do i think  i think if those marines from powell dont shift 
their butts getting here were gonna get caught up to our necks in the 
middle of something we shouldnt

ext  ryushi station  platform  dusk

its late and the bases exterior lighting casts yellow pools of light 
across the metal and concrete thoroughfares  guttierez and de vries  
a toughlooking afrikaan woman with a think accent  looks uneasily 
about them another group of people with trackers and guns are 
searching around in the background  nearby the vertical yellow column 
of a suspensioncrane gantry towers high above

de vries
cmon man  one more sweep

guttierez
one more sweep one more sweep  im getting tired of one more 
fuckin sweep were been lookin for this thing for three days now 
and found zip

de vries
ah quit griping  keeps you in shape doesnt it

guttierez
hey  i was in shape before we started doing this

de vries pauses listening to the sound from the surrounding forest

de vries
listen to that

guttierez cocks his head and listens  he has no idea what she means

guttierez
listen to what

de vries
thats what i mean  this is the quietest ive ever heard it  its 
unnatural

guttierez shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable 
blackness beyond the confines of the base

guttierez
de vries

de vries
yeah

guttierez
next time you have a thought like that keep it to yourself

brewster the dog stares in fascination at the rhinos through the 
meshwork fence of their pens  the animals move around in agitation  
not at her but at something else

de vries
something spooking the rhinos

guttierez
i dunno

ext  ryushi station  swamp level  dusk

predatorvision 
the rhinos the dog and the two humans can be seen way above on the 
platforms edge bright red

indistinct inside their camouflage cloaks the small group of predators 
wade carefully through the water towards the base of the installation

int  ryushi station  pump room

darkness  diller and uriostes voices heard os in hushed tones  the 
scraping of metalonmetal

diller
what is thatis that it

urioste
no  i think thats a regulator valve hold on

theres more noise

urioste contd
ah got it

about a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber 
illuminate  three others flicker erratically one of them remaining 
unlit diller waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse
rifle level he enters followed by urioste  shes carrying a portable 
 but bulky  piece of machinery

urioste
are you getting anything

diller   sarcastic
yeah eyestrain  whats with the lights

urioste
theyre always like that  headoffice are real cheap when it comes to 
spares  wave that thing in the corner

diller sweeps the tracker carefully around  the small screen registers 
nothing

diller
the rooms clean

urioste
great

urioste pulls at a twopiece hexagonal grating set in the center of the 
floor  its heavy and thick with grease but she doesnt seem to mind 
below it is what looks like a round metal plug  recessed into its 
surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve with handholds on 
either side  she turns the lever  theres a loud clunk and a plume 
of steam jets out of the valve

urioste contd
give me a hand with this

grunting the two of them pull the thick metal plug clear of the pit  
murky water sloshes around below  urioste pulls a second lever and 
hidden pumps make the water level drop rapidly

urioste contd
pass me over that tripod will you

leaning against the wall behind diller is a sturdy metal tripod topped 
with a blockandtackle arrangement  a hook dangles below this its 
thick metal cabling going up through the blockandtackle and 
connecting to the drum of a small industrial winch attached securely to 
the wall  diller hands the tripod over to urioste  she splays the 
legs apart and inserts their tips into matching holes around the open 
pit

ext  ryushi station  platform  dusk

guttierez and de vries walk over to the rhino pen brewster pulling at 
her leash  guttierez frowns at what he sees  all the rhinos are 
nervously huddled together in the far corner

guttierez
thats real peculiar behavior

de vries fingers a rough metal edge

de vries
hey guttierez

guttierez
what

de vries
take a look at this

guttierez moves over for a closer look  theres a torn hole in the 
meshwork just big enough for a rhino to squeeze through  blood and 
fragments of skin coat the edge of the gap

guttierez
one of em must have escaped

de vries
thats impossible man  this fence is hightensile  the breaking 
toleranced stand up to the strain of a rhino easy i know i put it 
up

guttierez shines the flashlight along the deck  a trail of smeared 
blood runs all the way to the perimeter  the surrounding fence has 
been buckled and twisted  they cross to it and look down at the swamp  
the torch beam sparkles on the murky water far below

guttierez
theres no way a rhinod survive that drop

de vries
goldsmiths gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies

guttierez
thats a fact

guttierez tracker starts to bleep  he raises it excitedly

guttierez contd
whoa wait a minute

de vries
what

guttierez
just got a reading

int  ryushi station  command center

most of the lights in admin are off and the rooms deserted  parsons 
is seated away from his usual station at a console topped by ten 
monitor screens each displaying a securicam picture  he looks tired  
kamen comes up behind him carrying two mugs of coffee

kamen
hows it going

parsons
yeah good evening to you too

he takes the coffee gratefully and sips at it

parsons contd
todays partys finished their sweep the relief teams out there now  
everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the autoshop

kamen

parsons

kamen

parsons

ext  ryushi station  platform  dusk

guttierez sweeps the tracker slowly around and brewster begins to 
gently snarl  
de vries pulls on the dogs leash to quieten her

guttierez
its up there somewhere

he shoulders his rifle

guttierez contd
come on

a metal ladder runs up the side of one of the base buildings  
guttierez crosses to it and starts to climb the first few rungs

de vries
what  are you nuts  just the two of us

guttierez
ive seen this mother de vries  we can bag it no problem

de vries
forget it man

guttierez
cmon de vries  think of the bonus

de vries
fuck the bonus  i hate heights  you wouldnt get me up there even if 
it wasnt night

guttierez starts to climb the ladder

de vries
what the hell are you doing

guttierez
hey fair enough  if you wont come ill handle it myself

de vries runs her fingers through her hair in frustration  comes to a 
decision counter to what she wants to do

de vries
wait a minute

guttierez stops climbing

de vries contd
alright okay  look

guttierez
what

de vries
ill come with you

brewster barks  she drags the dog over to a metal stanchion and ties 
the leash around it

de vries contd
but im going first

guttierez
anything you say mammacitta

she climbs around guttierez and begins to ascend the ladder  brewster 
whimpers and plaintively barks after them

ext  ryushi station  rooftop level  dusk

the rooftop is dark mysterious  pieces of retrofitted junk can be 
seen in silhouette edged in light from way below  de vries and 
guttierez carefully step over the threshold  they speak in whispers

de vries
careful of that edging there

guttierez
yeah i got it

although we have an outstanding view of the night lights of the base up 
here the immediate gloom is impenetrable 

de vries
wheres that flashlight

by way of an answer a powerful ray cuts a swathe through the air  de 
vries takes the torch from him and shines it on the ground  circular 
extractor fans rotate quietly in the gloom

de vries contd
still got him

guttierez
its moving slow  about eleven metres on the left

de vries plays the flashlight across the rooftop

guttierez contd
little bit further

the beam comes to rest on a protruding piece of apparatus  a short
range antennae about seven feet wide

guttierez contd
yeah yeah yeah  right there right behind the antennae  i think 
were got it cornered

ext  ryushi station  platform  dusk

hiroko bends down to inspect a small plastic grating fitted flush with 
the roadway  the broken grillework is melted outwards  kamen and two 
other men  caldwell and thomas  stand behind

thomas
the door to the food storage locker was smashed open  it must have 
come straight out of here

hiroko yawns

hiroko
alright  keep your eyes peeled

she voices her concern to kamen

hiroko contd
if it got out of the systems it could be anywhere

ext  ryushi station  rooftop level  dusk

its very quiet and we can hear the nervous breathing of guttierez and 
de vries as they cautiously stalk forward

guttierez
hold it hold it

de vries
whats wrong

guttierez
im picking up another signal

de vries looks around unnerved

de vries
what  where

guttierez
just behind us over to the right

de vries shines her beam over the surface of the yellow crane to their 
rear shifting her attention toandfro from it and the antennae

de vries
cant see a thing  are you sure

guttierez
yeah i

the second blip on the small screen abruptly vanishes

guttierez contd
wait  lost it

de vries
how

guttierez
i dunno  might be a glitch

from behind the metal disc there comes a shuffling sound followed by a 
metallic thunk  this gets their attention  the two of them halt in 
their tracks

de vries
oh man  thats no glitch

guttierez
its alright its cool

de vries
is it still moving

guttierez
no hes stopped hes totally still just take it nice and easy babe  
nice and easy

a small manylimbed shape hurls itself from the confines of its hiding 
place with a feral shriek  de vries yelps in surprise and looses off 
a spray of bullets

ext  ryushi station  platform  dusk

hiroko looks up startled by the sound of gunfire  she sees the 
rooftop of one of the building modules lit by tracer fire  brewsters 
tethered nearby barking furiously

int  ryushi station  pump room  pump shaft

a think metal cable connected to her jacket harness suspends urioste in 
the gloom of the pump shaft  in front of her is a machinepart we saw 
her carry earlier  with the strap of a flashlight clenched in her 
mouth shes just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of 
machinery in an alcove with simultaneously doing her best not to touch 
the walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge

the report of de vries weapon can be heard even down here perhaps 
more startling in the confined space  urioste jumps dropping the 
flashlight into the water in the process

int  ryushi station  pump room

diller turns away from the winch and peers into and beyond the access 
tunnel leading outside  uriostes voice floats up out of the shaft 

urioste   os muffled
what was that

diller   raising his voice
something outside

ext  ryushi station  rooftop level  dusk

the wind whips at guttierez as he blinks away his shock

guttierez
holy shit

de vries keeps her torch beam on the moving shape  it halts by the 
edge of the roof and stares at them

de vries
oh nice going man  it was a lemur a goddamn lemur

guttierez radio headset crackles to life

hiroko   os on headset
guttierez what the hells going on up there

guttierez
uh sorry about that boss  everythings fine  false alarm thats 
all

de vries glances around the rooftop annoyed

de vries
hey look lets forget it  theres nothing up here

predatorvision  
de vries in closeup glowing brightly  her voice replayed and 
distorted

predator   os
nothing up here  nothing up here

int  ryushi station  pump room  pump shaft

uriostes flashlight bobs upanddown on the water below still lit and 
well out of reach

urioste    disgustedly
shit

diller   os muffled
whats the matter

urioste
ive dropped my torch into the water give me about uh a meter
andahalfs worth of slack

diller   os muffled
okay

int  ryushi station  pump room

diller crosses to the wallmounted winch  on the mechanisms side is a 
luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters  he 
pulls a throwswitch and the display slowly changes from 8 to 95 
as the cable feeds out

int  ryushi station  pump room  pump shaft

urioste descends the dingy shaft partially abseiling off the walls  
her feet almost tread water  shes down as far as she can go

urioste contd
whoa whoa

int  ryushi station  pump room

uriostes voice echoes up out of the pit

urioste contd  os muffled
thats enough

diller locks the winchswitch back into its up position  the whine 
of the cablefeed stops immediately

int  ryushi station  pump room  pump shaft

urioste stretches out to the floating lamp flexing her fingers  
its just about in reach

six slender fingers explode from beneath the waters surface and clamp 
like a vise around uriostes wrist  a sleek eyeless head follows 
trailing a body straight out of a charnelhouse nightmare  a scream 
forms in her throat rapidly cutoff as the aliens other hand clamps 
firmly over her mouth jerking her downwards

int  ryushi station  pump room

diller whirls in response to the choked cry from below  he sees the 
winch tripod above the shaft rattle the cable going taut as an 
anglers line the wallmounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps 
from its clamped position freely unspooling cable at a frightening 
rate  the digital counter flickers rapidly 
111151212513  diller watches the tripods tubular 
legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain  he scrambles for 
the winchlever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place the 
overstressed cable vibrating with a low metallic twang as it hits the 
shafts edge  dillers moment of satisfaction is shortlived the 
deepsunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by 
the colossal force from below  he leaps aside avoiding the heavy 
piece of machinery as it hurtles towards him  watches it disappear 
noisily into the conduit

diller
annie

dillers quivering fingers grope for his flashlight

diller contd
annie

he feverishly reaches the shafts edge and peers into the darkness

what he sees  the torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the 
alien emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft 
walls towards him  recoiling in horror he makes a run for the door  
halfway there he remembers his pulserifle and dives to the floor 
grasping it just as the alien reaches the top  diller fumbles with the 
safety and give the creature a full blast on rockandroll blasting it 
back into the pit

ext  ryushi station  rooftop level  dusk

guttierez and de vries hear the gunfire from below

guttierez
the hell was that

the predators gaze snaps away from the two humans and down onto the 
platform below  he watches the infrared shapes of other people 
running towards the source of the shots

dillers on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as another 
aliens claws emerge from the exposed hole  he races across the 
threshold and slams the thin inner door closed

ext  ryushi station  platform  dusk

in a handheld shot were running with hirokos group along the narrow 
catwalk bridging the roadway to the pump room kamen taking the lead  
diller sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides 
with him 

kamen
kev wha

diller breaks free of the other mans grasp  he looks as if hes about 
to say something but never gets the chance

theres a sound of tearing metal and a hissing sevenfoot express 
train of teeth and biomechanical limbs erupts from the shadows

ext  ryushi station  rooftop level  dusk

predatorvision  
gazing down at the platform an unseen hunter watches the swift black 
shape of the alien in amongst the group of humans

from the corner of her eye de vries sees something moving nearby  she 
violently pulls guttierez out of the path of the shimmering form that 
barges past them launching itself from the rooftop

parsons sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed 
to his bank of screens by an exterior securicam 

parsons
oh my god

ext  ryushi station  platform  dusk

with superhuman strength the alien brutally backhands diller 
splintering his skull and killing him instantly  his body caromes into 
thomas knocking the man to the floor  the alien turns to kamen its 
questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the 
ground  the space on the catwalk it limited theres so many people 
its impossible to get a clean 
shot

hiroko
move  get out of the way

hiroko draws a bead on the alien  she flips off the safety on her 
rifle its the tiniest click but the alien somehow senses danger  
its skeletal tail lashes out sending both her and the weapon flying  
caldwell gets in for his shot but the tails there in a second  it 
strikes like a snake once  twice  the stinger punctures caldwells 
chest and throat  nobody could survive something like that

the alien flicks its skull back around to kamen  the mans head is 
inches away from its eyeless facea row of burnished metal teeth 
openthe toothed inner tongue ready to strike

whoomph  something lands heavily closeup jarring the catwalk  the 
alien drops kamen and whirls  a spear wielded by an invisible form 
appears out of nowhere and pierces the aliens midriff spraying acidic 
fluid  the creature emits a outraged shriek and flails around its 
ubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant  the stinger 
makes contact  theres a sputtering sound as the predators cloaking 
device begins to flicker spasmodically giving us peekaboo glimpses 
of its natural form  electrical sparks dance around the predators 
ruin wristcomputer luminous green blood welling from a wound in his 
arm

from out of the pump room comes more noise like metal being trashed in 
a compactor  hiroko screams at kamen whos coughing painfully next to 
the door panel

hiroko
get the door

kamen hastily slaps the close button and both halves of the exterior 
pressure bulkhead rumble together  a second alien appears from the 
shadows within and prises its fingers into the dwindling gap 
struggling for purchase  despite the aliens best efforts the door 
motors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid 
clunk  muffled pounding comes from the other side

nearby thomas has retrieved caldwells weapon in the heat of the fight 
and is bringing it to bear on the predator  at the last possible 
moment hiroko sees what hes about to do

hiroko
no

reflexively she knocks the barrel away as thomas looses a volley of 
shots

predatorvision 
the predators speech analyser plays back her vocal patterns as white
hot bullets sear the night

predator
no

snapping in for a closer look at her

predator contd
no

one of the aliens hands clamps firmly onto the predators mask and 
wrenches it off  hiroko stares at the predators face in fascination  
from the distinctive features we see that its broken tusk  the 
predators good hand flashes down to his thigh almost too quick to 
follow  in one rapid movement a circular smartweapon is brought up 
slicing the front of the alien skull away from its head  in a feat of 
strength the predator lifts his opponents corpse on the end of the 
spear and hurls it over the catwalk railing

not wasting a second broken tusk performs an almostvertical bound of 
some twenty feet with astounding grace  he grips a pipe running down 
the side of one of the building modules then clambers over the roofs 
edge and finally disappears from view  brewster continues to bark 
frenetically 

hirokos headset has been knocked to the floor and a frantic muted 
voice is coming from it  she picks it up and presses the transmit 
switch

coughs a few more times

hiroko

kamen rubs his throat  he nods

kamen

brewsters barks cease replaced instead with a terrified low whining

de vries
whats with the dog

guttierez jogs over to brewster  lowers his rifle to the ground and 
fumbles with the knot tying the dog to the pipe

guttierez
hey cmon now girl  its alright  lets just get this knot 
undone

a spray of plastic shards explodes not three feet away from guttierez  
the rifle goes skittering away out of reach and he scrambles away as 
an alien halfpulls itself out of the sewer overflow wet and 
glistening

lashes out to grab the howling animal theres nothing guttierez can 
do  brewsters legs are the last thing we see thrashing helplessly as 
shes dragged down into the splinteredged gap

get out of there man

thomas grabs caldwells rifle from the deck  he races towards 
guttierez with 
de vries close behind 

thomas
catch this

from behind comes the sound of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid 
limbs struggle up out of newlybroken ducts  thomas heaves the rifle 
over the heads of the emerging aliens  although guttierez snags it 
awkwardly he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures

guttierez
chew on this

de vries races up to join them screaming as she fires  kamen glances 
down at this trackers tiny screen  it shows clusters of signals lots 
of them

kamen   hollering
theyre all around theyre in the drainage system

de vries reacts swiftly loosing a round of shots at the emerging 
aliens guttierez yells across to kamen

guttierez
get your ass out of here boss

pumped up with adrenalin kamen reaches an intersection and encounters 
a harrowing tableau  an alien blocks his way on the other side of a 
corridor bulkhead holding a struggling man above the floor  its 
pistonlike tongue shoots into the mans skull spraying gore

the alien sees kamen and its mouth twists into a bloody snarl  both 
kamen and the alien lunge forward together but kamens got the edge by 
a splitsecond  he strikes a bright red switch and the overhead 
pressure bulkhead slams down and locks into place  his breathing is 
heavy as he slowly backs away from the hatch

thomas brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger  he gets off 
one shot then nothing more happens  he looks at the counter on the 
side  it reads zero

thomas contd
shit im dry  youre up

de vries raises her rifle  she aims and

click

de vries
im jammed

thomas
youre what

she works the manual slide

de vries
its locked solid

thomas
quick give me the clip

de vries fumbles the ammunition clip from her rifle  it falls from her 
hands onto a plastic overflow grate  thomas leaps after itabout a 
second too late  it slips through the narrow gap gone for good

thomas contd
oh lord  please no  not now

int  ryushi station  executive office

hiroko enters her office at a run  she crosses to an inset control box 
on the far wall and presses a button  two exterior panels begin to 
slide closed behind the polycarbonate window

kersmash  fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes 
under assault from the razoredge tip of an aliens tail  in shock 
hiroko reflexively falls backwards onto the floor scrambling away  
she watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge 
outside fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously 
raining repeated blows on the window with its tail

the alien leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the 
onslaught showering splinters across the room  the twin shutters 
secure behind it closing on the creatures tail in the process  it 
hisses in indignation and thrashes about  like a lizard the segmented 
tail snaps in two  the freed alien staggers a little before gaining 
balance blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden 
floorboards  it sights hiroko and hurls itself in her direction an 
unstoppable killing machine

hiroko
holo on

her voice quavers so badly with fear and panic its a wonder the 
computer can recognize it  four ninja swordsmen promptly appear 
forming a semicircle between hiroko and the alien  the alien halts 
confused by this intrusion it swipes at the preprogrammed holograms 
bewildered by the lack of contact as its claws pass through them

gaining on a few seconds of bought time hiroko flings herself towards 
the predator spear lying forgotten nearby  the alien locks in on this 
sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her  hiroko 
grunts swinging the spear with her full strength

shes no superathlete but the cutting edges advanced metallurgy does 
the job  it slices halfway through the aliens skull and sticks 
there spewing yellow fluid everywhere  hiroko beats a hasty retreat 
as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor fumbling at the lodged 
weapon

int  ryushi station  corridors

hiroko reels into the outside corridor  she shrieks as her shoulders 
are seized from behind

kamen
come on

hiroko looks at kamen confusedly as he continues along the corridor

hiroko
thats the wrong way

kamen
detour  other ways blocked

ext  ryushi station  platform far side  dusk

back outside the aliens have sensed that somethings amiss  de vries 
turns desperately to guttierez

de vries
you got any slugs left

guttierez looks down at the counter on his slung weapon

guttierez
yeah  uh

de vries rips the weapon off his shoulder  guttierez completes his 
sentence

guttierez contd
seven

blam  blam  blam  de vries tries to make each shot count  she 
sights an alien crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical 
storage containers draws a bead on the metal tank and fires

a molten ball explodes outward transforming the immediate vicinity 
into a blazing inferno  the aliens body twists endoverend 
remaining immobile as it hits the deck  a curtain of fire ripples 
across the platform

thomas
yes

their victory is shortlived  the other aliens crawl cautiously 
forward flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed  we can 
clearly hear the hissing of their internal jaws

de vries
try again man

the headset in guttierez hand bleeps as it turns into the correct 
channel he yells into it

guttierez
matt  open these damn doors right now ill ream your ass so bad these 
things out herell seem like the easter bunny in comparison  swear to 
god

thomas turns and hammers on the impenetrable plate metal

thomas
open the doors  open the goddamned fucking doors

blam  blam  blam  click  guttierez bullets are gone

de vries
thats it  were dead

the first of the aliens rushes at them  this is the end  de vries 
screams

theres a blinding flash and most of the aliens head vaporises  
guttierez blinks is disbelief as hazy shapes comprised of refracted 
fire suddenly occupy the killing ground between the human and alien 
antagonists  intense bursts of light illuminate the platform as hi
tech predator weaponry far in advance of the humans sears the air

guttierez turns at the sound of the huge metal doors grinding slowly 
open just enough for them to get through

guttierez
move

int  ryushi station  autoshop

thomas pushes de vries through the opening with guttierez hurriedly 
following

the autoshop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one 
wall the front of a crawler pokes from one of them while in the 
center of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenancepit on 
a hydraulic platform  a handful of grease monkeys stands around the 
doorway brandishing powertools in lieu of firearms  a blonde surfer
type with long straggly
hair rushes over to them  this is matt their savior

matt
close it up close it up

guttierez stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up  
in the midst of the flames the aliens are fighting a pitched battle 
toothandnail with their unseen opponents  its like a scene out of 
hell

int  ryushi station  corridors

clusters of rotating emergency lights wigwag above hiroko and kamen as 
they flee through the maze of long corridors leading to the command 
center  kamen is falling behind as they approach a junction

hiroko
hurry it up

kamen
dont wait for me

hiroko and kamen race along the final corridor leading to the command 
center halfway down kamen turns in response to a jarring sound from 
the rear  the metal grating making up the floor is smashed violently 
from beneath

kamen
run

int  ryushi station  command center

the pandemonium from the outside corridors gets the attention of york 
and everybody else in admin  he crosses to the bulkhead doorframe and 
what he sees makes his eyes bug

york
jesus christ

he shouts back into the crowded room

york contd
theyre inside inside the corridor

int  ryushi station  corridor

hiroko and kamen try to outrun the tidal wave of twisted and broken 
steel that emerges in their wake  kamen yells with fright as an alien 
claw pinions his ankle  he trashes about clutching at anything to 
prevent himself being dragged beneath the floor  crying out is pain as 
slivers of edged metal slice into his hands

hiroko  anguished
no

int  ryushi station  command center

york stands frozen at the bulkhead frame staring down the corridor in 
horror  cassie races up and pushes him out of the way

int  ryushi station  corridor

hiroko looks furiously around  spying an emergency axe in its wall 
housing she smashes the glass with her elbow cutting herself in the 
process  hiroko hefts the heavy tool swinging it down onto the 
disappearing aliens carapace with all her might

hiroko contd
bastard

the blade bites deep and yellow blood bursts from the threshing 
aliens wound  speckles of it dot kamens leg eating through the 
material of his trousers and into the skin and muscle beneath  he 
screams a sound of pure intense pain

hiroko hurls the axe aside  she begins pulling kamen out of the hole 
as the caustic liquid seeps into the nearby electrical conduit  
theres a sparking followed by a flash and a sheet of flame  cassie 
steps through into the corridor just as valves evenlyspaced along the 
length of the tunnel open up jetting white highdensity foam under 
extreme pressure  the hatch to the command center at the far end 
begins to close

hiroko
cassie

cassies head shoots around

int  ryushi station  command center

york seizes a metal chair from behind a nearby console and wedges it 
into the narrowing divide  cassie squeezes through the gap and 
urgently hollers to hiroko

cassie
it you dont uh move your ass youre gonna need a helluva diet 
to get through here

int  ryushi station  command center

from cassies pov we watch hiroko supporting kamen and stumbling him 
along  foam fills threequarters of the corridor to their rear and is 
nearly up to their knees everywhere else  the chairs frame creaks 
ominously in protest

york
hurry up were losing it

cassies eyes widen in terror

cassie
behind you

hiroko turns to see the long phallic head of an alien emerge 
momentarily from out of the foam  something yanks at kamen and he 
disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise

hiroko
kamen

hiroko starts to thrash at the foam but cassie reaches out and drags 
her away

cassie
its too late

hiroko
nooooo

the chair begins to buckle collapsing in on itself

york
its going

with a supreme effort cassie yanks hiroko through the gap  york 
vaults clear as the chair snaps in two leaving the bulkhead to thunder 
closed the two women collapse in a heap on the floor

ext  ryushi station  platform  dusk

the battle outside is going badly for the predators  theres only 
three of them left and one is broken tusk

a projectile whistles through the air towards an alien expanding in 
flight into a wire capture net  barbed tips on each corner bite into 
the wall of a base module trapping the enraged creature  small motors 
whine as the thin metal pulls inward slicing into the aliens body
 
the predator savors the scene for just a secondwhich is a second too 
long aliens are all over him clawing and ripping at his body  the 
shouldermounted plasmacannon is unceremoniously yanked away and 
clatters to the floor

the predator goes down groping for the selfdestruct system on his 
wrist he manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar but 
gets no further  an alien pounces at him its tail descending  the 
predator raises his arm in reflex but the stinger smashes straight 
through the buries it in his faceplate taking out the wristcomputer 
in the process

int  ryushi station  command center

hiroko stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed 
disbelief

parsons
miss noguchi

no reaction  he tries again

parsons contd
miss noguchi

hiroko snaps out of it  she crosses over to the bank of monitoring 
screens

hiroko
whats the story

parsons runs through each of the screens

parsons
everything on this module is locked and sealed  weve lost b c 
and e wings but e was the only one we didnt manage to totally 
evacuate

hiroko
how many how many people are missing

cassie
unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far but the numbers are all over 
the place

hiroko
whats our weapons situation

driscoll  a big guy with a beard  laughs curtly

driscoll
shit  our armorys a big blue box from the back shelf of stores  we 
got about two clips left for an autoloader and thats it

hiroko
autoshop

cassie
autoshops sealed but those boys are cutoff

hiroko
has anybody talked to them

cassie
not yet

hiroko
do it

ext  ryushi station  rooftops  dusk

broken tusk and the other predator scramble up onto the rooftop in a 
bid to escape their unstoppable opponents  backtoback they take up 
fighting positions  a few seconds later the first of the aliens 
arrives

both the predators shoulder cannons blaze firing volleyaftervolley 
still the aliens keep on coming finally reaching the point where its 
handtohandand nothing else

its a vicious fast and bloody on both sides  broken tusk takes 
flight his companion is not as lucky  the other predator kicks an 
alien from him and over the roofs edge  the alien lashes out with 
lightningfast reflexes pulling the predator with it  both creatures 
hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of 
the modules  caught like flies in a spiders web  both thrash about 
severing cables as they do  electrical sparks crackle through the 
air

int  ryushi station  command center

everything electrical in the command center flickers momentarily and 
the bank of monitors turn to static  theres an instant of silence 
collective concerns amongst those gathered there

driscoll
what the hell

parsons
dont panic people  weve just switched over to internals

hiroko
they knocked out the external feeds

parsons
looks like it

cassie
thirty six hours

parsons nods

parsons
give or take

cassie
were not gonna make it are we

hiroko
get the autoshop online

parsons shakes his head

parsons
communications to autoshop go through an fo link off the main trunk  
thats down with the other feeds

hiroko
well try the headset

int  ryushi station  autoshop

spirits are low in the autoshop

matt
im tellin you its impossible  nothing can grow and reproduce this 
fast

thomas
yeah  right  you wanna go outside and tell them that

de vries
whats keeping those fucking marines man they shoulda been here by 
now

thomas lashes out at an empty can kicking it noisily across the floor

thomas
maybe they aint coming  maybe they dont even know weve got 
problems

guttierez
i dont wanna hear that kind of crap thomas  theyre coming  just a 
matter of time thats all

guttierez headset lies nearby  parsons muted voice comes out of it  
one of the grease monkeys snatches it up and listens

grease monkey
yo  guttierez

int  ryushi station  command center

parsons
through now

hiroko
jan its hiroko  what sort of shape are you in down there

guttierez   os on speaker
pretty damn good shape considering  you can tell don kamen from me 
his people have got balls of steel

hiroko
kamen didnt make it jan

theres a pregnant pause from the speakers

hiroko contd
jan

guttierez   os on speakers
yeah  i were still here  were all uh all sorry to hear 
that

hiroko
can you make it back

guttierez   os on speakers
uh id say that was a negative  if we open the doors those things 
are gonna swarm inside  theres another problem too

hiroko
whats that

guttierez   os on speakers
de vries put a round through the storage tanks over by the west pier on 
the way in here  right now the stuff sprayin out is just burnin up 
but if we get a blowback a good part of the station could go with it

cassie
oh man

hiroko
alright lets keep calm  weve got to have an option of some sort 
theres got to be a way out of this

york
oh yeah  like what

yorks kept quiet but everyone turns to him now  his tone is scathing 
and cuts to the marrow

cassie
well what about those other things outside those warriors  maybe we 
can cut some kind of deal

york looks around at them in incredulous disbelief



 page 84 missing 



int  ryushi station  autoshop

matt walks nervously around holding the headset  everybodys eyes are 
on him

matt
well it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load 
the admin module onto the back of big bertha  that way we could put a 
bit of distance

int  ryushi station  command center

matt contd   os on speakers
between us and the station  least till the guys from fort powell 
arrive

hiroko
that sounds promising  can we operate the crane from here

driscoll
nah  its got programmable facilities but it was never rigged for 
remote operation  someoned have to go up to the cab to get it up and 
running

hiroko
which mean physically going outside

driscoll looks around uneasily

driscoll
yeah

int  ryushi station  command center  lower deck

a small group of people most of whom we saw in the command center are 
clustered around a section of the poorlylit maintenance corridor  
hirokos wearing a black hitech catsuit a fetishists dream  across 
her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster  she nods at a 
pile of clothing in driscolls hands

hiroko
is this the suit

driscoll
uhhuh

she takes it from him  slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls 
it up  york watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his 
face

york
this is fuckin lunacy  youre not gonna make it across the platform 
on foot

cassie
shut up york

hiroko
no hes right  has anyone got a bike near here

a redheaded girl looks around hesitantly then raises her voice

redheaded girl
i have

hiroko
let me have the keys

the girl rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over  hiroko puts 
them in a pocket on the suits sleeve

hiroko contd
which one is it

redheaded girl
uh the hyundai racer  yellow and black stripes

york
oh yeah  real inconspicuous

hiroko
listen i dont care if its pink and purple polkadots as long as it 
gets me there in one piece  somebody loan me a headset

cassie pulls off hers and hands it over  driscolls watching hiroko 
fasten up the suit  he spots a mistake

driscoll
no go back  second clasp from the bottom

hiroko finds the offending clasp and locks it

hiroko
how much airtime have i got

cassie
about thirty minutes  those are slimmeddown tanks so no stopping to 
admire the scenery

hiroko
deal

cassie
weve dumped the whole database from one of the cleaning remotes into 
the helmet itll project the route through the sewer system onto the 
inside of the glass as you go

driscoll
yeah i stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the 
helmet pickups too  thats also on the display

hiroko
sounds great

parsons
its not all good news  we had to take off the helmet lights  youll 
be going in blind

hiroko
what  why

driscoll
we had to  they were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits 
youre gonna have to negotiate  besides all the crap floating around 
reduces visibility to the extent where i doubt having helmet lights 
would have make that much difference anyway  maintenance lights down 
there oughta be enough to do the trick

hiroko
how tight are these shafts

cassie and driscoll exchange worried looks

cassie
tight  we chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running 
into any aliens

hiroko takes a deep breath  beads of perspiration dot her forehead  
parsons nods

parsons
theres still time to backout

hiroko
forget it  i wouldnt ask somebody to do something i wouldnt do 
myself  wheres the disk

parsons hands over a vinylwrapped packet

parsons
dont lose it

hiroko slips it into a breastpocket and secures the flap

hiroko
dont worry  i wont

driscoll hands several metallic objects to hiroko

driscoll
here  if you got to use em make em count

theyre magazines for her gun  she slots them into the bandolier

hiroko
thanks

parsons
lets just run through it one more time so i know youve got it 
straight

hiroko
okay i pull the access panel off of the console  insert the disk and 
press the green enabling button

parsons   interrupting
no  theres two of them

she pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place

hiroko
sorry  two green enabling buttons

parsons
right  when youve done that dont waste any time getting out of 
there  once that crane starts movingwell its bound to provoke 
some kind of response

york hands over a sophisticatedlooking powertool

york
youll need this for the gratings trigger finger to operate thumb 
button to switch over to the rivet gun  the sensorsll choose blade or 
socket heads automatically

hiroko
right   long beat   okay im set

york and driscoll lower the massive domefronted helmet over hirokos 
head autoclasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar  
parsons clips the slimline airtank to her back and driscoll makes the 
connections 

parsons
alright lets open her up  carefully now

cassie and the others hold their weapons and motiontrackers steadily 
at a fixed point on the ground  two onlookers bend down to the 
pressurehatch beneath the floorgrating  its identical to the one 
diller and urioste removed earlier  a plume of pressurised gas jets 
into the air and they pull the metal sealingplug free  cassie 
scrutinizes her tracker

cassie
all clear

hiroko reaches up to her helmet and presses a chunky button on one 
side

hirokos pov
were looking through the transparent bowl of the helmet at the open 
shaft braken water sloshing around its rim  superimposed lines of 
glowing neon appear on the visors surface a precisely overlaid 
duplication of the scene in computergraphic form  a flatly
synthesised male

computer voice comes over the helmet speakers os

computer voice   os on speakers
approaching a module lower level venturiduct ds ohfour

hiroko gets down on her hands and knees and crawls towards the opening  
she stares at the murky water with mounting apprehension  tries to 
reassure herself

hiroko
okay  okay

she looks around at the impassive staring faces  summoning up her 
courage she submerges the helmet

hirokos pov
the pale illumination of the lower level decklights gives way to 
absolute nothingness a stygian nightmare  she shudders with horror 
and pulls her head free

hiroko contd
oh  oh god

she wipes frenetically at the slicklycoated visor breathing heavily 
worried hands grab her

cassie
are you alright

parsons
what  whats wrong  what is it

hirokos eyes dart around speaking volumes  she swallows hard and 
calms down

hiroko
its alright  im okay

steeling herself she takes a deep breath and plunges headfirst into 
the water once more

hirokos pov
everything goes to blackness again  the headupdisplay presents a 
view of the unseen tunnel in cheerful candyapple hues

computer voice   os on speakers
entering venturi duct en route to secondary overflow sump ds oh four

york watches hirokos feet disappear into the shaft

parsons
seal it

the heavy sealingplug is dragged across the grating and positioned 
over the hole  york shakes his head

york
suicide run man  fuckin suicide run

int  ryushi station  sewer system  venturi duct

cassie wasnt kidding about the venturiduct  its only about half
again as wide as hiroko  the only illumination comes from the hazy 
circle above  as the plug reseals the hole even thats gone

something flickers  two weak fluorescent tubes come on lighting the 
murk with a faint orange haze

cassie   os on speakers
all the comforts of home

hiroko
thanks cassie

cassie   os on speakers
dont mention it

she inches her way through the narrow space towards us breathing 
heavily the clicking of the motiontracker in her helmet is 
overwhelming in the  silence

ext  ryushi station  antenna array  night

the stations massive antenna array is being transformed  otherworldly 
shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to 
cover its surface  aliens drop from dizzying heights exuding streams 
of gelatinous gunk from the four exhaust pipes on their backs  
theyre building a nest of staggering proportions

unnoticed by the busy biomechanoids faint sparks flicker from the 
crane catwalk high above

ext  ryushi station  crane catwalk  night

broken tusk sits on the catwalk floor a small shower of sparks 
lighting his face  hes attempting to repair his broken wrist computer 
with an intricate tool  he removes it and presses a switch  the 
display glows briefly then fades  he inserts it again  electrical 
sparks crackle across the computers fascia before burning out  
broken tusk throws the ruined machine away in disgust

int  ryushi station  autoshop

from our pov high up near the roof of the autoshop we see thomas 
sitting on the raised hydraulic platform  he grunts as he pulls a 
valve on the crawlers underside

across the room the second crawler rumbles out of the far bay  one of 
the grease monkeys walks slowly backwards waving it on

grease monkey
okay  back  back  little bit more

he steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing

grease monkey contd
whoashit

the man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the 
floor scowls first then frowns  its sticky

over near the doors matt exhales deeply on a cigarette  de vries is 
nearby listening attentively as guttierez gets a message on his 
helmet

guttierez
she just set off

matt claps his hands together  just once  to get everybodys 
attention

matt
okay people  lets hustle

theres a scream from behind  they wheel around in time to see the 
grease monkey being tugged into the maintenance opening  thomas yells 
down from the platform

thomas
theyre comin up through the pit

a box with two large buttons  one green one red  dangles from the 
ceiling on the end of a cable  matt forces down the red control 
making the platform lower  several tons of machinery and crawler bring 
about the demise of the aliens as they reach the lip of the opening 
crushing their chitinous limbs to smithereens

an alien rolls out of the pit in time scrambling for the safety of the 
nearby shadows  de vries sights it

de vries
over there

one of the men has seen it  his head snaps up to a mammoth engine
block suspended from a winch high above  he leaps for the release
catch as the alien passes underneath  pulls hard on the grip  chains 
rattle noisily as the block thunders down  the alien begins to look 
up just a second too late  the heavy piece of machinery smashes into 
the creature flattening it instantly

unseen by anybody another alien has escaped to the roof of the 
platformbound crawler  it wraps its long bony fingers around the 
face of the man stifling his cries and pulling him off the deck  the 
loud clattering of his chainsaw bouncing off the floorgrating gets 
thomas attention

thomas
motherfucker

thomas retrieves the fallen tool and jams the on switch hard  the 
aliens tongue shoots through the grease monkeys skull showering 
thomas with a faint speckling of blood  the alien discards the body 
and lunges at thomas who counters bringing the chainsaw up

the blade slices into the creatures throat and up through its head 
thomas draws out the chainsaw quickly  something happens to the pitch 
of the blade a peculiar sound

the acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band  like a metallic 
snake it whips off its supporting frame

straight at thomas

int  ryushi station  sewer system  venturi duct

hiroko elbows her way further through the cramped waterfilled duct  a 
wide grille directly in her path blocks further headway

notations

drifting in

cassie  os on speakers

she places the tip of her powertool over the first of the grilles 
anchoring bolts  the complex mechanism whines as it selects the 
correct wrenchtip for the job

int  ryushi station  autoshop crawler cabin

thomas is laidout in the back seat of the crawlers cab with de vries 
and matt trying to staunch the wounds from the chainsaw bands impact 
to his chest  guttierez speaks into his headset mike

guttierez

int  ryushi station  sewer system  sump chamber

thump  thump  slam  the grille in knocked out of its housing and 
floats lazily off into the water  hiroko passes through the newly
created hole

hirokos pov  
she finds herself in an upright cylindrical chamber about five feet in 
height  massive extractor fans churn dangerously where both the floor 
and ceiling ought to be  kicking up a swirl of particles  pale blue 
light filters down from above

yeah yeah yeah

with difficulty she straddles the floor turbine  a vortex of water 
swirls around her as she brings the powertool up once more

parsons listens attentively  he clicks his fingers at cassie

parsons
where is she

cassie
comin up the central reservoir

uhdifficult to say  i think

cassie looks up worriedly

cassie
i found it

parsons
and

cassie
drains right into the central reservoir

parsons
get her online  now

int  ryushi station  sewer system  sump center

hirokos pulls her third bolt free  it drifts slowly downward 
slipping between the vanes of the floor turbine

a fragmented voice comes through on her headset distorted beyond 
recognition  hirokos forehead knits together in concentration and 
annoyance

hiroko
what was that  i dont copy

click  click  beep  the routine sound of the motion tracker changes 
suddenly  hiroko turns her attention from the taskinhand to study 
the trackers helmet readout  three nebulous blobs have appeared from 
offscreen  heading straight for her position

cassie turns to parsons in frustration

cassie
i cant reach her  too much signal breakup

parsons
keep trying

int  ryushi station  sewer system  sump chamber

wildly around the chamber  the only way out the way she came in

access to

hiroko stabs the exterior helmet control  the computer voice ceases 
while the beeping from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume  
whatever the signals are theyre almost on top of her

hiroko turns to the narrow entry duct  its position makes it 
virtually impossible to get back into  she tries anyhow

beepbeepbeepbeep  a rush of displaced water flood into the chamber 
flattening her against the wall  dark shapes thunder past the other 
side of the grille like express trains in the nightgoing away from 
hiroko  she twitches in fear and disbelief as the blobs on the monitor 
screen recede and finally disappear  the trackers pitch returns to 
its hollow clicking

ext  ryushi station  platform  night

broken tusk tries to be as unobtrusive as possible as he picks through 
the aftermath of the battle down by the nowempty rhino pen  he finds 
something a predator facemask with a massive crack down one side  
he turns it carefully over in his hands

int  ryushi station  sewer system  central reservoir

adhering to her helmet  blinded she raises a gloved hand and wipes 
the mucus away

shes inside the central reservoir a long cylindrical concrete tunnel 
some eighteen feet in diameter  the waterlevel comes up about half
way  what fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion

shes found the main offshoot of the aliens nest  glued into the 
curved walls by a secretive resin as bodies  humans rhinos lemurs  
other animals  most are dead their innards blown open  the rest are 
comatose twitching occasionally  every square inch not containing 
bodies is filled with alien eggs  its like hell for real

itself on the waters surface its powerful tail propelling itself 
back toward her  it contracts on itself preparing to leap  hiroko 
raises the powertool
reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again  fat rivets rip 
through the facehuggers body  it writhes around on the waters

primer cylinder out by its handle  jams it into the detonator and 
turns

go and no means of defending herself hirokos a goner  the lead 
aliens lethal doublebarrel teeth open  its almost on her  hiroko 
cries out

whoosh  the aliens face is severed in half  a circular metal object 
blurs through the air and loops back on itself almost faster then the 
human eye can follow  a massive form slams down in front of hiroko 
pushing her out of the way  she hits the deck hard and gasps  broken 
tusk is standing before her  he skillfully catches the frisbeelike 
smart weapon then
throws it again

aliens hissing alien jaws are silenced by broken tusks formidable 
fighting  technique  questing limbs are blasted and hacked away by 
advanced predator weaponry  acidic blood flows freely  the skirmish 
is surprisingly brief

broken tusk and hiroko stare at one another  broken tusk pulls a slung 
metal rod from his shoulder  two barbed tips schnick outwards forming 
a spear the predator looks at her and his lip curls  it takes a 
second for hiroko to realise hes offering it to her  bewildered she 
accepts it pulling herself up

a bright orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind getting both of 
their attentions  broken tusk regards her  his mandibles clickclack

hiroko splashes through the swamp towards the predator  broken tusk 
has paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform 
piers running directly out into the swamp  most of the drain is 
underwater with only about eight inches protruding from the water  
the thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted  broken from 
within

youve got to be joking  no way am i going back in there

no joke  broken tusk starts submerging to get across inside

broken tusk pauses for a moment  he gives her a look then disappears 
into the blackness  hiroko looks around  its no fun being the last 
person left alive here

hiroko emerges within an air pocket inside the drain  she shivers  
its just as dirty and cramped as she remembers  several of the 
maintenance lights down here are broken and visibility is minimal

wha

broken tusk whirls and clamps a hand across her mouth  she gets the 
message

int  ryushi station  sewer system  central reservoir

they exit the culvert through another smashed grate  hiroko finds 
herself back in the central reservoir again  she wades through the 
water behind broken tusk holding the spear above her head  the two of 
them look very vulnerable in here  they pass beneath the pulsating sac 
hiroko saw earlier it looks riper now ready to burst  an insidious 
pulsing noise  like a heartbeat  gains in volume the further they 
travel

int  ryushi station  sewer system  pump chamber

they come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by 
an enormous pump  alien gunk covers everything

hiroko gasps  high above it a queen alien nesting on top of the vast 
mechanism  its egg sac drapes around the pump spiraling down around 
it she seems to be asleep

broken tusk ignores the queen  his eyes are searching the multitude of 
forms  human and otherwise  cocooned into the walls  he finds what 
hes looking for  up on one wall is another predator  dead  its 
stomach blown open

hiroko holds her spear tightly  facehuggers pulse malignantly wrapped 
around several trapped victims  a number of empty eggs are scattered 
hereandthere

broken tusk looks around  no aliens  he begins climbing the organic 
fresco watching the queen alien carefully for signs of awareness  the 
bellowslike sound of her breathing is overwhelming  he reaches the 
entrapped predator its left arm is encased in a solidified mass of 
secreted resin  broken tusk raises his smart weapon and activates 
it

the splintering noise makes hiroko wince  she glances up at the queen  
its breathing start to change and its head moves

broken tusk sees it too  he hesitates for a moment  the queen 
settles and her breathing goes back to normal  broken tusk resumes 
his work chipping off the final chunk of coating  he sheathes the 
smart weapon and flips open the other predators wrist device  he 
withdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier and goes to 
work

down below hirokos backing away  she doesnt see the arm coated in 
slime that grasps at her hair  she shudders stifling a scream  her 
eyes are wide as she turns

its kamen  hes been embedded into the biomechanical frieze  when he 
speaks his voice is wracked with pain and suffering

hiroko fearfully says something beneath her breath in japanese

up on the wall broken tusk has finished his task  he slides the tip 
of a claw across the selfdestruct mechanism  its readout display 
illuminates with alien characters  he activates a button and the 
readout begins to blink

schnick

broken tusk pushes hiroko through the reservoir  an alien egg on a 
nearby wall peels open  before the facehugger even has a chance to 
spring broken tusk swings his wristblades in a wide arc cutting 
through the egg and its writhing contents

the two of them reach the deep end and have to wade  hiroko pushes 
herself along the biomechanical outcropping  ahead of them is the 
pulsing sac before theyre even passed beneath it they hear 
something  a sound like waterfilled balloons hitting wet concrete
 
the sac ruptures spattering thick gloopy matter  a form comprised of  
slender limbs emerges from within  an immature queen alien  though 
justborn its reflexes are razorsharp  it lashes out at hiroko and 
broken tusk  hiroko ducks and the queens claws embed themselves in 
broken tusks shoulder destroying his automatic cannon

rolling across the platform and seeping into the drainage ducts

columns of fire jet from fissures and openings inside the pump chamber 
rippling across the adult queen alien and her hapless victims  she 
begins to scream flailing around atop her metal throne 

int  ryushi station  sewer system  central reservoir

the adult queens shriek echoes through the reservoir accompanied by a 
ball of fire that travels part of the way down  the immature queen 
turns her head in reply answering with her own yowl

broken tusk hisses with hate and brings his smart weapon slicing 
down through her arm severing it at the wrist  hiroko simultanesouly 
drives her spear into the aliens chest  she grabs the injured 
predator and pulls him away from the thrashing creature

claws brush her trouser leg but close on thin air  she hits the deck 
and quickly closes the last few feet to the chopper

broken tusk stops  aliens are appearing all over the pad and out of 
nearby drainage ducts

int  chopper  predawn

hiroko slips into the choppers pilot seat  she flips a bunch of 
switches and the turbines rise in volume from a low whine to a dull 
roar 

ext  ryushi station  helijet pad  predawn

an orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind broken tusk  with the 
aliens blocking his path theres no refuge for him almost  the 
navigation tower looms overhead nearby  broken tusk takes a 
calculated risk and leaps for it

int  chopper  predawn

the helijet flies pretty much like a standard helicopter  hiroko 
pullsback on the collective and the turbines pitch changes from a 
throaty growl to a highpitched whine

ext  ryushi station  helijet pad  predawn

the helijet rises a little unsteadily  the wash from the turbines 
plays across the shrieking aliens

int  chopper  predawn

hirokos pov  through the canopy dome we see broken tusk climbing 
the navigation tower with the aliens close behind

hiroko
okay butch  i can play cavalry too

ext  ryushi station  navigation tower  predawn

broken tusk scales the ladder as quickly as he can  as the top of the 
tower is a gallery catwalk surrounding the flashing beacon array

the immature queen accompanied by a phalanx of warrior aliens is 
almost upon him  the predator drives his wrist knives into the throat 
of a grasping alien which falls downward writhing  it crashes into 
the queen who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork  she 
hisses lashing out at the creature  sends it hurtling to the ground

ext  ryushi station  tower catwalk  predawn

broken tusk makes it to the top  theres not much space on the catwalk 
to maneuver  he looks around then down  this is his last stand 
instinctively he reaches down to his wrist for the selfdestruct 
computer of course its not there

int  ryushi station  sewer system  pump chamber

the third row of digits on the alien destruct mechanism disappear  
times running outfast

ext  ryushi station  tower catwalk  predawn

broken tusk smashes his foot hard into the face of an alien  a blast 
of displaced air hits him like a sledgehammer  he turns

hirokos helijet hovers stationary just a few feet away from the 
tower the door on the copilots side flapping open  she hollers at 
the predator over the roar of the engines

hiroko
cmon  jump

broken tusk looks down  its a long dropbut its the best option 
available to him  he jumps

thwack  his hands grip the door frame  the helijet wobbles slightly 
its center of gravity shifting  broken tusk hauls himself up and 
through the door as

kerblam  a massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the 
storage tanks below ignite  the shock wave buffets the chopper against 
the tower

int  chopper  predawn

broken tusks pov
the grinning face of the young queen gets suddenly closer as the heli
jet is propelled towards the metal structure

ext  ryushi station  navigation tower  predawn

crunch  the chopper hits knocking several aliens from their 
handholds  one of the queens arms shoots out wrapping itself around 
the port engine mount

int  chopper  predawn

hiroko pushes on the stick  the helijet pulls awaythen tilts 
violently to one side engines desperately trying to compensate

ext  ryushi station  predawn

the queen is hanging from the beleaguered craft its weight drawing it 
slowly down  in the background the navigation tower begins to slowly 
collapse

int  chopper  predawn

hiroko wrestles the overtaxed controls

hiroko
shit

broken tusk turns towards her

hiroko contd
in the back  in the back

the predator may not understand her words but he can follow the 
frantic jerking of her hand  he twists around to look in the choppers 
rear

ext  ryushi station  predawn

hiroko pilots the helijet over the stations storage tanks  the 
conflagration below has gotten completely outofhand

ext  chopper  predawn

the queen is starting to struggle up its arms flailing for purchase

int  chopper  predawn

broken tusk pulls out a pulserifle from the rear  he quickly takes 
stock of it

hiroko
watch your shots  if you hit the engine youll blow us both to hell

broken tusk goes for the trigger  his index finger wont slide into 
the trigger guardits too big  he takes the guard in both hands and 
exerts pressure  snap  problem solved

int  ryushi station  sewer system  pump chamber

bleep  theres only one set of digits left on the destruct devices 
display counter

ext  chopper  predawn

a red dot of light runs across the queens head  she must sense it 
somehow her head comes round to bear

broken tusks got the pulserifle trained right on her

broken tusk
chewonthis

blam  a round open a nice neat hole in the queens head  she yowls  
blam a second round does the job  the queen relinquishes her grip and 
falls screeching all the way down into the raging inferno below

int  ryushi station  sewer system  pump chamber

the last segment of the destruct mechanisms display disappears  we 
hear a

highpitched tone

int  chopper  predawn

hiroko throws the joystick forward

ext  ryushi station  predawn

the helijet accelerates hellforleather away  an incandescent ball 
of energy expands outward vaporising the station and most of the 
surrounding bayou for about a miles radius

ext  linsons range  encampment  predawn

big berthas parked by the blinking blue beacon tower site of the ill
fated hunting expedition  about a dozen or so people are milling 
around smoking cigarettes or talking

matt and de vries are leaning against the wheels of matts crawler  
they feel the concussive shockwave and look upward

their pov 
above the treetops a blinding whitelight blurs out the horizon

matt
holy shit

int  chopper  predawn

gauges and other instruments are going crazy as the helijet rides the 
turbulence out

ext  chopper  predawn

a chunk of metal is propelled through the air and rips into the 
choppers starboard engine  theres a burst of flame then the 
extinguishers cut in

int  chopper  predawn

the helijets bucking like a bronco now and theyre losing height 
rapidly

hiroko
weve lost the starboard engine  were going down  hold on

ext  chopper  predawn

the chopper clips the tree boughs and bounces

int  chopper  predawn

hiroko and broken tusk are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls  
the glass cracks with the impact

hirokos pov  
leaves twigs and branches rush past as the helijet breaks through 
the canopy of foliage

ext  swamp  predawn

the helijet ploughs into the swamp floor with a sickening crunch 
spraying mud all around

int  chopper  predawn

the canopy implodes  a hail of glass shards rip through the cockpit 
spraying across hiroko and cutting her skin  she screams

ext  swamp  predawn

the chopper comes to rest in the swamp  the squawking of the local 
wildlife os gradually dies down

int  chopper  predawn

hiroko moves her head and groans  theres a nasty gash across her 
forehead she turns to broken tusk  the door frame on his side is 
buckled and twisted part of the metal has sheared off its sharp end 
impaling him through the shoulder  the predator coughs luminous green 
blood

hiroko
weve gotta get you out of here

ext  swamp  dawn

the sun begins to rise as hiroko exits the helijet and goes around to 
the other side  she manages to get the mangled door open  broken 
tusks wound looks even worse upclose

hiroko contd
hold on  this is gonna hurt some

hiroko gets her arm under broken tusks shoulder  the predator braces 
himself and starts to move  the agony is excruciating his mandibles 
open and he lets out a leonine roar

hiroko helps him out of the seat  the predator gets unsteadily to his 
feet what happens next is totally unexpected

broken tusks throat bursts fountaining green blood  shocked hiroko 
gets out of the path of the predators tumbling mass  she looks up

the alien stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts its 
sledgehammer tongue its head following her movements

the predators smart weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying 
bladedown in the mire  hiroko scoops up activating it and scrambling 
away  she gets to her feet and holds the humming disc before her

the alien climbs warily down from the helijet and the two opponents 
face each other like sumo wrestlers  hiroko assumes a defensive 
stance holding the disc ready to strike  the alien hisses its tail 
stinger coming around it leaps for her and battle is joined  the 
alien lashes out but hiroko counters by swinging the weapon time and 
time again  with each thrust surgically thin wounds open up on the 
biomechanoids body  one of the aliens attacks sends her reeling to 
the floor its stinger arching towards her  she parries slicing the 
tail in half and struggling to her feet

the alien strikes again  hiroko feints then thrusts lopping off one 
of its hands  the alien howls with pain blinding lashing out at her 
and sending the smart weapon flying from her grip

shes lost and the creature knows it  its lips curl into a snarl

kerpow  kerpow  the aliens head detonates and its skeletal body 
slumps forward to splash into the swamprevealing broken tusk 
pointing the pulse
rifle

the dying predator gurgles his head drooping  hiroko stumbles across 
to him  broken tusks in a bad way green gore is pulsing freely from 
its throat  it gazes up at hiroko

broken tusk
nota prettysight

and with that the predator dies

hiroko look around  the sun is rising above the treetops and the 
setting is serene  somehow beautiful

the speakers in the helijet cabin crackle to life jarring her

voice   os on speakers
rimward tracking station this is the one thirtysecond rim corp 
battalion operating out of the cruiser tartarus from fort powell  
please respond  over

theres a sound os like a thunderclap  hiroko surveys the horizon

hirokos pov  
a pair of marine dropships float above the distant rainforest their 
weapons arms unfurled like exotic armed insects searchlights probe the 
ground far below

a shadow falls over hiroko blocking out the sun  a monstrous shape 
occupies the air above delineated only by a telltale vibration  the 
predator shuttlecraft lowers its cloaking device extending landing 
gear and a ramp it touches down in the bayou with scarcely a whisper

hiroko watches the predators file slowly out  broken tusks body is 
borne aloft and carried back inside  the lead predator turns to 
hiroko  he crosses to her  hirokos face is reflected in the faceted 
eyepieces of the predators helmet

the extraterrestrial hunter pulls out his telescopic spear  kerchunk  
the tips lock into place  the predator offers it to hiroko  she 
accepts a little confused

theres a long moment  the predator is still standing there  waiting 
hirokos eyes narrow  her mind is working furiously  what do they 
want

she realises  it suddenly becomes clear  she smiles

hiroko
yeah  why not

hiroko glances back at the hovering dropships then walks around the 
waiting predator and into the shuttlecraft without looking back

the predator follows her  the ramp slams closed as we

cut to black
