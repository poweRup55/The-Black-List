                                aliens

        fade in

        sometime in the future  space                            1

        silent and endless  the stars shine like the love of
        godcold and remote  against them drifts a tiny chip
        of technology

        closer shot  it is the narcissus lifeboat of the
        illfated starfreighter nostromo  without interior
        or running lights it seems devoid of life  the ping
        of a ranging radar grows louder closer  a shadow
        engulfs the narcissus  searchlights flash on playing
        over the tiny ship as a massive dark hull descends
        toward it

        int narcissus                                            2

        dark and dormant as a crypt  the searchlights stream
        in the dusty windows  outside massive metal forms can
        be seen descending around the shuttle  like the tolling
        of a bell a basso profundo clang reverberates through
        the hull

        close on the airlock door  light glares as a cutting
        torch bursts through the metal  sparks shower into the
        room

        a second torch cuts through  they move with machine
        precision cutting a rectangular path converging  the
        torches meet  cut off  the door falls inward revealing
        a bizarre multiarmed figure  a robot welder

        figures enter backlit and ominous  three men in
        bioisolation suits carrying lights and equipment  they
        approach a sarcophaguslike hypersleep capsule fg

                                   leader
                           filtered
                    internal pressure positive  assume
                    nominal hull integrity  hypersleep
                    capsules style circa late twenties

        his gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the
        canopy

        angle inside capsule  as light stabs in where the dust is
        wiped away illuminating a woman her face in peaceful
        repose

        warrant officer ripley sole survivor of the nostromo
        nestled next to her is jones the ships wayward cat

                                   leader
                           voice over filtered
                    lights are green  shes alive 
                    well there goes out salvage guys

                                                        dissolve to

        int hospital room  tight on ripley  gateway station    3 

        shes lying in a bed looking wan as a female medtech
        raises the backrest  she is surrounded by arcane white
        medical equipment  the medtech exudes practiced
        cheeriness

                                   medtech
                    why dont i open the viewport
                    watch your eyes

        harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
        the ceiling revealing a breathtaking vista  beyond the
        sprawling complex of modular habitats collectively
        called gateway station is the curve of earth as seen
        from high orbit  blue and serene

                                   medtech
                    and how are we today

                                   ripley
                           weakly
                    terrible

                                   medtech
                    just terrible  thats better
                    than yesterday at least

                                   ripley
                    how long have i been on
                    gateway station

                                   medtech
                    just a couple of days  do you
                    feel up to a visitor

        ripley shrugs not caring  the door opens and a man
        enters although ripley sees only what he is carrying
        a familiar large orange tomcat

                                   ripley
                    jones

        she grabs the cat like a life preserver

                                   ripley
                           cooing babycat talk
                    come here jonesy you ugly old
                    mooseyou ugly thing

        jones patiently endures ripleys embarrassing display
        seeming none the worse for wear  the visitor sits
        beside the bed and ripley finally notices him  he is
        thirtyish and handsome in a suit that looks executive
        or legal the tie loosened with studied casualness  a
        smile referred to as winning

                                   man
                    nice room  im burke  carter burke

                    see youre feeling better  im told
                    the weakness and disorientation
                    should pass soon  side effects of
                    the unusually long hypersleep or
                    something like that

                                   ripley
                    how long was i out there  they
                    wont tell me anything

                                   burke
                           soothing
                    well maybe you shouldnt worry
                    about that just yet

        ripley grabs his arm surprising him

                                   ripley
                    how long

        burke gazes at her thoughtful

                                   burke
                    all right  my instinct says
                    youre strong enough to handle
                    thisfiftyseven years

        ripley is stunned  she seems to deflate her expression
        passing through amazement and shock to realization of
        all she has lost  friends  family  her world

                                   ripley
                    fiftysevenoh christ

                                   burke
                    youd drifted right through the
                    core systems  its blind luck that
                    deepsalvage team caught you when
                    theyare you all right

        ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
        becomes one of dawning horror  burke hands her a glass
        of water from the nightstand  she slaps it away  it
        shatters with a smash  jones dives yowling  ripley
        grabs her chest struggling as if she is strangling
        the medtech hits a console button

                                   medtech
                           shouting
                    code blue  415  code blue
                    415

        burke and the medtech are holding ripleys shoulders as
        she goes into convulsions  a doctor and two techs run
        in  ripleys back arches in agony

                                   ripley
                    nonoooo

        they try to restrain her as she thrashes knocking over
        equipment  her ekg races like mad  jones under a
        cabinet hisses wideeyed

                                   doctor
                    hold herget me an airway stat
                    and fifteen ccs ofjesus

        an explosion of blood beneath the sheet covering her
        chest  ripley stares at the shape rising under the
        sheet  tearing itself out of her

        her pov as the sheet rises  a glimpse of the
        chittering horrorit screeches

        tight on ripley  screaming snapping up into frame
        alone in the darkened hospital room  she gasps for
        breath clutching pathetically at her chest  there is
        no demented horror rigging itself out of her  her eyes
        snap about wildly slowly focusing on the reality of
        her safety  shuddering bathed in sweat she kneads her
        breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs

        a video monitor beside the bed snaps on  a medtechs
        face

                                   medtech
                    bad dreams again  do you want
                    something to help you sleep

                                   ripley
                           faint
                    no ive slept enough

        the medtech shrugs and switches off  touching a button
        on the nightstand she opens the viewport revealing
        gateway and the turquoise earth  she hugs jones to her
        and rocks with him like a child still shattered by the
        nightmare  shivering  sleep is far off

                                   ripley
                    we made it jones  we made it

        but at what price

                                                        cut to

        ext park                                                 4   

        sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars
        beyond which a verdant meadow is visible

        extreme fg  jones stalks toward a bird hopping among
        fallen leaves  he leaps  and smack into a wall

                                   ripley

        wider angle  as jones steps back confused from the
        highresolution environmental wall screen a sort of
        cinerama videoloop  ripley sits on a bench in what we
        now see is an atrium off the medical center still
        somewhere in the bowels of gateway station  benches
        some unenthusiastic potted trees  the sterile corridors
        visible beyond glass doors bg

        burke enters in his usual mode casual haste

                                   burke
                    sorryive been running behind
                    all morning

        ripley seems healthier now but still a bit brittle

                                   ripley
                    have they located my daughter
                    yet

                                   burke
                    well i was going to wait
                    until after the inquest

        he opens his briefcase removing a sheet of printer
        hard copy including a telestat photo

                                   ripley
                    is she

        ripley studies the photograph stunned

        the face of a woman in her midsixties  it could be
        anybody  she tries to reconcile the face with the
        little girl she once knew

                                   ripley

                    wisconsin  no children

        ripley gazes off into the pseudolandscape into the
        past

                                   ripley
                    i promised her id be home for

                    of salt  when it came to flight
                    schedules anyway

        burke nods a simpatico presence

                                   ripley
                    you always think you can make it

        lets get one thing straightripley can be one tough
        lady  but the terror the loss the emptiness are in
        this moment overwhelming  she cries silently

        burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm

                                   burke
                           gently

        int corridor  gateway                                   5

        elevator doors part and ripley emerges in midconversation
        with burke  dollying ahead of them as they move rapidly
        down the corridor

                                   ripley
                    you read my depositionits

                    important thing is to stay cool

        int conference room  on ripley  gateway                6

        shes not cool  not unemotional

                                   ripley

                    do you want me to tell the same
                    story

        she faces the eight members of the board of inquiry at a
        long conference table  gray suits and grim faces  they
        arent buying  behind ripley on a large video screen
        parker grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot  his

                    repairs were made  that it resumed

        she slaps drakes open palm and it clenches into a
        greeting which is part contest  it gets rougher
        painful  until she cuffs him hard and they break with
        vicious laughter  dobermans playing  conscripted from
        juvenile prison the two of them were trained to
        operate the formidable smartguns  that is part
        of their bond

        across the room at the other table gorman sits with
        his creases perfectthe consummate strack nco  bishop
        takes a seat beside ripley who pointedly gets up and
        moves to the far side of the table  he looks wounded

                                   bishop
                    im sorry you feel that way
                    about synthetics ripley

        ripley spins on burke her tone accusing

                                   ripley
                    you never said anything about an
                    android being here  why not

                                   burke
                    well it didnt occur to me  its
                    been policy for years to have a
                    synthetic on board

                                   bishop
                    i prefer the term artificial person
                    myself  is there a problem

        bishop turns to ripley very conciliatory

                                   bishop
                    well that explains it  the
                    a2s were always a bit twitchy
                    that could never happen now with
                    out behavioral inhibitors  impossible
                    for me to harm or by omission of
                    action allow to be harmed a
                    human being
                           smiling
                    more cornbread

        wham  ripley knocks the plate out of his hand halfway
        across the room

                                   ripley
                    just stay away from me bishop
                    you got that straight

        burke and gorman exchange glances

        wierzbowski at the next table shrugs and turns back
        to the other troopers

                                   wierzbowski

                                   gorman
                    all we know is that theres
                    still no contact with the colony
                    and that a xenomorph may be
                    involved

        gorman nods to ripley who stands before the troops
        she sets some recording diskettes on the table

                    of large egg and attaches itself
                    to its victim  then it injects
                    an embryo detaches and dies
                    its essentially a walking sex organ

        a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven
        transparent cylinders  stasis tubes  they glow faintly
        with an eerie violet light given off by the field which

        preserves the specimens inside

        they look like jars containing severed arthritic hands
        the palsied fingers curled in a deathrictus
        structurally they are more like spiders with sickening
        translucent skin a flacid scrotal body gilllike
        organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid
        something you definitely do not want on your face for

        like a tapered piece of intestine which slithers

        the kid bolts like a shot scuttling along beneath the
        cabinetry  ripley scrambles to followto keep her
        in sight  crabbing frantically sideways  hicks makes
        a grab catching one tiny ankle  he snaps his hand
        out a moment later

                                   hicks
                    ow  shit  watchit she bites

        the girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the
        baseboard its grille kicked out  she scrambles
        inside her tiny body barely fitting wriggling like
        a fish

        in his bulky armor hicks knows hell never make it
        into the tiny duct  ripley dives  she squirms into
        the duct without thinking  just ahead she sees newt
        enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch  ripley
        pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it
        and crawls in after her


        newt is backed into a culdesac in the tiny steel
        chamber  ripley shines her light around in amazement
        it is a nest  a nest built by a child  wadded up
        blankets and pillows line the space mixed up with a
        haphazard array of toys stuffed animals dolls cheap
        jewelry comic books empty food packets even a
        battery operated tape player  all foraged from the
        wrecked colony  ripley marvels at the childs
        incredible adaptability the ability to functions even
        in this nightmarish environment

        newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch

        ripley grabs her controlling her in a bear hug  the
        kid struggles wildly like a cat at the vets  eyes
        wide hands lashing out in a frenzybut silent  no
        scream

        newt goes limp almost catatonic

        close on newts traumatized vacant stare  her lips
        are white and trembling her eyes track wildly and
        she flinches from unseen terrors  we read a dark
        nightmare world in her eyes

        ripleys light falls on something amidst the debris
        a framed photograph of newt dressed up and smiling

        ripley rocks her tears of suppresses terror and
        grief and hurt rolling down her face  it is a

        of some strange encrusted substance  it vaguely
        resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much
        larger scale and it attenuates so gradually into
        the original hardware that it is hard to see where
        one ends and the other begins

        vasquez turns hers over reluctantly

        the three who are carrying them get out small

        wall of living horror  the colonists have been
        brought here and entombed alive

        cocoons protrude from the niches and interstices
        of the structure  the cocoon material is the same
        translucent epoxy  the bodies are frozen in
        carelessly twisted positions  macabre image of
        frozen agony  many are disiccated  skeletal
        ripcages burst outward as if exploded from within
        paralyzed brought here entombed in living death
        as hosts for the embryos growing within then

        explodes in a gout of blood  a small fanged head
        emerges hissing viciously

        carrying flame throwers open fire  an orgy of
        purging fire  the cocoons vanish in the shimmering
        heat

        fingernails on blackboards

        glimpsed a glistening biomechanoid creature larger
        then a man  lying dormant it had blended perfectly
        with the convoluted surface of fused bone  the

        as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway
        she slams the left and right drivewheel actuators
        viciously spinning the machine in a roaring pivot
        gorman lunges forward along the aisle abandoning
        his command center

        a dark shape lunge toward drake  she fires one burst
        prone  clean body hit

        the flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin blowing
        open the things thorax  a spray of bright yellow
        acid slashes across drakes face and chest eating
        into him like a hot knife through butter  he drops
        in boiling smoke reflexively triggering his flame
        thrower

        against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise
        his 12gauge  an alien head wedges through the opening
        its hideous mouth opening  and hicks jams his shotgun

        something lands on the roof with a metallic clang

        gorman has plastered himself against a wall as far
        from the door as possible  a latch lever behind his
        head turns  the small hatch against which he was
        leaning is ripped away and something snatches him out
        the opening  he disappears to the waist with a shriek
        legs kicking  the alien clings to the roof pulling
        him out  its tail whips over scorpionlike and
        buries a four inch stinger in gormans shoulder
        hicks grabs a joy stick at the firecontrol console
        and turns it rapidly  on the roof the alien looks up
        as servomotors whir  a remote control turret cannon
        a 20mm chaingun swivels toward it in a curt arc

        armored back and tumbles away  gorman slumped
        unconscious is dragged back inside

        broadsiding a controlroom outbuilding  office
        furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in

        suddenly an alien arm arcs down right in front of
        ripleys face  it smashes the windshield  glistening
        hideous jaws lunge inside

        ripley recoils  face to face once again with the same
        mindnumbing horror  she reacts instinctively  slams
        both sets of brakes with all her strength  the huge
        wheels lock  the creature flips off landing in the
        headlights  ripley hits full throttle  the apc roars
        forward smashing over the abomination  its skeletal
        body is crushed under the massive wheels  it rolls
        tumblinglost in the darkness behind as the machine
        thunders onto the causeway and away from the station

        a sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming
        from the apcs rear end  hicks eases ripleys hand
        back on the throttle lever  her grip is white knuckled

        truncates his rant  vasquez has a pulserifle cradled
        not exactly aimed at burke but not exactly aimed away

        downblast of the vtol jets hovering above the complex
        like a huge insect its searchlights blazing

        the group is filing out of the personnel carrier which
        is clearly a write off  hicks and hudson have gorman
        between them and the others emerge into the wind
        they watch the ship roar in on its final approach

        levers are slammed forward in the melee

        they watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips and
        veers wildly  its main engines roar full on and the
        craft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude
        it skims the ground  clips a rock formation  the
        ship slews sideslipping  it hits a ridge  tumbles
        bursting into flame breaking up  it arcs into the

        she grabs newt and sprints for cover as a tumbling
        section of the ships massive engine module slams
        into the apc and it explodes into twisted wreckage

        the dropship skips again like a stone engulfed in
        flamesand crashes into the station  a tremendous
        fireball

        the remainder of the ground team watches their hopes
        of getting off the planet and most of their superior
        fire power reduced to flaming debris

        there is a moment of stunned silence then

                          hysterical
                   well thats great  thats just
                   fucking great man  now what the

                   were in some real pretty shit now

                          to ripley
                   you okay

        she nods  she cant disguise her stricken expression
        when she looks at newt but the little girl seems
        relatively calm  she shrugs with fatalistic acceptance

                                  newt
                   i guess were not leaving right

                   wasnt your fault

        into its basal structure

        the weary and demoralized group is gathered to take
        stock of their grim options  vasquez and hudson are
        just setting down a scorched and dented packing case
        one of several culled from the apc wreckage

        hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons
        lying on a table

                                  hicks
                   this is all we could salvage  weve
                   got four pulserifles with about
                   fifty rounds each  not so good
                   about fifteen m40 grenades and
                   two flame throwers less than
                   half fullone damaged  and
                   weve got four of these
                   robotsentry units with scanners
                   and display intact

        he opens one of the scorched cases revealing a
        hightech servoactuated machine gun with optical
        sensing equipment packed in foam

                                  ripley
                   how long after were declared
                   overdue can we expect a rescue

                   man were not going to make it
                   seventeen hours  those things
                   are going to come in here just
                   like they did before man
                   theyre going to come in here
                   and get us man long before

                                  ripley
                   she survived longer than that
                   with no weapons and no training

        ripley indicates newt who salutes hudson smartly

                                  ripley
                   so you better just start dealing
                   with it  just deal with it
                   hudsonbecause we need you and
                   im tired of your bullshit  now
                   get on a terminal and call up some
                   kind of floor plan file
                   construction blueprints
                   maintenance schematics anything
                   that shows the layout of this

                   this service tunnel is how theyre
                   moving back and forth

                                  hudson
                   yeah right it runs from the
                   processing station right into
                   the sublevel here

        he traces a finger along the abstract ground plan

                                  ripley
                   all right  theres a fire door
                   at this end  the first thing we
                   do is put a remote sentry in the
                   tunnel and seal that door

                                  hicks
                   we gotta figure on them getting
                   into the complex

                                  ripley
                   thats right  so we put up
                   welded barricades at these
                   intersections
                          pointing
                   and seal these ducts here
                   and here  then they can only
                   come at us from these two
                   corridors and we create a free
                   field of fire for the other
                   two sentry units here

        hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand

        seems to go on forever  vasquez and hudson have
        finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on
        tripods in the tunnel

        automatic field of fire  the sentry guns swivel
        smoothly the wastebasket bounces onceand is riddled
        by two quick bursts of exploding 10mm rounds into
        dimesized shrapnel  they retreat behind a heavy steel
        fire door which they roll closed on its track  vasquez
        using a portable welding torch begins sealing the door
        to its frame as hudson paces nervously

        vaultlike metal walls strange equipment
        several metal cots have been set up displacing or
        equipment which is pushed into one corner

        newt is resting her head on ripleys shoulder barely
        awakeout of steam  ripley sets her on one of
        the cots and newt lies down

                                  ripley
                   now you just lie here and

        this obviously strikes a chord with ripley but she
        feigns cheerfulness

                   ill bet casey doesnt have

        ripley lifts the dolls head from newts tiny fingers
        and looks inside  it is of course empty

                                  ripley
                   nothing bad in here  maybe
                   you could just try to be like
                   her

        ripley closes the dolls eyes and hands her back
        newt rolls her eyes as if to say dont pull that

                   my mommy always said there
                   were no monsters  no real
                   ones  but there are

        ripleys expression becomes sober  she brushes damp
        hair back from the childs pale forehead

                                  ripley
                          quietly
                   yes there are arent there

                                  newt
                   why do they tell little kids
                   that

        newts voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal
        shes seen that the world can be just as terrifying
        as her most primal childs nightmare if not more
        so and thats a lot worse than finding out there is
        no santa

                                  ripley
                   well some kids cant handle
                   it like you can

                                  newt
                   did one of those things grow
                   inside her

        ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in
        around her tiny body

                                  ripley
                   i dont know newt  thats
                   the truth

                                  newt
                   isnt that how babies come
                   i mean people babiesthey

                                  ripley
                   no its different honey

                                  newt
                   did you ever have a baby

                                  ripley
                   yes  a little girl

                                  newt
                   where is she

                                  ripley
                          quietly
                   gone

                                  newt
                   you mean dead

        its more statement than question  ripley nods slowly

        she turns reaching for a portable space heater
        sitting nearby and slides it closer to the bed  she
        switches it on  it hums and emits a cozy orange
        glow

                                  newt
                   ripley i was just thinking
                   maybe i could do you a favor and
                   fill in for her  just for a
                   while  you can try it and if
                   you dont like it its okay
                   ill understand  no big deal
                   whattya think

        ripley gazes at her a long time before answering
        a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her
        in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them
        may see another dawn

                                  ripley
                   i think its not the worst idea
                   ive heard all day  lets talk
                   about it later

        she switches off the light and starts to rise  newt
        grabs her arm  a plaintive voice in the dark

                                  newt
                   dont go  please

                                  ripley
                   ill be right in the other
                   room newt  and looki can
                   see you on that camera right
                   up there

        newt looks at the video security camera above the door
        ripley unsnaps the tracker bracelet given to her by
        hicks and puts it on newts tiny wrist cinching it
        down

                                  ripley
                   here  take is for luck  now
                   go to sleepand dont dream

        ripley walks away and newt rolls on her side hugging
        casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function
        light on the bracelet  the space heater hums
        comfortingly

        ecu gorman his eyelids slitted open like those of a
        corpse but with the eyes tracking erratically  the
        only sign of life

                                  ripley
                          voice over

                   how is he

        ripley stands over the lieutenant who is lying
        motionless on an examining table  bishop looks up
        from his instruments nearby the light of a single
        gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast

                                  bishop
                   ive isolated a neuromuscular
                   toxin responsible for the
                   paralysis  it seems to be
                   metabolizing  he should wake
                   up soon

                                  ripley
                   now let me get this straight
                   the aliens paralyzed the colonists
                   carried them over there

                   cocooned them to be hosts for
                   more of those

        ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the
        facehugger specimens

                                  ripley
                   which would mean lots of
                   those parasites right  one
                   for each personover a hundred
                   at least

                                  bishop
                   yes  that follows

                                  ripley
                   but these things come from
                   eggsso where are all the
                   eggs coming from

                                  bishop
                   that is the question of the
                   hour  we could assume a parallel
                   to certain insect forms who
                   have hivelike organization
                   an ant of termite colony for
                   example is ruled by a single
                   female a queen which is the
                   source of new eggs

                                  ripley
                   youre saying one of those things
                   lays all the eggs

                                  bishop
                   well the queen is always physically
                   larger then the others  a
                   termite queens abdomen is so
                   bloated with eggs that it cant
                   move at all  it is fed and tended
                   by drone workers defended by
                   the warriors  she is the center
                   of their lives quite literally
                   the  mother of their society

                                  ripley
                   could it be intelligent

                                  bishop
                   hard to say  it may have been
                   blind instinctattraction to
                   the heat of whateverbut she
                   did choose to incubate her eggs
                   in the one spot where we couldnt
                   destroy her without destroying
                   ourselves  thats if she exists
                   of course

        ripley ponders the ramifications of bishops analysis

                                  ripley
                          rising
                   i want those specimens destroyed
                   as soon as youre done with them
                   you understand

        bishop glances at the creatures pulsing malevolently
        in their cylinders

                                  bishop
                   mr burke have instructions
                   that they were to be kept alive
                   in stasis for return to the
                   company labs  he was very specific

        ripley feels the fabric of her selfrestraint tearing
        she slaps the intercom switch

                                  ripley

        in a small observation chamber separated from the med
        lab by a glass partition ripley and burke have
        squared off

                                  burke
                   those specimens are worth
                   millions to the bioweapons
                   division  now if youre smart
                   we can both come out of this

                                  burke
                   youve been doing your homework
                   look they cant impound it if
                   they dont know about it

                                  ripley
                   but they will know about it burke
                   from me  just like theyll know
                   how you were responsible for the
                   deaths of one hundred and fiftyseven
                   colonists here 

                                  burke
                   now wait a second 

                                  ripley
                          stepping on him
                   you sent them to that ship  i
                   just checked the colony log
                   directive dates sixtwelveseventynine
                   signed burke carter j

        ripleys fury is peaking now that the frustration and
        rage finally have a target to focus on

                                  ripley
                   you sent them out there and you
                   didnt even warn them burke
                   why didnt you warn them

                                  burke
                   look maybe the thing didnt even
                   exist right  and if id made it
                   a major security situation the
                   administration wouldve stepped
                   in  then no exclusive rights
                   nothing

        he shrugs his manner blase dismissive

                                  burke
                   it was a bad call thats all

        ripley snaps  she slams him against the wall surprising
        herself and him her hands gripping his collar

                                  ripley
                   bad call  these people are fucking
                   dead burke  well theyre going
                   to nail your hide to the shed
                   and ill be there when they do

        she steps back shaking and looks at him with utter
        loathing as if the depths of human greed are a far
        more horrific revelation than any alien

                                  burke
                          sadly
                   i expected more of you ripley
                   i thought you would be smarter
                   than this

                                  ripley
                   sorry to disappoint you

        she turns away and strides out  the door closes
        burke stares after her his mind a whirl of options

        ripley doubletimes it to hicks tactical console
        where hudson and vasquez have already gathered  hicks
        slaps a switch killing the alarm

                                  hicks
                   theyre coming  theyre in
                   the tunnel

        the trilling of the motion sensor remains speeding up
        two red lights on the tactical display light up
        simultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire which
        vibrates the floor

        the rss guns pound away echoing through the complex
        their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm
        a counter on the display counts down the number of

                   theyre at the fire door

                   man listen to that

        mixed with the echoing crashclang is a nervewrecking
        screech of claws on steel  the intercom buzzes
        startling them

        everyone including bishop is crowded at the window
        intently watching the ap station which is a dim
        silhouette in the mist  suddenly a column of flame
        like an acetylene torch jets upward from the complex
        at the base of the cone

                   much damage  the overload is
                   inevitable at this point

                   how  the transmitter was on the
                   apc  its wasted

                                  ripley
                          pacing
                   i dont care how  think of a
                   way  think of something

                                  hudson
                   think of what  were fucked

                                  ripley
                   what about the colony transmitter
                   that uplink tower down at the
                   other end  why cant we use that

                                  bishop
                   i checked  the hard wiring
                   between here and there was severed
                   in the fighting

        ripley is wound up like a dynamo her mind spinning out
        options grim solutions

                                  ripley
                   well then somebodys just going
                   to have to go out there  take a
                   portable terminal and go out there
                   and plug in manually

                                  hudson
                   oh right  right  with those
                   things running around  no way

                                  bishop
                          quietly
                   ill go

                                  ripley
                   what

                                  bishop
                   im really the only one qualified
                   to remotepilot the ship anyway
                   believe me id prefer not to  i
                   may be synthetic but im not stupid

                                  ripley
                   all right  lets get on it  whatll
                   you need

                                  vasquez
                   listen  its stopped

        they listen  nothing  an instant later comes the
        highpitched trilling of a motionsensor alarm  hicks
        looks at the tactical board

                                  hicks
                   well theyre into the complex

        int med lab                                            130

        one of the acid holes from the colonists siege has
        yielded access to subfloor conduits  bishop lying in
        the opening reaches up to graph the portable terminal
        as ripley hands it down to him  he pushes it into
        the constricted shaft ahead of him  she then hands him
        a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch
        cables a service pistol and a small cutting torch

                                  bishop
                   this duct runs almost to the
                   uplink assembly  one hundred
                   eighty meters  say forty minutes
                   to crawl down there  one hour
                   to patch in and align the antenna
                   thirty minutes to prep the ship
                   then about fifty minutes flight time

        ripley looks at her watch

                                  ripley
                   its going to be closer  you
                   better get going

                                  bishop
                          cheerfully
                   see you soon

        she squirms into the shaft pushing the equipment along
        ahead of him with a scraping rhythm  the diameter of
        the conduit is barely larger than the width of his
        shoulders  vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole
        and begins spot welding it in place

        int conduit                                            131

        bishop looks back as the welder seals him in  he sighs
        fatalistically and squirms forward  ahead of him the
        conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity  like
        being in the bore of a very long howitzer

        int med lab                                            132

        ripley jumps as an alarm suddenly blares through the
        complex

                                  hicks
                          voice over
                   theyre in the approach corridor

                                  ripley
                          into mike
                   on my way

        ripley jumps up unslinging a flamethrower from her
        shoulder in one motion and sprints for operations with
        vasquez  the sound of sentry guns opening up in
        staccato bursts echoes from close by

        int operations                                         133

        ripley runs to the tactical console where hicks is
        mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras
        the flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive
        video but impressions of figures moving in the smoky
        corridor are occasionally visible  the robot sentries
        hammer away driving streamers of tracer fire into
        the swirling mist

                                  hicks
                   twenty meters and closing
                   fifteen  c and d guns down
                   about fifty percent

        the digital readout whirl through descending numbers
        an inhuman shrill screeching is audible between bursts
        of fire

                                  ripley
                   now many

                                  hicks
                   cant tell  lots  d guns
                   down to twenty  ten  its out

        then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly
        the video image is a swirling wall of smoke  small fires
        burn dim glows in the mist  there are black and
        twisted shapes and pieces of twisted shapes scattered
        at the edge of visibility  however nothing emerges
        from the wall of smoke  the motion sensor tone shuts off

                                  ripley
                   they retreated  the guns stopped
                   them

        the moment stretches  everyone exhales slowly

                                  hicks
                   yeah  but look

        the digital counters for the two sentry guns read 0
        and 10 respectively  less than a seconds worth of
        firing

                                  hicks
                   newt time then can walk right
                   up and knock

                                  ripley
                   but they dont know that  theyre
                   probably looking for other ways
                   to get in  thatll take them awhile

                                  hudson
                   maybe we got em demoralized

                                  hicks
                          to vasquez
                          and hudson
                   i want you two walking the perimeter
                   i know were all in strung out
                   shape but stay frosty and alert
                   weve got to stop any entries before
                   they get out of hand

        the two troopers nod and head for the corridor  ripley
        sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee draining it in
        one gulp

                                  hicks
                   how long since you slept
                   twentyfour hours

        ripley shrugs  she seems soul weary drained by the
        nervewracking tension  when she answers her voice
        seems distant detached

                                  ripley
                          grimly
                   theyll get us

                                  hicks
                   maybe  maybe not

                                  ripley
                   hicks im not going to wind up like
                   those others  youll take care of
                   it wont you it if comes to that

                                  hicks
                   if it comes to that ill do us
                   both  lets see that it doesnt
                   here id like to introduce you to
                   a close personal friend of mine

        he picks up his pulserifle and with the casually precise
        movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt drops
        out the magazine and hands it to her

                                  hicks
                   m41a 10mm pulserifle over and
                   under with a 30mm pumpaction
                   grenade launcher

        ripley hefts the weapon  it is heavy and awkward  but
        there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal
        cold steel lines to at least the sense that she will
        be in some greater measure the master of her own fate
        she raises it clumsily

                                  ripley
                   what do i do

        int conduit                                            134

        bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing
        infinities  the pipe rings with his scraping advance
        he approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny
        shaft of light  he puts his eyes up to the acidetched
        opening

        his pov  as drooling jaws flash toward us slamming
        against the steel with a vicious scraping snap

        bishop flattens himself away from the opening and
        inches along looking pale and strained  he glances at
        his watch

        int operations                                         135

        ripley has the stock of the m41a snugged up to her cheek
        and is awkwardly trying to keep up with hicks
        instructions  the corporal is standing close behind her
        positioning her arms  its intimate but thats the
        last thing on their minds

                                  hicks
                   just pull it in real right  it
                   will kick some  when the counter
                   here heads zero hit this

        he thumbs a button and the magazine drops out clattering
        on the floor

                                  hicks
                   just let it drop right out  get
                   the other one in quick  just
                   slap it in hard it likes abuse
                   now pull the bolt

        clack

                                  hicks
                   youre ready again

        ripley repeats the action not very smoothly  her hands
        are trembling  she indicates a stout tube underneath
        the slender pulserifle barrel

                                  ripley
                   whats this

                                  hicks
                   well thats the grenade launcher
                   you probably dont want to
                   mess with that

                                  ripley
                   look you started this  now show
                   me everything  i can handle myself

                                  hicks
                   yeah  ive noticed

        int corridor                                           136

        dollying with ripley walking down the corridor now
        carrying the newfound friend the m41a  gorman steps
        out of the door to the med lab looking weak but sound
        burke is right behind him

                                  ripley
                   how do you feel

                                  gorman
                   all right i guess  one hell
                   of a hangover  look ripley
                   i

                                  ripley
                   forget it

        she shoulders by him into the med lab  gorman turns to
        see vasquez staring at him with cold slitted eyes

                                  gorman
                   you still want to kill me

                                  vasquez
                          turning away
                   it wont be necessary

        entering the darkened chamber ripley looks around
        newt is nowhere to be seen  on a hunch she kneels down
        and peers under the bed  newt is curled up there
        jammed as far back as she can get fast asleep  still
        clutching casey

        ripley stares at newts tiny face so angelic despite
        the demons that have chased her through her dreams and
        the reality between dreams  ripley lays the rifle on
        top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath  without
        waking the little girl she slips her arms around her

        ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling
        together in the darkness under their bed

        newts face contorts with the externalization of some
        tormented dreamscape  she cries out a vague inarticulate
        plea  ripley rocks her gently

                                  ripley
                   there there  sssshh  its all

        platform  a rising wind is clearing out the low fog and
        the silhouette of the station grows sharper  several
        systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the
        conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in
        the darkness  high voltage discharges arc around the
        upper latticework lighting the blighted landscape
        with irregular glaring flashes

        base of the telemetry tower  he has a testbay panel
        open and the portable terminal patched in  his jacket
        is draped over the keyboard and monitor unit to protect
        it from the elements and he is typing frenetically

        as she awakens with a start  she checks her watch
        an hour has passed  she gently disengages herself from
        newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot
        when she sees something and freezes

        across the room just inside the door to the med lab
        are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects
        two stasis cylinders  their tops are hinged open and
        the suspension fields are switched off  they are both
        empty  ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror
        rise through her in that silent frozen momentthe
        inescapable certainty of a lethal presence  unable to
        move or breathe she looks around frantically assessing
        the situation

        newt nods now wide awake  they listen in the darkness
        for the slightest betrayal of movement  the scrabble
        of multiple legs across the polished floor for example

        there is only the droning hum of the little space heater
        ripley reaches up and clutching the springs of the
        underside of the cot begins to inch it away from the
        wall

        the squeal of metal as the legs scrape across the floor
        is jarringly loud in the stillness

        when the space is wide enough she cautiously slides
        herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot
        reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the
        mattress  here yes clear the edge of the bed  the rifle
        is gone

        she snaps her head around  a scuttling shape leaps
        toward her from the foot of the bed  she ducks with
        a startled cry  the obscene thing hits the wall above
        her legs moving lightning fast  reflexively she slams
        the bed against the wall pinning the creature inches
        above her face  its legs and tail writhe with
        incredible ferocity and it emits a demented piercing
        squeal

        ripley heaves newt across the polished floor and in a
        frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot  she
        flips it over trapping the creature underneath

        they back away gasping  ripleys eyes flash around
        the shadowed room where every corner of space
        between equipment holds lethal promise  the creature
        scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a
        back of cabinets in a blur  ripley hugs newt close
        and heads toward the door moving as if every object in
        the room had a million volts running through it  she
        reaches the door  hits the wall switch  nothing
        happens  disabled from outside  she tries the lights
        nothing  she pounds on the door  the acoustically
        dampened door panel thunks dully  she moves to the
        observation window glancing frantically over her
        shoulder  the bare floor behind her is like a screaming
        threat

                                  ripley
                          shouting
                   heyhey

        she pounds on the window  through the double
        thickness window we can see that the lab is dark and
        empty  ripley whirls hearing a loathsome scrabbling
        behind her  newt starts to whimper feeding off her
        fear  she steps in front of the video surveillance
        camera and waves her arms in a circle

                                  ripley

        showing ripley waving her arms  there is no sound
        a surreal pantomime

        a hand enters frame and switches off the monitor
        ripleys image vanishes

        the console  hicks is talking via headset with
        bishop and hasnt noticed ripleys plight or

        ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against
        the observation window  it bounces back from the
        highimpact material  she tries again

        reverse angle  from the med lab side showing her
        futile efforts the chair hitting with a dull thwack
        barely audible through the double thickness pressure
        port

        ripley turns studying the room  she fumbles through
        a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and
        finds a small examination light  snapping it on she
        plays the beam over the walls  tall assemblies of
        surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the
        dark  she hears ot thinks she hears movements  the
        light spins across the room swiveling and bobbing
        frantically  like an indicator of her growing panic
        newt starts a thin high wailing

                                  newt
                   mommymommmyyyyy

        ripley steadies herself realizing newts terror and
        the childs dependence on her  she plays the beam
        across the ceiling  holds on something  gets an idea
        she removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks
        up some papers from the counter  moving cautiously
        she boosts newt up onto the surgical table in the center
        of the room and clambers up after her

                                  newt
                   mommyi mean ripleyim

                                  ripley
                   i know honey  me too

        ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass
        under the temperature sensor of a fire control system
        sprinkler head  it triggers spraying the room from
        several sources with water  an alarm sounds throughout
        the complex

        int operations                                         144

        hicks jumps at the sound of the alarm finally
        identifying its source among the lights flashing on
        his board  he bolts for the door yelling into his
        headset as he moves

                                  hicks

        ripley and newt are drenched as the sprinklers
        continue to drizzle in the darkness  the siren
        hoots maniacally masking all other sound  ripley
        scans the room with her light her hair plastered
        to her face wiping water out of her eyes  she is
        eye level with a complex surgical multilight  she
        looks into its tangle of arms and cables inches away
        looks away  her eyes snap back  something leaps at
        her face  she screams and topples off the table
        splashing to the floor  newt shrieks and scrambles
        away as ripley hurls the chittering creature off of
        her  it slams against a wall of cabinets clings
        for a moment then leaps back as if driven by a
        steel spring  ripley scrambles desperately pulling
        equipment over on top of herself clawing across the
        floor in a frenzy of motion  in a blurr of
        multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body

        she tears at it but it is incredibly powerful for
        its size  it moves like lightning toward her head
        avoiding her fumbling hands  newt screams abjectly
        backing away until she is pressed up against a
        desk in one corner

        ripley has both hands up forcing the pulsing body
        back from her face  the things tail whips around
        her throat and begins to tighten forcing the underside
        of its body close to her  ripley thrashes about
        knocking over equipment sending instruments clattering
        water streams over her into her eyes blinding her
        and making it impossible to get a grip on the creatures
        body

        angle on newt  as crablike legs appear from behind the
        desk right behind her  she sees it and thinking
        fast jams the desk against the wall pinning the
        writhing thing  the desk jumps and shudders against
        all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it
        she wails between gritted teeth as the second creature
        gets one leg free then another and another  squeezing
        itself inexorably onto the desk toptoward her

        the legs of the chittering thing claw at ripleys
        head getting a surer grip even as she whips her head
        from side to side  the obscene tubule extrudes wetly
        from the sheath on the creatures underside forcing
        itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over
        her face

        a figure appears at the observation window a silhouette
        behind the mistedover glass  a hand wipes a clear spot
        hicks eyes appear  he steps back  wham  a burst of
        pulserifle fire shatters the tempered glass  hicks
        dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes
        into the room in a shower of fragments  he hits
        rolling his armor grinding through the shards and
        slides across to ripley  he gets his fingers around the
        thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls  between
        the two of them they force is away from her face
        though ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens
        sickeningly around her throat  hudson leaps into the
        room flings newt away from the desk to go skidding
        across the wet floor and blasts the second creature
        against the wall  pointblank  acid and smoke

        gorman appears at ripleys side and grabs the tail
        unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor
        coil from her throat  all of them grip the struggling
        shrieking creature

                                  hicks
                   the corner  ready

                                  hudson
                   do it

        hicks hurls the thing into the corner  it scrabbles
        upright in an instant and leaps back toward them
        wham  hudson gets it clean

        ripley collapses gagging  the alarm and sprinklers
        shut off automatically  hicks sees the stasis
        cylinders

                                  ripley

        looking decidedly stressedout  he grips his rifle
        tightly aimed right at camera

                                  hudson

                   i say we grease this ratfuck
                   son of a bitch right now

        the group is gathered around burke who sits in a
        chair maintaining an icy calm although beads of
        sweat betray intense concealed tension  only a few
        minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on
        adrenaline as if the whole group is charged with
        high voltage

                                  hicks
                          pacing
                   i dont get it  it doesnt
                   make any goddamn sense

        ripley stands in front of burke every fiber of
        her being accusing him with absolute outrage  burke
        tries to break ripleys stare which is like a
        diamond drill  he cant

                                  ripley
                   he wanted an alien only he
                   couldnt get it back through
                   quarantine  but if we were impregnated
                   whatever you call itand then
                   frozen for the trip back at just
                   the right timethen nobody would
                   know about the embryos we were carrying
                   we and newt

        ripley glances at the little girl a frail figure
        sitting nearby hugging her knees and watching the
        proceedings with somber eyes  she is all but lost in
        an adult jacket someone has found for her and her still
        damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks

                                  hicks
                   wait a minute  wed know about it

                                  ripley
                   the only way it would work is if
                   he sabotaged certain freezers
                   on the trip back  then he could
                   jettison the bodies and make up
                   any story he liked

                                  hudson
                   fuuuck  hes dead

                   which species is worse  you dont
                   see them screwing each other over
                   for a fucking percentage

                          to burke
                   no offense

        ripley shakes her head the rage giving way to a
        sickened emptiness

                                  ripley
                   just find someplace to lock him
                   up until its time to 

        the lights go out  everyone stops in the sudden darkness
        realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the
        struggle  hicks looks at the board  everything is out
        doors  video screens

        vasquez as she begins welding the door  hudsons tracker
        is beeping like mad now as fast as their hearts

                                  ripley
                   they learned  they cut the power
                   and avoided the guns  they must
                   have found another way in something
                   we missed

                                  hicks
                   we didnt miss anything

                   floors not on the plans
                   i dont know

        she picks up vasquez scanner and aims it the same
        direction as hudsons

                                  hudson
                   twelve meters  man this is a big

                   theyre right on us  vasquez
                   how you doing

        vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal
        as she welds the door shut  working like a demon

                                  hudson

        ripley fiddles with her tracker adjusting the tuning

                                  hicks
                   well youre not reading it right

        he looks at ripley  it dawns on both of them at the same
        time  she feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles
        her tracker upward to the ceiling almost overhead  the
        tone gets louder

        hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of
        acoustic dropceiling  he shines his light inside

        hicks pov                                           151

        a soulwrenching nightmare image  moving in the beam of
        light are aliens  lots of aliens  they are crawling
        like bats upside down clinging to the pipes and beams
        of the structural ceiling not touching the flimsy
        acoustic panels  they glisten hideously as they claw
        their way forward in silence  they cover the ceiling
        of the operations room  the inner sanctum is utterly
        violated

        on hicks                                                152

        blasted by fear

        something moveshe snaps the light around  its a
        meter behind him  it lunges  he drops reflexively
        the claws raking across his armor

        hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach
        en masse from the handholds  the ceiling explodes
        raining debris  nightmare shapes drop into the room
        newt screams  hudson opens fire  vasquez grabs hicks
        pulls him up firing one handed with her flamethrower
        ripley scoops up newt and staggers back  gorman turns
        to fire and burke bolts for the only remaining exit
        the corridor connecting to the med lab  in the
        strobelike glare of the pulserifles we see flashes
        of aliens moving forward in the smoke from the
        flamethrower fires  they move like nothing human
        leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with
        powerful balletic grace

        dollying behind her as she sprints the walls becoming
        a frenzied blur  ahead of her burke clears the door to
        the med lab  he slides it closed  ripley slams into
        the door  tries the latch  hears it lock from the far
        side

        behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a
        locomotive a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and
        inhuman as you can imagine  strobe flashes backlight
        the demented silhouette  shaking ripley raises her
        rifle  she squeezes the trigger  nothing happens
        the creature hisses baring its teeth as it advances
        ripley checks the safety  the safety is off  the
        digital counter  the magazine is full  newt begins to
        wail  ripleys hands slick with sweat are trembling
        so much she almost drops the rifle  panic screams in
        her brain  the thing is almost on her filling the
        corridor when she remembers  she snaps the bolt back
        chambering a round  whips the stock to her shoulder
        fires  flashcrack  a flashbulb glimpse of shrieking
        jaws as the silhouette is hurled back screeching
        insanely

        ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil
        blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion

        silhouette  screeeech  the firecontrol system has
        tripped with sprinklers spraying the room and a
        mindless siren wailing  total pandemonium

        arms seize him lightning fast dragging him down
        another skeletal shape leaps on him from above  he
        disappears into the subfloor crawlway  hicks vasquez
        and gorman make it to the med lab access corridor

        int corridor

        stunned ripley sees through dissipating smoke the
        creature rising to advance again  flinching against
        blast and glare she drills it pointblank with a
        blinding burst that carries the m41as muzzle right
        up toward the ceiling  newt covers her ears against
        the concussion

                                  hicks
                          os

                   stand back

        hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the
        lock  inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor
        vasquez hands her flamethrower to gorman and unslings
        her rifle  she starts loading 30mm grenades into the
        launcher like oversize 12guage shells

                                  gorman
                   you cant use those in here

                                  vasquez
                   right  fire in the hole

        she pumps a round up and fires  the grenade explodes and
        the blast almost knocks them down  hicks kicks the door
        open molten droplets flying

                                  hicks
                          shouting at vasquez
                   thanks a lot  now i cant hear shit

                                  vasquez

        int med lab annex                                      156

        vasquez slides the door almost closed then fires three
        grenades rapidfire through the gap  she slams the door
        home as the grenades detonate the explosion sounding
        gonglike through the metal

        ripley sprints across the room trying the far door
        burke has locked it as well  hicks switches his
        handtorch from cut to weld and starts sealing the door
        they just passed through

        int med lab                                            157

        burke hyperventilating with terror backs across the
        dark chamber  gasping almost paralyzed with fear he
        crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main
        concourse  his fingers reach for the latch  it moves
        by itself  the door opens slowly

        on burke  his eyes wide transfixed by his fate  we
        hear the bullwhip crack of a tailstinger striking as we

                                                        cut to

        int med lab annex                                      158

        the door dimples with a clanging impact separating
        slightly from its frame  another crash the squeal of
        tortured steel  newt grabs ripley by the hand and
        tugs her across the room

                                  newt
                   come on  this way

        she leads ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and
        expertly unlatches the grille swinging it open  newt
        starts inside but ripley pulls her back

                                  ripley
                   stay behind me

        ripley trades her rifle for gormans flamethrower before
        he can protest and enters the air shaft which is a
        tight fit  newt scrambles in behind followed by hicks
        gorman and vasquez on rearguard  glancing back
        fearfully newt pushes on ripleys butt as they crawl
        rapidly through the shaft

                                  newt
                   come on  crawl faster

                                  ripley
                   do you know how to get to the
                   landing field from here

                                  newt
                   sure  go left

        ripley turns into a larger main duct where there is
        enough room to crabwalk in a low crouch  she runs
        scraping her back on the ceiling  the troopers armor
        clatters in the confined space  they approach an
        intersection  she fires the flamethrower around the
        corner the looks  clear

                                  newt
                   go right

        they sprint into the narrow connecting duct the maze
        becoming a blur  ripley fires the flamethrower
        periodically as they pass side ducts covered by
        louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or
        lower levels

        there is a long pause then bishops voice almost
        unintelligible with interference comes over the radio

                          voice over

        bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry
        mast out of the wind which is now gusting viciously

                                  bishop
                          yelling
                          over enunciating

                   got my hands full flying
                   the weathers come up a bit

        bishops fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and
        he squints watching the screen as the flight telemetry
        updates rapidly

        in the bg the ap station has become a raging demon
        wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges

        int air duct                                           160

                   all right stand by there  were
                   on out way  over

        the beam of ripleys light wavers hypnotically in the
        tunnel ahead  she blinks seeing somethingnot sure
        a glinting obscene form moving toward them filling the
        tunnel at the absolute limit of the lights power

                                  ripley
                   back  go back

        they try to crawl back jamming together  behind them
        the way they have come a grating is battered in with a
        ferocious clang and the deadly silhouette of a warrior
        flows into the duct  they are trapped  vasquez uses
        her flamethrower bathing the tunnel in fire  hicks
        snaps out his handwelder and cuts into the wall of the
        duct  molten metal spatters him as sparks fill the
        tunnel with lurid light  vasquez flamethrower sputters

                                  vasquez
                          icy
                   losing fuel

        between eyesearing bursts of flame ripley sees the
        glistening apparitions closing in  hicks torch feathers
        out  empty  bracing his back he kicks hard at the
        cherryhot metal  it bends aside

        beyond is a narrow service way lined with pipes and
        conduit  hicks slides through the searing hole
        lifting newt safely through as ripley hands her out
        ripley follows and turns to help gorman  vasquez
        flamethrower goes dry  she draws her service pistol
        suddenly she looks up as a warrior screeches down from
        a vertical shaft right above her

        she fires with incredible rapiditybam  bam  bam
        rolls aside  it lands on her legs and she snaps her head
        to one side just as its tail stinger buries into the
        metal wall beside her cheek  she fires again emptying
        the pistol kicking the thrashing shape away

        acid cuts through her chickenplate armor searing into
        her thigh  she cries out gritting her teeth against
        the whitehot pain  gorman sees vasquez hit unable to
        move  sees the creatures coming the other wayand
        turns away from the escape hole  he crawls back to her
        grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards
        safety  too late  the approaching alien warriors have
        reached and passed the opening  vasquez sees him
        barely conscious

                                  vasquez
                          hoarse whisper
                   you always were an asshole gorman

        she seizes his hand in a deadly drip but we recognize
        it as the power greeting she shared with drake
        something for the chosen few  gorman returns the grip
        he hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the
        creatures are upon them

        int service way                                        161

        rushing with ripley newt and hicks as a full tilt run
        the service way lights up with a powerful blast behind
        them and they stumble with the shock wave  newt breaks
        out ahead and its all ripley and hicks can do to keep
        up

                                  newt
                   this way  come on were almost

                   newt wait

        the kid moves like lightning diving and dodging around
        obstacles  if it wasnt clear before its clear now
        that we are on her turf and shes the ace  running on
        and on their breathing loud and echoingthe walls
        a directionless blur  newt never hesitates

        they reach a junction with a narrow angled chute which
        runs upward at a steep 45 degrees

                                  newt
                   here  go up

        ripley looks up the angles shaft seeing light at the
        topan exterior vent hood  the sound of wind booms
        down from above  like blowing across a bottle top
        vastly amplified

        ripley enters bracing her feet on perilously narrow
        side ribs in the shaft  she looks down  the chute
        descends far into the depths lost in shadow  she
        starts to climb with next behindbelow her and hicks
        just emerging from the side duct

                                  newt
                   just up there 

        newt slips a rusted rib collapsing under her foot  she
        slidescatches herself with one hand  ripley reaches
        for her dropping her light  the handlight goes
        skittering and bumping down the chute around a bend
        and disappears

        ripley strains reaching her hand groping for newts
        they miss inches apart

                                  newt
                   riiiiipppleee 

        she slips  hicks lunges grabbing her oversized jacket
        and she slips out of it  with an echoing scream newt
        plummets sliding down the chute into darkness

        moving with her the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like
        a bobsled ride  the shaft pitches left  newt bounces
        sliding halfway up the wall  the chute forks ahead
        newt tumbles into the right shaft which drops at a
        steeper angle into the depths  just disappearing down
        the left shaft we see ripleys light

        ripley looks hicks in the eye  and kicks freesliding
        down the chute after newt  ripley slams her feet into
        the sideribs bracing herself in a controlled descent
        ripley reaches the v  sees the glow of the light in
        the left fork  she goes left

                                  ripley
                   newt

        she hears a plaintive reply so echoey and distorted it

                   mommywhere are you

        ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it
        intersects with a horizontal service tunnel  the light
        is lying there but no newt  the echoing wail comes
        again

                                  newt
                          os
                   moooommeeee

        ripley starts down the tunnel answering  newts call
        comes again  fainter  she cant tell  she spins in
        a growing panic starts the other way

                                  ripley
                          to her headset
                   hicks get down here  i need
                   that locator

        int subbasement                                        163

        newt is in a low grottolike chamber filled with pipes
        and machines  it is flooded almost up to newts waist
        she looks up seeing light streaming through a grating
        ripleys voice seems to come from there

                                  ripley
                          os
                   newt  star wherever you are

        newt climbs some pipes straining to reach the grating

        int service tunnel                                     164

        hicks joins ripley unsnapping the emergencylocator
        from his belt  they follow the signal into a lighted
        area where the power apparently was not cut

                                  hicks
                   this way  were close

        following the signal they come to a grating set in the
        floor

                                  newt
                   here  im here  im here

        ripley runs to the grating  looking down she sees newts
        tearstreaked face  newt reaches up  her tiny fingers
        wriggle up through the bars of the grate  ripley
        squeezes the childs precious fingertips

                                  ripley
                   climb down honey  we have to
                   cut through this grate

        newt backs away climbing down the pipe as hicks cuts
        into the bars with his handtorch

        int subbasement                                        165

        newt standing waist deep in the water watches sparks
        shower blindingly as hicks cuts  she bites her lip
        trembling  cold and terrified  silently a glistening
        shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind
        her  it stands dripping dwarfing her tiny form  newt
        turns sensing the movementshe screams as the
        shadow engulfs her

        int service tunnel                                     166

        ripley panics hearing screaming below then splashing
        she and hicks kick desperately at the grating smashing
        it down  heedless of the cherryhot edges ripley
        lunges into the hole with her light

                                  ripley
                   newt  newt

        the surface of the water reflects the beam placidly
        newt is gone  bobbing in the water eyes staring is
        casey the doll head  in sinks slowly distorting
        vanishing in darkness

        hicks pulls ripley away from the hole  she struggles
        furiously trying to tear out of his grip

                                  ripley
                   no  noooo

        he drags her back  it takes all of his strength

                                  hicks
                          intense
                   shes gone  lets go

        he sees something moving toward them through a lattice
        of pipes  ripley is irrational  hysterical

                                  ripley
                   no  no  shes alive  we
                   have to 

                                  hicks
                   all right  shes alive  i
                   believe it  but we gotta get
                   moving  now

        he drags her toward an elevator not far away at the
        end of the tunnel  gets her inside slamming her against
        the back wall  hits the button to go to surface level
        an alien warrior leaps into the tunnel starts
        toward them  the doors are closing  not fast enough
        the creature gets one arm through the doors closing on
        it  they open again an automatic safety feature  the
        warrior hisses lunging  hicks fires pointblank  it
        spins away screeching  acid sluices between the closing
        doors across hicks armored chest plate as he shields
        ripley with his body  the lift starts upward  hicks
        fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way
        toward his skin  galvanized out of her hysteria ripley
        claws at his armor helping him as much as she can  he
        screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm  he
        shucks out of the combat armor like a madman dropping
        the smoking pieces to the floor  acrid fumes fill the
        air searing eyes and lungs  the elevator stops  the
        doors part and they stumble out ripley supporting hicks
        who is doubled over in agony

                                  ripley
                   come on you can make it

        sideslipping in hurricane gusts  bishop stands guiding
        it with the portable terminal  the ship sets down hard
        slides sideways  stops  bishop turns as ripley and
        hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building
        behind him  he goes to them helping to support hicks
        and they run toward the ship buffeted by the gale
        ripley shouts her words barely audible over the wind

                                  ripley
                   how much time

        an infernal engine roaring out of control  steam blasts
        and swirls lightning zaps around the superstructure and
        columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into
        the air

        we approach hypnotically  the dropship enters frame
        moving toward the station  it pivots hovering in the
        blasting turbulence and settles onto a narrow landing
        platform ten levels above the ground or about a third
        of the way up the enormous structure

        drops the roll  she has crudely fastened a m41a
        assault rifle together side by side with a flamethrower
        a massive unwieldy package of absolute firepower  her
        movements are curt precisedetermined  she works
        rapidly snatching magazines grenades belts and other
        gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the

                   dwayne  its dwayne

        ripley grabs his hand  they share a moment albeit
        brief  mutual respect in the valley of death

        ripley runs down the ramp crossing the platform to the
        open doors of a large freight elevator  the doors close

        int freight elevator                                   170

        the elevator descends  bars of light move rhythmically
        across her as ripley stands facing the doors watching
        the landings go by  the heat grows more intense  pipes
        glowing cherryred pass by  steam hisses and billows
        the lift clatters in a steady beat  hypnotic

        ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness
        directly over her tshirt  her hair is matted and
        she glistens with sweat  her eyes burn with a
        determination that holds the gutpanic in check

        the elevator descends  she checks her weapon  attaches
        a bandolier of grenades to her harness  primes the
        flamethrower  checks the rifles magazine  racks the
        bolt chambering the first round  she checks the
        marking flares jammed in the thigh pockets of her
        jump pants  she drops an unprimed grenade trembling
        forcing herself to be strong  we see she doesnt
        know doodley about grenades

        this is the most terrifying thing she has ever done  she
        begins to hyperventilate soaking with sweat  her fingers
        slick and slippery on the rifle  the elevator descends

        the lift motors whine slowing  it hits bottom with a
        bump  the safety cage retracts  slowly expectantly
        the doors open

        her pov  through the parting doorsan empty
        corridor  dark swirling with steam a ruddy glow
        visible here and there  it seems to have been a descent
        into dantean hell  the air itself vibrates with heat
        distortion  couplings groan  machinery whines and
        throbs  like the beating of a vast heart the pounding
        of massive pumps echoes through the station

        int corridor                                           171

        ripley moves out of the lift knuckles white on the
        rifle  her eyes dart straining to penetrate the lethal
        gloom  behind her we see a second elevator next to
        hers its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor  ahead
        the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence
        and not far down the biomechanoid catacomb begins
        she enters the maze darting glances at hicks locator
        taped to the top of her kludge weapon

        a voice echoes down the tunnels calm and mechanical

                                  voice
                   attention  emergency  all
                   personnel must evacuate
                   immediately  you now have

        range and direction read out in rapidfire alphanumerics
        on the locator display

        ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes moving through the
        swirling steam of the alien maze  she approaches an
        intersecting tunnel  flashing emergency lights
        illuminate the insane fresco of the walls  she spins
        firing the flamethrower  nothing there  she whirls
        back  moves forward trembling and adrenalized

        skeletal figures drown in the walls frozen in macabre
        tormented positions like human insects in amber
        steam blasts blinding her  the locator signal
        strengthens an she turns crouches through a low
        passage turns again  at each intersection she quickly
        lights a fifteenminute marking flare and drops it
        for the way back  she has to turn sideways inching
        through a fissure between two walls of deathcocoon
        niches human basrelief sealed in resin


        suddenly something shoots out grabbing her  a hand
        she recovers  then recognizes the face sealed in
        the wall  carter burke

                                  burke
                   ripleyhelp me  i can feel
                   itinside  oh godits
                   moving  oh gooood

        she looks at him  no one deserves this

                                  ripley
                   here

        she hands him a grenade wrapping his fingers around
        the spoon and pulls the primer  she moves on

                                  voice
                   you now have eleven minutes to
                   reach minimum safe distance

        ripley moves ahead  the locator signals shows she is
        almost there  a concussion rocks the place like an
        earthquake jarring her almost off her feet  then
        another  the whole station seems to shudder  a siren
        begins to wail a demented rhythm  following the tracker
        she turns a corner and stops  the range indicator reads
        zero  she looks down horrified to see newts tracer
        bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel  all hope
        recedes disintegrating into mindless chaos

        newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the
        edge of a cluster of upright ovoid shapesalien
        eggs  her eyelids flutter open and she becomes
        aware of her surroundings  the egg nearest her
        begins to moveopening like an obscene flower at
        its top to reveal something stirring within  newt
        stares transfixed by terror as the jointed legs
        appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one  she
        screams

        int catacombs                                          174

        ripley hears the scream and breaks into a run

        int egg chamber                                        175

        newt watches the facehugger emerge and turn toward
        her  ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap
        and fires blasting it with a burst from the assault
        rifle  the flash illuminates the figure of an
        adult warrior nearby  it spins moving straight
        for ripley  firing from the hip she drills it with
        two controlled bursts which catapult it back  she
        steps toward it firing again  her expression is
        murderous  and again  it spins onto its back
        she unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in
        a fireball  ripley runs to newt and begins tearing
        at the fresh resinous cocoon material freeing the
        child  she swings her up onto her back

                                  newt
                          weakly

                   newt i want you to hang on
                   now  hang on tight

        groggily newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts
        of ripleys battle harness as ripley picks up her
        weapon  more warriors are moving toward her among
        the eggs  she fires the flamethrower  the eggs are
        engulfed  one of the warriors lunges forward a
        living fireball  she blasts it in half with two
        bursts from the m41a  ripley retreats ducking under
        a glistening cylindrical mass  a piercing shriek
        fill the chamber  she turns  and there it is

        a massive silhouette in the mist the alien queen
        glowers over her eggs like a great glistening black
        insectbuddha  whats bigger and meaner than the
        alien  his momma  her fanged head is an unimaginable
        horror  her six limbs the four arms and two
        powerful legs are folded grotesquely over her
        distended abdomen  the eggfilled abdomen swells
        and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac suspended
        from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike
        membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped
        carelessly among the machinery  ripley realizes
        she ducked under part of it a moment before  inside
        the abdominal sac can be seen the forms of countless
        eggs churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor
        where they emerge glistening to be picked up by
        drones  the drones are tiny scuttling albino versions
        of the warrior aliens we have already seen

        ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher  she
        fires  pumps and fires again  four times  the
        grenades punch deep into the egg sac and explode
        ripping it open from within  eggs are tons of gelatinous
        matter pour across the chamber floor  the queen goes
        berserk screeching like some psychotic steam whistle
        ripley lays about her with the flamethrower igniting
        everything in sight with an insane fury  eggs shrivel
        in the inferno and figures of warriors and drones
        vanish in frenzied thrashing  over all is the queens
        shrieking as she struggles in the flames  two
        warriors emerge from the boiling smoke closing on
        her  she pulls the triggeran empty click  digital
        counter flashing crimson zeroes  she drops the
        magazine grabs another from her belt rams it home
        and opens up

        the creatures vanish in rapidfire flashes  ripley

        backs away venting her terror in a sustained orgy
        of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one
        long eyesearing expenditure of energy  then she
        dashes into the catacombs navigating by sheer primal
        instinct

        ripley runs blindly with panting intensity verging
        on hysteria  impressions crash upon herthe maze
        blurring by sirens howling the station rocking with
        explosions emergency lights flashing steam blasting
        redhot steel hissing  reality itself is reduced to
        a concussive series of strobelike instants of
        relentless forward motion

        she sees one of the flares she dropped and turns
        sees another sprinting toward it as the foundations
        of the world shake

        int egg chamber                                        177

        lashing in a frenzy the queen detaches from the egg
        sac ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and
        tissue behind it  seen dimly through swirling smoke
        it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward

        ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her firing
        bursts of pulserifle fire down side corridors at
        indistinct shapes and shadows  the weapon is empty
        when she reaches the freight elevators  a mass of
        debris falling down the shaft from a higher level
        has demolished the life cage she descended in  she
        slams the control for the other cage and hears the
        sound of the lift motors whine as it begins its
        slow descent from several levels up  an enraged
        screech echoes in the corridor  ripley sees a
        silhouette moving in the smokea glistening black
        shape which fills the corridor to the ceilingthe
        queen  her last cartridge is reading zeroes  the
        flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that
        the grenades are gone  ripley drops the weapon and
        looks up the shaft to the descending liftthen at
        the approaching figure  the elevator wont be in time
        she runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous
        screech beats in her ears  she scrambles up the
        rungs

        int second level                                       180

        ripley struggles up through a narrow hatch newt
        clinging to her  she dives aside as a powerful
        black arm shoots up through the opening its
        razor claws slamming into the grillefloor inches
        from her  looking down through the grille she
        sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her
        wet and leering  she scrambles up running as
        the grillefloor lifts and buckles behind her
        with the titanic force of the creature below
        it hurls itself with insane ferocity against the
        metal pacing her from below as she runs


        int stairwell                                          181

        ripley reaches an opengrid emergency stairwell and
        sprints upward  it rocks and shudders with the
        stations death throes

                                  voice
                   you now have two minutes

        the lift reaches bottom the doors rolling open
        the queen turns and freezes as if contemplating
        the open lift cage

        int stairwell                                          184

        ripley stumbles smashing her knees against the
        metals stairs  as she rises she hears the lift
        motors start up  looking down through the lattice
        work of the station she sees the life cage start
        ominously upward  she knows there is only one
        explanation for that  she runs on the stairwell
        becoming a crazy whirl around her

        ext landing platform                                   185

        ripley with newt still clinging to her slams
        through the door opening onto the platform
        through windwhipped streamers of smoke she
        seesthe ship is gone

                                  ripley
                   bishop

        her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred
        outrage at the final betrayal  she scans the sky
        nothing

                                  ripley
                          hysterical
                   bishop

        newt is sobbing

        the lift rises ponderously into view  ripley turns
        backing away from the doors toward the railing  there
        is no place to run to on the platform  explosions

        detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs
        swell upward through the machinery  the platform bucks
        wildly  nearby a cooling tower collapses with a
        thunderous roar and the shriek of rending steel  more
        explosions one after another rocketing up from below
        ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops  the
        safety cage parts

                                  ripley
                          to newt low
                   close your eyes baby

        the lift doors begin to open  a glimpse of the
        apparition within

        angle on ripley and newt  as the dropship rises right
        behind them its hovering jets roaring

                                  voice
                   you now have thirty seconds to
                   reach

        ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from
        the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship  a
        tremendous explosion rips through the complex nearby
        slamming the ship sideways  its extended landing legs
        foul in a tangle of conduit grinding with a hideous
        squeal of metal on metal

        ripley leaps into a seat with newt cradling her  begins
        strapping in  bishop wrestles with the controls  the
        landing legs retract ripping free  ripley slams her
        seat harness latches home

                                  ripley
                   punch it bishop

        the entire lower level of the station disappears in a
        fireball  the air vibrates with intense heat waves and
        concussion  the dropship engines fire  ripley is
        slammed back in her seat  the ship vaults out and up
        bishop standing it on its tail pouring on the gees
        ripley and newt see everything shake into a blur

        ext stratosphere                                       188

        the dropship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into
        the clear high night  below the clouds light up from
        beneath from horizon to horizon

        a sun hot dome of energy bursts up through the cloud
        layer whiting out the frame  the tiny ship is slammed
        by the shockwave tossed forwardand climbs scorched
        but functioning toward the stars

        int dropship                                          189

        ripley and newt watch the blinding glare fade away and
        they sit wideeyed trembling realizing they are
        finally and truly safe  newt starts to cry quietly
        and ripley strokes her hair

                                  ripley
                   its okay baby  we made it  its

        the scorched and battered ship once again sits in its

        engine  rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber
        hypnotically

        int dropship                                          191

        bishop stands behind ripley as she kneels beside a
        comatose hicks

                                  bishop
                   i gave him a shot for the pain
                   well need to get a stretcher to
                   cart him up to medical

        ripley nods and picking up newt precedes bishop down
        the aisle to the loading ramp

                                  bishop
                   im sorry if i gave you a scare
                   but that platform was just becoming
                   too unstable

        int cargo lock  dropship                             192

        bishop continues as they move down the ramp

                                  bishop
                   i had to circle and hope things
                   didnt get too rough to take you
                   off

        ripley turns to him stopping partway down the ramp
        she puts her hand on his shoulder

                                  ripley
                   you did okay bishop

                                  bishop
                   well thanks i 

        he notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the
        ramp next to his shoe  ssssss  acid  something bursts
        from his chest spraying ripley with milklike android blood
        it is the razorsharp scorpion tail of the alien queen
        driven right through him from behind  bishop thrashes
        seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands as is
        slowly lifts him off the deck  above them the queen
        glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic
        mechanisms inside one landingleg bay  it blends perfectly
        with the machinery until it begins to emerge  seizing
        bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him
        aside shredded like a doll  it descends slowly to the
        deck the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black
        limbs dripping acid and rage  still smoking where ripley
        halffried it  the queen is huge powerfuland very
        pissed off  it descends slowly its six limbs unfolding in
        inhuman geometries

        ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself staring
        hypnotizedterrified to break and run  she lowers newt
        to the deck never taking her eyes off the creature

                                  ripley
                          to newt
                   go

        newt runs for cover  the alien drops to the deck pivoting
        toward the motion  ripley waves her arms decoying

                                  ripley
                   here

        without warning it moves like lightning straight at her
        ripley spins sprinting as the creature leaps for her
        its feet slam echoing on the deck behind her  she clears
        a door  hits the switch  it whirrs closed  boom  the
        alien hits a moment later

        int dark chamber                                       193

        ripley moves ferretquick among dark unrecognizable
        machines

        various angles  very tight on what she is doingher feet
        going into stirruplike mechanisms  velcro straps
        fastened over them  fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence
        her hand closing on a complex gripcontrol  the hum of
        powerful motors  the whine of hydraulics

        int cargo lock                                         194

        the queen turns its attention from the doors to newt as
        the little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike
        service channels which cross the deck  the channels are
        covered by steel grillework and barely big enough for her
        to crawl through

        int channel                                            195

        newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the
        alien appears above seen through the bars  a section of
        grille is ripped away behind her  she scrambles
        desperately  another section is ripped away right at her
        heels  light pouring in  the next will be right above
        her

        int cargo lock                                         196

        the queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her
        the parting doors reveal an inhuman silhouette standing
        there

        ripley steps out wearing two tons of hardened steel
        the power loader  like medieval armor with the power of
        a bulldozer  she takes a stepthe massive foot
        crashclangs to the deck  she takes another advancing

        ripleys expression is one you hope youll never see
        hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her
        child and that primal murderous rage surges through her
        now banishing all fear

                                  ripley
                   get away from her you bitch

        the queen screeches pure lethality and leaps

        wallop  a roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches
        it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall  it
        rebounds into a massive backhand  crash  it goes
        backward into heavy loading equipment

                                  ripley
                          screaming
                   come on

        the queen emerges as a blur of rage lashing with
        unbelievable fury  the battle is joined

        claws swipe tail lashes  ripley parries with radical
        swipes of the steel forks  they circle in a whirling
        blur demolishing everything in their path  the cavernous
        chamber echoes with nightmarish soundswhine crash
        clang screech

        they lock in a death embrace ripley closes the forks
        crushing two of the creatures limbs  it lashes and
        writhes with incredible fury coming within inches of her
        exposed body  she lifts it off the ground  the hind
        legs rip at her slamming against the safety cage denting
        it in  the striking teeth extend almost a meter from
        inside its fanged maw shooting between the crashbars
        she ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion
        behind her dead in a spray of drool  yellow acid foams
        down the hydraulic arms toward her  the creature rips
        at highpressure hoses  purple hydraulic fluid sprays
        machine blood mixing with alien blood  they topple
        off balance  the queen pins her  ripley hits a switch
        the power loaders cutting torch flares on directly in
        the things face  they roll together over the lip of
        a rectangular pit a vertical loading airlock

        int loading lock                                       197

        they crash together four meters below twisted in the
        loaders wreckage  the alien shrieks pinned

        ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader
        and claws toward a panel of airlock actuating buttons
        she slaps the red inner door override and latches the
        hold lockingkey down  a klaxon begins to sound  she
        hits outer door open and there is a hurricane shriek of
        air as the doors on which they are lying separate
        revealing the infinite pit of stars below

        all this time the alien has been lashing at her in a
        frenzy and she has been parrying desperately in the
        confined space  the airlock becomes a wind tunnel
        blasting and buffetting her as she struggles to unstrap
        from the loader  the air of the vast ship howls past her
        into space as she claws her way up a service ladder

        int cargo bay                                          198

        newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across
        the floor toward the airlock   bishop torn virtually in
        two his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind
        grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for newt as she
        slides past him  he catches her arm and hangs on as she
        dangles dolllike in the airblast

        int loading lock                                       199

        the alien seizes ripleys ankle  she locks her arms
        around a ladder rung feels them almost torn out of
        their shoulder sockets

        the door opens farther all of space yawning below  the
        loader tumbles clear falling away  it drags the alien
        still clutching one of ripleys lucky hitops into the
        depths of space  its shriek fades it gone

        with all her strength ripley fights the blasting air
        crawling over the lip of the inner doorway  she releases
        the override from a second panel  the inner doors close
        the turbulent air eddies and settles

        she lies on her back drained of all strength  gasping
        for breath  weakly she turns her head seeing bishop
        still holding newt by the arm  encrusted with his own
        vanilla milkshake blood  bishop gives her a small grim
        smile

                                  bishop
                   not bad for a human

        he winks

        ripley crosses to newt

                                  newt
                          weakly

                                  ripley
                   right here baby  right here

        ripley hugs her desperately

        int corridor                                           200

        ripley limps along the corridor carrying newt on her hip
        the ships systems hum comfortingly  newts head rests
        on her shoulder

                                  newt
                   are we going to sleep now

                                  ripley

                                  ripley
                   yes honey  i think we both can

        hold on them as they recede down the long straight
        corridor

                                                         fade out
