               int staircase outside old salieris salon  night  1823

               total darkness we hear an old mans voice distinct and in 
               distress it is old salieri he uses a mixture of english 
               and occasionally italian

                                     old salieri
                         mozart mozart mozart forgive me  
                         forgive your assassin mozart

               a faint light illuminates the screen flickeringly we see 
               an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs  
               we are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the 
               point of view of the landing up the stair is coming a 
               branched candlestick held by salieris valet by his side is 
               salieris cook bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and 
               biscuits both men are desperately worried the valet is 
               thin and middleaged the cook plump and italian it is 
               very cold they wear shawls over their nightdresses and 
               clogs on their feet they wheeze as they climb the candles 
               throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house 
               which is evidently an old one and in bad decay a cat scuttles 
               swiftly between their bare legs as they reach the salon 
               door

               the valet tries the handle it is locked behind it the voice 
               goes on rising in volume

                                     old salieri
                         show some mercy i beg you i beg 
                         you show mercy to a guilty man

               the valet knocks gently on the door the voice stops

                                     valet
                         open the door signore please be 
                         good now weve brought you something 
                         special something youre going to 
                         love

               silence

                                     valet
                         signore salieri open the door come 
                         now be good

               the voice of old salieri continues again further off now 
               and louder we hear a noise as if a window is being opened

                                     old salieri
                         mozart mozart i confess it listen 
                         i confess

               the two servants look at each other in alarm then the valet 
               hands the candlestick to the cook and takes a sugared cake 
               from the dish scrambling as quickly as he can back down the 
               stairs

               ext the street outside salieris house  vienna  night

               the street is filled with people ten cabs with drivers 
               five children fifteen adults two doormen fifteen dancing 
               couples and a sled and three dogs it is a windy night snow 
               is falling and whirling about people are passing on foot 
               holding their cloaks tightly around them some of them are 
               revelers in fancy dress they wear masks on their faces or 
               hanging around their necks as if returning from parties  
               now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house  
               the window above the street is open and old salieri stands 
               there calling to the sky a sharpfeatured whitehaired 
               italian over seventy years old wearing a stained dressing 
               gown

                                     old salieri
                         mozart mozart i cannot bear it any 
                         longer i confess i confess what i 
                         did im guilty i killed you sir  
                         i confess i killed you

               the door of the house bursts open the valet hobbles out 
               holding the sugared cake the wind catches at his shawl

                                     old salieri
                         mozart perdonami forgive your 
                         assassin pietˆ pietˆ forgive your 
                         assassin forgive me forgive 
                         forgive

                                     valet
                              looking up to the 
                              window
                         thats all right signore he heard 
                         you he forgave you he wants you to 
                         go inside now and shut the window

               old salieri stares down at him some of the passersby have 
               now stopped and are watching this spectacle

                                     valet
                         come on signore look what i have 
                         for you i cant give it to you from 
                         down here can i

               old salieri looks at him in contempt then he turns away 
               back into the room shutting the window with a bang through 
               the glass the old man stares down at the group of onlookers 
               in the street they stare back at him in confusion

                                     bystander
                         who is that

                                     valet
                         no one sir hell be all right 
                         poor man hes a little unhappy you 
                         know

               he makes a sign indicating crazy and goes back inside the 
               house the onlookers keep staring

                                                                    cut to

               int landing outside old salieris salon  night

               the cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand 
               the dish of cakes in the other the valet arrives panting

                                     valet
                         did he open

               the cook scared shakes his head no the valet again knocks 
               on the door

                                     valet
                         here i am signore now open the 
                         door

               he eats the sugared cake in his hand elaborately and noisily

                                     valet
                         mmmm  this is good this is the 
                         most delicious thing i ever ate 
                         believe me signore you dont know 
                         what youre missing mmmm

               we hear a thump from inside the bedroom

                                     valet
                         now thats enough signore open

               we hear a terrible throaty groaning

                                     valet
                         if you dont open this door were 
                         going to eat everything therell be 
                         nothing left for you and im not 
                         going to bring you anything more

               he looks down from under the door we see a trickle of blood 
               flowing in horror the two men stare at it the dish of 
               cakes falls from the cooks hand and shatters

               he sets the candlestick down on the floor both servants run 
               at the door frantically  once twice three times  and the 
               frail lock gives the door flies open

               immediately the stormy frenzied opening of mozarts symphony 
               no 25 the little g minor begins we see what the servants 
               see

               int old salieris salon  night

               old salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood an open 
               razor in his hand he has cut his throat but is still alive  
               he gestures at them they run to him barely we glimpse the 
               room  an old chair old tables piled with books a forte
               piano a chamberpot on the floor  as the valet and the 
               cook struggle to lift their old master and bind his bleeding 
               throat with a napkin

               int ballroom  night

               twentyfive dancing couples fifty guests ten servants 
               full orchestra

               as the music slows a little we see a masquerade ball in 
               progress a crowded room of dancers is executing the slow 
               portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820s

               ext street outside salieris house  night

               as the fast music returns we see old salieri being carried 
               out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants and placed 
               in a horsedrawn wagon under the supervision of a middle
               aged doctor in a tall hat this is doctor gulden he gets in 
               beside his patient the driver whips up the horse and the 
               wagon dashes off through the stillfalling snow

               montage

               ext four streets of vienna and

               int the wagon  night

               the wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city  
               inside the conveyance we see old salieri wrapped in blankets 
               halfconscious being held by the hospital attendants doctor 
               gulden stares at him grimly the wagon arrives outside the 
               general hospital of vienna

                                                                    cut to

               int a hospital corridor  late afternoon

               a wide whitewashed corridor doctor gulden is walking down 
               it with a priest a man of about forty concerned but 
               somewhat selfimportant this is father vogler chaplain at 
               the hospital in the corridor as they walk we note several 
               patients  some of them visibly disturbed mentally all 
               patients wear white linen smocks doctor gulden wears a dark 
               frockcoat vogler a cassock

                                     doctor gulden
                         hes going to live its much harder 
                         to cut your throat than most people 
                         imagine

               they stop outside a door

                                     doctor gulden
                         here we are do you wish me to come 
                         in with you

                                     vogler
                         no doctor thank you

               vogler nods and opens the door

               int old salieris hospital room  late afternoon

               a bare room  one of the best available in the general 
               hospital it contains a bed a table with candles chairs a 
               small fortepiano of the early nineteenth century as vogler 
               enters old salieri is sitting in a wheelchair looking out 
               the window his back is to us the priest closes the door 
               quietly behind him

                                     vogler
                         herr salieri

               old salieri turns around to look at him we see that his 
               throat is bandaged expertly he wears hospital garb and 
               over it the civilian medal and chain with which we will later 
               see the emperor invest him

                                     old salieri
                         what do you want

               he propels his wheelchair to the fortepiano and plays an 
               unrecognizable melody

               salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously he 
               is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of 
               sweet things his attention is attracted in particular by a 
               huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a 
               pineapple he reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls 
               but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him  
               he ducks down behind the pastry table

               a girl  constanze  rushes into the room she runs straight 
               across it and hides herself behind one of the tables

               after a beat of total silence mozart runs into the room 
               stops and looks around he is age twentysix wearing a 
               fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the 
               archbishop of salzburg upon it he is puzzled constanze has 
               disappeared

               baffled he turns and is about to leave the room when 
               constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny 
               mouse instantly mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling 
               across the floor meowing and hissing like a naughty cat 
               watched by an astonished salieri mozart disappears under 
               the cloth and obviously pounces upon constanze we hear a 
               highpitched giggle which is going to characterize mozart 
               throughout the film

               he leaps up disheveled and rumpled and runs out of the room  
               salieri watches in amazement and disgust

                                                                    cut to

               the opening of the serenade is being tentatively conducted 
               by the leader of the windmusicians guests turn around as 
               mozart appears  bowing to the archbishop  and walks with 
               an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is 
               playing the leader yields his place to the composer and 
               mozart smoothly takes over conducting

               herself at the back

               the music fades down salieri stands shocked from his 
               inadvertent eavesdropping after a second he moves almost in 
               a trance toward the door the music dissolves

               int grand salon  day  1780s

               mozart is conducting the adagio from his serenade k 361 
               guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists the squeezebox  
               opening of the movement begins salieri appears at the door 
               at the back of the salon he stares in disbelief at mozart

               the music swells up and salieri listens to it with eyes closed  
               amazed transported  suddenly engulfed by the sound finally 
               it fades down and away and changes into applause salieri 
               opens his eyes

               the audience is clearly delighted mozart bows to them also 
               delighted colloredo rises abruptly and without looking at 
               mozart or applauding and leaves the salon count arco 
               approaches the composer mozart turns to him radiant

               he extends his hand to be kissed mozart does it with a

               int palace corridor  day  1780s

               a group of people who have attended the concert among them 
               constanze are standing outside the private apartment at 
               sight of the composer they break into sustained applause  
               mozart is suddenly delighted he throws the door wide open

               so that the guests can see into the private apartment where 
               the archbishop sits  and he can see them colloredo is 
               clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee he 
               smiles and bows uneasily as they include him in the small 
               ovation

               mozart stands in the corridor out of the archbishops line 
               of sight bowing and giggling and encouraging the applause 
               for the archbishop with conducting gestures suddenly 
               irritated colloredo signs to arco who steps forward and 
               shuts the door ending the applause

               int palace grand salon  day  1780s

               salieri in this vast room is standing and looking at the 
               full score of the serenade he turns the pages back to the 
               slow movement instantly we again hear its lyrical strains

               cu salieri reading the score of the adagio in helpless 
               fascination the music is played against his description of 
               it

                         extraordinary on the page it looked 
                         nothing the beginning simple almost 
                         comic just a pulse  bassoons and 
                         basset horns  like a rusty 
                         squeezebox then suddenly  high 
                         above it  an oboe a single note 
                         hanging there unwavering till a 
                         clarinet took over and sweetened it 
                         into a phrase of such delight this 
                         was no composition by a performing 
                         monkey this was a music id never 
                         heard filled with such longing 
                         such unfulfillable longing it had 
                         me trembling it seemed to me that i 
                         was hearing a voice of god

               suddenly the music snaps off mozart stands before him as he 
               lays down the score

                                     mozart
                         excuse me

               he takes the score bows and struts briskly out of the room  
               salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little 
               figure

                         not to be believed this piece had

                         to keep mozart in vienna majesty 
                         it should really infuriate the

                         is your majestys intention

               a somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study  
               we see a fourposter bed also a marble mantelpiece above 
               which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood bearing the figure 
               of a severe christ opposite this image sits salieri at his 
               desk on which stands a pile of music paper quill pens and 
               ink on one side of him is an open fortepiano on which he 
               occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing 
               with some difficulty he scratches notes out with his quill 
               and ruffles his hair  which we see without a powdered wig  
               there is a knock at the door

                                     salieri

                                     salieri

                         me see

               greedily he unwraps the napkin and lifts the lid on the box

               she gives a little curtsey flattered and giggling and is 
               shown out salieri turns back to his work chewing he plays 
               through a complete line of the march he smiles pleased

                         grazie signore

               he inclines his head to the christ above the  fireplace and 
               starts to play the whole march including the phrase which 
               pleased him

               int a wigmakers shop  vienna  day  1780s

               the march continues on the fortepiano as we see mozart 
               seated in front of a mirror wearing an extravagant wig on 
               either side of him stands a salesman one of them holding 
               another wig equally extravagant mozart takes off the first 
               wig to reveal his own blonde hair of which he is extremely 
               proud and hands it back

                                     mozart
                         and the other one

               the salesman puts the second wig on his head mozart pulls a 
               face of doubt in the mirror

                                     mozart
                         and the other one

               he takes it off and the other salesman replaces it with the 
               first wig on his head

                                     mozart

               the emperor goes to the instrument sits and plays the first

                         slowly slowly i need a minute to 
                         practice

               the majordomo bows and goes the emperor addresses himself 
               to the march he plays a wrong note

                                     salieri

               int palace corridor  vienna  day  1780s

               taking his instructions literally the majordomo is marching 
               very slowly toward the salon door he is followed by a 
               bewildered mozart dressed very stylishly and wearing one of 
               the wigs from the perruqier

               int royal palace grand salon  day  1780s

                         herr mozart

               mozart comes in eagerly immediately the march begins played 
               by his majesty all the courtiers stand listening with 
               admiration joseph plays well but applies himself fiercely 
               to the manuscript mozart still bewildered regards the 
               scene but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself 
               it finishes and all clap obsequiously

                                     orsinirosenberg
                         bravo your majesty

                         well done sire

               the emperor rises pleased with himself he snatches the 
               manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the 
               rest of the scene

                                     joseph
                         gentlemen gentlemen a little less 
                         enthusiasm i beg you ah mozart

               he extends his hand mozart throws himself to his knees and 
               to josephs discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour

                                     mozart

                         little concert here as he got off 
                         the stool he slipped and fell my 
                         sister antoinette helped him up 
                         herself and do you know what he 
                         did jumped straight into her arms 
                         and said will you marry me yes or 
                         no

               embarrassed mozart bursts into a wild giggle joseph helps 
               him out

               and makes for the door all bow then he becomes aware of 
               the manuscript in his hand

                                     joseph
                         ah this is yours

               mozart does not take it

                                     mozart
                         keep it sire if you want to it is 
                         already here in my head

                                     joseph
                         what on one hearing only

                                     mozart
                         i think so sire yes

               pause

                                     joseph
                         show me

               mozart bows and hands the manuscript back to the emperor  
               then he goes to the fortepiano and seats himself the others 
               except for salieri gather around the manuscript held by the 
               king mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly 
               accuracy

                                     mozart
                              to salieri
                         the rest is just the same isnt it

               he plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a 
               phrase which he repeats dubiously

                                     mozart
                         that really doesnt work does it

               all the courtiers look at salieri

                                     mozart
                         did you try this wouldnt it be 
                         just a little more 

               he plays another phrase

                                     mozart
                         or this  yes this better

               he plays another phrase gradually he alters the music so 
               that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in 
               the marriage of figaro non piu andrai he plays it with 
               increasing abandon and virtuosity salieri watches with a 
               fixed smile on his face the court watches astonished he 
               finishes in great glory takes his hands off the keys with a 
               gesture of triumph  and grins

               int bedroom in salieris apartment  day  1780s

               we see the olivewood cross salieri is sitting at his desk 
               staring at it

                                     salieri

               on another knock louder

                                     salieri

                         my dear it will hardly enhance your 
                         reputation to be celebrated throughout 
                         vienna as a singing prostitute for a 
                         turk

               he seats himself at the fortepiano

                                     cavalieri
                         oh well perhaps you could introduce 
                         us anyway

                                     salieri
                         perhaps

               he plays a chord she sings a scale expertly he strikes 
               another chord she starts another scale then breaks off

                                     cavalieri
                         what does he look like

                                     salieri
                         you might be disappointed

                                     cavalieri
                         why

                                     salieri
                         looks and talent dont always go 
                         together katherina

                                     cavalieri
                              airily
                         looks dont concern me maestro  
                         only talent interests a woman of 
                         taste

               he strikes the chord again firmly cavalieri sings her next 
               scale then another one and another one doing her exercises 
               in earnest as she hits a sustained high note the orchestral 
               accompaniment in the middle of martern aller arten from il 
               seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from 
               exercises to the exceedingly florid aria

               we dissolve on the singers face and she is suddenly not 
               merely turbaned but painted and dressed totally in a turkish 
               manner and we are on

               int opera stage  vienna  1780s

               the heroine of the opera cavalieri is in full cry addressing 
               the pasha with scorn and defiance

               the house is full watching the performance  which is 
               conducted by mozart from the clavier in the midst of the 
               orchestra  we note von strack orsinirosenberg bonno and 
               von swieten all grouped around the emperor in a box

               in another box we see an overdressed middleaged woman and 
               three girls one of whom is constanze this is the formidable 
               madame weber and her three daughters constanze josefa and 
               sophie all are enraptured by the spectacle and madame weber 
               is especially enraptured by being there at all not so 
               salieri who sits in another box coldly watching the stage

               cavalieri is singing martern aller arten from the line doch 
               du bist entschlossen

                                     cavalieri
                         since you are determined since you 
                         are determined calmly with no 
                         ferment welcome  every pain and 
                         woe bind me then  compel me bind 
                         me then  compel me hurt me break 
                         me kill me at last i shall be freed 
                         by death

               after a few moments of this showy aria with the composer 
               and the singer staring at each other  he conducting 
               elaborately for her benefit and she following his beat with 
               rapturous eyes  the music fades and salieri speaks over 
               it

                                     old salieri vo
                         there she was i had no idea where 
                         they met  or how  yet there she 
                         stood on stage for all to see showing 
                         off like the greedy songbird she 
                         was ten minutes of ghastly scales 
                         and arpeggios whizzing up and down 
                         like fireworks at a fairground

               music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria

                                     cavalieri
                              singing
                         be freed at last by death be freed 
                         at last by death at last i shall be 
                         freed by death

               before the orchestral coda ends cut to

               int old salieris hospital room  night  1823

               through the window we see that night has fallen

                         understand i was in love with the

                         a finger on her all the same i 
                         couldnt bear to think of anyone 
                         else touching her  least of all the 
                         creature

                                                               cut back to

               int   the opera house  vienna  night  1780s

               the brilliant turkish finale of seraglio bursts over us  
               all the cast is lined up on stage mozart is conducting with 
               happy excitement

               the curtains fall much applause the emperor claps vigorously 
               and  following his lead  so do the courtiers the curtains 
               part mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back he 
               skips up onto the stage amongst them the curtains fall again 
               as they all bow in the auditorium the chandeliers descend 
               filling it with light

               the curtains are down and an excited hubbub of singers in

                         what do you mean sire

                         well i mean occasionally it seems 
                         to have how shall one say
                              he stops in

                         required neither more nor less

                                     joseph
                         my dear fellow there are in fact 
                         only so many notes the ear can hear 
                         in the course of an evening i think 
                         im right in saying that arent i 
                         court composer

                              to salieri
                         but this is absurd

                                     joseph

                         its quality work and there are 
                         simply too many notes thats all 
                         cut a few and it will be perfect

                                     mozart
                         which few did you have in mind 
                         majesty

                         well there it is

               into this uncomfortable scene bursts a sudden eruption of 
               noise and madame weber floods onto the stage followed by 
               her daughters all turn to look at this amazing spectacle

                                     madame weber
                         wolfi wolfi my dear

               she moves toward mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd 
               theatrical gesture then sees the emperor she stares at 
               him mesmerized her mouth open unable even to curtsey

                                     madame weber
                         oh

               cu of salieri watching her receive it

                         my fathers consent your majesty  
                         not entirely not altogether

               he giggles uncomfortably

                                     joseph
                         excuse me but how old are you

                                     joseph
                         well my advice is to marry this 
                         charming young lady and stay with us 
                         in vienna

                                     madame weber
                         you see you see ive told him that 
                         your majesty but he wont listen to 
                         me

               cavalieri is glaring at mozart mozart looks hastily away 
               from her

                                     madame weber
                         oh your majesty you give such 
                         wonderful  such impeccable  such 
                         royal advice i  i  may i

               she attempts to kiss the royal hand but faints instead  
               the emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a 
               pace

                                     joseph
                         well there it is strack

               he nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage with his 
               chamberlain all bow

               cavalieri turns with a savage look at mozart and leaves the 
               stage the opposite way to her dressing room tossing her 
               plumed head salieri watches mozart stays for a second 
               indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help madame weber

                                     constanze
                              to mozart
                         get some water

               he hurries away the daughters gather around madame weber

               katherina sits fuming at her mirror a dresser is taking the 
               pins out of her wig as she stares straight ahead of her 
               mozart sticks his head round the door

                                     mozart

               he dashes off

               constanze and mozart make their way quickly through a crowd 
               of actors in turbans and caftans and stagehands carrying 
               bits of the dismantled set of seraglio we see all the turmoil 
               of backstage after a performance

               a fireman passes mozart carrying a small bucket of water 
               mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the 
               crowd to madame weber who still lies prone on the stage 

               mozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws 
               water on her face she is instantly revived by the shock 
               constanze assists her to rise

                         are you all right

               instead of being furious madame weber smiles at them 
               rapturously

                         it was incomprehensible what was 
                         god up to here i was denying all my 
                         natural lust in order to deserve 
                         gods gift and there was mozart 
                         indulging his in all directions  
                         even though engaged to be married  
                         and no rebuke at all was it possible 
                         i was being tested was god expecting 
                         me to offer forgiveness in the face 
                         of every offense no matter how 
                         painful that was very possible all 
                         the same why him why use mozart to 
                         teach me lessons in humility my 
                         heart was filling up with such hatred 
                         for that little man for the first 
                         time in my life i began to know really 
                         violent thoughts i couldnt stop 
                         them

                         into marriage i know my son he is 
                         too simple to see the trap  and

                         cares for him

                         im not surprised money seems to be 
                         more important to him than loyalty

                         to vienna let vienna look out for

                         i thank you

               in deepest gratitude he kisses the archbishops hand he 
               motions leopold to rise we hear the first dark fortissimo 
               chord which begins the overture to don giovanni the theme 
               associated with the character of the commendatore

                                     leopold vo
                         my dear son

               the second fortissimo chord sounds

               int a baroque church  day  1780s

               we see a huge cu of mozarts head looking front and down 
               as if reading his fathers letter we hear leopolds voice 
               over this image no longer whining and anxious but 
               impressive

                                     leopold vo

                         steps toward marriage until we meet 
                         you are too gullible to see your own 
                         danger as you honour the father who 
                         has devoted his entire life to yours

                         i will

               the camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling 
               beside constanze a priest faces them behind them are madame 
               weber josefa and sophie weber and a very few others among 
               them a merry looking lady in bright clothes the baroness 
               waldstadten

                         i now pronounce you man and wife

               the opening kyrie of the great mass in c minor is heard  
               mozart and constanze kiss they are in tears madame weber 
               and her daughters look on approvingly the music swells and 
               continues under the following

               int a room in leopolds house  salzburg  night  1780s

               there is a view of a castle in background leopold sits alone 
               in his room he is reading a letter from wolfgang at his 
               feet are his trunks halfpacked for the journey he will not 
               now take we hear mozarts voice reading the following letter 
               and we see as the camera roves around the room mementos of 
               the young prodigys early life the little fortepiano made 
               for him the little violin made for him an order presented 
               to him we see a little starling in a wicker cage and we 
               see portraits of the boy on the walls concluding with the 
               familiar family portrait of wolfgang and his sister nannerl 
               seated at the keyboard with leopold standing and the picture 
               of their mother on the wall behind them

                                     mozart vo

                         and kiss your hand a hundred thousand 
                         times

               the music of the mass fades as leopold crumples the letter 
               in his hand

                         an interesting idea majesty but

                         impossible im afraid wolfi would 
                         be frantic if he found those were 
                         missing you see theyre all

               a pause he puts out his hand and takes up the portfolio 
               from the table he opens it he looks at the music he is 
               puzzled

                                     salieri
                         these are originals

                         astounding it was actually beyond 
                         belief these were first and only 
                         drafts of music yet they showed no 
                         corrections of any kind not one  
                         do you realize what that meant

               vogler stares at him

                                     old salieri
                         hed simply put down music already 
                         finished in his head page after 
                         page of it as if he was just taking 
                         dictation and music finished as no 
                         music is ever finished

               int salieris salon  late afternoon  1780s

               cu the manuscript in mozarts handwriting the music begins 
               to sound under the following

                                     old salieri vo
                         displace one note and there would be 
                         diminishment displace one phrase 
                         and the structure would fall it was 
                         clear to me that sound i had heard 
                         in the archbishops palace had been 
                         no accident here again was the very 
                         voice of god i was staring through 
                         the cage of those meticulous ink
                         strokes at an absolute inimitable 
                         beauty

               the music swells what we now hear is an amazing collage of 
               great passages from mozarts music ravishing to salieri and 
               to us the court composer oblivious to constanze who sits 
               happily chewing chestnuts her mouth covered in sugar walks 
               around and around his salon reading the pages and dropping 
               them on the floor when he is done with them we see his 
               agonized and wondering face he shudders as if in a rough 
               and tumbling sea he experiences the point where beauty and 
               great pain coalesce more pages fall than he can read 
               scattering across the floor in a white cascade as he circles 
               the room

               finally we hear the tremendous qui tollis from the mass in 
               c minor it seems to break over him like a wave and unable 
               to bear any more of it he slams the portfolio shut 
               instantly the music breaks off reverberating in his head 
               he stands shaking staring wildly constanze gets up 
               perplexed

                                     constanze

               he rings a silver bell for a servant and abruptly leaves the

               faint knocking at the door salieri stirs himself a servant 
               appears

                                     servant

               int salon in salieris apartment  night  1780s

               constanze is sitting on an upright chair veiled as before 
               the portfolio of music on her lap through the far door 
               leading from the hall another servant is peering at her  
               the first servant joins him and shuts the door on the girl 
               leaving her alone

               we stay with her the clock ticks on the mantelpiece we 
               hear an old carriage pass in the street below nervously she 
               lifts her veil and looks about her

               suddenly salieri appears from the music room he is pale and 
               very tight they regard each other she smiles and rises to 
               greet him affecting a relaxed and warm manner as if to put 
               him at his ease

               as she talks she extinguishes the candles in a pair of 
               venetian candelabra and subsequently other candles around 
               the room

                         lovely but we cant afford them  
                         it doesnt do any good the more i

               she picks up the portfolio

                                     constanze
                         do you still want to look at this 
                         or dont we need to bother anymore  
                         i imagine we dont really

               she looks at him inquiringly and drops the portfolio on the 
               floor pages of music pour out of it instantly we hear a 
               massive chord and the great qui tollis from the mass in c 
               minor fills the room to its grand and weighty sound 
               constanze starts to undress watched by the horrified salieri  
               between him and her music is an active presence hurting 
               and baffling him he opens his mouth in distress the music 
               pounds in his head the candle flickers over her as she 
               removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace suddenly 
               he cries out

                                     salieri
                         go go go

               he snatches up the bell and shakes it frantically not 
               stopping until the two servants we saw earlier appear at the 
               door the music stops abruptly they stare at the appalled 
               and frightened constanze who is desperately trying to cover 
               her nakedness

                         you shit you shit you rotten shit

               he seizes her wrists and thrusts her back then he leaves 
               the room quickly slamming the door behind him constanze 
               turns and sees the two servants goggling at her in the room

                                     constanze
                         what are you staring at

               wildly she picks up the candelabrum and throws it at them  
               it shatters on the floor

                         fraulein

                                     frau schlumberg
                         just one year

                                     mozart
                         who was your teacher

                                     frau schlumberg
                         i was but she quite outgrew the 
                         little i could show her

                                     mozart
                         thank you madame

                         come on now  courage play me 
                         something you know

               in response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard 
               without playing a note an awkward pause

                                     mozart
                         perhaps it would be better if we 
                         were left alone i think were both 
                         a little shy

               husband and wife look at each other

                                     schlumberg
                         nonsense strudels not shy shes 
                         just willful you give into her now 
                         youll be sorry later strudel  
                         play

               silence the girl sits unmoving schlumberg bellows

                                     schlumberg
                         i said play

                                     mozart
                         perhaps if i were to play a little 
                         first it might encourage the 
                         fraulein
                              to the girl
                         why dont you let me try the 
                         instrument all right

               suddenly the girl rises mozart smiles at the parents they 
               smile nervously back mozart slides along the bench raises 
               his hands and preludes over the keys instantly a dog howls 
               loudly startled mozart stops schlumberg leaps to his feet 
               and goes over to the beagle

                                     schlumberg
                         stop that dudelsachs stop it at 
                         once

                         too please please  play i beg 
                         you

               mozart resumes playing this time it is a lively piece 
               perhaps the presto finale from the k 450 the dog howls 
               immediately

                                     schlumberg
                         stop it stop

               mozart stops

                                     schlumberg

                         dog you keep playing its most 
                         important he always howls when he 
                         hears music weve got to break them 
                         of the habit play please please

               amazed mozart starts to play the rondo again the dog howls 
               louder

                                     schlumberg
                         thats it now keep going just keep 
                         going
                              to the beagle

                         herr mozart thats it go on go 
                         on

               mozart plays on suddenly the dog falls silent schlumberg 
               smiles broadly

                                     schlumberg
                         good good good very good dog 
                         very very good dudelsachs
                              to his wife snapping 
                              his fingers
                         quick quick dear bring his biscuit

               the wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits a servant brings 
               in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray he 
               puts it down beside mozart as schlumberg addresses the silent 
               dog with deepest affection

                                     schlumberg
                         now guess whos going to get a nice 
                         reward clever clever dudi

               he gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily  
               mozart stops playing and stands up

                                     schlumberg
                         its a miracle herr mozart

                                     mozart
                              barely controlling 
                              himself
                         well im a good teacher the next 
                         time you wish me to instruct another 
                         of your dogs please let me know  
                         goodbye fraulein goodbye madame 
                         goodbye sir

               he bows to them and leaves the room they look after him in 
               puzzled astonishment

                                     frau schlumberg
                         what a strange young man

                                     schlumberg
                         yes he is a little strange

               ext a busy street in vienna  day  1780s

               a cheerful scene we see mozart strutting and beaming making 
               his way through the crowd of porters carriers and hawkers 
               sellers of sausages and pastries vendors of hats and ribbons  
               horses and carriage clatter past him his mood is best 
               expressed by a bubbling version of non piu andrai played on 
               the fortepiano

               still in the same mood he enters the door of his own house

               int mozarts house  hallway   day  1780s

               suddenly he stops he looks up the stairs the grim opening 
               chords from the overture to don giovanni cut across the march 
               from figaro what he sees looking up the stairs is a 
               menacing figure in a long grey cape and dark grey hat 
               standing on the landing the light comes from behind the 
               figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its 
               arms towards mozart in an alarming gesture of possession  
               it takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held 
               before mozart realizes who it is then as the music 
               continues he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes 
               joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figures 
               arms

                                     mozart
                         papa papa

               both men embrace the music slowly fades

               int mozarts living room  day  1780s

               a cramped lowceilinged little room which nobody has tidied 
               for ages we see music lying everywhere also there are many 
               empty wine bottles musical instruments  among them a 
               mandolin a viola a fortepiano with the black and white 
               keys reversed  books and abandoned plates of food

               mozart clasps his fathers arms leopold is now seen as an 
               aging travelstained man in clothes that need repair his 
               face is lined and he is obviously not in perfect health

                                     mozart
                         why are you here

                                     leopold

                         thousand times papa my papa

               he kisses his hands

                                     leopold

                         you this wife of yours

               mozart ducks away and fetches his fathers bags from the 
               landing

                                     mozart

               leopold looks about him at the mess in the room

                         do you always live like this

                         very sweet woman youll see

               he carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the 
               bedroom constanze lies in bed she sits up startled

                                     mozart

               constanze who looks ill and tired stares at leopold  
               leopold stares back from the doorway

                                     mozart
                         well wait well wait why dont 
                         you get up now darling

               he closes the door again

               constanze comes into the room she is wearing a dressing

               sounds through all the following this is an alternate song 
               from il seraglio a very extroverted tune for baritone and 
               orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum the vocal part 
               should be arranged for trumpet

               shopping

               int a costume shop  vienna  day  1780s

               this is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades  
               it is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds  
               wolfgang is wearing a costume a mask pushed up on his 
               forehead constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask 

               amidst the merriment leopold is helped by two assistants to 
               put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat to 
               which is attached a full mask of dark grey its mouth is cut 
               into a fixed upward smile

               he turns and looks at his son through this mask

               int a large party room  vienna  night  1780s

               we are in the full whirl of a masquerade ball couples are 
               dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes the music of 
               ich mochte wohl der kaiser sein increases in volume and 
               persists we see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade 
               above the dancers a steer is being roasted through the 
               bobbing crowd we see a group headed by the figure of bacchus  
               this is schikaneder in a greek costume wearing vine leaves 
               in his hair he is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses 
               and three other men constanze as columbine and mozart as 
               harlequin are pulling leopold by the hand of his dark cloak 
               and smiling mask this whole group threads its way across 
               the crowded room and disappears through a door as they go 
               they are watched by salieri standing alone in a corner 
               wearing ordinary evening clothes he turns away hastily to 
               avoid being seen by them

               as soon as they disappear into the far room salieri goes 
               quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino 
               masks off a tray he quickly takes a small black mask and 
               puts it on

                                                                    cut to

               int a grotto room next door  night  1780s

               a fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto lit by candles  
               a fortepiano to one side is being played by schikaneder  
               the music of ich mochte wohl der kaiser sein crossfades to 
               another tune  this is vivat bacchus from il seraglio which

               schikaneder dressed as bacchus is humming as he plays the 
               music is actually accompanying a game of forfeits which has 
               begun five couples the group we have just seen are dancing 
               in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs when the music 
               stops they will each have to find a chair and the one who 
               fails must pay a forfeit

               constanze is dancing with leopold mozart is dancing with 
               one of the actresses the two other actresses are dancing 
               with two other gentlemen and two children dance together  
               a little boy and a little girl the scene is watched by a 
               circle of bystanders among them  from the doorway  is 
               salieri

               schikaneder stops playing immediately the couples scramble 
               for the chairs leopold and constanze meet on the same chair 
               bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of 
               it to the amusement of the people around the chair over
               balances and they both end up on the floor constanze 
               immediately gets up again sets the chair on its feet and 
               tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time but 
               schikaneder calls out from the fortepiano

                                     schikaneder
                         no no you both lost you both lost 
                         you both have to forfeit and the 
                         penalty is you must exchange your 
                         wigs

               people are delighted by the idea of this penalty the children 
               jump up and down with excitement the three actresses 
               immediately surround leopold reaching for his hat and mask 
               and wig whilst he tries to hold on to them mozart takes 
               off constanzes wig  an absurd affair with sidecurls 
               constanze laughingly surrenders it

                                     leopold
                         no please this is ridiculous no 
                         please

               despite his protests an actress takes off his hat to which 
               the smiling mask is attached to reveal his outraged face 
               showing a very different expression underneath another 
               actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on 
               the old mans head the third actress takes constanzes wig 
               from mozart and attempts to put it on his fathers head

                                     leopold
                         no really

                                     mozart
                              calling to him
                         this is just a game papa

               constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice

                                     constanze
                         this is just a game papa

               laughingly the bystanders take it up especially the 
               children

                                     bystanders
                         this is just a game papa

               as leopold glares furiously about him the actress succeeds 
               in getting constanzes wig firmly onto his head everybody 
               bursts into applause delightedly constanze puts on leopolds 
               wig hat and mask from the waist up she now looks like a 
               weird parody of leopold in the smiling grey mask and he 
               looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig  
               schikaneder starts to play again and the couples start to 
               dance leopold angrily takes off constanzes wig and leaves 
               the circle his partner constanze is left alone seeing 
               this mozart leaves his partner and catches his father 
               entreatingly by the arm

                                     mozart
                         oh no papa please dont spoil the 
                         fun come on here take mine

               he takes off his own wig and puts it on leopolds uncovered 
               head the effect if not as ridiculous is still somewhat 
               bizarre since wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs he 
               takes constanzes wig from his father as this happens the 
               music stops again mozart gently pushes his father down onto 
               a nearby chair the others scramble for the other chairs 
               and he is left as the odd man out he giggles schikaneder 
               calls out to leopold from the keyboard

                                     schikaneder
                         herr mozart why dont you name your 
                         sons penalty

               applause

                                     mozart
                         yes papa name it name it ill do 
                         anything you say

                                     leopold
                         i want you to come back with me to 
                         salzburg my son

                                     schikaneder
                         what did he say what did he say

                                     mozart
                         papa the rule is you can only give 
                         penalties that can be performed in 
                         the room

                                     leopold
                         im tired of this game please play 
                         without me

                                     mozart
                         but my penalty ive got to have a 
                         penalty

               all the bystanders are watching

                                     schikaneder
                         ive got a good one ive got the 
                         perfect one for you come over here

               mozart runs over to the fortepiano and schikaneder 
               surrenders his place at it

                                     schikaneder
                         now i want you to play our tune  
                         sitting backwards

               applause

                                     mozart
                         oh thats really too easy any child 
                         can do that

               amused sounds of disbelief

                                     schikaneder
                         and a fugue in the manner of sebastian 
                         bach

               renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty mozart smiles 
               at schikaneder  it is the sort of challenge he loves he 
               defiantly puts on constanzes wig and seats himself with his 
               back to the keyboard before the astonished eyes of the 
               company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task 
               his right hand plays the bass part his left hand the treble 
               and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant 
               fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been 
               dancing

               attracted by this astonishing feat the players draw nearer 
               to the instrument so does salieri cautiously with some of 
               the bystanders constanze watches him approach only leopold 
               sits by himself sulking

               the fugue ends amidst terrific clapping the guests call out 
               to mozart

                                     guests
                         another do another someone else

                                     mozart
                         give me a name who shall i do  
                         give me a name

                                     guests
                         gluck haydn frederic handel

                                     constanze
                         salieri do salieri

               smash cut salieris masked face whips around and looks at 
               her

                                     mozart
                         now thats hard thats very hard 
                         for salieri one has to face the right 
                         way around

               giggling he turns around and sits at the keyboard then 
               watched by a highly amused group he begins a wicked parody

               he furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his 
               eyes then he begins to play the tune to which they danced 
               in the most obvious way imaginable relying heavily on a 
               totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and 
               dominant endlessly repeated the music is the very essence 
               of banality the bystanders rock with laughter mozart starts 
               to giggle wildly through this excruciating scene salieri 
               stares at constanze who suddenly turns her head and looks 
               challengingly back at him

               mozarts parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a 
               fart noise instead of notes to end cadences he builds this 
               up urged on in his clowning by everyone else until suddenly 
               he stops and cries out the laughter cuts off mozart stands 
               up clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his 
               breeches the momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl 
               of laughter

               paper and jots down notes he is very much in his own world

               picks up his cue and plays a shot on the billiard table he

                         it is not your place to ask questions  
                         is it true

                                     mozart
                         well yes i admit it is

                                     mozart

                                     orsinirosenberg
                         what you think mozart is scarcely 
                         the point it is what his majesty 
                         thinks that counts

                                     mozart
                         but your majesty 

                                     joseph
                              motioning him to be 
                              silent
                         mozart i am a tolerant man i do 
                         not censor things lightly when i 
                         do i have good reason figaro is a 
                         bad play it stirs up hatred between 
                         the classes in france it has caused 
                         nothing but bitterness my own dear 
                         sister antoinette writes me that she 
                         is beginning to be frightened of her 
                         own people i do not wish to see the 
                         same fears starting here

                                     mozart
                         sire i swear to your majesty theres 
                         nothing like that in the story i 
                         have taken out everything that could 
                         give offense i hate politics

                                     joseph
                         i think you are rather innocent my 
                         friend in these dangerous times i 
                         cannot afford to provoke our nobles 
                         or our people simply over a theatre 
                         piece

               the others look at their king solemnly all save mozart

                                     mozart
                         but majesty this is just a frolic  
                         its a piece about love

                                     joseph
                         ah love again

                         its so new people will go mad for 
                         it for example i have a scene in 
                         the second act  it starts as a duet 
                         just a man and wife quarreling 
                         suddenly the wifes scheming little 
                         maid comes in unexpectedly  a very 
                         funny situation duet turns into 
                         trio then the husbands equally 
                         screaming valet comes in trio turns 
                         into quartet then a stupid old 
                         gardener  quartet becomes quintet 
                         and so on  on and on sextet septet 
                         octet how long do you think i can 
                         sustain that

                                     joseph
                         i have no idea

                                     mozart
                         guess guess majesty imagine the 
                         longest time such a thing could last 
                         then double it

                                     joseph

                         sire only opera can do this in a 
                         play if more than one person speaks 
                         at the same time its just noise  
                         no one can understand a word but 
                         with music with music you can have 
                         twenty individuals all talking at 
                         once and its not noise  its a 
                         perfect harmony isnt that marvelous

                         your judgment of literature thats 
                         in question even with the politics 
                         taken out this thing would still 
                         remain a vulgar farce why waste 
                         your spirit on such rubbish  surely 
                         you can choose more elevated themes

                                     mozart
                         elevated what does that mean 
                         elevated the only thing a man should 
                         elevate is  oh excuse me im sorry 
                         im stupid but i am fed up to the 
                         teeth with elevated things old dead

                                     mozart
                         yes but this is not a ballet this 
                         is a dance at figaros wedding

                              withdrawing it 
                              imitating the emperor

               mozart giggles with relief and gratitude

                                     old salieri
                         im sure i dont need to tell you i 
                         said nothing whatever to the emperor  
                         i went to the theatre ready to tell 
                         mozart that his majesty had flown 
                         into a rage when i mentioned the 
                         ballet when suddenly to my 
                         astonishment in the middle of the 
                         third act the emperor  who never 
                         attended rehearsals  suddenly 
                         appeared

               int opera house  day  1780s

               in the background the same recitativo before the march the 
               emperor steals in surreptitiously with von strack his finger 
               to his lips he motions everyone not to rise and slips into 
               a chair behind salieri orsinirosenberg and bonno

               the three conspirators look at each other wideeyed

               the recitativo summons up the march but instead there is 
               silence mozart lays down his baton the musicians lay down 
               their instruments the celebrants of figaros wedding come 
               in with a few pitiful dance steps in procession only to 
               come presently to a halt lacking their music the singers 
               try to go on singing but they have no cues from their 
               conductor or from the accompaniment everyone on stage looks 
               lost though they attempt to go on with the story for a while 
               consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators mozart 
               glances back at the group seated in the theatre  finally 
               the emperor speaks in a whisper

                                     joseph
                         what is this i dont understand

                         majesty the herr director he has 
                         removed a balleto that would have 
                         occurred at this place

                                     joseph
                         why

                                     orsinirosenberg
                         it is your regulation sire no ballet 
                         in your opera

               mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot

                                     joseph
                         do you like this salieri

                         it is not a question of liking your 
                         majesty your own law decrees it 
                         im afraid

                                     joseph
                         well look at them

               we do look at them the spectacle on stage has now ground to 
               a complete halt

                                     joseph
                         no no no this is nonsense let me 
                         hear the scene with the music

               orsinirosenberg acknowledges his defeat

                         yes majesty

               orsinirosenberg rises and goes down to where mozart sits 
               anxiously with the musicians watching his approach

                                     orsinirosenberg
                         can we see the scene with the music 
                         back please

                         oh yes certainly certainly herr 
                         director

               he looks back deliriously at salieri trying to indicate his 
               gratitude salieri acknowledges with a slight and subtle 
               nod

               orsinirosenberg returns to his king

                              to orsinirosenberg
                         what i hoped by that edict director 
                         was simply to prevent hours of dancing 
                         like in french opera there it is 
                         endless as you know

               composer begins a reprise of the scene which had been cut 
               out the music of the march begins faintly the celebrants 
               of figaros wedding start to enter as the count and the 
               countess sit in their chairs

               in the theatre we see increasing pleasure on the emperors 
               face sullenness and defeat on the courtiers then suddenly 
               without interruption on a crescendo repeat of the march we

               company wheels in and around to the music of the restored 
               march which reaches a triumphant climax

                         revealed one of the true wonders of 
                         art the restored third act was bold 
                         and brilliant the fourth was a

                         first tender words he has offered 
                         her in years only because he thinks 
                         she is someone else i heard the

                         making my defeat more bitter with

               chord salieri becomes aware that some of the audience are 
               asleep and many mare are apathetic in the near silence we 
               see the emperor yawn behind his hand those nearby look at

                         the emperor only yawned once three 
                         yawns and the opera would fail the

                                                                    cut to

               int schikaneders theatre  night  1780s

               noise smoke the audience is sitting at tables for an evening 
               of vaudeville mozart constanze and their son karl now 
               about two years old and sitting on his mothers lap are 
               watching a parody scene by schikaneders troupe they are 
               rowdy bawdy and silly incorporating motifs situations and 
               tunes from mozarts operas which we have seen and heard 
               before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer plates 
               of sausages etc

               the parody

               on stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in don 
               giovannis palace shown before

               schikaneder as don giovanni is dancing with the three 
               actresses to the minuet from don giovanni end of act i 
               played by a quartet of tipsy musicians leporello is handing 
               around wine on a tray

               suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside the 
               music slithers to a stop all look at each other in panic 
               leporello drops his tray with a crash all go quiet one 
               more knock is heard then all musicians actresses don 
               giovanni and leporello make a dash to hide under the table 
               which is far too small to accommodate them all the table 
               rocks schikaneder is pushed out he is terrified he shakes 
               elaborately three more knocks are heard louder

                                     schikaneder
                         who is it

               one more knock

                                     schikaneder
                         ccccome in

               in the pit a chromatic scale from the overture to don giovanni 
               turns into a anticipatory vamp this grows more and more 
               menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the 
               back falls down

               an absurd pantomime horse gallops in it has a ridiculous 
               expression and is manned by four men inside standing 
               precariously on its back is a dwarf wearing a miniature 
               version of the armour and helmet worn by the commendatore  
               he sings in a high nasal voice

                                     commendatore
                              singing
                         don giovannnnnnnnnni

               he tries to keep his balance as he trots in but fails he 
               falls off onto the stage he beats at the horse trying to 
               get back on

                                     commendatore
                         down down

               bewildered the horse looks about him but cannot see his 
               small rider who is below his level of sight

                                     commendatore
                         im here im here

               the horse amidst laughter from the audience fails to locate 
               him exasperated the dwarf signals to someone in the wings  
               a tall man strides out carrying a seesaw on his shoulders 
               stands another man

               the dwarf stands on the lowered end of the seesaw there is 
               a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end 
               and the commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the 
               horse only backwards so that he is facing away from don 
               giovanni the two men bow to the applauding audience and 
               retire offstage

               the commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper 
               menacing attitude and at the same time turn around to face 
               don giovanni this he finds difficult

                                     commendatore
                              singing

                         a circus

               a trapeze sails in from above on it stands a grand soprano 
               wearing an elaborate turkish costume like a parody of 
               cavalieris in il seraglio she comes in singing a mad 
               coloratura scale in the manner of martern aller arten

                                     schikaneder

               he marches off stage

                              singing dramatically

                         at last i shall be freed by dea 

               the commendatore pulls out his sword reaches up and thrusts 
               her through with it the soprano collapses on the bar of the 
               trapeze the audience applauds at the same moment eight 
               dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water 
               they sing as they march to the sound of the march that was 
               cut from act iii of figaro they are dressed as miniature 
               copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are 
               wearing cooks hats

                                     eight dwarves
                              singing
                         were going to make a soprano stew 
                         were going to make a soprano stew 
                         and when you make a soprano stew 
                         any stupid soprano will do any stew
                         stewstewstewstew any stewpid 
                         soprano will do

               they set the giant pot down in the middle of the stage the 
               trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the 
               stage

               we hear the chromatic scale from the don giovanni overture 
               again repeated and repeated only now fast and tremolando 
               to this exciting vamp schikaneder suddenly rides in on a 
               real horse waving a real sword with this he cuts the string 
               of the trapeze and the soprano falls into the pot a 
               tremendous splash of water schikaneder rides out more 
               applause

               all the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb 
               up the sides of the pot the three girls produce labeled 
               bottles from under their skirts the first is salt

                         prestissimo leporello  where are 
                         you

               the table is raised in the air by leporello sitting under it 
               on a bale of hay

                                     first lady

                         behold

               ottavio the horse gives a piercing neigh and runs down to 
               the hay

                                     commendatore
                              holding on
                         hey hey watch out

               the vamp starts again vigorously the horses rearend swings 
               around on a hinge to turn his hindquarters straight on to 
               the audience the rest of him stays sideways his tail springs 
               up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding 
               his arsehole

               schikaneder offers him a handful of hay the horse eats it 
               and out the other end comes a long viennese sausage the 
               audience roars with laughter another handful of hay and out 
               of the other end falls a string of sausages then a large 
               pie crust and all then a shower of iced cakes 

               suddenly  silence schikaneder produces an egg from his 
               pocket ottavio the horse rears up in disgust

                                     commendatore
                         whoa whoa ottavio whoa

               leporello pries open the horses mouth schikaneder pops the 
               egg into it a breathless pause as a drum roll builds the 
               tension up and up and up and then suddenly out of the 
               horses rearend flies a single white dove

               wild applause

               it flies into the audience immediately all the cast start 
               humming the lyrical finale from figaro tutti contenti  
               more and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the 
               theatre everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins 
               to eat the end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and 
               magical and then suddenly the tempo changes and the coarse 
               strains of ich mochte wohl der kaiser take over and the whole 
               company is dancing frantically a general dance as the 
               curtain falls

               it rises immediately the audience  including mozart  is 
               delighted they applaud vigorously schikaneder takes a bow 
               amongst his troupe among much whistling and clapping he 
               finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience 
               toward the table where mozart sits with his family on stage 
               a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old 
               german tune some of the audience joins in singing it

                                     schikaneder

               int the imperial library  day  1790s

               von swieten and salieri stand close together several scholars 
               and students are examining scrolls and manuscripts at the 
               other end of the room

                                     von swieten
                              keeping his voice 
                              down

                         introduced mozart to some of my 
                         friends and hes begging from 
                         practically all of them it has to 
                         stop

                         do something for him

                                     salieri
                         no baron no im afraid mozart is 
                         a lost cause he has managed to 
                         alienate practically the whole of 
                         vienna he is constantly drunk he 
                         never pays his debts i cant think 
                         of one person to whom i dare recommend 
                         him

                                     von swieten

                         such a talent

                                     salieri
                         indeed just a moment  as a matter 
                         of fact i think i do know someone 
                         who could commission a work from 
                         him a very appropriate person to do 
                         so yes

               in

               visited with leopold now salieris servant stands in it 
               waiting we see a few other customers being served by the 
               staff renting masks costumes etc one of the staff emerges 
               from the back of the shop carrying a large box which he 
               hands to salieris servant the servant leaves the shop  
               through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy 
               street full of passersby carriages etc

               int salieris apartment  dusk  1790s

               the d minor concerto continues salieri alone eagerly opens 
               the box from the costume shop and takes out the same dark 
               cloak and hat that leopold wore to the masquerade only now 
               attached to the hat is a dark mask whose mouth is cut into a 
               frown not a laugh it presents a bitter and menacing 
               expression he puts on the cloak the hat and the mask and 
               turns his back suddenly we see the assembled and alarming 
               image reflected in a fulllength mirror the music swells 
               darkly

                                                                    cut to

               ext a snowy street in vienna  dusk  1790s

               as the tutti of the d minor concerto continues we see 
               salieri dressed in this menacing costume dark against the 
               snow stalking through a street which is otherwise lively 
               with people going to various festivities some of them wear 
               frivolous carnival clothes

               int mozarts living room  dusk  1790s

               mozart sits writing at a table he appears now to be really 
               quite sick his face expresses pain from his stomach cramps  
               there is a gentle knock at the door he rises goes to he 
               door and opens it immediately there is a shock cut

               the dark frowning mask stares at him and at us the violent 
               d minor chord which opens don giovanni is heard salieri in 
               costume stands in the doorway

                                     salieri
                         herr mozart

               the second chord sounds and fades mozart stares in panic

                                     salieri

                         again soon

               he turns away mozart closes the front door instantly we 
               hear the opening of the requiem mass also in d minor  
               mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on 
               the wall the portrait stares back constanze opens the door 
               from the bedroom she sees him staring up

                                     constanze
                         wolfi wolfi

               he looks at her with startled eyes the music breaks off

               he gives a strange little giggle

                                     constanze
                         whats the matter

               he stares at her she stares at him

               int old salieris hospital room  night  1823

               old salieri is now wildly animated totally driven by his 
               confession to vogler

                                     old salieri
                         my plan was so simple it terrified 
                         me first i must get the death mass 
                         and then achieve the death

               vogler stares at him in horror

                                     vogler
                         what

                                     old salieri
                         his funeral  imagine it the 
                         cathedral all vienna sitting there 
                         his coffin mozarts little coffin 
                         in the middle and suddenly in that 
                         silence music a divine music bursts 
                         out over them all a great mass of 
                         death requiem mass for wolfgang 
                         mozart composed by his devoted friend 
                         antonio salieri what sublimity 
                         what depth what passion in the music 
                         salieri has been touched by god at 
                         last and god forced to listen  
                         powerless  powerless to stop it i 
                         at the end for once laughing at 
                         him do you understand do you

                                     vogler
                         yes

                                     old salieri
                         the only thing that worried me was 
                         the actual killing how does one do 
                         that how does one kill a man its 
                         one thing to dream about it its 
                         very different when you have to do 
                         it with your own hands

               he raises his own hands and stares at them the raging dies 
               irae from mozarts requiem mass bursts upon us

                                                                    cut to

               int mozarts apartment  living room  night  1790s

               mozart sits working frantically at this demonic music his 
               whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever he 
               pours wine down his throat spilling it and grimaces as it 
               hits his stomach all around him are manuscripts

               there is a banging at the front door mozart does not hear 
               it the music raves on another knocking comes louder 
               constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her 
               distracted husband the knocking is repeated again even 
               more violently and insistently

                                     constanze
                         wolfi wolfi

               he looks at her the music breaks off silence an enormous 
               bang at the door startles him

               constanze moves to open it

                                     mozart

               mozart springs up he is clearly terrified

                                     mozart

                         working on it come back later

               he runs out of he room into his workroom and shuts he door  
               now a little scared herself constanze goes to he front door 
               and opens it cautiously schikaneder stands there floridly

                         so let me see it where is it

               mozart with a bright rather demented smile presents his 
               head to schikaneder

                                     mozart

                         drink

               he giggles schikaneder suddenly grabs his lapels

                                     schikaneder

                                     schikaneder

                         who are you

               schikaneder suddenly takes mozart by the arms and speaks to 
               him with intense appeal

                                     schikaneder

                              insistently
                         are you sure its an opera

               the overture to the magic flute begins grandly to the music 
               of the slow introduction we see

               int mozarts apartment  living room  night  1790s

               the room lit by a few candles appears dirty the camera 
               shows us again leopolds portrait on the wall looking down 
               upon a scene of disorder

               papers litter the table dirty dishes are piled in the 
               fireplace on the fortepiano lies mozarts masonic apron 
               woven with symbols to the more lyrical passage of the 
               introduction we see mozart take up a candle and enter

               int mozarts apartment  bedroom  night  1790s

               we watch him stand beside constanze who lies asleep mozart 
               now looks very ill his wife appears worn out tenderly he 
               touches her hair then he moves to the cot where his son 
               karl lies asleep and kneels pulls up the childs little 
               blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the 
               boys constanze opens her eyes and stares at him mozart 
               rises and returns to

               int mozarts apartment  living room  night  1790s

               the introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue 
               begins instantly mozart starts to dance to it all alone 
               gleefully like a child he looks up at his fathers portrait 
               and makes a silly rude gesture at it he is briefly an 
               irresponsible and happy boy again

               then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door the 
               music fades down warily mozart crosses and opens he door 
               the familiar dark chords from don giovanni cut across the 
               happy music it ends before him stands the masked stranger

                                     mozart
                         i dont have it yet its not 
                         finished im sorry but i need more

                                     mozart

                         a wonderful piece  the best i ever 
                         can

               he turns and looks constanze has come into the living room  
               nervously mozart indicates her

                                     mozart

               salieri contemplates them both

                         the sooner you finish the better 
                         your reward work

               he turns and goes down the stairs mozart shuts the door he 
               closes his eyes in fear

                                     constanze

               he will not look at her or reply

                         give me one reason i can understand

                                     mozart

                         its killing me

               he looks at her suddenly

                                     constanze
                         no this is really awful youre

                         you

               suddenly she starts to cry

                                     constanze
                         its not fair i worry about you all

                         nonsense and  and frighten me its 
                         not fair

               her tears flow mozart looks at her helplessly

                                     mozart
                         go back to bed

                                     constanze

                         please please

               she sits down tearfully staring at him

               we hear the rex tremendai majestatis from the requiem and 
               see on the wall the portrait of leopold mozart looking down  
               the camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table 
               mozart is writing the music he looks up and sees that 
               constanze is fast asleep in her chair mozart gets up quietly  
               he puts on his hat and cloak takes a bottle of wine and 
               tiptoes from the house without stopping the music changes 
               from the heavy requiem to the lighthearted patter of the 
               papapapa duet from the magic flute

                                                                    cut to

               fortepiano bottles and a chaos of papers strewn about in 
               the chairs are the three actresses giggling schikaneder 
               and mozart both drunk are singing the duet of the two bird
               people the actor sings papageno and the composer in a 
               soprano voice sings papagena at the keyboard absurdly 
               they end up rubbing noses and fall on each others necks

               he comes through he door and stares across the living room 
               at an open bedroom door puzzled he crosses

               the bedroom is also empty we see constanzes empty bed

                         selfish

               and with a scream madame webers voice turns into the shrill 
               packing coloratura of the second act aria of the queen of 
               the night in the magic flute

                                                               dissolve to

               int schikaneders theatre  night  1790s

               on stage we see the queen of the night fantastically costumed 
               furiously urging her daughter to kill sarastro as she sings 
               we see the interior of the theatre now rearranged from 
               when we last visited it to watch the cabaret an audience of 
               ordinary german citizens stands in the pit area or sits  
               they are rapt and excited

               the theatre also possesses boxes some of these show closed 
               curtains  their inhabitants presumably engaged in private 
               intimacies in one of them sits salieri

                                     queen of the night
                              singing furiously
                         a hellish wrath within my heart is 
                         seething death and destruction flame 
                         around my throne if not by thee 
                         sarastros light be extinguished 
                         then be thou mine own daughter never 
                         more rejected be forever so sundered 
                         be forever all the bonds of kin and 
                         blood hear hear hear god of 
                         vengeance hear thy mothers vow

               thunder and lightning she disappears amidst tremendous 
               applause from the audience

                                                                    cut to

               on the poster for the magic flute the name emmanuel

               we cut to the scene immediately before papagenos song ein 
               madchen oder weibchen papageno played by schikaneder 
               dressed in his costume of feathers is trying to get through 
               a mysterious door a voice calls from within

                                     voice
                         go back

                         which door i came in

                         go back oh this is awful

               he weeps extravagantly

               in the pit mozart indicates to the first violinist to take 
               over as conductor he slips from his place and goes stealthily 
               backstage we follow him over the scene we hear papageno 
               being addressed by the first priest in stern tones

                                     first priest
                              on stage
                         man thou hast deserved to wander 
                         forever in the darkest chasms of the 
                         earth the gentle gods have remitted 
                         thy punishment but yet thou shalt 
                         never feel the divine content of the 
                         consecrated ones

                                     papageno
                         oh well im not alone in that just 
                         give me a decent glass of wine  
                         thats divine content enough for me

               laughter an enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth

               we follow mozart into the wings actors and actresses stand 
               around in fantastic costumes we see a flying chariot and 
               parts of a huge snake lying about also the scenery door of 
               a temple with the word wisdom inscribed on the pediment 
               mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel 
               with several manuals and a musician waiting to play it 
               silently mozart indicates that he wishes to play the 
               instrument himself

               on stage schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the 
               first priest

                                     first priest
                         man hast thou no other desire on 
                         earth but just to eat and drink

                                     papageno
                              schikaneder
                         well

               laughter from the audience

                                     papageno
                         well actually i do have a rather 
                         weird feeling in my heart perhaps 
                         its just indigestion but you know 
                         i really would like  i really do 
                         want  something even nicer than 
                         food and drink now what on earth 
                         could that be

               he stares at the audience and winks at them they laugh

               now papagenos aria ein madchen oder weibchen begins it 
               is interpolated as he pretends to play his magic bells 
               with the glockenspiel actually being played offstage by 
               mozart schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see mozart 
               conducting he looks into the wings and realizes the situation 
               with amusement he sings joyfully and the audience watches 
               entranced

                         to heaven be flown

               at certain moments we see the stage from salieris point of 
               view schikaneder singing then pretending to play and then 
               we see mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes 
               in the wings then suddenly the actor mimes playing and 
               no sound comes he mimes again but still nothing comes he 
               looks offstage in anxiety there is evidently some commotion  
               people are looking down on the floor the song comes to a 
               nearhalt schikaneder stares then the comedian signals to 
               the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it at 
               this moment salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box

                                                                    cut to

               int wings of schikaneders theatre  night  1790s

               we see the actress playing papagena wearing an old tattered 
               cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a 
               hideous old woman over her face she is looking worriedly 
               down at mozart who is lying unconscious on the floor

               a few people around him are trying to revive him one has 
               put a wet handkerchief around his temples another is holding 
               a small bottle of smelling salts there are voices saying 
               doctor take him to a dressing room someone call a carriage 
               take him home etc papagena is urged to go on stage by a 
               distracted stage manager suddenly we hear the voice of 
               salieri

                                     salieri
                         ill take care of him

               he steps forward

                                     salieri
                         i have a carriage excuse me

               the actors step back respectfully he stoops and picks up 
               the frail composer in his arms mozart is quite limp and 
               salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck all this 
               is watched nervously by schikaneder on stage whilst performing 
               his scene with papagena as an ugly old woman

                                     ugly old woman
                         here i am my angel

                              appalled
                         what who the devil are you

                                     ugly old woman

                         some people get all the luck

               audience laughter the actress raises the little painted 
               cloth with the ugly old face on it to show her own pretty 
               young one to the audience more laughter

                                     ugly old woman

               but looks exceedingly ill salieri has set him down in the 
               winters night snow is falling

               he starts to collapse again salieri helps him into the sedan 
               the door is shut the chair sets off and salieri strides 
               beside it through the mean street a lantern with a candle 
               swings from the chair

               sedan chair he is followed by mozart carried in the arms 
               of one of the porters the room is now really in complete 
               disarray the table is piled high with music the pages of 
               the requiem lie amongst many empty wine bottles the porter 
               carries mozart into

               lie about on the floor a sock has been stuck into the broken 
               pane of one window

               the porter lays mozart down on the bed as salieri lights 
               candles from the lantern to reveal plates of halfeaten food 
               and other signs left by a man whose wife has departed it is 
               obviously very cold another very small bed nearby belongs

                              vaguely singing

               smiles

               int mozarts apartment  bedroom  night  1790s

               mozart is sitting up in bed propped against pillows the 
               coins lie on the coverlet many candles burn in the necks of 
               bottles salieri without coat or wig is seated at an 
               improvised worktable on it are blank sheets of music paper 
               quills and ink also the score of the requiem mass as so 
               far composed mozart is brighteyed with a kind of fever 
               salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire 
               to put down the notes as quickly as mozart can dictate them

                                     mozart
                         where did i stop

                                     salieri
                              consulting the 
                              manuscript
                         the end of the recordare  statuens

                                     mozart
                         so now the confutatis confutatis 
                         maledictis when the wicked are 
                         confounded flammis acribus addictis  
                         how would you translate that

                                     salieri
                         consigned to flames of woe

                                     mozart
                         do you believe in it

                                     salieri
                         what

                                     mozart
                         a fire which never dies burning one 
                         forever

                                     salieri
                         oh yes

                                     mozart
                         strange

                                     salieri
                         come lets begin

               he takes his pen

                                     salieri
                         confutatis maledictis

                                     mozart
                         we ended in f major

                                     salieri
                         yes

                                     mozart
                         so now  a minor suddenly

               salieri writes the key signature

                                     mozart
                         the fire

                         common time

               salieri writes this and continues now to write as swiftly 
               and urgently as he can at mozarts dictation he is obviously 
               highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates his speed 
               however can never be too fast for mozarts impatient mind

                                     mozart

                         sing it back

               salieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line  
               after the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on 
               the soundtrack and engulfs his voice they stop

                                     mozart

                                     salieri

                         flammis acribus addictis flam
                         mis acribus addictis

               his voice is lost on the last words as tenors engulf it and 
               take over the soundtrack singing their whole line from the 
               beginning right to the end of the sixth measure where the 
               basses stopped but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them  
               salieri writes feverishly we see his pen jotting down the 
               notes as quickly as possible the ink flicks onto the page  
               the music stops again

                                     mozart
                         now the orchestra second bassoon 
                         and bass trombone with the basses 
                         identical notes and rhythm
                              he hurriedly hums 
                              the opening notes of 
                              the bass vocal line
                         the first bassoon and tenor trombone 

                                     salieri
                              labouring to keep up
                         please just one moment

               mozart glares at him irritated his hands move impatiently  
               salieri scribbles frantically

                                     mozart
                         it couldnt be simpler

                                     salieri
                              finishing
                         first bassoon and tenor trombone  
                         what

                         with the tenors

                                     salieri
                         also identical

                                     mozart
                         exactly the instruments to go with 
                         the voices trumpets and timpani 
                         tonic and dominant

               he again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning 
               conducting on the soundtrack we hear the second bassoon 
               and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and 
               tenor trombone come in on top playing the tenor vocal line  
               we also hear the trumpets and timpani the sound is bare and 
               grim it stops at the end of the sixth measure salieri stops 
               writing

                                     salieri
                         and thats all

                                     mozart

                              he smiles
                         strings in unison  ostinato on all  
                         like this

               he sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato

                                     mozart
                              speaking

                                     mozart
                              speaking

                         show me

               salieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato

                                     mozart
                              excitedly

                         the next measures exactly the same 
                         rising and rising  c to d to e up 
                         to the dominant chord do you see

               as salieri writes mozart sings the ostinato from the 
               beginning but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice 
               on the soundtrack playing the first six bars of their 
               agitated accompaniment they stop

                                     salieri
                         thats wonderful

                         benedictis call me among the blessed

               he is now sitting bolt upright hushed and inspired

                         again

               he sings the ostinato phrase twice

               the entire confutatis bursts over the room as mozart snatches 
               the manuscript pages from salieri and reads from it singing 
               salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment the music 
               continues right through the following scenes to the end of 
               the movement

               in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat the childs bed is 
               obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped

               so he attempts to button his waistcoat but does it ineptly 
               so that the vestment becomes bunched up making him look 
               absurd

               frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound mozart 
               makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages the coins 
               brought by salieri fall on the floor  karl runs after them

               measured thread

               the drizzle of rain has now become heavy one by one the 
               group breaks up and shelters under the trees the cart moves 
               on toward the cemetery alone followed by nobody growing

                         my room watching myself become 
                         extinct my music growing fainter 
                         all the time fainter until no one 
                         plays it at all and his growing 
                         louder filling the world with wonder 
                         and everyone who loves my sacred art 
                         crying mozart bless you mozart

               the door opens an attendant comes in cheerful and hearty

                                     attendant
                         good morning professor time for 
                         the water closet and then weve got 
                         your favourite breakfast for you  
                         sugarrolls
                              to vogler
                         he loves those fresh sugarrolls

               salieri ignores him and stares only at the priest who stares 
               back

                                     old salieri
                         goodbye father ill speak for you  
                         i speak for all mediocrities in the 
                         world i am their champion i am 
                         their patron saint on their behalf 
                         i deny him your god of no mercy  
                         your god who tortures men with 
                         longings they can never fulfill he 
                         may forgive me i shall never forgive 
                         him

               he signs to the attendant who wheels him in his chair out 
               of the room the priest stares after him

               int corridor of the hospital  morning

               the corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks 
               all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses 
               and nuns they form a long wretched strange procession  
               some of them are clearly very disturbed as old salieri is 
               pushed through them in his wheelchair he lifts his hands to 
               them in benediction

                                     old salieri
                         mediocrities everywhere now and to 
                         come i absolve you all amen amen  
                         amen

               finally he turns fullface to the camera and blesses us the 
               audience making the sign of the cross underneath we hear 
               stealing in and growing louder the tremendous masonic funeral 
               music of mozart

               on the last four chords we

                                                                  fade out

                                         the end
