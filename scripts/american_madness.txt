               as dickson stops to speak to the doorman dickson is a man 
               of about fifty whose looks belie his years there is a 
               robustness and virility about him that is compelling his 
               very walk radiates power

               he now puts his hand on the old mans shoulder

                                     gardiner

               gardiner hurriedly produces a handkerchief and starts to 
               blow his nose

               the smile on his face disappears as he sees something which 
               annoys him

                                     dickson
                              sternly
                         oh carter

               a young man looks up quickly he is smoking a cigarette

                                     carter

                         you know the rules about smoking

               carter quickly crushes out the cigarette even as he does 
               so dickson reaches into his pocket and flips carter a 
               fresh one which carter pockets for later

                                     carter

               he turns to address a man below  the janitor without a

               camera goes past and now singles out three men who are 
               coming forward one glance and we know they are here for 
               no kosher reason

               they are typical gangster types one of them the leader 
               is dressed in everything but the kitchen sink  light 
               fedora stiff shirt and collar with stripes running 
               perpendicularly flashy gray suit  spats  and walking 
               stick the other two are just tough hombres but dressed 
               to kill

               as they walk toward camera they glance around the bank 
               with a professional casualness but obviously very much 
               impressed their eyes rove around the place and finally 
               land on some object where they stop

                                                                 cut to

               forgotten several people talk to him but matt walks on 
               heedlessly he cant get over the shock of what he just 
               saw he always had been under the impression that dicksons 
               home life was a happy one he never dreamed that phyllis 
               dickson represented anything but the height of 
               circumspection and now  cyril cluett of all people

               helen comes running into scene all excited
