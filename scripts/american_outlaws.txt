               the rangers plunge into thick woods branches slap at them
               but the sound of gunfire keeps them going captain malcolm
               is still in the lead flanked by two young men who are
               obviously brothers the big handsome one is cole younger
               the skinny one with the lopsided hair is bob younger

               ext woods edge

               they break through the other side of the woods emerging
               behind a rickety set of fencepost fortifications instantly
               gunfire tears apart the trees around them the captains
               horse goes down and the younger brothers dive and roll to
               hide beneath the palisade

               the captain still alive has fallen beyond the wooden
               shield cole scrambles through the savage rifle fire grabs
               captain malcolm and hauls him behind the fortification

                                     captain malcolm
                              bellowing
                         fall back into the woods out of
                         your saddles before youre shot out
                         of em

               the rangers leap from their saddles as a new sound starts
                a dull roar that grows and approaches and bbrrrrappppp
               as unbelievably trees explode into splinters and horses
               and men go down in a heap

                                     cole
                         gatling theyve got a gatling

                         dammit this stopped being fun
                         about two years ago

               some men are crawling to the fortifications others are
               staying in the woods the captain pokes his head up to take
               a look with him we see

               ext another hillside

               at the top of which about a hundred fifty yards off is a
               three man gatling crew squads of union soldiers are
               beginning to make their way down the hillside and just to
               their right is an eight inch cannon with a burning fuse

                         down

               boom and with a whistle the cannonball tears through the
               forest and explodes just behind the rangers some of the men
               are screaming from injury and panic

                                     captain malcolm  contd

               frank raises his head just high enough to poke the enfield
               over the stacked fenceposts everyone else is flinching from
               the suppressing fire frank is perfectly still squinting
               aiming perfectly centered  bang

                                                                    cut to

               as the captain of the six man crew snaps back and hits the
               ground dead before the others can react two more grab
               their throats and drop the remaining soldiers bolt from the
               cannon

               but the gatling crew swings the gun around and the barrels
               blaze

                                                                    cut to

               ext fortifications

               frank and the others hit the dirt as the gatling shreds the
               fenceposts fells trees churns the ground stitching a path
               of destruction across the bulwarks and into the woods where

               ext woods

               the gatling rounds are everywhere rangers jerk as the
               gatling tears them apart jesse grabs web to his chest and
               swings around shielding the boy with his own body when the
               fire pauses for a moment jesse looks down  hes covered
               in blood he lets web fall away blood bubbles up from where
               the boys chest used to be

                                     jesse

               jesse sighs hes seen too much death to cry anymore he
               stands up pivots and strides for the fencepost barrier
               rifle fire is zipping through the air all around him but he
               keeps walking

               ext fortifications

               jesse sprints back into the woods cole bob and frank
               exchange looks

                                     bob

                         this ought to be interesting

               another roar from the gatling pushes their heads down but
               as that sound fades another blends in growing louder and
               louder the sound of hoofbeats

               angle on

               the men at the fortification turning to face the woods
               their faces stunned as jesse james on horseback at full
               gallop explodes from the woods heading straight at his own
               men and at the last second leaps over the barrier and as he
               does jesse leans back in the saddle to let the wind strip
               off his longrider coat revealing for the first time his
               guns  two colts at the hip a crossed bandolier on his
               chest with two crossholstered colts at the shoulders and
               two colts in the small of his back

               and for that one second as jesse and the horse are in
               midair and the longrider coat trails behind him like
               leather wings and his guns gleam blue in the sunlight jesse
               james is the angel of death

               ext hillside

               the horse hits the ground running the union troops are in
               shock as jesse draws both his hip colts and starts firing

                                     jesse
                         come on ya yankee bastards

               his guns blazing jesse rides straight at the bluecoats
               five six are down before they can even react they start
               firing back but they cant draw a bead two more are down
               jesses making every bullet count

               angle on

               the gatling gun as the crew swings it around and fires
               hundred of rounds tearing straight at jesse

               angle on

               jesse who incredibly cuts the horse hard left using just
               his knees still shooting as the gatling volley goes wide
               actually killing two of the union soldiers behind jesse

               but then the arc of fire takes jesses horse in the rump
               the horse falls but jesse dives off still firing killing
               another two soldiers then he hits the ground rolls and is
               up and running dropping the spent colts and drawing the two
               shoulder guns in one smooth motion never interrupting his
               shooting

               ext fortifications

               frank sees the gatling swing away from him he stands and 

               ext hillside

                bang as the gatling triggerman drops bang as the
               ammofeeder goes down and bang as the third man falls
               before the echo of the first shot clears

               ext fortifications

               cole is the first one on his feet

                                     cole

                         charge

               with a ragged cheer the rangers erupt from the forest some
               actually on horseback firing at the exposed union troops

               ext hillside

               soldiers are swarming jesse but hes moving turning an
               untouchable blur in the chaos as he drops two more empty
               colts and reaches for the last two at his back a soldier
               just an arms length away brings up a rifle

                                     jesse
                         oh you do not

               jesse grabs the rifle barrel and drives the butt straight
               back into the soldiers nose the union boy falls releasing
               the gun jesse swings the rifle in a smooth arc bashing
               another soldier in the jaw and then spins it effortlessly
               into his opposite hand and fires it point blank into another
               union soldier

               angle on

               the rangers plowing into the union soldiers rattled the
               union troops are beginning to break and fall back

               angle on

               jesse as another nearby soldier draws a revolver jesse
               snags his hand twists it wrapping the mans arm backward
               around jesses waist with the other man still gripping the
               weapon jesse fans the hammer as he turns shooting six more
               union soldiers as they try to rush him with a final yank
               jesse pulls the colt from the man and crashes it down on his
               skull

               angle on

               the union soldiers in full retreat

               ext the gatling station

               the few remaining bluecoats break and run as jesse reaches
               the gatling suddenly a figure leaps up from behind the
               gatling and fires his rifle a bloody streak tears jesses
               cheek and he stumbles onto his back with a cry the figure
               jumps forward and buries his bayonet in jesses chest

               jesse gasps then puzzled looks down the bayonet has
               lodged right in the x of the ammo belts on his chest
               stopped by the bullets and leather jesse kicks as the
               union soldier is knocked back jesse smoothly snapkicks to
               his feet and draws both remaining colts he pulls up short

               its a fifteen year old boy web mimms in a blue uniform
               theres a deadly pause

                                     jesse

               stretches down the road and around a bend as far as the eye
               can see

               jesse and the other rangers ride into the midst of the
               confederates who part and flow around the horsemen like a
               slowmoving river

               and the pinkertons squint in concentration theres
               definitely some sort of rhythmic drumming coming closer

               does

               jesse flashes a knife and the noose drops away from coles
               neck facing cole he cuts the rope on coles wrists 

               cole instantly draws jesses guns from his waist holster

               the stairs behind jesses back  jesse and cole exchange a
               look then jesse steps away 

               as bob rides by he tosses jesses gunbelt into the air

               and cole jumps on behind him jesse puts the spurs to it and
               the horse surges into a gap in the crowd

               allen pinkerton steps past the panicking troops squarely
               in the path of the charging horse he draws his gun and
               fires the bullet plows into jesse just as the terrified
               horse lurches forward trampling pinkerton

               cole holds jesse up and the riders take off down the

               a lavishly appointed carriage rolls up to the front of the
               nicest hotel in town rollin parker and his retinue of
               pinkerton detectives scurry to the door

               the door opens out steps thaddeus rains wearing an
               elegant suit he bought in london last year and a scowl he
               picked up in boston three decades ago the scowl fits him
               better

                         no it is not my pleasure to have
                         to leave my board room to come to
                         this godforsaken piece of dirt to
                         discover why in the name of all that
                         is holy you cannot seem to evict a
                         few simple farmers from their
                         pathetic little mudholes so that i
                         may build the greatest railroad that
                         this country has ever seen

                         distress sir

               rains sighs as he speaks he checks a heavy gold ornate
               and everpresent pocketwatch on a gold chain

                                     rains
                         parker tell me whats going on so
                         i can return as quickly as possible
                         to boston and my whores and cigars
                         not necessarily in that order

                         two weeks ago we managed to
                         arrange to have the army hang one of
                         the local farmers

                                     rains

                         unfortunately not sir a gang of
                         local thugs managed to rescue him
                         from the gallows not only has this
                         inspired resistance from the other
                         farmers the redoubtable mr alan
                         pinkerton was seriously injured

                         until he recovers

                         a further impediment is that the
                         army garrison has been ordered to
                         move on from liberty we will no

                         instead of raising their arms

               coach and start firing the gang fires back dropping two of
               the men

               bank window

               old wanted posters are replaced by a new set

               the coach is stopped

               jesse and frank are pulling the payroll off as the rest of
               the gang keeps their guns on the remaining pinkertons two
               dead pinkertons lie on the ground

                                     jesse
                         see thats a shame if people
                         would just hand over the money and
                         not shoot at us

                jesse frank and the younger brothers sit heads bowed
               in a small country church as the collection plate is passed
               jesse drops in a handful of twenty dollar gold pieces

                a group of boys swarm around jesse

               obvious swing in a large semicircle south of the state
               then swings up again and continues due west

               burly draws points the gun right at jesses face the
               other detectives gasp jesse stares down the barrel then
               raises his eyes and speaks in a voice that is low and
               terrifying

                                     jesse  contd
                         yknow i could do this without the
                         gun but it just makes things easier

               slam as jesse kicks burly in the crotch the gun fires
               missing jesses head only because he jerks it like a
               mongoose

               jesse backhands the detective with the heavy chain the gun
               drops right into jesses hands 

               the guards are running for the gun box 

               jesse flips the chain tight tucks up and kicks off from
               the back wall and slides the length of the rail over the
               detectives heads as he reaches the end he fires the gun
               blowing open the gun box jesse then shoots the rails
               ceiling strut and then kicks at the roof

               the rail wrenches free dropping jesse to the floor in a
               blur hes up reaching into the gun box he tosses one gun
               into the air then fans the hammer of another

               half the guards drop but the other half are right on top
               of him and nobodys that fast 

               jesse drops the spent gun catches the other gun in the
               opposite hand and fans that hammer all in a single breath

               as the smoke clears the last of the detectives falls with
               a thud

               ext train

               jesse pops open the door to his car hes improvised a
               gunbelt like his old one holding six colts hes still
               holding the chain from his restraints now that theyre no
               longer wrapped around jesse we see theyre at least a few
               yards long

               int third troop car

               some pinkertons look up as a bang sounds from on top of the
               car

               ext train

               and jesse jumps off the roof and 

               clank as the chains  fastened to the roof  go taut and
               jesse is at window level and hes firing and firing into the
               car

               int third troop car

               pinkertons falling drawing their guns not able to get a
               bead on jesse because 

               ext train

               the chain still shooting he reaches the end kicks up and
               is on the roof again

               angle on

               one detective barely alive stumbling through the door
               opening the door to the next

               int second troop car

               the detectives inside start as the wounded man falls into
               the doorway

               ext train

               jesse looks down and sees heavily armed pinkertons coming
               out of the doorway

                                     jesse

               the roof jesse miraculously is untouched almost to the
               club car

               int club car

               pinkerton is already moving as parker and thaddeus rains
               look around

               detectives climbing up behind him hes trapped

               but we hear a low whistle and

               ext train engine
