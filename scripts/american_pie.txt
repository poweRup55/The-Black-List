               inner thigh

     nadia walks off

                         jessica

               as virgins  theyve probably got
               special dorms for people like us

     a long beat as they give this serious consideration
     then kevin strides purposefully to the front of the
     group

                         kevin

               like a bet

                         kevin

               is more important than any bet  now
               heres the deal we all get laid
               before we graduate

     a beat

                         oz

               trying to get laid

                         kevin
               this is different  this is better
               think of when youre working out oz
               you need a partner someone to spot
               you  someone to keep you motivated

     oz nods getting into it  kevin smiles and continues
     arms outspread

                         kevin contd
               thats what we are we keep each other
               on track  prior to this day weve

               pontificated

                         kevin
                   ignoring him
               separately we are flawed and
               vulnerable  but together we are the
               masters of our sexual destiny

                   kung fu voice
               their tigerstyle kungfu is strong
               but our dragon style will defeat it

                   going on
               the shalin masters from east and west

               guys guys  youre ruining my
               fucking moment here  now think about
               it 

     kevin jumps up on a chair

                         kevin contd
               no longer will our penises remain
               flaccid and unused  from now on we
               fight for every man out there who
               isnt getting laid when he should be
               this is our day  this is our time
               and by god were not gonna let
               history condemn us to celibacy  wewillmake a stand  wewillsucceedwe will get laid

     kevin jumps down off the chair and puts his hand out in
     front of him  one by one the guys pile their hands on
     top in between them  its a pact  they break with a
     cheer  woohoo

                         stifler
                   wandering down from upstairs
               what the hell are you losers doing

     they all stop  stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his
     mouth  a goatee of dried toothpaste

                         finch
               if i might ask when you brush your
               teeth do you spit or swallow

     stifler tries to give a retort to finch but turns green
     and heads back upstairs

     int dog days  day

     the guys are finishing up breakfast  hot dogs  eggs

     int east great falls high  back of library  day

     kevin is walking through the religion section  he
     carefully looks about making sure nobodys watching

                         kevins brother vo
               it originally started as a sex manual
               this book that some guys brought back
               from amsterdam in the early eighties
               what to do with your tongue things
               like that  and each year it got
               passed on to one east student who was
               worthy of it

     kevin kneels down on the floor near a section of various
     bibles on the bottom shelf

                         kevins brother vocontd
               after a couple years guys started
               adding their own techniques  things
               they figured out themselves

     kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom
     shelf  pulls out a pocket knife  flips up the bottom of
     the shelf  slides it out

                         kevins brother vocontd
               you have to keep it a secret and
               return it at the end of the year  so
               now you know  good luck

     there a bit dusty is an old book  many extra pages of
     notebook paper have been tucked into it nearly breaking
     the binding  the original title is now obscured  over
     it someone has written the bible

     remember when indian jones found that gold statue  its
     like that right now

     kevin carefully pulls it out  reverently flips through
     it  full of details  explicit diagrams  anecdotes
     and atop each handwritten page is a year indicating the
     date it was added

     kevin reaches the last page  its blank  he lightly
     runs his hand down the empty page

     freshbaked pie on the counter  next to it is a note
     jimmy  apple your favorite  ill be home late

     jim sniffs the pie taking in the aroma  then stopsas
     a quizzical look spreads across his face

     after a moment of thought he slides a finger into the
     pie  moves it around a bit studying the consistency

     then jim becomes more curious  we can see the gears in
     his head start to turn  he looks down at the pie like
     its well not a pie

     nadia walks off  jim collapses into ozs and kevins
     arms like a marathon runner at the end of a race  they
     pat him heartily in congratulations

     ext rast great falls  side of school  day

     after school  oz is there as heather pulls up in a new
     saab

               by the way though about prom  that
               was like a bad idea  sorry i invited
               you

     she hastily walks towards the school

                         oz

                         heather

               thought you might actually be worth
               going with  but you are just a jock
               no wait  youre a jerk

                         oz
               what  no im not

                         heather
               i saw you making fun of me with your
               lacrosse buddies

                         oz
               i wasnt making fun of you

                         heather
               give me a break youre so full of it

     she hurries up more breaking off from oz and enters the
     school  after a moment he slowly heads in

     int east great falls high  little auditorium  later

     oz and heather are singing with the group at opposite
     ends of the room  its a pop contemporary arrangement
     of how sweet it is  it sounds jazzy cool

     oz looks dazed like the winds taken out of him  he
     sings along distant  heather almost defiantly sings
     clearer and better than ever  oz watches her though she
     never looks his way  at the bride of the song heather
     breaks into a solo  she sings beautifully  oz is
     hooked

     the choir teacher halts the song

                         choir teacher
               okay heather that was good but i
               want to thicken up that solo

               a little but i think itll work
               better as a duet  with a tenor part

                         oz
                   interrupting
               ill do it

     a beat as the choir teacher is impressed and heather
     looks indifferent

                         oz contd
               ill do it

                         choir teacher
               okay then  the rest of you okay with
               that

     the rest of the choir agrees as heather looks to oz with
     skepticism

                         choir teacher contd
               great  see you tomorrow

     the group starts packing up

                         heather
                   annoyed
               why are you doing this

     every other sentence sounds like a question even though
     it isnt

                         michelle
               and so one time  i was at band camp
               and we werent supposed to have pillow
               fights  but we had a pillow fight
               and it was so much fun

     jim couldnt care

                         michelle contd
               and one time we all lost our music
               and we were supposed to play this
               song  but we didnt know it  so we
               just made it up  and we kept playing
               and playing but the conductor didnt
               know what we were doing and it was so
               funny

     jim looks wistfully over at nadias empty desk

                         michelle contd

               angry

                         michelle

                         jim
                   interrupting

                         michelle

     int east great falls high  hallway  a little later

     heather is walking down the hall  she turns to go into
     the little auditorium  and through the window in the
     door she sees oz  she stops

     oz is singing working through the solo  determined to
     get it right  he bounces his lacrosse ball off the
     floor in rhythm keeping time  theres one point that
     he keeps getting stuck at and going back over  heather
     watches this softening as she sees that oz is actually
     putting his heart into it  finally hes frustrated 

                         oz
               dammit

     he whips the lacrosse ball at the wall  heather recoils
     still watching unseen by oz  after a moment oz cools
     off  he gets the ball and diligently starts up again
     heather is impressed

     int vickys bedroom  day

     finch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him

     int east great falls high  bathroom stall  day

     finch has stopped  hes staring down at the toilet  it
     looks entirely uninviting  but hes straining
     struggling starting to dance around moaning as he
     cramps up

     he grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with
     it  then another and another  sweat drips off his
     forehead

                         finch
               come on come on come on

     hes got the seat lined with at least three layers of
     toilet paper  notices a spot where theres still bare
     toilet seat  he tears off one square of toilet paper
     placing it on the spot  he steps back and looks it over
     still wriggling to contain his bowels

                         finch contd
               okay  you can do this

     he unbuckles his pants  sits down  just as we hear
     someone enter the bathroom  finch still restraining
     listens for a momentonly to hear the clickclickclick
     of heels

     int east great falls high  main hall  day

     the bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal
     symbol for women  stifler is there laughing even
     harder

     int east great falls high  bathroom stall  day

     finch is terrified  through the crack between the stall
     door and the frame finch catches glimpses of bright
     colored skirts and dresses  he grits his teeth
     straining

     and a gurgle comes from finchs stomach  his eyes bulge

     int east great falls high  bathroom  day

     a group of girls is at the mirror including the girl
     holding out for finch fixing their hair

                         girl holding out for finch
               you know its just gonna be some

     int east great falls high  bathroom  day

     the girls at the mirror freeze  and we hear what can
     only be the sound of diarrhea exploding into a toilet
     bowl

     the girls run out screaming and laughing

     int east great falls high  bathroom  day  moments later

     finch exits the stall with trepidation pulling up his
     pants  slowly slinking he approaches the door  grabs
     the handle  composes himself  and like nothing ever
     happened he opens it

     int east great falls high  main hall  day

     finch comes out of the bathroom  stops  his eyes
     register complete disbelief

     a semicircle of girls including the ones we have seen
     gossiping about him has crowded around the door  all
     staring at him with complete repugnance openmouthed

                                                       dissolve to

               okay  albert you ready

     albert steps next to heather  hes kind of funny
     looking with an overlysuave attitude that comes off as
     plain weird

                         albert
               no problemo

     he sings a couple lines  way too melodramatic and
     cheesy  heather looks trapped

     oz is running up the field towards the goal cradling
     the ball in his stick  he seems to have a good lead
     suddenly he is tumbling falling losing the ball
     someone has checked him  he lays stunned on the ground
     as stifler recovers the ball and scores

     the players run back to the sidelines to reset for the
     faceoff and gather around the coach

                         coach marshall

     like a shakespearean actor psyching himself

                         albert
               focus on the music  think melody
               let the music be my guide

                         heather
               that would be a start

     ext lacrosse field msu  day

     oz shows some emotion peeking through  confused

                         coach marshall

               seniors this marks the culmination of

     a wave of realization washes over oz  he stands up tall

                         coach marshall contd
               now thats the attitude ostreicher

     oz collects himself  takes a deep breath

               good luck guys

     he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave

                         coach marshall

     your food in a fancy restaurant and you look at the
     creation on the plate and secretly youre not sure if
     its really what you ordered  but you dont say
     anything and you just eat it

     then we see her raise a childrens plastic recorder to
     her lips  and she whistles the michigan fight song  on
     cue jim chimes in

     jim and michelle lay on the floor tangled in sheets and
     each others clothing  exhausted gasping

     and then we see the closet door is open just a crack

     moaning

     chair falling out of place  and the door opening as
     stifler walks in  he stops horrified
