               camera begins to pull back slowly straight up  the song 
               moon shadow by cat stevens begins once we are high enough 
               to see the entire moon the main title is superimposed

               we continue to retreat from the moon looking on as it grows 
               farther from us continuing credits until the full moon is 
               the size it appears to us from earth

               ext crossroads on the moors  night

               tree branches enter into the frame the camera pans down and 
               we see a truck approaching we are at a crossroads in the 
               moors looking sinister enough to have earned their literary 
               reputation

               the truck stops at the crossroads the driver mustached and 
               wearing tweeds boots and a muffler climbs down

               moon shadow ends

                                                                    cut to

               loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams down  
               revealed among the sheep are two rudelyawakened young 
               american boys they look exhausted they both carry backpacks 
               two american kids on a jaunt in europe they are both in 
               their late twenties

               it is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too 
               happily pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch

               the place looks empty david and jack enter the middle of 
               town and look about the camera sees what they see a few 
               shops dark and shuttered light and laughter come from the 
               pub

               int the slaughtered lamb  night

               the pub was apparently modernized sometime in the mid
               fifties its traditional englishness combines with greasy 
               stainless steel and glass it is populated by mostly pale 
               young men with longish hair several older men are ruddy 
               complexioned and sport large mustaches four or five are 
               watching a chess game two men are playing darts the 
               conversation is loud and there is often laughter but there 
               is something unsavory about these people a look of leanness 
               and poverty they seem inbred and somehow sullen we establish 
               the types and the general level of noise in the room

               the door opens revealing david and jack there is dead silence 
               and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys 
               who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention  
               they give each other a what look then turn to the 
               assembled populace

                                     david

               table and very selfconsciously remove their packs place 
               them on the floor and sit down at the table there is a 
               long awkward wait the woman finally comes over to them

               as the woman turns to prepare the tea everyone resumes what

               and the boys breathe easier

                         to talk about it because they felt 
                         so silly

                         right

               alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits 
               on the edge of the bed taking knife and fork in hand she 
               neatly cuts davids food into pieces david watches all this 
               amused she places a napkin under davids chin and holds up 
               his first bite on his fork david folds his arms and refuses 
               to open his mouth

                                     alex

               alex grabs davids nose forcing his mouth open quickly 
               shoving the fork in it david is startled but amused and 
               chews his food slowly and swallows it alex holds up another 
               bite

                                     alex

               david opens his mouth obediently alex almost smiles she 
               feeds him for a while they are both sizing each other up  
               finally

                                     david
                         may i have a glass of milk

               alex smiles

                                                                  fade out

               fade in

               ext dense forest  day

               again we are running fast and faster david again running 
               naked flying through the green forest he stops suddenly 
               ears perked he looks about and then we hear jacks os 
               screams the voice of jack screams

                                     jack os
                         david david please help me oh 
                         god david oh my god

               david turns in blind panic he runs and we run with him 
               desperately trying to find the source of jacks screams

               he comes to a clearing in the woods light streaming through 
               the tall trees  jacks screams halt in midword david looks 
               in disbelief at the clearing there is a hospital bed with 
               someone in it it is the same as davids

               david walks toward it slowly the figure in the bed lays 
               still it grows dark very dark and david looks up at the 
               full moon there is a howl identical to the one heard earlier 
               back on the moors david approaches the bed slowly fearfully 
               we hear ocean noises on the soundtrack the sound of crashing 
               surf david reaches out to pull back the covers lightning 
               and thunder cause him to hesitate for a second silence the 
               camera remains on david as he pulls off the covers his face 
               registers total disbelief and increasing horror

               we cut to the bed to find  david he lies there pale white 
               with purple lips and death pallor

               the camera begins to move in on the corpse of david

               cut back to the standing davids terrified face then continue 
               until davids death mask fills the screen the face remains 
               still for several beats then suddenly opens its bright yellow 
               eyes and red mouth revealing fangs in a bloodcurdling wail 
               which carries over in the

                                                                    cut to

               int hospital nurses station  night

               mrs hobbs hears davids screams and efficiently calls out

                                     mrs hobbs
                         orderly miss gallagher

               miss gallagher and an orderly appear at once

                         and restrain the patient

               it is bright daylight and dr hirsch gazes thoughtfully 
               out the window

                                     dr hirsch
                         youve never had bad dreams before

                         never so bizarre

               dr hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed

                                     dr hirsch

                         man is capable of

                         to disbelieve me you yourself said 
                         it must have taken incredible strength 
                         to tear apart a person like that

                                     dr hirsch

                         baskervilles was an invention of sir

                         hell a fraud a fake

               there is an awkward silence as david sits and dr hirsch is 
               embarrassed at raising his voice

               alex goes off turning for a last wave david stands looking 
               after her when a little girl walking a dog passes by the 
               dog on seeing david begins to growl and snarl

                                     david
                              to dog

               the dog begins barking ferociously the little girl tugging 
               on his leash

                                     david
                         thanks a lot dog

               he realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back up the 
               steps to find the door locked

                                     david
                         wonderful

               cut to shot of davids bare feet on the cold stone he mutters 
               to himself imitating a newscaster

                                     david
                         an american werewolf was found frozen 
                         to death today in the heart of london 
                         england

               he looks around and sees that there is a small window ajar 
               on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the ground 
               which can be reached by climbing a brick wall which he does 
               but not without damage to his bare toes

               at the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on seeing 
               david the hair stands up on its arched back and it glares 
               at david hissing and spitting david is disturbed by the 
               cats hostile behavior

                                     david
                         what did i do cat

               the cat is really acting fierce when david goes to pat it 
               cautiously it screeches and runs away david is by this 
               time not amused david manages to pull himself into the 
               window

               int alexs bathroom  dusk

               david awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny window  
               finally getting both feet on the ground he steps to the 
               sink and regards himself in the mirror

                                     david
                              weakly
                         snarl growl grrrr

               he examines his mouth touching his canines carefully after 
               a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen

               into the bathroom and looks into the mirror

                         jesus christ

               he stands in agony the book falls to the floor

                                     david
                              screams
                         what christ what

               he begins sweating profusely clinging to the sides of his 
               head he trembles violently

                                     david
                         im burning up jesus

               he rips at his shirt tearing it off his body is dripping 
               wet

                                     david
                              shouts out in pain 
                              and fear
                         jack where are you now you 
                         fucker

               as a new spasm of pain wracks his body he cries out in 
               anguish

                                     david
                         help me somebody help me please 
                         jack

               davids hair is wringing wet he screams and grabs at his 
               legs

                                     david
                              pleading whimpering
                         im sorry i called you a meat loaf 
                         jack

               new bolts of agonizing pain wrack through davids body he 
               grabs at his pants pulling them off as if they are burning 
               him standing naked in the center of the room david gasps 
               for air

               he falls to his knees and then forward on his hands he 
               remains on his hands and knees trying to master his torment 
               but its no use on all fours he gives himself over to the 
               excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change

               the metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one  
               as bone and muscle bend and reform themselves the body 
               suffers lacerating pain we can actually see davids flesh 
               move the rearranging tissue his mouth bleeds as fangs 
               emerge his whole face distorts as his jaw extends his skull 
               literally changing shape before our eyes his hands gnarl 
               and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward

               the camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the 
               window davids moans change slowly into low guttural growls  
               we hear the four footfalls as the wolf begins to walk as 
               the camera pans back over the room we see the front door 
               pushed open and hear the wolf padding off into the darkness

                         i tried to investigate the attack  
                         there are no records the case was 
                         closed and now theyve misplaced 
                         the file davids lacerations were 
                         cleaned and dressed when he arrived 
                         here and yet supposedly no doctor 
                         examined him before i did the goodman 
                         boy is already in the ground so hes 
                         no good to us so i went to the pub 
                         in east proctor where i was convinced 
                         of two things

                                     alex

                                     dr hirsch
                         they were lying there were no 
                         witnesses no escaped lunatic the 
                         whole community is hiding the truth 
                         of what actually happened up there

                                     alex
                         and what else

                                     dr hirsch
                         i think the village of east proctor 
                         is hiding some dark and terrible

                                     dr hirsch
                         david has suffered a severe trauma  
                         i myself witnessed some form of mass 
                         neurosis in east proctor if all the 
                         villagers believe that jack goodman 
                         was killed by a werewolf why 
                         shouldnt david and then it follows 
                         that if he survived an attack by a 
                         werewolf wouldnt he himself become 
                         a werewolf the next full moon

                         but in such a deranged state he could 
                         harm himself or perhaps others

                                     alex
