               int byrons apartment  the next morning

               zack awakens and finds himself entangled in arms and legs 
               and soiled sheets he carefully slips free and rises to his 
               feet on unsteady legs his head pounding his eyes blood
               red

               as hes pulling on his shorts his eyes suddenly take in the 
               apartment and the lifestyle it represents halfsmoked joints 
               and cigarettes cascading out of makeshift ashtrays empty 
               wine bottles and three naked people snoring their bodies 
               draped over one another

               a look of profound disgust comes over zacks face and he 
               turns away from the scene and heads into the bathroom

               int byrons bathroom

               zack finds some aspirins and downs them with a glass of water

               suddenly byron comes in shoves him out of the way and 
               pukes in the toilet zack stares at him in an intense way 
               seeing more than the moment seeing all the other times hes 
               played out this scene with this man

                                     byron

                         towel

               zack hands him the towel byron swigs some mouthwash then 
               turns to his son

                                     byron

               fatigues camera pans as he crosses the intersection 
               revealing a large parade ground where two classes of aviation 
               officer candidates are drilling with rifles

               being demonstrated on the blackboard by the instructor a 
               navy lieutenant all the candidates are using slide rules to 
               work out the difficult problems

               quick close shots reveal that most of the candidates have a 
               pretty fair facility with the slide rule but zack looks 
               like hes never had one in his hand until now

               ext the barracks  night

               starting close on a row of shined boots and a row of shined 
               buckles we widen to reveal an enlisted sailor and zack 
               scrutinizing the boots and buckles spread out on a navy issue 
               blanket zack nods his satisfaction hands over a wad of 
               currency and carefully starts folding the edges of the 
               blanket around his booty as the sailor disappears into the 
               darkness then as zack lifts his santas sack of goodies 
               over his shoulder and turns around to go he stops suddenly

               include sid

               he stands there in the darkness a big grin on his face

                                     sid
                         so thats how you do it

               zack looks like a thief caught in the act

                                     zack
                         hey you gonna tell anybody about

                         how about free boonies for the 
                         duration

               zack smiles realizing his roommate is putting him on

                         how about you kiss my ass

               sid laughs together they head back toward the barracks 
               entrance

               parade of puget debs come into the club wearing satiny 
               formals and hopeful smiles

               perryman walks past with his attractive black wife

               lieutenant jg her shortened hair brushed back nicely on the 
               sides she smiles at zack and he smiles back

               topper approaches one of the girls coming through the door 
               a short dumpy little girl with jugs the size of watermelons 
               and escorts her toward the ballroom

               then sid and zack spot paula and lynette coming through the 
               door in clingy little formals milkywhite bosoms pushed up 
               high and little gold crosses dangling in the valley between

               zack looks around and the faces of the others are similarly 
               disquieted by the sight how do you describe the presence of 
               death in a room but its there foley brought it in with 
               him

               topper rises to his feet terrified and sid pats him on the 
               back

               foley grins sadistically as he watches topper climb up onto 
               the mat

                         comprehension

               he leaps on topper like a cat grabbing the boys throat 
               between his thumb and forefinger seemingly intent upon 
               killing him but in reality scaring him more than actually 
               hurting him that much

                                     foley

               fast for them zack just sits there almost amused

               topper

               finally starts fighting back convinced this maniac means to 
               kill him to make his point he finally summons enough survival 
               instinct to wrestle foleys hand from his throat he sinks 
               to the floor of the ring and struggles to catch his breath

                                     topper

               topper hurries to comply while foley swaggers to the edge 
               of the mat sits down and starts putting foam safetykick 
               pads on his feet really getting off on this

               town tavern is a local hangout and theres a sense that a 
               number of the townies are watching the boys in white with 
               resentment

                                     zack

               they start for the door all four linking arms

               near the door

               one of the boys who was watching them troy 25 jostles 
               into zack then pretends it was the other way around

                                     troy

               dockworker probably and he seems to tower over zack

               zack looks more amused by it all than threatened he shakes 
               his head and starts out the door with his friends troy and 
               some of the other locals share a look and follow

               ext the town tavern  night

               troy jobs out of the place and plants himself in front of 
               zack

               a circle is forming around zack and troy paula looks 
               frightened lynette looks turned on

                                     troy

                         inside and cool off

               he turns away from troy and pushes out of the circle

                                     troy
                         hey im not finished talking to

               he charges after zack and knocks his cap off

               various shots of the fight

               if you can call it a fight zack turns around and hits troy 
               in the face with two very fast punches a left and a right

               before his assailant can recover zack delivers a strange 
               roundhouse kind of kick that seems to come out of him in 
               slow motion then gathers incredible speed until its 
               slamming with the force of a mulekick into troys face 
               troy goes down gushing blood from flattened nostrils

               zack

               looks around the other locals who clustered earlier around 
               their champion but theyre all staring at him afraid

               taking paula by the hand he leads the foursome away

               moving with zack paula lynette and sid

               zack stares straight ahead lost in the world of his 
               adolescence paula just watches him sensitive to the place 
               hes in

                         no chance at all of being an officer

               zack rises from the bed and very slowly approaches her paula 
               almost flinches as he stops a few feet away then he leans 
               forward and kisses her as gently as he knows how very 
               tentatively she responds

                                                               dissolve to

               lynette leaves her room and knocks on paulas door paula 
               comes out zipping up her dress

                              smiles
                         a definite improvement

               they drive off

                                                               dissolve to

               int zacks room at the tides inn  day

               he wakes up and slowly focuses on paula cooking eggs and 
               bacon in the kitchenette

                                     zack

               he jumps out of bed pulls on some boxer shorts and sits 
               down at a small rickety table she has beautified with 
               wildflowers stuffed in a glass paula puts his steaming 
               breakfast before him and stands back to watch him attack it 
               he looks up at her and finds her staring at him almost 
               wistfully

                                     zack

                         thats it

               she nods and turns away so he cant see her eyes and know 
               how much shes lying zack finishes off his eggs and bacon 
               downs his coffee as she comes over to refill his cup he 
               unbuttons her blouse and starts playing with her nipples

               he starts tickling her and she cant sustain her vamp role 
               any longer

                                     zack

                         little polack getting feisty on me

               he takes her in his arms and they kiss the moment turns 
               suddenly real and zack finds himself pulling away afraid of 
               the feelings that are churning his guts paula studies him a 
               moment

                                     paula

               their eyes stay together for a long time

                                     zack
                         i forgot to thank you for breakfast

                                     paula

                                                                    cut to

               int the large indoor pool on the base  day

               our camera is the first to ride the dilbert dunker and we 
               are suddenly shooting at high speed down a steep incline 
               inside a cagelike contraption painted red wham we hit 
               water at neckwrenching speed and go under in a swirl of 
               bubbles

               wait whats happening the goddamn cage is turning 
               somersaults which way is up which is way up a strange 
               looking alien in a wet suit and mask knifes toward us his 
               hands work to extricate us we rush toward the promise of 
               light and air at the surface we can hear our own tortured 
               breathing will we make it

               candidate dellaserra reaches the surface

               gasping for air the dilbert dunker instructor stands off to 
               the side giving him a thumbs down

                                     instructor
                         back in line that was totally unsat 
                         dellaserra

               dellaserra clings to the side of the pool and vomits hes 
               grateful to be alive

               zack watches them raise the dilbert dunker

               it finally comes to a rest high in the rafters of the 
               building where he is to be the next to take the ride sid 
               and seeger are right behind him followed by topper he steps 
               into the cage and the instructor makes sure hes buckled 
               snugly into the harness then zacks eyes fall on

               foley standing pool side zack looks away from him and gives 
               his thumbs up

               and the dunker takes him on its crazy ride plummeting down 
               the tracks blasting into the water somersaulting

               underwater  zack

               waits until the turning has stopped studies the direction 
               his air bubbles are taking as he unfastens his harness and 
               pulls himself down and out of the dunker

               back on the surface  zack

               gets a thumbs up from the instructor and grins as hes 
               climbing out he watches sid take the big ride

               underwater  sid

               almost loses his composure when the harness at first defies 
               his efforts to get it open then hes free and surfacebound

               as zack helps him

               out of the pool sids efforts at a cocky grin fails to hide 
               from his friend the fear he felt under there

                                     zack
                         you okay

                                     sid
                         sure

               they turn to watch casey

               stay on caseys exhilarated face as she plunges

               and watch her extricate herself as easily as zack

               as zack and sid help her out of the water

               her eyes are wild with excitement

                                     casey
                         think theyll let us do that again 
                         god that was fun

               topper climbs into the dilbert dunker

               he looks down at the pool far below his three friends 
               standing pool side give him a thumbs up for encouragement 
               but topper is too frightened to acknowledge them he turns 
               to the instructor helping to fasten him inside the 
               contraption

                                     topper
                              scared shitless
                         does this thing hit with the same 
                         impact as an actual plane

                                     instructor
                         this is nothing compared to a plane
                              beat
                         dont forget to watch the bubbles

               topper nods and gives a thumbs up

               in a perch above the raised dunker

               a young seaman apprentice flicks a switch and the dunker 
               lurches down the tracks

               topper sucks in his breath terrified

               the impact of hitting the water is so jolting it knocks his 
               wind out in a rush and he goes under already screaming that 
               silent little scream of the mind that drowning people hear

               underwater the dunker turns him over and over leaving him 
               upsidedown the silent scream is louder panic rides its 
               frequency as topper tears at the lever that would release 
               him from the harness he gets it open and pushes out of the 
               opening in the dunker with all his might he has forgotten 
               to watch for his air bubbles top is bottom and bottom is 
               top

               he smashes violently into the tiled floor of the pool freaks 
               out and swims straight up and into the jaws of the dunker 
               again

               zack sid casey and foley

               watch from pool side concerned as the diver goes down for 
               topper

               underwater

               the instant the diver is within grasp of the totally unstrung 
               boy topper grabs him in a dying mans grip that even the 
               brawny frogman is unable to break

               the diver hits him once twice but topper clings to him 
               even tighter and as they wrestle the harness further snares 
               them both the scream now becomes the scream of two drowning 
               men

               intercut the faces of the onlookers

               seconds are ticking by and it reflects on all the faces in 
               the huge room

               suddenly foley dives fully clothed into the pool

               his smokey the bear hat and cane stay at the surface as he 
               knifes down through the water toward the churning humanity 
               below

               underwater  foley reaches topper and the diver

               both men are so hopelessly entangled in the parachute harness 
               and so close to losing consciousness that foley has to move 
               very fast his presence of mind is so total its frightening

               with no wasted moves he frees both men and pulls them toward 
               the surface

               at the surface

               the instructor helps foley get them laid out by the side of 
               the pool and while foley works mouthtomouth on topper he 
               works on the diver the diver is easily revived but topper 
               required everything foley has to offer he might have died 
               in less expert hands but foley is slowly pulling him through

               intercut  zack sid perryman seeger and others

               watching foleys efforts to revive their compatriot

               finally foley steps away from topper

               and nods to the room of onlookers that hell be all right

                                                                    cut to

               int the barracks room  day

               neatness every pair of skivvies folded identically and 
               measured with a ruler which is exactly what hes doing at 
               the moment perrymans problem is his belt buckle which he 
               is frantically trying to shine before foley gets there zack 
               stands casually by his locker buffing his fingernails his 
               shoes and buckle shined to perfection as always

               camera holds on the fourth locker the one that belonged to 
               topper daniels the door to the locker is open and its empty

               sid gives him a dirty look but zack ignores it the sound of 
               harsh footsteps approaching and the three candidates snap to 
               rigid attention by their lockers

               foley walks in and starts inspecting perryman sweat runs 
               down the blacks face in rivers foley moves on to sid checks 
               out his locker then turns to zack

                         class its you isnt it mayonnaise

               he brings his cane up suddenly like a majorettes baton 
               and with one poke knocks the piece of fiberboard out of its 
               place in the ceiling allowing two pairs of shined boonies 
               a halfdozen freshlybrassoed belt buckles and a little 
               black book recording the monies owed him to rain down

                                     foley

               foley turns and strides out zack meets his roommates eyes 
               for an instant knowing hes finished perryman doesnt look 
               too sad about it he whispers in zacks ear as he walks past 
               enroute to the door

                                     perryman

               int foleys office in the barracks  day

               foley is doing paperwork at his desk as zack approaches and 
               knocks on the door

                         do that instead of going on liberty

               zack follows his gaze to the obstacle course where seeger is 
               struggling to pull herself over the tenfoot wall with the 
               same results as last time

                                     foley

               int zack and paulas room at the tides inn  day

               they are making love when its over they lie there for a 
               long time in one anothers arms flagrantly satisfied and 
               still joined

                         that was great

               they share a little smile of satisfaction they chuckle the 
               longer they stay together like that the more painfully 
               intimate the moment becomes

                                     paula

                         they found them like that shriveled 
                         up from weeks without food or water

               zack laughs and the connection is nearly broken suddenly 
               zack just takes her face in his hands and kisses her in a 
               most loving way

                                     zack

                         guys in that sailboat

               he laughs

                                     paula
                         we were pretty drunk

               paula takes his officerstyle cap and puts it on

                                     paula

                         whats stopping you

               paula seems to consider it for a moment then she shakes her 
               head its a fantasy thats all far removed from the 
               realities of her life

                                     paula
                         i dont care what the magazines say 
                         its just not as easy being a girl 
                         especially from a catholic family 
                         you dont know the junk i grew up 
                         listening to bout the way women 
                         are supposed to think and act

                                     zack
                         thats no excuse for not going after 
                         what you want

                                     paula
                         who says im not going after what i 
                         want my mothers thirtynine years

                         know exactly what i dont want

               they share a stretch of silence zack retreating into himself 
               his eyes somehow far away

                                     zack
                              after a silence
                         my old lady swallowed a bottle of 
                         pills one day while i was at school

                                     paula

                         she didnt leave a note nothing 
                         ive always hated her for that

                                     paula
                         does it still hurt

                                     zack

               paula studies him a long moment

                         you feed em that line

               he looks at her and smiles then she kisses him

               ext the air show  day

               six jets fly directly at us jolting our senses

               on intercom

               the program consists of six aircraft performing a sequence 
               of maneuvers in one of three different components a diamond 
               of four aircraft two solo aircraft that oppose each other 
               along the line of flight and all six aircraft in a delta 
               formation

               camera pans zack and paula

               as they enter and move toward the bleachers where sid and 
               lynette are already seated zack suddenly stops and scans

               both men rise angrily to their feet but a split second later 
               the angels are making another pass over the stands and 
               everyone is standing and applauding making their argument 
               less public

               of flowers in his hand his white liberty uniform almost

               past him to answer it seeing the expression on her fathers

               serving out helpings of stew as she serves zack she meets 
               his eyes and smiles an almost flirtatious smile

               across the table from zack joe is staring their way in a 
               most hostile manner

               his castle an outright attack on his manhood

               finally zack can handle his stares no longer he smiles his 
               most disarming smile and meets the mans gaze

                                     zack

               ext the survival course  day

               zack sid casey perryman and dellaserra are struggling to 
               erect a shelter in the driving downpour using a parachute 
               and logs theyve cut its a hokey little tepee at best but 
               they crowd inside it as thunder and lightning herald a blast 
               of monsoonlike rainfall the shelter collapses on top of 
               them

               inside the tent  night later

               the five candidates are sitting around inside the tent 
               listening to the rain zack slightly aloof and pensive

                                     casey
                         i dont know about you guys but im

                                                                    cut to

               a helicopter shot of elgin air force base

               in the hinterlands beyond the navy base is an air force base 
               with vast acreage of swamplands and tundra a big truck comes 
               bouncing along a windy little road into the undergrowth the 
               truck stops and the candidates from zacks class file out 
               the back of it while foley comes around from the passenger 
               seat to address them

                                     foley
                         okay worms this is it can you 
                         pussies live through three days 
                         without food or water in the 
                         wilderness this is where we thin 
                         our ranks the natural way children 
                         incidentally those little twigs you 
                         see floating in those mud puddles 
                         arent twigs theyre water moccasins

               ground level shots

               reveal that hes right lethallooking snakes slither and 
               glide over the surface of the swamp waters

               the faces of the candidates

               reflect what youd expect fear even zack looks wary of the 
               ordeal ahead

               montage of shots

               captures the humor of the next three days of survival 
               training the candidates are a sorry spectacle the first day 
               and a half trying to catch snakes with forked sticks trying 
               to rub wood together to start a fire throwing up from eating 
               the wrong berries but generally clowning around not taking 
               it too seriously then as hunger sets in a change comes 
               over them they set up a big tent for shelter get a nice 
               fire going and prepare a serviceable meal from carefully 
               selected roots berries and tree bark and strips of fried 
               water moccasins on the third day they plot a path through 
               the wilderness and finally emerge onto a highway where foley 
               waits with the truck the candidates send up a weary cheer 
               and embrace each other as if theyd just pulled off an escape 
               from a pow camp

                                                                    cut to

               a payphone on the other side of the cavernous room the noise 
               of the processors and conveyors is terrible but her coworker

               the way some of the women watch her and shake their heads a 
               little suggests that it might have some basis in truth

               lynette resumes her place on the line

               and struggles to come up with a perky grin but then it sits 
               on her face like it belongs to someone else

               up the angled beam leaps the moat and is approaching the 
               wall full tilt when he sees seeger up ahead struggling as 
               usual to get over it

                                     zack
                              calling
                         come on seeger lets go over it 
                         together

               he makes it in one leap but she falls back to the ground 
               beaten zack pauses at the top of the wall and looks down at 
               her

               foley watches from the distance

               zack drops back down beside seeger she has tears of 
               frustration in her eyes

               shes not going to make it and the realization that shes 
               come this far only to fail is crushing her

                                     casey
                         go on zack go for the record

                                     zack
                         fuck the record now you listen to 
                         me and do exactly what i tell you
                              he draws a line with 
                              his foot
                         start back ten yards and take off 
                         from here not here or there 
                         but right here
                              the total officer
                         no excuses seeger you are going to 
                         plant those legs here and then youre 
                         going to yank yourself over that 
                         wall because you have to you want 
                         jets then do it goddamnit

               seeger nods almost mesmerized by his decisive tone of voice 
               his sudden emergence as a leader she starts running takes 
               off exactly on the mark and struggles to the top of the 
               wall

               she drops down on the other side and zack joins her smiling

               foley stops his watch

               and shakes his head he can live without that record

               zack and casey

               as they finish the course they stop and hug each other 
               then something catches zacks eye that chases the good 
               feelings away

               zacks pov

               big sid is trudging slowly toward the 101 course in his 
               warmup his nickname loverboy somehow ironic especially 
               in this moment sid sees zack looking his way and signals 
               the news to him by putting his arms into a babycradling 
               position and rocking the imaginary offspring from side to 
               side

                                                                    cut to

               inside the mess hall  day

               zack and sid are in line getting their food

                                     sid
                         its a big religious thing with her 
                         and she wont even discuss it

                                     zack
                         but she expects you to marry her

                                     sid
                         she said it was up to me if i dont 
                         shell go off and have the baby on 
                         her own somewhere

               at the mention of the word baby nearby classmates perk 
               their ears up

                                     zack

                         kid by herself and not do anything

                         abortion

                                     sid

                         the point

                                     zack

               they leave the food line and start toward the tables

                         responsibility

                                     sid

                         goes ahead and has it zack therell

                         that and not knowing its name or 
                         where it lived

                                     zack

                         your responsibility

               angle a table

               sid and zack sit down with their classmates and start eating

                                     zack
                         your brother getting killed instead

                         to marry this susan isnt that why 
                         you do everything man out of some 
                         bullshit code of ethics you inherited 
                         from your family

               foley can be seen at the instructors table in shot

               background watching them but sid and zack are oblivious to 
               their audience

                                     sid
                              angrily
                         maybe its all bullshit to you but 
                         thats now how i was raised i believe 
                         we have a responsibility to the people 
                         in our lives  that thats the only 
                         thing that separates us from the 
                         goddamn animals
                              beat
                         im not like you mayo i cant just 
                         shit on people and then sleep like a 
                         baby all night

               the words sting and zack flares back at his friend

                                     zack
                         you got a responsibility to you first 
                         pard  and if you cant handle that 
                         youve got bigger problems than 
                         getting a girl pregnant

               they stare at each other a long time but no more words come

                                                               dissolve to

               int the altitude chamber  day

               wearing full oxygen masks zack and sid are part of a group 
               of six candidates playing patacake at simulated altitudes 
               inside the claustrophobicsmall decompression chamber an 
               instructor is explaining the test over an intercom from 
               outside the windowed chamber

                                     instructor
                         now everybody take off your masks 
                         but continue the same exercise the 
                         purpose is to show you the effects 
                         of altitude on the motor skills when 
                         youve been cut off from your oxygen

               slowly their reactions begin to deteriorate at first sid 
               seems amused by his and zacks fumbling to slap hands then 
               as a shining sound mounts into a crazy place he begins to 
               panic

                                     sid
                              suddenly calling
                         stop this thing i said stop it

               everyone looks at him strangely sid lurches like a drunk to 
               his feet and tries to move toward the door he trips over 
               himself and falls then stays there with his hands on his 
               ears and his body curled into a fetal position

                                     sid
                         i want out let me out please let 
                         me out

               zack extricates himself from his harness like a man with 
               eight thumbs condemned on top of it to move in slow motion 
               he weaves drops to his knees by sid and awkwardly tries to 
               enclose him in his arms

                                     zack
                         sid its okay dont be afraid

               the whining stops as they start to back off on the pressure 
               inside the chamber but they cant do it too fast slowly 
               sid comes to his senses and his eyes focus on zack

                                     zack
                         sid what happened

                                     sid
                         i dont know i felt like like 
                         i was suffocating christ zack 
                         i was so scared so godddamn 
                         scared

               tears are running down sids face

                                     zack
                         hey man dont cry not in front 
                         of the instructors

               zack looks around at the faces all staring back in judgement 
               not just the instructors by now the candidates know the 
               symptoms of a dor as well as anybody

               the door to the chamber slams open and foley is standing 
               there grimfaced

                                                                    cut to

               ext the parade ground  day

               zack is on morning colors duty he and one of the lesser
               known candidates are raising the flag a bugler standing 
               nearby blowing morning colors zack suddenly sees something 
               that chills him

               sid and foley stand in front of the admin building foley 
               saluting the flag sid just standing there arms at his sides 
               shoulders slumped

               as the bugler finishes zack turns to his classmate

                                     zack
                         i gotta do something

               he breaks into a run

               track with zack

               as he runs toward foley and sid and walks with them toward 
               the water

                                     zack

               the big okie hangs by his necktie from a cluster of exposed 
               drainage pipes in a corner of the ceiling

                              suddenly

                         old blimp hangar in five minutes 
                         mayo youre my volunteer

               zack stops in his tracks and turns to face his antagonist

               hell wait around for this

                                                                    cut to

               int the musty old hangar  day

               foley is up in the ring in his vc pajamas watching them 
               take do their seats zack is the last to walk in

                                     foley

                         yes sir

               he climbs up into the ring with foley

                                     foley
                         put these on

               he hands zack a set of safetypunch gloves and safetykick 
               foot pads zack sits on the canvas and puts them on foley 
               already wears his

                                     foley
                         ill start with some basic kicks 
                         you try to copy me

               zack gets to his feet and squares off opposite foley

               most of zacks classmates

               know about the incident in town with the locals and the 
               word spreads quickly to the others in excited whispers they 
               share a common dream these twentyone survivors to see 
               foley broken and humbled

               the martial arts demonstration  a series of shots

               foley demonstrates a simple side kick the heel of his foot 
               slamming hard against zacks jaw as in the previous 
               demonstration foley isnt afraid of inflecting a little 
               punishment along with his instruction hes unprepared 
               however for the skill and and speed with which zack returns 
               a version of that kick the heel of his foot hitting foley 
               so solidly it rocks him back a couple of steps before he can 
               catch his balance

               foley grins a rivulet of blood running down his chin

                                     foley
                         lookylooky what we got thats pretty 
                         cute mayo

               foley executes a crescent kick his specialty and bloodies 
               zacks mouth zack returns a crescent kick that knocks the 
               marine right on his ass

                                     foley
                         youre good

                                     zack
                         get on your feet and find out how 
                         good sir

               before zack can get set foley seizes the offensive and starts 
               backing him across the ring with a series of fast kicks

               momentarily trapped in the corner zack ducks a punch slips 
               under a crescent kick and hits his man three times in the 
               face with his foampadded knuckles then follows with a kick 
               to the midsection that makes the marine sink to his knees 
               with a silly expression on his face

               suddenly unafraid of foley the class rises to its feet and 
               cheers zack on

               adlibs of get him zack no mercy remember what he 
               did to us quieter mumblings of kill the motherfucker

               foley gets to his feet zack drops him instantly with a 
               jumpspinning back kick

               foley gets up again and manages to stay up for a short time 
               but its a pathetic mismatch and zack can land solidly at 
               will with hands and feet finally with a spinning outside 
               crescent kick that awes his classmates zack flattens him 
               again foley just lies there obviously spent

               zack offers him a hand foley looks up at him helplessly 
               shakes his head in defeat and reaches out to accept his 
               help

               then with shocking suddenness foley coils his knees to his 
               chest yanks zack toward him and  at the same time  
               unleashes a kick straight to zacks chin zack crumples to 
               the canvas and lies there barely conscious foley rises to 
               his feet

                                     foley
                         oldest trick in the book now is 
                         there anything you want to tell me 
                         mayo

               zack shakes his head no foley bows to him formally then 
               to the rest of the class and marches like gods warrior son 
               from the old hangar

               zack watches his classmates file out leaving him alone in 
               the cavernous hanger

                                                               dissolve to

               int the barracks  night

               zack comes in by himself

               int zacks room  night

               perryman looks up from his navigation book as his only 
               surviving roommate enters zack looks at the two stripped 
               bunks the empty lockers then he stares at his own locker 
               for a long time trying to make up his mind

               then perryman gets up puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder 
               just for an instant and goes back to his studies finding 
               some coins in his locker zack leaves the room

               int the barracks payphone  night

               zack throws some money in to satisfy the operator

                                     zack

               the sun is just rising and sending its colors across the 
               big wide lawn where the graduation ceremony will soon take 
               place

               four enlisted men are positioning risers and folding chairs

                                                                    cut to

               commanding officer and his staff including foley seated 
               on the risers and the large gathering of family and friends 
               seated on the folding chairs the base marching band a

               zack see his father

               and smiles

               seconds later the camera is panning the face of the 
               graduates

               standing at attention on their risers reciting their 
               commissioning oath

               minutes later the newlycommissioned officers have broken 
               ranks

               and are embracing their families and friends on the lawn

               byron finds zack and the two men stare at one another warily 
               before warmth floods their faces and they come together in 
               an embrace zack pulls a folded document from his breast 
               pocket

               he starts to bring his hand up to salute his son but zack 
               grabs his wrist to stop him

                                     zack

               he looks over at

               foley in dress blues

               he cane propped characteristically behind him the newer 
               notches clearly recognizable from the ones that predate this 
               class he watches them approach one after the other each 
               of his worms his scuzzes his college pukes and he renders 
               to them as is the tradition their first salute in return 
               they hand him a silver dollar

               perryman pays up then casey approaches him

                                     foley

               she gives him a silver dollar and hurries off to rejoin her 
               family

               zack approaches foley

               and the marine salutes him briskly his heels clapping 
               together like a flamenco dancers

                                     foley
                         congratulations ensign mayo sir

               zack gives him a silver dollar and foley pockets it and snaps 
               off another brisk salute

                                     foley

                         and thank you

               foley just grins as zack answers his salute

                                                                    cut to

               ext the base  day

               moving with zack on his motorcycle he still wears his dress 
               whites and his gear is packed in a navy seabag strapped to 
               the back as he drives away from the barracks waving farewell 
               to some of his classmates as he rumbles past the parade 
               ground he sees foley addressing a spanking new class of 
               candidates still in civvies still sporting hair

                                     foley
                         i dont believe what im seeing 
                         look at all that hair all those 
                         lard bellies from junk food and pot 
                         where you been all your lives at an 
                         orgy listening to mick jagger and 
                         bad mouthing your country i bet

               the new class cracks up laughing as zack motors past headed 
               for the gates its hard to believe only thirteen weeks have 
               elapsed since he heard those words for the first time seems 
               more like a lifetime

               ext the gates of the naval air station  day

               zack drives out and disappears down the road

                                                          slow dissolve to

               int the national paper kill  day

               paula is at work on the line the sweat of a long day stings 
               her eyes as it stings the eyes of her fellow workers poor 
               paula its not hard to imagine her in a few years as bunny

               hell lynettes already there old debs never die

               the women on the paper towel line near the door

               are the first to see him enter

               esther pokrifki

               stops her work as she sees the flash of gold on a naval 
               shoulder board

               the women on the napkin line

               send up a buzz of gossipy excitement as he strides past them

               so clean so handsome so perfect every debs fantasy

               he wears the dress white uniform with ensign gold

               and he wears it proudly as he strides through their ranks 
               toward the girl who is only now stopping to watch him 
               approach

               paula cant believe it

               almost as she might have dreamed it long ago as a little 
               girl she watches him take her face in his hands and kiss 
               her in such a romantic way that its unlikely the women at 
               national paper or any of us will ever forget that kiss

               lynette and bunny watch that kiss

               with a mingling of happiness and painful desperate longing 
               on their faces

               esther pokrifki

               is the second happiest deb in the room

               the other aging debs in the huge factory

               stop their work to watch a few even applaud

               zack suddenly lifts paula in his arms

               and with their eyes still touching he carries her toward 
               the door

               lynettes face

               reveals all the jealousy that accompanies the happiness she 
               is feeling for her friend shes never leaving this place 
               and she knows it

                                     lynette
                         way to go paula way to go

               she adds her applause and half the factory is clapping and 
               cheering by the time the officer and his girl reach the 
               doorway

               ext the national paper mill  day

               zack carries paula out into the sunshine and kisses her again

               shes like candy all right and hell never get enough 
               pull back into helicopter shot that dwarfs them far below 
               us and

               fade out

                                         the end
