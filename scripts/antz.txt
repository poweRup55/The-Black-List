                      over a dark screen
               all my life ive lived and worked in
               the big city

     we see

     ext an ant mound  day

     the camera swoops towards the entrance then dives inside
     past a couple of toughlooking soldier ants who stand at the
     gates of the ant colony like insect bouncersinto an access
     tunnel that snakes this way and that past a row of ants
     plodding along

     and into the main chamber of the colony a huge teeming
     vista that seems to stretch away forever filled with ants
     rushing here and there on their business  we see  a
     traffic cop directing foot traffic waving his arms like
     crazy so both sides move at once  a column ofsoldier antsmarching along in formation  a chain of ants letting down
     amatchboxelevator filled with workers

                         z vo
               which is kind of a problem since
               ive always felt uncomfortably in
               crowds

     int motivational counsellors office  day

     we join z a worker ant with issues  hes lying on a couch
     recounting his woes

               worker  but i dont have any other

     hyperactive latenight tv huckster and founder of ronco

     z gives a fake smile

                         motivational counsellor
                      incredibly up
               z were part of thefastest growingspecies in the whole world

     the counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall  an arrow
     shows ant population going up up up

                         motivational counsellor
               ask me why were so successful

                         z
               why are we so successful

                         motivational counsellor
               im glad you asked me that question

     the motivational counsellor opens some blindsand we see a
     vista of the antfilled chamber below

                         motivational counsellor
               what do you see out there

                         z
               ants

                         motivational counsellor
               right  ants  millions of creatures
               each with his assigned task all
               pulling together

     down below we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an
     incline  one worker ants slips and the boulder rolls down
     crushing his leg  the other ants rush over  it looks like
     theyre going to help their fallen comrade but instead they
     climb right over him and pick up the boulder continuing
     with their task

                         motivational counsellor
               you see  being an ant is being able
               to say hey immeaninglessyouremeaningless

                         z
               but  but ive always felt life was
               about finding meaningand then
               sharing it with someone special
               someone you love

     the motivational counsellor puts his arm on zs shoulderhe
     seems to understand

                         motivational counsellor
               zyou need help

               whoops  were gonna have to stop
               there  your minute is up

     the counsellor ushers z out of his seat and towards the door

                         motivational counsellor
               now back to work  weve maderealprogress  remember  lets be
               best superorganism we can be

     int early megatunnel  day

     agigantictunnel with the size and scale of the chunnel
     a banner strung overhead reads the megatunnel  tunneling
     our way to a bright future  along the walls hang 50s work
     incentive style posters with messages like you asked for
     it you got it  more work and two meals a week is
     enough  line after line of ants is working on the tunnel
     digging passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant everyone
     synchronized

     close on a clump of dirt being passed from hand to hand
     pull out to reveal

     azteca a feisty cynical female worker ant who stands
     there waiting to pass the dirt on  z is daydreaming behind
     her with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him

                         azteca
               hello  earth to z  you better snap
               out of it or theres gonna be a lot
               of pissed off ants

     z looks back and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily

                         z
                      snapping out of it
               sorry azteca  here you go fellas

               a food shortage without you
               complaining about it every day

                         z
               the squeaky wheel gets the oil

     a whistle blows

                         z
               thank goodness  breaktime

     all the ants put down their tools  a beat  then the whistle
     blows again  all the ants pick up their tools again

                         azteca
                      resigned
               breaks over

                         z
                      getting back to work
               this colony needs another tunnel like
               a hole in the ground  why are we
               even digging this thing

                         azteca
               who cares z  all i know is we
               gotta dig  were not the ones in
               charge

     int town center  day

     the huge spacious main chamber of the colony  looming over
     the scene is the royal palace which seems to be
     inaccessible perched on top of a hilllike pedestal

     around the base of the pedestal a crew of workers loiters
     seemingly aimlesslycan these be the only unemployed ants
     in the place

                         general formica
               stairs

     the workers look up and groan  then they start forming a
     stairway with their own bodies linking arms stepping on
     each others shoulders  its extremely unpleasant work  one
     ant is a little tardy and just manages to get in place
     before

     general formica the pattonesque military leader of the
     colony steps on his head using it as the first step as he
     ascends to the palace his aidedecamp carpenter in tow  as
     formica mounts the stairs  we can hear the workers going
     ouch  oof  yikes etc

                         general formica
               cut the chitchat down there
                      turning to carpenter
               weve spoiled these workers
               carpenter  theyve never had it so
               good and listen to them  always
               grumbling and complaining

     formica steps on the foot of one of the stairway ants who
     muffles a yelp

                         carpenter
               yes sir

                         general formica
               what have they got to complain about
               three square meals a day

                         carpenter
               actually sir weve cut them down to
               three roughly rectangular meals a
               week

                         formica
               dont give me statistics carpenter
               i know what im talking about  doors

     formica and carpenter have reached the top of the staircase
     there the two guard ants on either side of the massive
     throne room doors pull them open  and one door hinge
     squeaks

                         formica
                      to guard ant while
                       passing
               oil that soldier

     int throne room  day

     the queen is on her throne her huge abdomen sprawled behind
     her

                         queen
               ah  general formica

     formica salutes and marches to her carpenter behind him

     note  throughout this scene the queen is giving birth
     repeatedly  each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a
     short happy birthday fanfare on his trumpet  midwife ants
     bring each baby to the queen for inspection who coos a few
     words  the midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet
     line powered by ants on a treadmill

                         queen
               general the severe food shortage
               that faces the colonypainsme
               the thought of any of my children
               going hungry

               the situation

                         formica
               we are launching a major offensive to
               expand our foraging territory

                         queen
               yes what else

                         formica

               priority and i promise you its
               being dealt with swiftly and
               decisively

     the queens attention is interrupted by another baby being
     put in her arms

                         queen
                      to baby

               good man  i dont know what we would
               do without you

     formica clicks his heels and bows his head  carpenter bows
     low  formica smartly about faces 

                         bala os
               general formica

     princess bala hurries through a second doorway carrying a
     swatch book  something about her sets her apart from the
     handmaiden ants with her  her tiara probably

     formica tilts his head quizzically to carpenter behind him

                         carpenter
                      sotto
               princess bala sir  your fiancee

               romantic general

     he strides across the floor  bala watches him go her
     antennae drooping unhappily

                         formica
               no squeak  outstanding

     we see through the nowopen doors into the throneroom as
     formica and carpenter doubletime out of the frame

     the queen sees that bala is unhappy

                         queen

     for miles and there arehundredsof ants trying to get a
     drinkunfortunately theres only one bartender  z is at
     the bar with weaver a burly ant soldier

                         z

     the bartender a grizzled veteran slaps down what looks like
     a couple of large green beer mugs  actually theyre aphids
     little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs
     hanging from the ceiling  the kegs are specialized ants with
     hugely distended stomachs which spray liquid into the aphids

                         aphids
                      as theyre slapped
                       on bar

               poor guys had one too many scouting
               missions

     music starts up

     int ant bar entrance  night

     princess bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar
     accompanied by her worriedlooking handmaidens

                         handmaiden 2
               we shouldnt be doing this  it

               and do princesses do improper things

                         bala

               isnt improper  anyway dont worry
               no one will recognize us in our
               disguises

     she adjusts her disguise a hardhat tied down jackie o
     style with an ants version of a chanel scarf

                         bala
               im just a common worker cooling off
               after a rough day

     music starts  an ant barker takes the mic at one end of the
     dance floor

                         barker
                      on loudspeaker
               okay folks  its sixfifteen and
               that means its time to dance

     every ant gets up to dance  weaver turns to z

                         weaver
                      draining his beer
               time to cut a rug z

                         z
               im not in the mood
                      disgusted
               even when theyre off work they
               follow orders

                         weaver
               well you just sit here and be a
               partypooper

     weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the
     dance  the barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone 
     all the ants already know the steps  everyone dances in
     perfect synch

                         barker
                      southern twang
               and a leftrightquarterstepback

               a leftrightquarterstepbackstep
               halfstep 

     at the entrance bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens

                         bala
               im going to ask one of these
               mindless primitive workertypes to
               dance with me

                         handmaiden 1
               but general formica would be furious

                         bala
                      enjoying the idea
               i know

     the handmaidens are appalled  bala whirls away from them
     sets her sights and searches the crowd  zeroing in on 

     z whos watching the other ants dance

                         z
               what a bunch of losers  mindless
               zombies capitulating to an oppressive
               system 

                         bala
               wanna dance

     balas standing right there  z isinstantly smitten

                         z
               meyes  i mean 
                      regaining suavosity
               just let me finish my beer

     not breaking eye contact with bala z smiles suavely
     reaches suavely for a beer  suavely grabs the candle in a
     glass jar off the bar  suavely singes his face

     he plays it off with a rakish little laugh  a bit
     apprehensive bala heads onto the floor  z follows her

                         z
               so uh  how come i havent seen you
               around here before

                         bala
                      covering up
               i work in the palace i dont get out
               much

                         z

               really live it up  of course theyre
               all a little you know from
               inbreeding 

                         bala
                      shockedwhat

     z and bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the
     ants but z cant do any of the steps

                         z
               now lets see i  its been a
               while since i  i think you 

     bala watches z trying to follow along  its the blind
     leading the blind as z tries in vain to follow the barkers
     rapid instructions

                         z
               here ill lead

     z starts doing his own individual dance  with a suave
     expression on his face he leads bala in a helterskelter
     mixtureof tango charleston and handjive

                         bala
               are you sure this is a real dance

                         z
               well actually uh  im sort of
               making it up 

                         bala
                      surprised
               really

                         z
               why should everyone dance the same
               way  its as exciting as watching
               fungus grow

                         bala
               youre right

                         z
                      surprised
               you  you think im right

                         bala
               why cant i just do whatever i want
               to do  why cant i just go wild
               yahoo

     bala starts to get into it making up her own steps in reply
     to zs loosening up having fun  for a moment the two of
     them are actually sexy together  then they get a littletoowild  and the other ants who are still doing their
     intricate dance start to collide with bala and z  z almost
     knocks over a big soldier ant  we can only see the ants
     back at the moment

                         soldier
               hey  watch your stepworker

     z has turned around to see the soldier ant major mandible
     glaring at him  mandible is about twice zs size  hes got
     one eye missing and half of his left antenna his been chewed
     off

                         bala
               you watch yours soldier or my
               worker friend will beat you up

                         z
                      terrified
               oh thats okay ill let him off
               this time
                      whispering to bala
               are you crazy  this guys built like
               a pebble
                      ineptly trying to
                       placate the soldier
               you know they do great prosthetic
               antennas nowadays 

                         bala
               arent you gonna stand up for
               yourself

     zs caught between a rock and a hard place  he doesnt want
     to get beaten up but on the other hand he doesnt want to
     lose face in front of bala  more soldiers have gathered
     around looking hostile

                         soldier
               how come you dont dance like the
               rest of us

     z glances over at bala  then shaking with nervousness he
     says defiantly

                         z
               because  because im anindividual

                         soldier 2
               an individual  never heard of it

                         mandible
               you look like a worker to me

                         weaver
               hey lay off my little buddy

     z meanwhile looks far away ecstatic as if hes just
     realized something very important  unfortunately just at
     this moment a soldier pushes weaverweaver pushes him
     backsomebody makes a dive for z  and before you know it
     theres a regularbar brawlgoing on with weaver in the
     middle of it cracking heads together punching ants in the
     face having a great time  just then the princess
     handmaidens hurries over

                         handmaiden 1
               princess bala  princess bala

     z whos scrabbling around on the floor overhears

                      thinks
               never  bye

     bala rushes off with her handmaiden just before a squad of
     whistleblowing police wade into the crowd

                         z
               wait  princess  wait

     but shes already gone leaving z holding her scarf

     int dormitory  the next day

     z is talking to weaver whos getting ready to go off to war

               come right back after the inspection

     weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation

                         z
                      overjoyed
               thanks  i owe you

     z skips off and joins the column marching in time with the
     soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little

     int town center  night

     the ant army has gathered in a huge hall in front of a
     reviewing stand  we can hear the murmuring of thousands of
     soldiers  but all we can see is a huge poster of an ant
     general pointing right at the camera  the poster reads
     general formica wants you  to obey

     z turns to some of the soldiers near him

                         z
               any of you guys know when the
               princess will show up  shes kind of
               a personal friend

     the soldiers look at z like hes nuts

                         loud voice
               attenshun

     martial music sounds and we hearthousandsof ant feet as
     they snap to attention  z imitates the soldiers awkwardly

     general formica struts to the middle 6f the screen slapping
     his thigh with a swagger stick the antenna of some
     unfortunate insect

                         formica
               first of all let me make one thing
               clear  nobody ever won a battle bythinking for himself  all this
               thinking stuff is aload of crap
               if the almighty had wanted you boys
               tothink he wouldnt have given you
               huge mandibles and a brain so small
               youdmisplace itif it wasnttrapped inside your head

     in the audience z starts laughing  he thinks formicas
     just made a joke

                         z
                      slapping his thigh
               trapped inside your head  thats
               a good one 

     z notices nobody else is laughing  he stops

                         z
               geez  tough room

     from the stage formica is squinting at the audience trying
     to make out who was laughing but there are just too many
     ants  he continues

                         formica
                      striding back and
                       forth
               we ants survive as a species because
               we do what were told  we survive
               because we work together as one we
               get the job done we do whatever it
               takes to persevere
                      dramatic pause
               hell were not an army of
               antswere onegiantant withgiant fists andgiant jaws

     the soldiers cheer  z cheers along with the rest of them

                         z
                      to the soldier ant
                       next to him
               lays it on a little thick doesnt
               he  if you ask me hes one giant
               bore

                         formica
               now ive heard a lot of scuttlebutt
               about afood shortage  well you boys

               the meantime were gonna eat the
               enemy forbreakfast we are gonna
               eat the enemy forlunch and we are
               gonna eat the enemy fordinner

                         z
               geez and i forgot my toothbrush

                         formica
                      reflective moment
               dammit im proud to be an ant
                      he looks out at his
                       army
               and i know each and every one of you
               boys will do your duty  dismissed

     z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in
     confusion

                         z
                      clapping
               bravo  bring on the princess

                         colonel
               stow the gab there soldier  lets
               move em out

     the soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past
     the reviewing stand

     a colonel marches at the head of zs column as z looks around
     for the princess

                         colonel
               eyesleft

     finally as zs part of the army marches past the end of the
     reviewing stand he sees her looking bored standing next
     to the queen who is giving the royal wave

                         z
                      waving
               princess  princess bala  hey  its
               me  z  ive got your scarf

     on the reviewing stand bala sees z  that is to say she
     sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching
     by

                         bala
                      peering out
               who is that idiot

                         queen
               darling you must encourage the
               troops  wave

     bala waves unenthusiastically little more than flopping her
     hand back and forth on her wrist

     down below z takes this as a sign that bala has seen him

                         z
                      excited
               excuse me guys  thats my date
               well its been fun  have a great
               war

     z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals but hes
     surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers  and theyre
     carrying him along with them

                         z
               hey  wait

     z loses sight of the princess as hes carried away
     barbatus a hardasnails grunt soldier ant taps z on the
     shoulder

                         barbatus
               you new kid

                         z
               i just joined up  but im quitting
               i got a trial membership

                         barbatus
               trial membership  kid when you join
               this ants army youre in for the
               full hitch

     at that moment z is swept out of the cramped corridor
     theyve been marching along as the army emerges into the
     open air outside of the colony

     ext ant mound  night

     its a starry moonlit night  the shadows crowd around the
     panicked z who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the
     march

                         z
               wait a minute theres been a
               mistake  ive got to get back to the
               colony

     z starts to fall out of line but barbatus looking
     concerned stops him

                         barbatus
               are you crazy kid  they shoot
               deserters

     z swallows hard

                         barbatus
               you just stick by old barbatus
               hell watch out for you
                      off zs look

               playing hard to get  as a matter of
               fact shes playing completely
               unattainable
                      nervously
               so whats on the schedule  a brisk
               walk  a foraging expedition

                         barbatus
               no  were going to attack the
               termites

                         z
                      alarmed
               attack  but  i hate attacking
               its so hostile

     around z and barbatus the ants start up a marching song
     which we intersperse with dialogue between barbatus and z to
     form a montagetimecut as the ant army marches on to the
     termite capital

                         ant soldiers
                      to the tune of when
                       johnny comes
                       marching home
               we ants go marching one by

                         barbatus
                      grim smile
               no such luck  those dirty terms are
               five times bigger than us and they
               shoot acid from their foreheads

                         soldier ants

     screen fading into another column marching diagonally
     downwards across the screen

     montage shot of zs column crossing a bridge composed of
     living ants  all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as
     theyre getting stepped on

                         z
               so were going back for more armor
               right  i mean these guys are from

     ext terrain near termite stump  night

     z looks up to seelooming high above themthe termite
     city which is built in the stump of a dead tree  from here
     it looks like a demonic mount fuji  the colonel ant shouts
     an order

                         colonel
               attaaaaaaaaack

     the front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite
     colonyz is swept along

                         barbatus
               over the toooooooooooooop

     z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of
     ants invade the colony through every possible entrance
     upover the lip of the stumpand down inside to the very
     middle of the termite colony

     into a disquietinglypeacefulscene   theyre in the middle
     of the hollowedout trunk and ants keep pouring in  but
     theres not a termite to be seen  barbatus looks around
     suspiciously

                         barbatus
               its too damn quiet

     then we hear a strangetappingnoise  barbatus looks over
     and sees that zs teeth are chattering with fear

                         barbatus
               dont be scared kid  barbatuss
               got yer back

                         z
                      petrified
               maybe they went out for the evening
               lets leave them a message and head
               home

                         colonel

     a nearby soldier ant take afireflyout of his knapsack andpinches him  the firefly yelling yipe  yipe  yipe
     shoots into the air like a flare lighting up the interior of
     the stump with eery shifting luminescence

     then we notice hollowed into the inside of the stump like
     innumerable pockmarkstermite holesstaring out upon the
     stumpand with an unearthlyroar we see the first ofhundreds of termitesemerging to pour into the center of the
     tree right onto the ant army

                         colonel
               theyre here

                         barbatus
                      to z
               keep your head down

     within moments z finds himself in the middle of abloodbath  the ants have broken into the colony but are
     taking heavy losses from the gigantic blind acidspewing
     termites  the battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as
     something out ofbraveheart in a few quick shots from zs
     perspective we see

      a squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier but are
     literallymeltedinto smoking heaps of flesh by ajet of acidfrom its forehead

      a termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and ispulled to pieceswith hideousrippingsounds

      another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one
     and slowlycrusheshis head in his huge jaws

                         z
                      looking around
               guys  guys  it isnt too late for
               all of us to just talk this over

     just then a termite burst up from the ground and turns to
     face z  z isdwarfedby this hulking roaring drooling
     monstrosity

                         z
               wait  please  acid makes me come
               out in spots   could i just say i
               have always had the greatest respect
               for your species  i mean eating
               wood  why didntithink of that
               i 

     the termite rears getting ready to melt z when oof hes
     knocked backwards by

               barbatus  you  you saved my life

                         barbatus
               dont get all sappy about it

     as barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite the
     colonel strides up to z puffing on a cigar

                         colonel
               i love the smell of formic acid in
               the morning

                         z
               look out

     a stream of termite acidengulfsthe colonel instantly
     burning him to a cinder clutching a stillburning cigar zs
     paratroop buddies turn in terror to see aherdof termites
     rumbling towards them  z terrified dives into the hole
     that the huge termite made

     int termite tunnel  night

     and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound
     the corridors here are primitive cavemanlike pocked with
     jagged access holes

     no sooner has z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes
     burrowing out from one of the side walls snapping at zs
     head  z just avoids getting decapitated and digsstraightthrough the wallin order to escape

     int termite queens chamber  night

     straight into the hub of the entire termite complex  the
     queens chamber  this is nothing like the civilized court of
     the ant colony  its a huge stinking fetid dungeon whose
     walls are held up by one massive to z column of piled
     stones

     the termite queen a repulsive slimy squirming footlong
     monster is attended by a crew of diminutive blind termite
     nurses  the queen turns to look z right in the eye

                         z
               excuse me  i seem to be lost and i
               was wondering if you could give me 

     before z can say directions the queen gives out a
     piercing bloodcurdlingshriek  the nurses start shrieking
     too

                         z
                      backing away
               ill let myself out

     but the queens shriek has summoned a soldier termite  thebiggestone weve seen yet  who is charging headlong at z
     jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors

                         z
                      backing away
               shoo  torro  torro

     at the last moment z jumps out of the way  and the termite
     runsheadfirstinto the supporting column of the chamber  as
     if on a spring release the termites jaws clamp shut  andshatterthe base of the column  the walls of the room begin
     to rumble

     the termite turns to eat zbut iscrushedby a stone
     falling from the ceiling which gives a final shudder andcollapses raining earth and stones down on the queen

     as the walls of the chamber crumble melees of ants and
     termites pour into the room from the corridors around and
     abovethey keep struggling until

                         ant officer
                      points at z
               hes killed their queen

                         z
               hey im sorry it was a mistake 

                         ant officer
               victory

     we can see that the termite warriors deprived of their
     leader are suddenly confused and directionless easy prey
     for the ants

                         z
                      facetious
               this is terrific   lets exact
               crippling war reparations  lets set
               up a puppet government

                         ant officer
               lets slaughter them all

     the ants set about killing the disoriented termites whenwe
     hear anotherrumblecoming from the outsidethe ants look
     up confusedly

     and a from the ants point of viewfivehundred footlong tonguebursts through the top of the chamber with a
     crash  the ten or so ants standing directly below aresmashedby the tongue which squirts out a spray of saliva
     around the crater  as quick as it appeared the tongue
     retracts with a hideous sluuurping sound  we can now see
     the end of the snout of an anteater poking through a hole in
     the ceiling high above

                         ant officer
               incoming

     the tongue comes down again smashing some more ants whose
     bodies are slurped up by the tonguethe ants scatter but
     to no avail as the tongue comes smashing down again and
     again

     z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down
     again barely missing him

     z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him
     across the tunnel from intersecting accesstunnels getting
     closer and closer to z dragging more and more screaming ants
     and struggling termites

     then the tongue disappears  silence  z wipes his brow

     and we hear a thunderous sniffing noise as the anteater
     searches for more prey and the tongue startsrumblingdown
     the corridorright towards z the tip squirming as it
     ricochets along the walls

     z gets up and runs the tongue lapping towards him
     reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed indiana
     jones inraiders of the lost ark  the walls disintegrate
     under the pressure of the tongue which gets closer to
     zcloser

     andjust misses himas z tumbles out of the stump and down
     to the groundz sits there dazed as we see the huge form
     of the anteater withdraw its tongue and with a final
     contented burp shuffle off into the distance

     ext termite stump  morning

     z makes his way across the corpsestrewn battlefield an
     expression of horror on his face

     other workers as he goes along

                         azteca
                      surprised at herself

     int town center  day

     a huge crowd is forming eager to welcome the army back  a
     band is striking up a triumphant victory song confetti and
     streamers are being thrown as general formica strides in
     followed by carpenter

               the armys returned  our brave boys
               are back etc

     everyone waves little flags as the tuba player oompahoompah
     oompahs

     and z walks into the hall looking bedraggled and
     exhausted his helmet hanging over his ears

     the band slows to a halt

     at the edge of the crowd azteca sitting on weavers
     shoulders can just about see over the crowd

                         azteca
               it looks like only one soldier made
               it back

     weaver looks distraught

                      to himself

     int throne room  day

     z follows formica and carpenter into the throne room  at the
     end of the hall a society band is playing  the room is full
     of courtier ants and officers

     waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors douevres

                         z
               wow what a spread  you know
               theres a food shortage in the rest
               of the colony

               negatorytoo many ants  and while
               we soldiers go out there and fight
               and bleed and die for the colony
               the nambypamby workers live it up
               back home

     feeling a little hot z wipes his brow

                         z
               well i i dont think living it up
               is the right term  how about
               working themselves to death

                         formica
               i tell you son sometimes at night
               i see myself in battle fighting a
               horrible faceless enemy with the
               future of our whole species at stake
               and always the dream ends with each
               of us plunging his sword into the
               others heart

                         z
                      spooked
               oh hey thats great i think i see
               an old war buddy over there its
               been fun chatting  good luck with
               the hallucinations

     z escapes from formica who gazes after him suspiciously

     z mingles in with the crowd then he sees princess bala
     standing with a group of officers who are eating hors
     doeuvres

                         officer
                      telling a joke
               what do you call it when 10000
               workers are killed in a tunnel cave
               in
                      a beat
               who cares  theyre workers

     the officers laugh but bala looks bored in this stuffy
     social scene

                         z
               butdont you think the worker
               class is the very foundation of the
               colony 
                      realizes hes
                       getting odd looks
               i mean uh without them who would
               we stand on

     more laughter

                         bala
               youre the hero of the recent termite
               campaign arent you

                         z
               well if singlehandedly vanquishing
               the enemy and slaughtering a whole
               nestful of termites makes someone a
               hero yes i am

     z reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by
     and knocks the whole thing clattering to the ground

                         z
                      feigning nonchalance
               and you are

     she moves towards the dance floor  z spitcombs his
     antennae struts after her  until he trips on his sword
     he tumbles falls but hops to his feet just as bala turns
     toward him turning it into a ballet plies

                         z
               just warming up

     she frownstheres something familiar about this guy  but
     then they start dancing

     across the room the queen and general formica watch the
     party

                         queen
               all these parties are so marvellouslyalike

                         formica
               they should be
                      suspicious
               but theres something funny about
               that soldier

     formica strides over to where z and bala are dancing

                         formica
                      glowering
               may i cut in

                         bala
                      pulling z back

               war hero

                         z
                      trying to placate
                       formica
               uh sorry general iive always
               had this animal magnetism it 

     bala yanks z back onto the dance floor dancing away from
     formica

               someone

     formica catches balas eye  she frowns at him and decides
     to get a little shocking

                         bala
               he was swarthyprimitive
               earthysensual

     as she says these things z tries to act accordingly

                         bala

                         bala

                         z

               pretty hot to trot then

                         bala
               sshh  sshh

     a livid formica is stalking over towards them

                         formica
                      furious
               whats this  aworkerhas been
               masquerading as a war hero

                         z
               well it wasnt a masquerade really
               it was more what id call a clever
               ruse 

                         formica
               arrest him

                         z
               cant we all settle this like
               adults  were not larvae anymore 

     angry officers begin to surround z who hides behind bala in
     fear using her as a shield

                         queen
               oh my god  hes taking her hostage

                         z
               no im not  i mean  nobody move
               or the princess gets it

     people shout and scream as z backs up with the
     princessinto the kitchen

     int kitchen  day

     z backs up into the kitchen still pulling bala along with
     him  here ant chefs are preparing food for the partyvomitinglittle florets onto a platter  formica and the
     soldiers follow them in

                         z
                      to formica
               stay back youlunatic  do you think
               i dont know how to use this

     z realizes that hespointing his finger at them

                         z
               uhoh

     the officers rush forand z with bala in tow falls
     backwards into an opening marked garbage

     ext ant mound  day

     hold on the garbage chute exit  nothing happens for a
     moment  then 

     from a distance we hear the faint sound of screaming
     dopplering closer 

      and then z and bala come flying out of the exit right
     into the mud cutting off the scream abruptly

     bala sits up coated in mud  z is nowhere to be seen
     because shes on top of him

                         princess
               this is thoroughly unacceptable

                         z
               youre telling me

     she gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance where
     soldiers are already issuing to get her

                         bala
               im coming  im coming

     butjust as balaa about to be rescuedwhat looks like a
     gigantic laser beam sweeps along the rim of the colony
     sizzling the ground as it moves alongand ignites the lead
     soldier into flames  bala looks stunned

     z watches in horror as another soldier ant is fried and we
     look up to see a gigantic magnifying glass casting the
     beamwe can just about make out the huge grotesque figure
     a seven year old kid holding it

     bala who has no idea whats really going on turns from the
     colony and runs the other way

                         bala
               im going  im going

     unfortunately this draws the fire of the laser which
     follows after her in what looks like a strafing run sizzling
     in her footsteps

     z whos running towards the princess suddenly realizes that
     hes running towards certain doomand joins bala in legging
     it away from the colony under abrown leaf whichburstsinto flamesbetween the redwoodlike stalks of some
     flowersand finally into the relative safety of some
     grasswhere they throw themselves on the ground exhausted

                                              cut to

     ext weed clump  day

     z and bala dust themselves off

                         bala
               whatwasthat thing

                         z
               how shouldi know

                         bala
               i order you to find out where we are

                         z
               alright alright ill try to get
               directions from one of the locals

     z tries to flag down some passing bees

                         z
               excuse me i 
                      it passes him by
                       he tries the next
               pardon me 
                      same response
               and they call them social insects

                         bala
               climb up that tree and get a better
               view

     bala points to a thin blade of grass  gingerly z tests the
     grass and starts climbing up itbut his weight bends it so
     that hes lowered back to the ground face to upsidedown
     face with bala

                         bala
               ive been kidnapped by the village
               idiot

                         z
               whos the bigger idiot  the idiot
               who gets kidnapped or the idiot who
               lets herself get kidnapped by the
               idiot

                         bala
               how dare you speak to me like that
               im the princess

     z squares up with her

                         z
               theoretically yes  but is the
               monarchical hierarchy applicable
               without the underlying social
               structure to support it

                         bala
               of course  it defines society  to
               deny the precept is to say that order
               is an arbitrary distinction applied
               by the society itself

                         z
               but can there be a society composed
               of just two ants

                         bala
               no  theres no such thing as just
               two ants  you never see just two
               ants  you see a million ants

                         z
               look around sweetheart

     she looks around  she doesnt like what she sees  she
     glowers at z

                         bala
               i hate you

                         z
               well i guess that makes us even

                         bala
               ha  dont make me laugh  youre
               crazy about me  thats why you lied
               and cheated to get near me

                         z
               oh come onyourethe one who came
               after me  the swarthy earthy
               sensual worker

                         bala
                      repulsed
               i wasslumming it  i danced with you
               because you were the most pathetic
               specimen in the place

                         z
               is that the same standard you used to
               choose general formica

                         bala
               ididntchoose him  what kind  ofidiotwould
                      unconvincingly
               choosewho she wanted to marry

     she shakes herself out of it

                         bala
               now worker you shall take me back
               to the colony and have your head cut
               off and stuck on a sharp pole

                         z
               well thats an appealing offer
               butconsidering the options
                      he decides
               you go back  me im going to
               insectopia

                         balainsectopia  you stupid worker

               source
                      he knows that was
                       maybe stretching it
               that it exists  now you follow
               the yellow egg
                      looking aroundthatdirection

                         bala

               thats not a name  thats just a
               letter

     z meanwhile hits the road  bala has no idea of where to
     go  just then the scariness of the outside world comes
     through to her

     we start hearing noises  the equivalent of scary jungle
     sounds in a tarzan movie  the hissing croaking
     chirruping bala seeseyeslooking out at her from all
     directionsand spots a colossal monster a sparrow fixing
     her with his beady gaze

                         bala
                      clears her throat
               worker
                      no responselouder
                       now
               oh worker  where are you
                      getting desperate
               z  z  wait for me

     bala heads off after z

     int megatunnel  day

     the mass of worker ants are swinging pickaxes in the tunnel
     the foreman moves up the line berating the workers yelling
     at them to dig faster

                         azteca
               i tell ya im gettin sick of bein

               then he took a hike with one of the

     over zs line we can see a gigantic wheel getting larger
     and larger and heading right towards them a gigantic wheel
     the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards
     them

     bala notices that theyre clutching one another in fear she
     pushes him away

                         bala

               wait i hear something

     we can in fact hear a low musical plunk theres a pause
     and then we can hear it again

     z and bala walk over a rocky dune the soft shoulder of the
     path  beyond the grass starts up again  they have come to
     the end of the desert ie the other side of the path
     through the blades of grass we can see

                         z
               itsits


                         bala
               water

     ext lake  day

     a lake a puddle stretches before them  it is in fact the
     overflow of a drinkingfountain whose drain is jammedas z
     and bala run to the lake water dribbles from the fountain
     and into one edge of the pool to the ants its a waterfall

     bala and z run to the edge of the water and start slurping
     they smile at each other until they remember that they dont
     like each other

                         z
               this lake is huge  and so close to
               the colony  think of the vacation
               potential

                         bala
               cut me down a soft leaf so i can take
               a nap

                         z
               listen princess you cant order
               me around  out here youre not the
               boss anymore  out here youre
               just 

      but before he can finish awater dropletfrom the
     fountain falls on him  it may not sound like much but to z
     its as though a tenfoot diameter sphere of jello had
     engulfed him

     zs stuck inside because of the surface tension of the
     droplet which doesnt burst just quivers up and down
     inside z is slowly franticallydrowningand screaming for
     help  but his screams are muffled in the water

                         bala
                      annoyed
               out here im just what

                         z
                      through the water
               hlllllllp

                         bala
                      hands on hips
               stop fooling around in there

     by now the droplet has startedrolling and z is being turned
     upsidedown  he manages to get one foreleg out of the
     droplet and in a frantic attempt to pull himself outpullsbala in by the leg

                         bala
               let me go

     but its too late  theyre nowbothstuck in the droplet
     and as z continues to drown he also has to deal with balayelling at him though we cant hear exactly what it is
     shes yelling through the water

     then having run out of air she too starts thrashing
     alternately trying toswimand trying toslap himas z tries
     todefend himself  finally all this commotion is enough to
     make the dropletburst spilling the two coughing
     sputtering drenched ants onto the ground

     they both lie there miserable wet and cold

                         bala
                      chants to herself
               im going to be rescued soon  im
               going to be rescued soon  im going
               to be rescued soon

               that theyrenot going to rescue you

               welliamthe oldest

     bala turns from z  shes thinking things over realization
     dawning on her

                         bala
               by three seconds

     she looks out into the grass forest

                         bala
                      to herself
               youre right  there are as many
               princessesas there are blades of
               grass

     z overhearing her slowly puts his hand on her shoulder

     int megatunnel  day

     formica and carpenter are walking into the entrance of the
     tunnel with a squad of soldiers

                         formica

     hands leading the chant

               with the female

                         carpenter

                         formica
                      calculating
               no one should have to  have him
               brought to me

     int formicas chambers  night

     a nervous weaver is sitting across from formica flanked by
     a couple of stoic guards  carpenter stands smiling by the
     side door  there is no obvious threat to weaver but the
     atmosphere is truly intimidating

                         formica
               so this zhe fancies himself an
               individual

                         weaver
               yeahi meanwelli dont know
               really sir

                         formica
                      patronizing
               well nowyouhavent fallen for this
               silly idea of individuality have

                         weaver
               thank you sir

     weaver begins to relax a bit

                         formica
               so tell me  wheres z

                         weaver

                         formica
               okay son

     he pats weaver on the shoulder

                         formica
               we know what makes an ant colony
               strong dont we  we know that no
               ant can be an individual  nosingleant matters right

                         weaver
                      enthusiastically
               thats correct sir

                         formica
                      points at a guard
               not that one
                      another guard
               or that one

                         weaver
               no sir

     formica nods at carpenter who smiles and opens a door  two
     soldiers walk in holdingazteca  the color drains from
     weavers face

                         formica
                      calmly with
                       satisfaction
               or that one  her life doesnt
               matter does it

                         azteca
               dont tell that tightass anything
               weaver

     weaver starts to get up but the guards behind him hold him
     down

                         weaver
               wait  just let her go  zs long
               gone anyway following some golden
               egg to insectopia  youll never
               catch him

     formicas face lights up

                         formica
               insectopia hunhsee why
               individuality is so dangerous  it
               can always be used against you
                      to the guards
               if this sissy here wants to dig
               hell dig  send them both back to
               the tunnel project  double their
               workload

     the guards exit with weaver and azteca

     lockjawed william f buckleyesque accents

                         male wasp
                      under his breath
               theyre eurotrash dear

     we hear a loud rumbling noise  the family is about to sit
     down for their picnic lunch  gigantichandsreach down and
     pull away the force fields

                         male wasp
               lunch
                      to z
               a little piece of advice sport 
               bob and weave  bob and weave

                         bala
               what do you mean

                         male wasp
               well  like my father used to say 
               theres no such thing as a free meal

     the wasps dive in to the picnic darting in for a bite and
     then dashing away again

                         the wasps
               excuse me  ill have some potato
               salad  thankyou  dont mind if
               i do  after you etc

      but all is not well  we pull back to reveal that z and
     bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo which is
     attached to agiant sneaker  whichmoves

                         z
               i sort of imagined insectopia a
               little differently 

     just at that moment we hear a whistling in the air  and
     the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out
     of the sky sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an
     aftershock that throws bala and z to the ground

                         bala
               ohmygod

                         male wasp
                      shaking her
               muffy  muffy  wake up

     but she doesnt move  the male wasp stares up at the sky

                         male wasp
                      heartbroken
               whyyyyyyyyyyyyy

     but z also looking up has no time to commiserate

                         z
               bala look out

     they are only saved by the fact that they are so small  the
     holes of the swatter pass over them

     the woman realizing that the swatter wont work on ants
     throws it to the side and tries stomping on them

     before bala can get away a sneaker falls on her with a
     thunderous boom that shakes the ground

                         bala
               mmmffllmmm

     the shoe rises as the person wearing it steps awayand we
     see that bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle
     soled sneaker adhering to a big piece ofbubblegum

                         bala
               z  help me

     but bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge looping
     ferriswheellike motion  boom  the sneaker on which bala
     is stuck falls again as the woman tries to step on z too 

                         z
               bala
                      mournfully
               ill never see her again

      but he does instantly as the shoe rises again showing
     bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum 

                         bala
               z  get me out of heeeeere

      the woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get
     the bubblegum off her shoez heart sinks as the shoe balas
     stuck on lopes off into the distance

                         z
                      thinks
               these things always come in twos

     he sees a second shoe starting to rise 

                         z
               take me to your leader

     z runs towards the shoe as it rises and at the last moment
     catches on to the snaky swingingshoelace

                         z
               whoooooooaaaa

     the sneaker lifts off into the air with z holding on for
     dear life to the lace and getting further and further away
     from bala as hes drawn to a vertiginous heightthe
     landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the
     background

                         z
               bala  come back here

     for a moment the sneaker seems to pause in the airthen it
     descends again in a stomachchurning rollercoaster free
     fall as the sneaker on which bala is stuck rises up again

                         bala
               z  im stuck

       but z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends
     the sneaker hits the ground and z can feel himself
     againits now or never

                         z
                      tarzan whoop
               aaeeyaeeyaaaaaaaah

     as the sneaker rises again heswingsoff the lace hurtling
     through the air and catching one of the laces of balas
     sneakerthe momentum swings him up and under the sole

                         bala
               z  youre here

     z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to bala  now hes
     stuck too

                         z
                      ruefully
               yeah  im here

     the sneaker descends again  z and bala hold hands and scream
     as they see the ground rise too meet them

     thud  theyre squished deeper into the bubblegum  the
     sneaker rises again

                         bala

               yes

                         balathis is all your fault

     the sneaker rises and seems ready to fall againbut
     instead it just hovers there  the person wearing it is
     balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum
     with a penny

                         z
               were safe

     just then the hand holding thepennylooms upthe penny
     is by ant standards about sixty feet high  the huge image
     ofabraham lincolnstares down at them

                         z

     the penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker
     bringing bala and z along with it  theyre carried through
     the air as the penny gets thrown awayturning over and over
     in a lopsided orbit as bala and z scream

     and land with a crash in totaldarkness

     ext lake  day

     the lake where z and bala were nearly drowned by the water
     droplet

     the earth shakes as a huge monstrous creature approaches the
     lake  and begins to drink from it  the creature seems to
     hear something andgrowling turns its ugly head  its a
     pomeranian one of those yappy little lapdogs  but seen

     the monster rears and snaps at two of the ants who are
     making a diversionary run

     and thengets itfrom the rest of the ants who land on his
     soft wet nose and startstinging away like crazy

     the monster rears back in pain  and runs away yipping

     two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a
     piece of machinery on a tripod  only its an ant  a
     highly specialized blind ant with an incredibly acute sense
     of smell

                         tracker ant

     the tracker drool running out of its long proboscis sniffs

     ant team six takes to the air heading in the direction
     indicated by the tracker ant

     int trash bag  day

     darkness  out of it we hear the voices of z and bala

                         bala
               come on z

                         z

               ii dont know what i was thinking
               insectopia

     in one corner of the screen we can see an irregular little
     hole through which ashaft of lightis falling  bala
     proceeds towards it the hole appears to get bigger and
     bigger

                         z
                      defeated
               theres only one thing worse than an
               ant who goes around mindlessly
               following orders and thats an ant
               whostoo dumbto go around
               mindlessly following orders

     bala stopsshe notices that theyre being watched  shes
     emerging from a tied offgarbage bag the yellow ties loop
     away gracefully  bala and z have been tossed into a garbage
     area  and above them and below them peering from garbage
     cans recycling containers bags etc a multicultural
     assortment of insects are regarding them

     a laidback fly voices their thoughts

                         fly
               whats with the bummer attitude

     a nearby butterfly joins in

                         butterfly
               yeah  nobody stresses out ininsectopia

                         bala

                      joining bala
               insectopia

     z and bala look around  just to get things straight the
     garbage dump doesnt look disgusting  that would be seeing
     it through human eyes  instead were looking at it throughant eyes and reimagined this way itsparadise  not the
     ordered sterile paradise of the picnic but an earthly land
     of plenty

     the sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer reflective
     walls of smoothest obsidianthe garbage cans are gigantic
     thick metal columns put there by the gods think the
     pyramids a coke bottle refracting the sunlight into a
     gorgeous rainbow trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into
     the pink bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half which
     appears as a multichambered concave dome  everywhere
     insects are disporting themselves  a multi species lovein
     thats like an insect version of woodstock

     bala and z are awestruck  bala turns to z

                         bala
                      happily
               z we made it

                      alighting on the
                       grapefruit
               cmon in  the nectars fine

     like a kid at an amusement park z slides down the smooth
     side of the garbage bag whooshing this way and that until he
     slides into one end of a straw a red and white striped
     tunnel and isshot out

                         z
               yippeeeeee

     into a bottlecap filled with lemonade which he
     alternately drinks and swims through

     down at the bottlecap z is drying himself off  then he
     sees emerging from behind a lemon peel a gigantic termite

                         z
                      terrified
               aaaaagh

     surprisingly the termite seemsequallyterrified

                         fly
                      to z
               hey take it easy  theres nothin
               to be afraid of

                         z
               yeah well i make it a practice not
               to trust anyone who shoots acid out
               of their forehead

                         cricket
               dude here in insectopia we dont
               judge people by how many arms and
               legs weve got

                         fly
               yeah back home they called me a
               fruitfly  but here im known

                         cricket
               anyway big gus is mellow

     the termite sticks his hand out  a drop of acid drips from
     his head and splashes at zs feet

                         z
                      taking his hand
                       disgusted
               charmed

     z reaches out and shakes the termites hand as bala watches
     smiling

     for a moment z is shy  then he looks at her too  theyre
     two lovers leaning closer about to have their first kiss

     the wasp takes off leaving the other insects looking a

     suddenly the wasp bounces up and down in the air

     int formicas chambers  day

     formica sits at his desk going over some plans  formicas
     chambers are located inside a snake skull with the eye
     sockets serving as windows and the mouth serving as a door
     the walls are hung with trophies  the heads of other
     insects

     ant team six burst in the doors of formicas office carrying
     the struggling and kicking bala  one of the commandoes sets
     the tracker ant one the floorthen formica gets up from his
     desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him

                         formica
               princess bala  good

               you dont have to look for him
               anymore  he was eaten by a praying
               mantis

                         formica
                      regretfully
               its a shame he died prematurelyi
               was hoping to kill him myself

                         bala
               well youll never be able to hurt him
               where he is now
                      sadly
               i miss him already

                         formica
                      surprised

     the soldiers look shocked  for a moment formica looks
     furious  then he just shrugs

                         formica
                      shaking his head
               princess bala im just a simple old
               soldier and the ways of the feminine
               mind are a little too complex for me
               but one thing i do know is there are
               more princesses where you came from
               i just hope theyre not all like you
               in the meantime maybe we can arrange
               for you to see z again after all

     he gestures to the commandoes who drag her out the door  we
     notice that the tracker ant has been left behind

     ext ant mound  day

     z hops down from the wasp who has landed near the entrance
     to the colony

                         male wasp
               good luck z  for a wingless insect

                         z
               thanks chip

     they shake hands and the wasp flies off

                      to himself
               how am i going to get in  the place
               is crawling with soldiers

     z starts for the nearest entrance  but hes spotted by a
     couple of soldier ants

                         z

               wellif you insist

     int megatunnel  day

     the queen with formica striding at her side is carried by
     a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the
     bottom end of the mega tunnel where a red ribbon waits to be
     cut

                         queen
               very impressive general

     behind herhundreds of thousandsof workers are crowded
     looking confused and expectant  some of them clutch little

     which we see are being handed out to them by ant team six

     the queen is looking around unhappily

               its justhow i miss bala  i wish
               she were here for this special moment

                      falsely supportive
               she is your majestyshe is

     the camera heads up the long long tunnel where we see

     int mid skylight tunnel

     bala tied and gagged  shes at the point in the megatunnel
     where it begins to curve upwards towards the surface  she
     struggles against her bonds but cant get loose

     elsewhere in the colony a column of soldiers marches by and
     we hear the tromptromptromp of their boots  when theyve
     gone z pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirthe
     heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers

     int outside formicas chambers  day

     z creeps around the outside of formicas chambers  this part
     of the colony seems to be deserted

                         z
               geez this place really empties out
               in august  where is everybody

     z walks up to the skull that houses formicas chambers and
     peeks in the eye socket

     int formicas chambers

     inside the tracker ant whos been left behind switches
     on eyes glowing  z enters the chamber cautiously

                         tracker ant
                      sniffing
               z  z  i smell z

     for a moment zs afraid  then he sees the small tracker ant
     doesnt seem hostile

               been out in the wilderness for a

     the blind ants eyes

                         z
                      getting it

     z carrying the little tracker ant heads out following its

     z can answer his own question  he puts down the tracker ant
     with a look on his face like a kid forced to eat broccoli
     startsdiggingthrough the wall

     int skylight apex  day

     meanwhile a member of ant team six  the stupidest member
     in fact waits at thevery top of the tunnel where it
     narrows almost to a point  hes hanging from a winch and
     has a little hammer and chisel in his hand  hes whistling
     awaiting instructions

     int megatunnel  day

     z emerges from the tunnel hes dug spits a load of dirt out
     of his mouth and wipes his hands off  nearby bala lies
     there bound and gagged

     z unties bala and undoes her gag

     they hug

                         z
               why do they have you tied up here

                         bala
               theres something going on z 

     from here z can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd
     is gathering

                         bala
               theyre having a ceremony to open the
               megatunnel

     we can hear the sound of water shifting somewhere above  he
     looks up the tunnelin the distance we can make out the
     silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall

                         z
               bala that  that lake we found 
               i think the tunnels right underneath

               said there were too many ants

                         bala
               oh no

     bala looks too shocked to move  z starts pushing her into
     the tunnel he made and starts heading down towards the crowd

                         bala
               z  what are you doing

     int ant mound  day

     all the soldiers are filtering out of the assembly area
     leaving the workers behind  as his troops march by formica
     steps to the side and hands the queen a pair of scissors to
     cut the ribbon strung across the megatunnel

                         formica

     formica surrounded by his bodyguards hurries off as the
     queen readies to cut the ribbon

     ext ant mound  day

     outside of the colony where formica surrounded by the army
     gives a signal to mandible by drawing his finger across his
     throat

                         mandible
                      talking into his

     int skylight apex  day

     at the top of the tunnel the commando starts chiseling away
     furiously at the walland nothing but dust falls down  the
     commando looks at the dust as it falls down down the long
     tunnelhe looks up at the dry wallhmmm

     then

     the wall bursts open

     and a torrent starts pouring out  swallowing the terrified
     commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel
     like a freight train ripping up the walls as it goes

     int early megatunnel  day

     everyone turns to hear therumbling soundcoming down the
     tunnel 

                         azteca
               listen

                         worker 1
               hes right

     from here we can see deep into the tunnel at the point
     where it levels outand the torrent can be seen rushing
     down at them

                         z
               lets move it

     all of a sudden therespanicas every ant tries to scramble
     away from the oncoming waterin the confusion the queens
     bearers drop her and scramble over her

                         queen
               you there  stop  i say

     the queen turns and for a brief moment is silhouetted
     against the whitecapped torrent of water

     and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt andhightails it away from the torrent running so fast that she
     passes some of her bearers on the way

     and then the torrentspits out of the mouth of themegatunnel quickly filling up the chamber and branching into
     all of its side tunnels as we see

     a group of workers running up a side tunnel and gettingconsumedby a wave which crashes down on them like a hand
     slapping a tableanother group the members of which are getting swallowed up
     one by one one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the
     tunnel and keeps on going upsidedownit works for a while
     but eventually he too is swallowed up

     babies

     in one of the larger accesstunnels down which thousands of
     workers are fleeing a group of ants turns and decides to
     make a stand for it  they link up in a mass and form a
     living dam  it holds for a while but then bursts scattering
     and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating
     them up

                                              cut to

     int town center  day

     the huge main chamber of the colony where most of the
     workers  as well as z bala weaver azteca and the
     queen  have run to

     the chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides  water flows
     out of every escape tunnel the workers tryand the crowd is
     becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters
     rise around them

                         azteca
               theres no way out

                         queen
               were all going to drown

                         bala
               zwhat can we do

     z clenches his fisthe feels utterly powerlessthen he
     shouts

                         zdig

     the workers turn to look at him questioningly

                         z
               weve got to dig a trench around us

      but one of the workers raises his hands

                         worker 1
               uhwe dont dig any more  were
               individuals

                         worker 2
               yeah  were too important to dig
               you taught us that z  you hate
               digging

                         z
                      at his wits end
               yeah but i hate drowning more  nowdig

                         weaver
               you heard the ant  dig

     the workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves
     passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the
     dry ground

      but they seems to be making little headway against the
     water as it continues to rush in

     the ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to
     this   as the moat gets deeper the pile grows higher and
     higherweaver is digging up huge chunks of earthnearby
     azteca is digging like crazy tooz runs around directing
     traffic and encouraging the workers

                         z
               thats it  pass the dirt back to the
               center  go on

     nearby the queen stands there looking squeamish

                         z
               your highnesstime to get your
               hands dirty

     gingerly the queen reaches out for a clod of dirtand
     passes it along  next thing you know shes practicallycrushedby a huge load thrown up by weaver

     the water keeps rushing inbut now we notice that

     the pile of dirt in the middle of the island created by
     the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher
     reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber

     and the water is getting swallowed up by the moat
     swirling around angrily

     now z looks up and sees that with a little more effort they
     can reach the top 

                         z
               we need to form a scaffolding around
               this mound  lets do it

     the workers start to cluster around the mound covering it
     forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up
     towards the ceiling

                         z
               nowclimb

     the ants start to scale the scaffolding up towards the top
     of the chamberits a swarming mass of ants hauling each
     other up giving each other legs up climbing ever and ever
     higher towards the top

     where they start to dig through the very ceiling

     as at the bottom of the mound z starts to organize the
     hauling away of the queen as though she were a big cargo
     container

                         z
               okay boys  take her up

     z slaps the queen on the butt and shes winched away on a
     cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those
     plastic toy monkeys

     ext ant mound  day

     and aztecas head pokes through the groundshe hauls
     herself up and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground
     widening the hole

     int town center  day

     the water is risingbut almost all of the ants have
     escapedz clambers up the mound as the scaffolding of ants
     rolls up from the bottom

     and the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of
     the structure  as z hauls himself through the hole in the
     ceiling

     the entire structure collapses into the angry waters below
     which seem furious to have missed their prey

     ext ant mound  day

                         worker
               he did it  z  z  z  z  z

     the z cheer goes up with everyone joining in  but the
     jubilation is shortlived for appearing on the ridge
     surrounding the workers is formicas army circling the mass
     of workers backing them in towards the roiling water behind
     them  formica himself appears in the front lines with
     carpenter and mandible at his side

                         formica
               z  i should have known  all that
               work all that preparation come to
               nothing  all because of one stinking
               ant

     he steps forward to address the surrounded trapped workers

                         formica
               alright  which one of you is z

     the workers trembling but silent cower inside the unbroken
     circle of soldiers

                         formica
               what are you deaf  i asked you
               wheres z

     formica laughs shaking his head

                         formica
               folks you may have survived that
               flood but theresno wayyoure
               gonna escape fromme  ill make you
               a deal  hand over the rebel leader
               z and you survive

     this sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers

                         formica
               but if you dont hand him over
               youreallgoing to die each and
               every singleindividual one of
               you

     the workers all look at each other

                         formica
               what shall it be workers

     the workers remain frightened but silent  z trembles
     terrified

                         formica
               have it your way

     as formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack a
     lone figure steps out from the crowd

                         z
               wait

     z stands there shivering with fear

                         z
               im z

     for a moment z stands alone under the glare of formicas
     gaze

     then another figure steps out from the throng of workers

                         weaver
               noimz

     z turns astonished to see weaver still and unwavering
     bravely risking his life for his friend  then azteca also
     steps forward

                         aztecaimz

     next bala comes forward

                         bala
               noimz

     more and more ants step forward

                         workers
               im z  im z  im z and so is my
               brother  ive been z for weeks now

                         queen
                      regallyweare z

     now the workers are all shouting the same declaration

                         all
               i am z  i am z  i am z

     z is plainly flabbergasted  formica is outraged  he gives
     the signal

                         formica
               attack

     the army swells forward on all sides pushing the workers
     towards the swirling water  some workers surround the queen
     to protect her  all seems lost when the fly from insectopia
     alights on the rim of the horizon

                         fly
               hey guys

     the wasp appears on the other side of the horizon

                         wasp
               its them

     suddenly on all sides a massive insect army appears on the
     ridge looking not unlike ambushing indians in a john ford
     film  formicas soldiers stop in their tracks awed by the
     unfolding spectacle  it looks like all of insectopia has
     turned out spiders caterpillars rhinoceros beetles all
     manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up and
     now surround the army dwarfing them

                         wasp
               are these hooligans giving you
               trouble z

                         fly
               say the word z and we kick their
               butts

     the ant army remains frozen unsure of what to do next
     formica is furious  if ants had veins formicas would be
     bulging out of his face

                         formica
               what are you doing  attack
                      berating his army
               come on you yellowbellies
                      turning on carpenter
               dont just stand there carpenter
               make an example of yourself

                         carpenter
               uh actually weareoutnumbered
               sir

     formica turns towards the insects gathered against him  with
     his chin raised pridefully formica steps forward and
     charges z

                         formica
               ahhhhhhh

     formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet
     blows off his head  zs eyes get big he stumbles backwards
     slipping and formica goes flying over him toward the
     whirlpool behind  he scrabbles at the edge of the water and
     then tumbles over

     for a moment it looks as if hes gone

                         formica os
               helphelp me

     z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over  formica
     is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created
     which are roiling not far below  he looks up into zs eyes
     a new expression crossing his features fear

                         formica
               pleaseii cant swimhelp me

     formica goes under for a bit then his head comes up again 
     but hes not going to be able to stay afloat for long

     suddenly he sees a line dropped down  above z looks down on
     him

                         z
               i thought you said that the life of
               one ant doesnt matter

     formica looks at the lineand in that moment seems to
     realize his error

                         formica
               i guess it doesto the ant

     formica reaches up and takes the line and is pulled up by z
     and a bunch of other ants the line we see extends from a
     nearby spider one of the cavalry from insectopia

     formica is left broken and alone by the precipice while
     hordes of ants surround z to congratulate him  bala fights
     her way to his side and the two of them embrace  then the
     ants pick up z and bala and cheering bear them away

     only carpenter stays behind  he walks up to formica
     carrying his dented and dusty helmet  he cleans it the best
     he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen
     general

                         carpenter
               sir if its any consolation i still
               think youre completely worthless as
               an individual

                                              fade to

     close up of z

     as he addresses the audience standup style

                         z
               so uh thats pretty much it  just
               your basic simple worker overthrows
               the government and winds up with the
               princess kind of a story
               you know there was the big parade
               and everything

                                              cut to

     int town center  day

     a huge assembly of ants applauds as z who is given a medal by
     the queen

     general formicas face looking extremely dispeptic

                         z vo
               general formica was almost
               unemployable  he eventually got a
               gig as a honeydew keg

     pull back to reveal formica clinging to a wall his belly
     hideously distended with honeydew

                         z vo
               the queen asked me to take over his
               job but i said sorry but im
               really not the general type  im
               more the specific type  so they
               gave the job to weaver instead

                                              cut to

     weaver in formicas old office in a generals uniform his
     feet up on formicas desk smoking a cigar  carpenter is on
     his hands and knees scrubbing the floor

               weaver cut the defense budget in
               half  now we only have an army of
               five million

     cut back to

     z addressing the audience

                         z
               and me i guess you could say that i
               lived happily ever after

     bala enters the frame embraces and kisses him

                         z

     we pull back to reveal

     int zs house  day

     z and bala stand in the midst of their living room up to
     their knees in thousands of child ants  the children cover
     every horizontal surface  they run around cry laugh and
     tease each other  z looks around the room looks back at us
     and shrugs

                         z
               well so nothings perfect  but you
               know  i wouldnt change a thing

     the camera pulls upand away from the groundto reveal
     that this whole story has been taking place in a small area
     of central park  we pull back and back and see all the
     familiar landmarks from the story the bike path the
     drinking fountain etc  we tilt up into the new york
     skyline  big musical flourish

     fade out
