int arcade world  electronic darkness

we dont know if its night or day  its just black

and maybemaybe intermittent sparks racing by  so quick we barely
perceive them  like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed

breathing

slow and hollow filling up the entire world  its eerie as hell  a
feeling of utter loneliness

and now the breathing recedes fading into the darkness  whatever it
wasits gone now

main credits roll

we hear cellos  four of them  weaving an intricate melody

and now the visuals  brightly colored shapes spinning in  equally
intricate matching the music  they grow and flourish like flowers
opening up in time lapse photography

fractals

is what theyre called  the visual manifestation of geometric formulas
the mandelbrot set  the julia set  each mathematic form made up of
progressively smaller forms and on into infinity

glorious and beautiful  forms folding in upon themselves and
regenerating

this is creation were witnessing

this is life in the making

							dissolve to

int counselors office  day

an eye

for a brief moment we still hear the cellos  and in the eye the last of
the fractals are spinning away leaving us with the iris  a nice blue
one  this is alex mannings eye

				alex vo
		time  thats all i ever think about
		anymore  its like theres never enough of
		it you know

								cut to

int  manning house hallway  day

this is a flashback in case youre wondering  well continue to hear
alexs voice as we move through the house in slow motion  everything is
very bright and dreamlike

right now were moving with the camera slowly moving down a long hallway
at the end of the hallway is an open door

we stop at the doorway  were afraid to go in

				alex vo
		its strange  when the futures in front
		of you it seems to go on forever  i mean
		you never really get there  its always
		one step ahead of you  its like theres
		no present theres no now  as soon as
		you think im here the moments already
		gone  either everythings in the future
		or its in the past
			beat
		theres no now

				man vo
		so where are you then

				alex vo
		im in the past

we move through the doorway

int  manning house bedroom  day

everything looks normal at first  a typical bedroom with sunlight
streaming in through the windows  a bed madeup flowers in vases
everything looks perfect

then we move further in and over to the right  theres something on the
floor curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom  halfway in halfway
out

its a womans body  shes wearing a dress her legs awkwardly bent  we
cant see her face from this angle but in her limp hand is a gun  and
all around that hand speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroom
and the carpeting beyond is blood

a shrill bell shatters the moment

								cut to

int  counselors office  day

the bell continues  its a school bell signaling the end of the period

on alex

as we see her for the first time startled  shes seventeen and pretty
though in a simple way  her eyes are the most striking  deep  intense
if alex has a problem its the fact that she thinks too much and its
reflected in her eyes

across from her is mr weaver a highschool guidance counselor and that
was his voice we heard with alexs hes unexceptional middleaged
incapable of really hearing what alex has to say  this is his office
were in typical say no to drugs teen propaganda decorate the room
fun

as the bell dies we hear the army of footsteps outside students milling
in the halls

alex glances at the door and starts to rise from her chair

				mr weaver
		we dont have to stop now

				alex
			cutting him off
		thats okay  ive got a test coming up
		anyway  gotta study

				mr weaver
			sighs
		i have to tell you im a little concerned
		about you alex  its been three months
		now since your mother uh

				alex
			offering fixing him with
			a stare
		killed herself

mr weaver stops more than a little uncomfortable

				mr weaver
			reluctant
		yes  now your father

				alex
		hes a basket case  youve talked to him
		you know that  he might as well be dead
		too

alex glances down at the floor anything to avoid looking at the
counselor  she heaves a backpack onto to shoulder

				alex
			continuing
		look mr weaver i dont even know why i
		came here  i fine  really
			looking up
		its like i said  its just part of the
		past now  it doesnt matter anymore

she turns and before mr weaver can respond shes out the door

int  highschool hallway  day

alex moves quickly through the mass of students wiping the remnants of
halftears on her coat sleeve

								cut to

int  highschool cafeteria  day

funtime  total chaos  if youve been to highschool you know the riff
bad food teenage melodrama and a squadron of supervisors trying to keep
a lid on things

alex

makes her way to the far corner of the cafeteria where a cluster of kids
lounge around a table  these are alexs friends  and while none of them
are your garden variety pocketprotectortype nerds these kids arent
exactly part of the incrowd  theyre a little off  quirky  all of
them come from screwed up families and thats what bonds them  they are

greg holliston  alexs boyfriend  hopeful artist not bad either and
kind of punk looking  greg and the others are big fans of thriftshop
clothing  because they dont have the money they improvise

nick drake  gregs best friend and future computer pioneer  hes
attractive and hes got an edge  a bit of a hotshot  genius in the
making

benz and stilts  inseparable  benz is flunking out of school and would
like nothing better than to spend the rest of his life reading comic
books  hes tall perpetually unkempt awkward and nervous  stilts
contrary to his nickname is quite short and never without his skateboard
stilts is constantly hitting on

laurie  the sixth member of the group  a teen theda bara and as cynical
as you can get  shes whats affectionately known as an art chick

the boys in the group particularly nick and stilts are avid
skateboarders and are frequently seen with their boards  stilts is always
leafing through an issue of thrasher magazine

right now the group is in the midst of an argument  nick has a pocket
video game in his hands which he casually plays  he can get through these
games in his sleep  it beeps and whirs

				nick
			to benz
		youre an idiot you know that whatre you
		going to do when you get out of here

				benz
		i was thinking about writing for one of
		those filipino mail order brides

stilts and greg burst into laughter

				stilts
		i think i saw that on the home shopping
		network  the girlfriend hour right after
		auto accessories

				benz
			giggling
		exactly

				laurie
		you guys are sick

alex flops down in a chair and everyone turns

				greg
		so howd it go

alex shrugs trying to make light of it

				alex
		he thinks im sublimating

				stilts
		what the hell does that mean

				laurie
		it means shes screwed up

				stilts
		fucked up  thats what they said i was

				benz
		you are fucked up

				stilts
		yeah but only because i want to be

				greg
		would you guys knock it off

greg turns back to alex and looks her in the eye

				greg
			continuing
		listen to me alex  these counselors
		dont know anything  theyre full of shit
		if you dont fit the pattern of the perfect
		kid they freak

				alex
			nodding
		i know

				greg
		so tell me youre okay then

				alex
		im okay

				greg
			smiles
		good   cause id freak if you werent


greg leans over and kisses alex  the rest of the group launches into
exaggerated groans with benz and stilts fluttering their eyes and making
smooching faces at each other  the kiss is over and everyone laughs

things are okay now

				greg
			to alex
		heywatch this

greg pulls an old polaroid camera from his backpack  he leans in close to
her and holds the camera at arms length aiming it back at them  flash
and the moments captured forever

greg pulls the polaroid out and peels off the backing before the picture
even develops he begins rubbing his fingers over it manipulating the
emulsion

				nick
			engrossed in his game
			again
		you making another one greg

				greg
		sure  practice

				benz
		lemme see

greg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to benz
the papers are color xeroxes of polaroid blowups  greg has messed with
them creating swirling psychedelic patterns with the images  stilts and
laurie lean in

				stilts
		cool

				greg
			still working
		see when the emulsions still warm you can
		move it around
			stops
		there

greg holds up the polaroid for alex to see

polaroid

greg and alex are side by side grinningall around them the world has
spun into strange colors  its an odd effect

greg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it

				greg
		safe keeping

meanwhile nicks pocket video game emits an explosion noise

				nick
		shit  im out

he sets the game down dejected

				benz
		you guys going to dantes after school

				greg
		i dont know

				benz
		check it out

benz pulls a flyer from inside his coat  its an ad for a new game called
arcade featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of a
circuit board  the tag at the bottom reads coming this fall  reality
will never be the same

				nick
			excited
		thats the new slipstream game those guys
		are good  its supposed to be interactive
		graphics are unbelievable

				benz
		yeah  they were handing these out at
		dantes  test marketing it or something
		gonna have a demonstration today

				stilts
		cool

				laurie
		can you say anything but cool

				stilts
		of course i can  i can say all sorts of
		things

				greg
			annoyed

benz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again

				benz

greg turns to alex

				greg

		try the game out maybe get some dinner

				alex

				greg
		sure  never come back  disappear forever

				laurie
			nodding

alex laughs  laurie took the words right out of her mouth

ext  dantes inferno  day

the inferno is a rundown video arcade near the beach notable because the
games it sports are generally defective and out of date  nevertheless
its become our groups hangout  it has its charms

a huge mural chipped and faded with age adorns the front of the
arcadesomething straight out of hieronymus bosch demons in dayglo
the yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance

alex and the others

pull up across the street caravan style  greg and alex are in one
caran ancient buick skylark  no honda accords or vw rabbits for this
group

at the moment theres quite a bit of activity at the infernos entrance
kids are clustered around and slipstream employees are passing out arcade
promo sheets

the group

heads for the entrance plowing their way through the crowd  stilts and
benz have their skateboards jumping up onto the curb with them then
popping them up into their arms

int  dantes inferno  day

inside the inferno is a mishmash of video games ancient carnival props
and old horror movie posters  dusty creepy under the right circumstances
and filled with leering faces  in short any kids bedroom taken to a
horrific extreme  at dantes inferno theyve got the latest games side
by side with chestnuts like pacman

the group

makes their way inside joining a cluster of kids in the center of the
inferno  and there it is

arcade

it looks out of place in the midst of the inferno  shiny black
hightech and almost selfcontained like some sort of spaceage vertical
coffin  laseretched graphics on the sides bear the arcade logo and the
same strange frightening face

alex and her friends are suitably impressed most notably nick and benz

				benz
		check it out

				stilts
		definitely cool

nick is silent letting his eyes explore the machine  he turns to greg
and grins

				nick
		super computers microprocessors thats
		the future were looking at

another kid deloach pushes his way to the front of the group  his
fighting a losing battle against acne

				deloach
			looking around
		so how come theyre previewing it in this
		shithole

				stilts
		if you werent such a dick youd know what
		a cool place this was

				deloach
		gimme a break they got fucking space
		invaders here  thats shits for retards

				stilts
		soare you trying to say im retarded
		is that what youre implying

				deloach
		no but since im standing here im
		noticing that youre an ugly little fuck
		and youre making me sick

thats it for stilts  he launches himself at deloach catching him off
guard and knocking him to the floor

nick alex and greg are on them in a minute trying to extract the two
from each other

a large man

pushes his way towards them and effortlessly scoops both boys up wrapping
a beefy hand around the scruffs of their necks  this is finster the
proprietorenormous bald and always irritable

				finster
			shaking them
		cut it out

his face contorts and he spits as he speaks  nice guy alex steps
forward always the voice of reason

				alex
		its okay mr finster

				finster
		no its not
			to the boys
		you guys are shits and im throwing you out

				deloach
			acting tough
		your place sucks  who gives a shit about
		arcade anyway

				voice os
			booming metallic
		what did you say

everyone turns  the voice came from

arcade

its up and running now  the inside panel emits an eerie green light
from speakers inside the compartment we can here breathingthe same
breathing we heard earlier coming from a machine like this its creepy
as hell

even finster is impressed  he releases the boys and stares at the
machine

				laurie
			a whisper
		jesus

				another voice os
		not bad huh

a man steps out from behind the arcade machine  he grins happily dressed
to kill sporting a slipstream id tag this is difford pr man for
slipstream

				difford
		hi kids
			nods
		mr finster

the arcade machine continues to breathe inhale exhale the eyes in the
face are glowing now in unison with the breathing

difford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod

				difford
			smooth as silk
		were glad you people could make it and
		were anxious to have you try out our new
		product  we think its going to be a big
		seller  but youre the people that make it
		happen  youre the market share everyones
		tearing each other apart to get at  its
		your opinion thats going to make or break
		us

				nick
		so whats so different about arcade you
		guysve been talking about it for months

difford turns to nick and salutes him

				difford
		a man after my own heart  straight to the
		point
			to everyone
		whats different about arcade is the way it
		reacts  it responds like a human does  it
		learns  it adapts each time you play it
		changes its strategy

				nick
		thats impossible

				difford
			taking the bait
		is it  why dont you see for your self

difford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter  he tosses
it at

nick

who snags it out of midair and grins

				greg
		go for it nick

difford steps aside and waves nick to the machine  the rest of the kids
crowd around

arcade

isnt just your typical video game  first of all there are three
screensfront left and rightwhich provide a panoramic view while
playing  second the player wears data gloves which provide an actual
sensation of touch and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired
directly into the machine  the results give the user the feeling that
heshe has actually entered the video game universe

difford thinks he has a hit on his hands and his excitement shows

				difford
			indicating equipment
		the cybergloves are keyed into the games
		response mechanism  youll be able to pick
		things up inside the worldtools weapons
		 itll feel like theyre really in your
		hands

nick pulls on the gloves securing them with velcro straps

				difford
			continuing
		the goggles heighten the experience when
		we said reality will never be the same
		we werent kidding

difford places the goggles on nicks face  then he points to the control
board which features two joysticks and a large red button labeled
escape

				nick
			skeptical
		escape

				difford
		in case things get too intense  it
		automatically freezes the game gives you a
		breather  things can get pretty wild

				benz
			scoffing
		nick wont need it

				difford
		youre good eh

				nick
			grins
		the best

nick winks at alex and greg

				nick
			to difford
		so whats the scenario  am i saving a
		princess  fighting zombies

				difford
		it changes  there are eleven levels each
		one is a different layer of the arcade
		universe  the concept is youre entering
		the video game itself making your way
		across the circuit board to the logic core
		 arcades brain

				nick
		so how do i start

				difford
		the game will guide you

nick turns back to the machine and pops the quarter into the coin slot
he punches the start button on the top of one of the joysticks

immediately the screens come to life  darkness with shooting stars of
light racing back and forth

on screen

a threedimensional computergenerated face appears out of the darkness
spinning in from far away and coming to rest

				arcade
		i am arcade
			breathing
		you want to play games  you picked the
		wrong machine

the crowd of kids is suitably impressed  even alex is amused
so far so good

				arcade
		whats your name

				nick
		nick

				arcade
			almost contemptuous
		nick  kiss reality goodbye

suddenly

a lightbeam above the video screen illuminates nicks face

				laurie
			concerned
		whats it doing

				difford
		memorizing nicks features  watch

on screen

the face of arcade spins away and a computergenerated figure appears
complete with a pixelrendered version of nicks face

video nick

is dressed in futuristic armor with exaggerated cybergloves and a full
helmet on instead of goggles  he also wears elbow and knee pads and
carries a thrasher in his hands sort of a cross between a soupedup
skateboard and the silver surfers board  its his means of
transportation

the screen prints out  nick  enter the vortex

video nick

hops onto the thrasher  abruptly the world around him begins to spin and
video nick is shooting a curl a whirlpool of lightdown down faster
and faster until

boom  empty space and video nick is falling towards a circuit grid  its
the electronic universe rushing up to meet him

				arcade
		one word of advice nick  you spend too
		much time in one place and i send out the
		screamer  you dont want to be around when
		that happens
			laughs
		see you on the other side

on screen

video nick plummets from the sky like a meteor slamming into the ground
with an explosion of dust  the dust clears

video nick is standing on an eerie plain with strange reedlike plants
dotting the ground and mist coiling around everything  it looks like
earth and yetit doesnt

video nick

hops onto the thrasher and begins to move  and move it does  with a
whoop the arcade world is rushing past us the game has begun

on nicks face

as a smile gradually creeps across it  hes having the time of his life
gloved hands manipulating the joysticks like mad  from his reactions we
can tell that this is one of the most incredible things hes ever
experienced

the other kids

watch nick then the screen then nick again

				benz
		check it out

				greg
		come on nick

now everyone is laughing urging nick on  its like theyve all
discovered the most amazing toysomething thats going to turn their
world upset down

difford

is pleased as punch watching the kids reactions more than the game

on screen

images are rushing past at blinding speed lasers explosions and god
knows what

on nick

as sweat begins to trickle down his fast  his hands move faster and
faster in response to the game

the screen

nick

the screen and

bam  nick slams down the escape button and rips off his goggles  the
video image freezes

nick

hes practically hyperventilating sweat pouring down his face  he leans
over resting a hand on the control board and for a moment everyone is
silent  then

				greg
		nickyou okay

slowly nick lifts his head  hes now sporting a devilish grin

				nick
		you gotta try this thing

nick pulls off his cybergloves and holds them out for greg greg turns to
alex

				alex
		go for it

				greg
		hold my keys then

he hands her his keychain and takes the cybergloves from nick  greg pulls
them on then straps on the goggles

				greg
			to difford
		so how do i get back in

				difford
		just hit escape again

on screen

greg hits the button and immediately the image unfreezes once again
were on the thrasher board rushing across the plains

gregs face

as a smile slowly creeps across it

								cut to

int dantes inferno  later

at the front of the inferno difford and two slipstream helpers are
unpacking cardboard boxes  the kids have clustered around them
momentarily forgetting the arcade machine

difford pulls cut a handful of game cartridges as well as goggles which
dangle over his arm

				difford
		heres what were going to do  what im
		holding are the home versions of arcade
		the prototypes

this is met with an enthusiastic response from the kids

				difford
			continuing
		in a month or so were planning on releasing
		arcade in both versions but were still
		fine tuning and thats where you guys luck
		out  so what well do is have you register
		with us and then were going to loan these
		out to you for a week or so  the only thing
		you have to do in return is answer some
		marketing questions sound fair

the kids cant line up fast enough

our group

is right up front with nick and alex being the first two in line

difford winks at nick

				difford
		so what do you think

				nick
		sign me up

alex is glancing around now  she sees benz stilts and laurie but not
greg

				alex
		wheres greg

laurie jerks her thumb back at the arcade machine

				laurie
		hes still working on the game

and alex finds greg for a moment spotting him over the heads of the other
kids

on greg

his face is a mirror of nickssweat pouring down grinning from ear to
ear  its addictive as hell  sights and sounds rush past us on the three
screens racing at incredible speeds

and now from within the game we hear a strange sounda scream of
sorts halfway between a shriek and a sonic boom

				arcade
		times up friend

the shrieksonic boom reaches a nightmarish pitch and suddenly the screens
explode with light

at the front of the inferno

everyone turns in response  its as if someone set off a flashbulb

alex

pushes her way back through the kids making her way to the arcade
machine

arcade

greg is nowhere to be found  in fact the cybergloves and goggles are
dangling from the control board abandoned

alex turns to a nearby kid

				alex
		wheres greg

the kid shrugs

				kid
		dont know  i think i saw him walk out
		but im not sure

alex isnt listening anymore  shes staring at the floor of the arcade
machine

gregs polaroid

is on the floorthe photo of greg and alex which he manipulated

alex picks it up glancing around  she scans the faces of the crowd and
she doesnt see greg anywhere  she turns away

on screen

a video figure is lying on the computergenerated ground it sits up
brushing dust from itself and looks around it faces us  only the image
isnt of nick anymore  its video greg now

up front

alex has rejoined her friends  the four of them are now clutching arcade
home versions in their arms cybergloves and all  they look like kids on
christmas day

				alex
		has anyone seen greg

				stilts
		hes probably outside  you know how he is
		gets bored

				nick
		yeah outside

nick heads for the door with the rest of the group in tow

								cut to

ext dantes inferno  day

outside greg is still nowhere to be found  benz stilts and laurie have
piled into their car waiting for nick to take the wheel

nick and alex

are up by gregs skylark

				alex
		so where is he

				nick
		guess he took off  you have his keys
		right

alex holds them up and gives them a shake

				nick
		hmmm  he said you were going to have
		dinner

				alex
		yeah

				nick
		so take his car home  wait  im sure hes
		up to something

				alex
			cutting him off
		but he was playing the game  i mean you
		saw him

behind them

laurie reaches over the seat and honks nicks horn  laurie and the others
burst into laughter  stilts sets his skateboard on the street and rolls
it towards nick

back to nick and alex

nick stops the board with his foot and steps onto it balancing  he waves
to the others and turns back to alex

				nick
		its nothing okay  just take his car home
		hell show up

nick tousles alexs hair  he shakes his arcade cartridge at her

				nick
		dont worry about it

and with that nicks off rolling back to his car and leaping over the
door skateboard and all  laurie and the others are still screaming with
laughter

nick hits the ignition and guns the car pulling out with a dramatic
screech and sailing off down the street

on alex

clutching gregs car keys  she glances on the front seat where her own
arcade cartridge rests

the cartridge

has the same glowing eyes that were laseretched on the machine inside the
inferno

				alex
		fuckyou

								cut to

ext manning house  night

the manning place is your basic suburban ranch house totally
unexceptional  the lawn looks a little ragged and a pile of newspapers
frayed and yellowing have accumulated by the front door  inside the
house is dark lonely

alex

pulls up in gregs skylark scooping the arcade kit into her arms

								cut to

int  manning house  night

as alex enters the dark house we can hear whispers coming from further
within  its a little creepy but alex seems unconcerned

she negotiates her way through the darkened house on into the den

den  following through

dim flickering light illuminates the den casting long shadows across a
sleeping figure on the couch

this is alexs father jimhopelessly middleaged and getting older by
the moment  its the tv thats doing the whispering  cnn or something
from what little we can see of the rest of the house it looks like a
mess

alex bends down and jostles her fathers shoulder

				alex
		daddad

jim stirs though barely  he turns a sleepy face towards her looking
gray and lifeless

				jim
		yeah

				alex
		did greg call dad

jim shakes his head and sinks back into the couch

from alexs attitude its obvious that this scene has played itself out
many times before

				alex
		you should go to bed dad

jim waves a tired hand dismissing her

				jim
		am in bed

				alex
			standing back up
		yeah

she turns and grabs a comforter thats bunched up at the end of the couch
spreading it over her father

on the tv

were getting a desaturated view of carnagesome sort of war going on
in some faroff land

alex grabs the remote and flicks the tv off plunging the room into
darkness

								cut to

int  alexs room  night

static

latenight tv static filling up the entire screen

we pull back

revealing a televisionand further back until we see alex crouched
behind it in silhouette  shes fiddling with wires back there and

blink suddenly the slipstream logo appears on the tv screen with nifty
computer graphics  shes just hooked up the home version of arcade  alex
moves back to the front of the set

alexs room

is her haven a virtual library filled with books which she loses herself
in  theyre stacked everywhere

and puzzles too  halfassembled jigsaws  intricate things  an escher
print  the descendants of rubiks cube boxes within boxes  this is
alexs life what she retreats to

a photo

of alex and her mother sits by her bed neglected and collecting dust
well see her later

candles

or whats left of them have dripped and spread across her night table

alex

sits at the foot of her bed facing her television slowly she draws on
the cybergloves testing her fingers next she pulls on the goggles
instead of a control panel the home version has a control box complete
with joystick and a mini escape button

alex fingers the start button on top of the joystick

the screen

goes black black with intermittent sparks  and the breathing begins

arcades face

appears in the black a pinpoint at first spinning round and round and
growing larger  it comes to a rest eyes glowing

				arcade
			malevolent
		hello alex

alex jumps back dropping the control box  arcade continues to breathe

				alex
		how 

a thing beam of light shoots from the arcade terminal playing over alexs
face

				arcade
		kiss reality goodbye

on screen

arcades face spins away to be replaced by a pixelrendered image of
alex dressed in battle gear

video alex sets her thrasher on the ground and mounts it

				alex
			both frightened and
			fascinated
		wheres greg

and from the screen

				arcade
		in here of course

on screen

the vortex of light explodes around video alex twisting reality  and
alex is spinning round and round plummeting towards

the circuit grid

beneath her a world of geometric shapes and light and the words
 level one  flash across the screen and we

								cut to

ext level one the plains  day

alex slams into the ground splashing up water and smoke alike
we are inside arcade now experiencing what alex experiences

the plains 

in many respects it looks like earth  land water sky yet certain
things are off  small things like the color of light a sluggish
smokefilled red or the occasional flicker of lightning which races
beneath the cloud cover above

alex

pulls herself up from the muck brushing dirt and water from her face
she coughs totally disoriented  looks around

looks at herself  shes wearing

battle gear

this is the real thing as opposed to the cartoon version we saw nick
wearing when he played the game before  its a cross between a
skateboarders protective guardpads and fullblown armor  a helmet rests
on her head with a visor raised up

alex glances down and sees a thrasher board resting next to her  note
depending on the terrain of each level the thrasher board will adjust
itselfworking as a skateboard snowboard or hover board

on alexs right cyberglove

is an led display  in the upper lefthand corner it says level one  to
the right two pulsing bars of light labeled time elapsed and
strength

at this very moment the time elapsed bar is just shrinking away to
nothing

blink  now its gone

no rest for the weary

a shrieksonic boom

is immediately heard on the horizon and its the most godawful noise
weve ever heard  it fills up the world

alex

jerks her head up terrified

				alex

all around her the world begins to vibrate

something

is rushing towards her now at an unbelievable speed  the shrieksonic
boom is deafening  the world is shaking apart

and suddenly the thing is upon her

alex screams

								cut to

int  alexs room  night

alex flies back from the tv screen violently ripping the goggles and
cybergloves off  but the shriek is continuing and then she realizes
that

the phone is ringing

alex stops shaking  the phone continues to ring  shes back in her room
everythings fine  normal

she glances at the game

on screen

we see the black again black with sparks racing past benign

alex reaches over and picks up the phone all the while keeping her eyes
glued to the screen

				alex
			drymouthed
		hello

				nick os
			filtered
		hey kid

alex clutches the phone still shaking

				alex
		nick

				nick  os
			filtered
		have you played the game yet  its
		incredible  i was just

				alex
			cutting him off
		listen to me  greg never came home i think
		the game has something to do with it

				nick os

		what the hell are you talking about

alex continues to watch the television screen almost mesmerized by the
flickering sparks  her eyes begin to glaze over

				nick os
			filtered
		you there  hello

alex snaps out of it tearing her gaze from the screen

				alex
		i have to talk to you

				nick os
			filtered
		we are talking

				alex
		no in person  now

				nick os
			filtered
		its twelvethirty

				alex
		im coming over

alex quickly hangs up the phone and moves back to the television  she
reaches for the control box and hits the off switch

nothing happens  sparks continue to shoot across the screen

alex tries it again  same result

				alex
		shit

again and again she hits the button but nothing is happening

alex reaches behind the tv grabs hold of the electrical cords and
yanks

the fucking cord wont come out

and then she hears it an electronic whisper both seductive and horrific

				arcade
		alex

with all her might alex pulls on the cords pop  they fling out of the
tv and the screen goes dead

alex sits back against the wall for a moment catching her breath and
trying to calm the rising hysteria within her

				alex
			to herself
		okaydont think about it
			deep breath
		okay

alex stands up grabbing her coat off the bed

int  manning house living room  night

alex comes down the stairs heading for the front door only she stops for
a momentnoticing the light

on the couch

her father is once again bathed in the blue light of the television
static whispers the same as before are coming from the set

alex looks at her father  he hasnt moved  and yet the tv is on once
again

the screen

blue static  unexceptional  and a face  someone in the static

alex draws closer to the screen  she can hear something now other than
static whispers  sounds kind of like a voice

the screen

a definite ghostly face is there  it turns looks at alex us and its
greg

				greg
			on screen strange
		alex

alex jerks and snaps off the tv spooked as hell  she stands in the
darkness and all but runs out of the house

								cut to

ext  manning house  night

alex races to the skylark and fumbles with the keys finally she gets it
right guns the gas and rips out of the driveway

a streetlight

above is flickering wildly  sputtering humming casting strange shadows
across the street

								cut to

ext  nick drakes house  night

alex has climbed up to the roof using a wood pile stacked beside the
house as a boost  now she creeps towards a secondstory window

behind her on the street and this should be subtle folks another
streetlight is flickering

window

it looks in on nicks room  alex draws close and taps on the glass

nick appears immediately grinning like an idiot  he raises the window

				nick
		alex you dont know how long ive waited
		for this

				alex
		funny

alex climbs in

int  nicks room  night

the room is an intricate shrine to nicks obsessioncomputers and
computergenerated images  an entire wall is covered with a collage of
cutout pictures from magazines  on his shelves are miniature
armaturesflexible models of human musculature

and of course there is nicks computer setup

even as alex climbs down onto nicks bed she notices that his computer is
up and runningconnected to the arcade home version

				alex
		whats that

nick turns back to the computer monitor

fractals

as seen earlier are blossoming on the screen

				nick
		isnt it amazing  its a sort of rest
		position in the game when youre between
		levels

nick pulls alex closer  shes wary  but nick is suitably impressed
excited even

				nick
			continuing
		theyre fractals  visual representations
		of mathematic equations  the game is
		totally brilliant  i mean look at it
		its like a dna molecule or something

and in truth the fractals are beautiful

alex turns back to nick  and for the first time nick stops grinning
its clear that alex is upset

				alex
		something weirds happening

nick sits down on his bed

				nick
		what do you mean by weird

				alex
		greg never came home  a few hours is one
		thing nick but this is different
		somethings happened to him

alex glances at the computer monitor again  on the lower righthand side
is a little pulsing green light on and off on and off like a heartbeat

				alex
		can you turn off the game

				nick
		im in the middle of it

				alex
			upset
		turn if off

nick is taken aback but he rises and turns off the computer all the same

and this time the game stays off  nick comes back to the bed

				nick
		happy

				alex
		no
			frustrated
		look i know youre not going to believe me
		but listen anyway
			carefully
		i think the games alive somehow

the look on nicks face says it all  he moves to speak and she stops him

				alex
			continuing
		no wait  just listen  i hooked it up
		earlier tonight and it said my name  as
		soon as i turned it on nick  it said my
		name  how could it know  and then i
		asked it where greg was and it said in
		here

				nick
		alex i think youre freaking out gregs
		gone ill give you that  and maybe hes
		in trouble  but its not arcade thats
		doing it

				alex
			insistent
		it is

				nick
		how  its a machine alex machines
		dont think  theyre not alive  its a
		good program a brilliant program it was
		designed so it would act as if it were
		alive but its not alive

				alex
		so how did it know my name then

				nick
			shrugs
		you imagined it

alex is furious  she rises and begins pacing back and forth voice
growing louder  she draws in close

				alex
		see men always do this  quiet down
		honey  chill out  take a valium im not
		a fucking idiot nick
			screaming
		i did not imagine it

				nick
			a strained whisper
		quiet  i do have parents you know

alex spins around and points at the computer monitor

				alex
		there

the monitor

arcade is back on again fractals unfolding and green monitor light
blinking

on nick

okay  alright  this does throw him for a second

				alex
		it turned itself back on nick

				nick
		no it didnt  its just a faulty relay or
		something  it happens

nick crosses to the monitor and flips the off switch  he tries it again
and again but the game wont turn off

				alex
		its alive nick  its listening to us 

nick spins around angry maybe a little freaked out

				nick
		just shut up  enough already okay

silence for a moment  nick takes a deep breath  overreacted  after a
moment

				nick
		sorry  maybe i need the valium

				alex
		call the others  laurie benz

nick acquiesces  he pulls out his phone and punches in a number

				nick
		ill try stilts  hes got insomnia

nick and alex watch each other in silence as the connection is made  we
can faintly hear the phone ringing

no answer

				nick
		okaylaurie then

alex turns away sinking to nicks bed  all the anger has drained out of
her  she knows they wont reach them

on nick

as he listens for an answer  three rings four five he hangs up
punches in the final number

				nick
		benz

again  no answer

nick hangs up and sets the phone aside  he looks at alex

				alex
			fatalistic
		somethings happened to them

				nick
		its the middle of the night  theyre
		asleep  phone didnt wake them

				alex
		all of them

nick shrugs  hes not willing to accept anything but hes uncomfortable
all the same

				nick
		look why are you fucking with me like this

alex rises  shes tired  tired and scared

				alex
		because i didnt know where else to go

				nick
			glances at a clock
		its two oclock in the morning  go home
		go to sleep  well figure something out in
		the morning

and then more for himself than for her

				nick
			continuing
		its not this weird  itll make sense
		everything gets weird this late anyway
		right

				alex
			halfhearted
		sure

she turns and climbs back out the window onto the roof then she ducks her
head back in

				alex
		if i were you id think twice about playing
		that game again

then shes gone  nick moves over and watches

nicks pov

as alex drops down from the roof and makes her way to gregs car  the
streetlight outside is still flickering

nick turns back to his room  moves back to the monitor and watches the
fractals unfolding

he gives the off switch a token try  nothing

the fractals

we move in on them losing ourselves in the labyrinth of swirling colors
and we

moves down the aisles of books dwarfed by shelves which reach clear to
the ceiling  she looks a little haggard like she hasnt had any sleep
she turns

nick and stilts

are sitting at a study cubicle  nick looks equally tired but stilts is
jawing away

as alex joins them nick looks up

				alex

			to nick
		whats her problem

				alex
		did you play arcade last night

				stilts

alex nods glaring at nick  his reluctance to believe her is
understandable but the events unfolding are scaring him

				alex
		you want to hear something else nick i
		tried to call them this morninggreg
		benz laurie  their phones are out of
		order

alex reaches into her bag and pulls out a sheet of paper with names on it

				alex
			continuing
		and then i started thinkingabout everyone
		else that was at dantes yesterday  i drew
		up this list deloach those other jerks 
		their phones are out of order too

stilts starts humming the twilight zone theme

				nick
			annoyed
		so what do you want me to do

alex softens then reaches for nicks hand

				alex
		we have to find out whats happened to them
		i think theyre gone

				nick
		no way

				alex

stilts thinks nick and alex are involved in some sort of joke but hes
playing along grinning

nick follows alex to the front door and alex hits the buzzer

				alex
			to herself

alex tries the buzzer again  persistently

				alex
		shit

alex looks close to cracking  theres a desperation in her face

				alex
		this is like a movie or something  i mean

				nick
		it doesnt necessarily mean shes

				alex
			cutting him off
		lets go around back

before nick can stop her alex is running around to the back

ext  lauries house back porch  day

the backyard is in a sorry state with junk strewn everywhere  theres a
cannibalized car piles of scrap wood and a swingset thats hopelessly
rusted

alex winds her way to the back porch and a set of dusty glass doors  she
steps up and clears a spot to look through

				alex
			visibly relieved
		shes here

nick joins her at the window peering inside

their pov

they are looking into a cluttered living room dark except for the light
thats issuing from the television  the television faces away from us
but we can see laurie siting in front of it mesmerized

laurie

she looks like shit  wan with sunken eyes and mussed up hair  mascara
has run down her cheeks and even now tears are trickling from her eyes
yet despite this theres a dazed smile on her face  we cant hear her
but she seems to be talking to the television

alex

steps back a moment concerned

				alex
		it is the game

she taps on the window

				alex
		laurie

inside

laurie continues to watch the screen oblivious to the rest of the world

alex taps the harder using her fist now

				alex
			louder
		laurie

nick joins alex now and the two of them are banging on the glass
theres no way in hell laurie wouldnt be able to hear them

alex steps back from the window again panicking

				alex
		nick what do we do

alex looks around sees a twobyfour and snags it

				nick
			realizing
		no alex  alex wait a minute

alex swings the twobyfour like a club and smash  down comes the glass
in a shower

int lauries house living room  day

alex and nick enter and immediately sense that something is wrong

the light from the tv screen continues to flicker and a lowpitched
electric hum permeates the airthe sound a live wire might make  and
the hum seems to be mobile too coursing through the wallsup down and
around alex and nick

nicks eyes try to track the hum as it races overhead

				nick
			freaked
		what is it

and as nick speaks his breath escapes his mouth in a frosty plume of
mist  its cold in here too

laurie meanwhile has failed to notice alex and nicks arrival  alex and
nick step further in to get a view of the tv

static

fills the screen  static and strange whispervoices  its all
indistinct

				alex
			shaking laurie
		lauriewake up

lauries face is a mess  tears are running down but shes grinning all
the same  its frightening

				laurie
			voice distant
		i am awake
			grins wider
		dont you see them

				nick
		see what

laurie points to the tv screen

				laurie
		angels  there are angels inside

but we see only static

				alex
		we have to turn it off laurie  im turning
		it off

as alex reaches for the off knob a face coalesces out of the static
its greg again

				greg
			staticlaced
		alex  dont leave me here

				nick
		jesus christ

and on the screen

gregs face metamorphosizes into arcades

				arcade
			mocking greg electronic
		dont leave me here

and even as arcade speaks the voice seems to come from all around them
from the humming coursing through the walls

nick backs away from the screen petrified

				arcade
			seductive
		hi nick  ready to kiss reality goodbye

the humming around them has increased  laurie begins to shake

				alex
		change the channel

				nick
		what

alex snatches up the remote control and stabs the buttons

on screen

every single channel portrays the fractals recombining and growing

the screen flickers and arcades face appear again reestablishing
control

				nick
			angry scared
		who are you

				arcade
		god

the word reverberates through the room and humming has become a roar
around them  an electrical storm

outlets

around the room are crackling with energy spitting out sparks

				arcade
		come inside  i only want to play

alex drops the remote stunned

				alex
		oh god  hes in the cable system hes
		out of the game

nicks eyes find the cable wire extending from the wall and into the tv
sure enough sparks are crackling down that wire and into the wall

arcade laughs and its the most awful sound weve ever heard

laurie

is convulsing now and tiny sparks are racing around her eyes

alex sees her and screams clutching her hands to her ears in an attempt
to block out the deafening roar

nick

moves without thinking picking up a nearby chair and slamming it into the
television  it explodes glass sparks and smoke

the humming stops altogether quiet now  and then from everywhere at
once

				arcade
		see you on the other side

with a final roar the energy behind the walls whips around and around
then rushes away

outside

nick catches a quick glimpse of sparks racing across the telephone wires
suspended above the back yard

total silence for a moment  alex and nick are too stunned to speak  then
alex looks at laurie

laurie

lies on the ground unconscious  glass scattered all around her

				alex
		laurie

alex drops to her side trying to find a pulseanything

				nick
		is she breathing

alex nods

				nick
		then leave her

				alex
		we cant

				nick
		well call 911  look around alex  we broke
		in smashed the tv no ones going to
		believe what happened here

alex glances around  the room is a mess  all the outlet are singed  and
now she notices that everything electronictv clock thermostatall

				nick
			continuing
		i believe you now  i dont know what the

nick sets up his labtop inside the phone booth as alex watches  he hooks
up the modem to the phone receiver and turns the machine on

the small screen

warms up and in black and white we see the same fractals nick flips off
the laptop and sighs

				nick
		thats what i thought

				alex
		what

				nick
		its not just the cable system  its in
		the phone system as well the electronic
		net  its everywhere

				alex
		nick what is it

				nick
		maybe it is alive in a waysome sort of
		electronic intelligence  its like a
		computer virus that developed a personality
		or something  its selfreplicatingit
		mimics life

				alex
		like the fractals

nick nods  he grabs his skateboard out of the back seat and sits on the
curb spinning a wheel with his finger  he stares at the wheel a moment

				nick
		its growing  getting stronger maybe its
		only localized now

				alex
			catching his drift
		but then it hits the relay stations

				nick
		right  and then communication satellites
		and then anywhere

alex looks up into the sky despite herself

alex stalks off a few paces  thinking  thinking

				alex
		slipstream

				nick
		what

				alex
		they made arcade  its still a game
		right  it thinks like a game  maybe it
		still has to play by the rules someone had
		to program it in the first place didnt
		they

at this nick perks up

				nick
		you mean we learn the rules

				alex
		and beat it at its own game

				nick
		you realize that in order to do that wed

the slipstream compound comprises a cluster of mirrored
antisepticlooking buildings  carefully maintained greens surround the
compound dotted with perfectly positioned trees  the whole effect
greenery included seems prefabricated and sterile  we move with the
camera sweeping in and dropping low across the main concourse and up the
stone steps to the main lobby

int slipstream lobby  day

alex and nick are moving across the lobby  nick is still carrying his
skateboard  the two of them look extremely out of place being that the
rest of the people bustling around them are dressed for success

their pov

as they approach a prefab receptionist sitting behind and enormous desk
the guys smile is so perfect he mustve had it tattooed on  he wears one
of those obnoxious phoneheadsets

				receptionist
		may i help you

		we need to see mr difford

				receptionist

		no but its important and if youd

		im sorry but if you dont have an

nick reaches across the desk and snags the receptionist by his shirt
jerking him forward

				nick
			menacing
		if diffords not out here it one minute
		were calling the news and informing them
		that your fucking games are whispering in
		our ears and telling us to commit suicide
		im talking public relations nightmare
		here buddy  satanism virgin sacrifices
		backward messages the whole bit

the receptionist glances at alex who puts on a stern face and nods

nick releases his grip  the receptionist smooths out his shirt and
smiles

				receptionist
		one moment please
			punches in extension
		rachel would you be kind enough to tell
		mr difford that we have a situation in the
		lobby which requires his immediate attention
			beat
		thankyou

the receptionist clasps his hands together and looks back up

				receptionist
			continuing
		mr difford will be right with you

				alex
		why thankyou

alex and nick move away from the reception desk having caused quite a
scene  the rest of the visitors watch them with curiosity

				alex
		virgin sacrifices

				nick
			shrugs
		drives em crazy every time

nick casts his eyes over the walls where graphics from various slipstream
games are displayed  he stops on one display in particular a triptych of
sorts featuring the haunting face of arcade

bing

alex and nick turn at the sound just in time to see difford exiting an
elevator and briskly making his way towards them

				difford
		nick alex how are we today

				alex
		howd you know it was us

				difford
		security camera
			points to one
		pulled your files before i came down be

difford laughs and claps nick on the back

				difford
			continuing
		now what seems to be the problem

				alex
		its the game arcade

				difford
		you dont like it

				nick
		thats gotta be the understatement of the
		century  its killing people

beat  difford looks from alex to nick and back again his smile fades
from his face

				difford
		if this is a joke im not laughing

difford closes the doors behind him  he stares and alex and nick for a
moment assessing calculating risks

				difford
		talk to me

				alex
		theres something wrong with arcade the

at this difford breaks into a smile  nick sees this and acts quickly to
save the situation

				nick
		what alex is trying to say is that it
		seems like its alive

				alex
		no im not

				nick
			freezing her with a
			stare
		were not getting very far into the levels
		and we kind of thought maybe we could talk
		to a programmer learn some tricks and
		stuff
			beat
		i mean you dont want us kids running
		around school saying your games too hard
		right

				difford
			relieved
		thats what this is all about tricks
		sure id be happy to introduce you to

alex has caught on  she shuts up for the moment

				difford
			continuing
		tell you what ill take you down to our

int  research and development  day

hardly what youd expect  the lab is hopelessly cluttered as if a
whirlwind had swept inside and thrown everything helterskelter  difford
leads nick and alex inside

a man sets in front of a stack on monitors  one his head is a helmetlike
instrumentsort of an extension of the stereoscopic goggles  he wears a
labcoat and a slipstream id badge but aside from that his appearance
is unkempt  kind of your 60s dropout look

				difford
		this is one of our newest projects were
		trying to get rid of joysticks
		altogether 

				nick
			nodding
		the airforce is working on the same thing

				man
			to screen
		come on come on

he moves his head this way and that

the monitors

a computeranimated turtle is crawling across the screen then the words
times up flash over  the turtle flips onto its back and dies tongue
hanging out

				man
		shit

				difford
			clearing his throat
		albert

albert turns around in his seat and pulls off the helmet

				difford
			continuing
		this is nick and alex  theyd like to talk
		to you about arcade  maybe you can give
		them a few programmers secrets

				albert
		yeah sure

				difford
			to nick and alex
		then i leave you in capable hands

difford exits  nick points to the helmet in alberts hands

				nick
		does that thing work

				albert
		getting there  its more sensitive than a
		joystick  your videocharacter can respond
		as fast as you can
			standing
		but what can i do for you

				alex
		were having some problems with arcade

				albert
		yeah who isnt

				nick
		what do you mean

				albert
		its a tough game  hard to pin that bastard
		down  keeps on changing the rules

				alex
		we vere thinking there might be tricks
		you know surprises that youd worked into
		the game

				albert
		sure  every games got em  ill start
		with the schematics  i can print these up
		if you want

albert moves back to the wall of monitors then reaches for a computer
disk and inserts it into a nearby drive  he taps a few buttons and
bingo

schematics

of each worldlevel within the arcade game appear on the monitors

				albert
		youve got your ten levels right here
		they are  each level has an exit only
		remember the exits arent always what they
		seem
			points to each one
		first ones the blood red sky then youve
		got the blue desert tower of ghosts
		kingdom of the blind  on each world you
		have to find a golden key and youve only
		got so much time to do it in  if youre
		too late the screamer comes

				nick
		how do you stop the screamer

				albert
		you cant  he gets you and youre dead
		its like time catching up with you you
		know  like fate  each level you get
		progressively less time to complete  first
		half of the game takes place in the wild
		lands  then you reach level 6 and thats
		the sea of darkness  theres a twoheaded
		boatman thatll take you across if you
		answer his riddle right  if you dont

he motions cutting a knife across his throat

				nick
		whats the riddle

				albert
		if i tell you then its no fun

				nick
			harder
		just tell me the fucking riddle

				albert
		wellit involves a paradox  you have to
		trick the boatman

albert hits some keys again and levels one through six disappear  now
theyre replaced by seven through ten only instead of a schematic for
level eleven theres only a question matc

				albert
			continuing
		the next half of the game takes place in
		arcades brain the city of truth its
		urban scenarios lots of metal and concrete
		screamer comes faster here  on level four
		you can get a free life if you wait until
		the last possible second before exiting that
		world  gotta time it right though

				alex
		whats the question mark

				albert
		level ten  thats where youve got to
		unlock arcades heart using the keys youve
		found

				alex
		how do you do that

				albert
		good question  see thats where the fun
		comes in  arcade changes it every time
		hes a machine without a soul once you give
		him a soul he stops being a threat

alex looks dejected

				alex
		but how can it change every time

				albert
		its the games logic core  we actually
		patterned it after human brainwaves  i
		mean theres a personality in there
		thats what makes it so incredible

				nick
		how the hell did you do that

				albert
		well were veering into classified info
		here but ill tell you that it involved a
		donor  he was dead of course so its not
		like anything unethical was happening

at this a chill runs down alexs spine

				alex
		dead

				albert
		well braindead anyway  coma patient
		its really not all that important

				alex
		maybe hes not dead

				albert
		he

				alex
		the donor  maybe hes alive inside the
		game

				albert
			laughs
		and maybe youve been taking too many drugs

nick glances at the helmet again

				nick
		could you play arcade with that

				albert
		well technically yes but this is only
		the prototype

nick nods and smiles offering his hand

				nick
		thanks albert  think you could print up
		those schematics

				albert
		sure

albert moves back to the computer console  meanwhile nick pulls alex
aside

				nick
			quietly
		go outside get your car and meet me out
		front with the engine running and make it
		quick okay

				alex
		what are you going to do

				nick
		get that helmet  if were going to play
		arcade i want every advantage possible

across the lab

albert is oblivious to their conversation

alex backs towards the lab doors turns and opens them

								cut to

int slipstream hallway  day

alex makes her way quickly down the hall turning a corner and passing a
security guard  she waves at him her smile fading as soon as shes
passed

								cut to

int rd lab  day

albert is just pulling the last printed copy of the schematics from a
laser printer  he turns and hands them to nick

				albert
		here you go  happy hunting

nick takes the schematics and tucks them inside his jacket

				nick
		thanks again

and with that nick pulls back his fist and punches albert square in the
face

albert goes down more stunned than hurt and nick springs into action
he scoops up the cyberhelmet in his free hand kicks open the doors and
tosses his skateboard into the hallway

int slipstream hallway  day

nick leaps on the board and starts pumping his foot like a bandit picking
up speed like mad

hes racing down the hallway maneuvering between startled employees  and
here comes a man with a mail cart

whoosh  nick zips by him  and now an alarm is ringing

				nick
		shit

int another hallway  day

nick comes screeching around the corner narrowly missing a collision with
two security guards

				guard 1
		thats him

but nicks already past them  he puts his foot down again pushing for
more momentum

the guards

are after him now charging down the hallway

up ahead

a set of double doors labeled emergency exit blocks his way

nick spins out sweeping the back of the board forward and screams to a
stop just before the doors  he kicks the board up into his free hand
and

wham  he hits the doors running  now the fire alarm is blaring in
addition to the other alarm  a voice is squawking over the pa and its
a hell of a racket

				voice
			on pa
		security breach in rd  subject heading
		towards eastern exit

int stairwell  day

nick is charging down the stairs four and a time  one level two
now hes reached ground floor

int ground floor hallway  day

boom  nick tumbles out of the stairwell only to see a trio of guards
heading straight for him

nick drops his board to the ground and heads right pumping his foot

one of the guards leaps at him and

misses by a foot or so crashing to the tile floor

nick

screeches to another stop twists and starts pumping down another
hallway

int loading area  day

nick plows into the loading area like a bullet whipping around stacks of
boxes and lumbering forklifts  a few workers attempt to stop him but
hes moving too fast

ahead

is a loading dock raised four feet from the ground to accommodate semis
nicks heading for it  the loading door is open and outside is freedom

just then

the steel loading door begins to grind and lower  some genius has hit the
controls

nick

pumps like mad and hes really moving now  either hell make it or hes
going to hit that steel door at about forty miles and hour

the door

is quickly closing off nicks escape route  hes only got about four feet
to negotiate

nick ducks low and clears it

ext loading dock  day

nick rockets off the loading dock through the air and down hitting the
concrete driveway  the driveway peels off to the left and slopes
downward

nick hangs tight hugs the curve and picks up more speed

below

the driveway splits off  to the left slipstreams main building and to
the right the parking lot

guards

are piled into an electric cart speeding up from the left to cut nick
off  its going to be close

nick forks off to the right dust before they reach him

its clear sailing now and up ahead nick can see alex pulling up to the
end of the driveway

whoosh  nick scrapes the board forward grinding the wheels sideways in
order to slow his speed

he leaps picking the board up with him and dunks himself smackdab in
the back seat of the skylark

alex

guns the engine and tears away in a cloud of exhaust

ext country road  day

nick is in the back seat laughing  the sun is beginning its descent and
the sky is taking on a reddish tint

				nick
		jesus christ

				alex
		i cant believe you made it

nick climbs into the front seat next to alex and for a second hes
pretty close to her  he kisses her on the cheekcaught up in the
moment  then he sinks back catching his breath

				alex
		you got the schematics

				nick
		everything

neither one speaks for a moment as the mood dampens once again  driving
wind whipping alexs hair around  she stares at the road ahead

				alex
		so where do we play the game nick

nick doesnt answer at first  for a second there hed managed to forget
everything

				nick
		ive been thinking about that
			beat
		arcades like a virus so it seems like the
		place to hit him would be where the virus
		started  you know like his point of origin

				alex
			grim
		dantes inferno

				nick
		yeah
			deep breath
		the inferno

overhead

as we watch alexs skylark speed away from us  shadows are creeping
across the landscape now  streetlights are flickering sputtering on

and night is falling

							dissolve to

ext dantes inferno  night

sweeping down from the sky we follow the skylark  as alex and nick near
the inferno streetlights blink off in succession progressive darkness
working its way towards their destination

dantes inferno

we move past the painted walls the various demons illuminated by
moonlight

alex and nick rush to the front door  its gated  inside the inferno is
totally dark  shadows

				alex
		the windows are barred
			thinking
		theres a skylight  we can get in through
		the roof

								cut to

ext  dantes inferno roof  night

alex and nick creep over the roof and sure enough theres a skylight in
the center caked with grime

nick stands and plants his foot through the skylight  it shatters
raining down glass into the darkness below

nick pulls off his belt and hooks it around one of the iron sash bars
gripping the belt he lowers himself down after a moment he disappears
from view

alex leans over the skylight  she cant see a thing

				alex
		nick
			beat
		nick

for the longest moment theres no response  then

				nick os
			from below
		okay your turn

alex climbs over and grasps the belt tightly lowering herself down into
the inferno

int  dantes inferno  night

alex dangles from the skylight a good eight feet from the floor

				alex
			warily
		are you there

her pov

the inferno is a world of threatening shapes and shadows and nick is
nowhere to be seen

alex steels herself and drops to the floor

she stands a bit shaky and cautiously moves around a cluster of video
games

nick

is standing on the other side staring at a game screen which pulses with
a dim light

alex approaches putting a hand on his shoulder  he turns

				nick
		alex

				alex
		you didnt hear me

nick shakes his head  alex leans forward to see what hes looking at

on the screen

fractals are unfolding  its mesmerizing

				alex
		stop looking at it

nick shuts his eyes pulling away from the screen  he shakes his head
trying to clear his thoughts

				nick
		shitits like a trance or something
			breathes
		okay  im fine  really

its at that moment that nick and alex hear the voices

video screens

all around them flicker on staticlaced images fading in they are the
faces of their friendsgreg laurie and many others  all those that
have disappeared  the voices fade in and out merging with one another
tinged with the same mechanical edge of arcades voice

				voices
			eerie
		nickalexsave us

				alex
			horrified
		oh god

nick grabs alex and pulls her into the canter of the room

				nick
		put it out of your head alex  its just
		trying to psyche us out

despite nicks words we can tell that the voices are having a
disheartening effect on him

the arcade

prototype stands in front of them now and surprisingly the machine is
not on  the eyes in the leering black face are quite dead

around alex and nick the faces of their friends continue to fade in and
out casting the whole room in a strange shimmering blue light

nick moves to the back of the machine and opens the access panel
revealing the internal circuitry  he pulls a small penlight from his
pocket and flips it on

				alex
		what are you looking for

				nick
		a way to hook this helmet into the game
		im sure there are interfaces

nicks pov

and indeed there are  parallel interfaces where you might hook a printer
cable into a computer  nick takes the cable from the cyberhelmet and
secures it into one of the interfaces

				nick
		there  now were wired in

he stands and moves around front pressing the start button of the game

nothing happens

he presses it again  nothing

				alex
		is the game plugged in

nick checks  it is

				nick
			frustrated
		i dont understand  it wants us to play
		the game  its been taunting us 

				alex
		put in a quarter

				nick
		it can turn itself on alex  it doesnt
		need a quarter

				alex
		yes it does  dont you see  we have to
		play by the rules  thats what it wants

nick rifles through his pockets  he doesnt have a quarter  neither does
alex

				nick
		change machine

nick moves over to the change machine and picks up a nearby chair  he
smashes the chair into the face of the machine again and again
obliterating the lock  nick opens the front of the machine and tears out
the coin box spilling quarters all over the floor  he grabs a handful
and returns

				nick
		there

he shoves one in arcades coinslot and pulls on the cybergloves

				alex
		two players nick  you need to put in
		another quarter

nick straps the goggles over his eyes

				nick
		youre not coming alex

				alex
		yes i am

				nick
			snapping
		i know how to do this  im good at these
		games  you never play youd be nailed in
		an instant

				alex
		and what if something happens to you am i
		suppose to go in after you alone

				nick
		no  if youre smart you run like hell

alex grabs a second quarter and shoves it in the coin slot

				alex
		im going

nick stares at her a moment then nods tiredly  she reaches for the
second pair of cybergloves and pulls them on

				nick
		you dont get it do you

				alex
			strapping on goggles
		what

				nick
		i dont want anything to happen to you  i
		care about you

				alex
		i already have a boyfriend nick

				nick
		i know
			beat
		it sucks

the two of them stand there a moment looking at one another  after a
moment nick laughs tiredly

				nick
		what can i say
			pulls on the cyberhelmet
		tough being a hero isnt it

nick reaches out for the joystick and hits the start button

				nick
			grim
		here goes nothing

as before the screen comes to life  darkness and sparks then we hear
the breathing

arcades face

spins into view grinning at alex and nick

				arcade
		nick  alex  i missed you so much all
		your friends are here

				alex
		fuckyou

				arcade
		any time

				alex
		we know what you are

				arcade
		a heartless monster of course
			incredibly evil
		oh save me alex save me from myself

arcade laughs and its not a sound youd want to hear twice

the lightbeam

clicks on playing over their faces and analyzing their features

on screen

arcades face spins away and computergenerated versions of alex and nick
appear  as before they are suited up in video game armor each carrying
a thrasher board

				arcade
		kiss reality goodbye

the video versions of nick and alex hop onto their thrasher boards and the
world around them curls in upon itself

the process is similar to what weve seen before but even more extreme
lights and sounds are pouring out of the arcade machine in almost
unbearable intensities  it seems as if the real world is going to be
shaken apart

				nick
			over noise
		hold on

				arcade
		see you on the other side

another flash of light and

alex and nick disappear from the real world completely their equipment
gloves and goggles fall to the floor empty  theyve been physically
sucked inside the game

the light from the screen dies down now and everything is oddly quiet

on screen

boom  suddenly a circuit grid is rushing up to meet them

note  as we move through each level video legends will appear on the
screen as title cards enhancing the effect that we are actually inside a
video game

the words level one  blood red sky flash across the screen and we

								cut to

ext  level one the plains  day

alex and nick slam into the ground like twin meteors splashing up water
and muck

the red sky

crackles with lightning  smoke obscures everything alex and nick pull
themselves up a bit dazed

				alex
			looking around
		you feel it  its different this time

				nick
		were actually inside arent we

alex nods

				nick
		okay
			deep breath
		give us a kiss

				alex
			after a moment
		one  in case

				nick
		dont even say it

nick leans over and gently kisses alex on the lips  its over in a
moment but hell savor it the rest of his life

				nick
		thanks  always wanted to do that

				alex
		yeah well i figure these are unusual
		circumstances

				nick
			grins
		thats what i was hoping youd say

nick flips the visor on his helmet down and checks the digital readout on
his cyberglove  when he speaks his voice is filtered through a radio
headset  nick looks good in his armor tough  hell they both do

				nick
		ill take the lead and handle the physical
		threats  you watch the elapsed time and
		look for exits

				alex
		got it

nick tosses his thrasher board down and it hovers above the water  he
steps onto it comfortable  alex does the same shes a little shaky but
she maintains her balance

				nick
		you steer by pivoting your back foot
			he demonstrates
		okay

nick turns looking around  the land seems identical in every direction

				nick
		which way do you think level two is

				alex
		youve got the schematics check

nick panics for a moment patting his uniform checking pockets  he cant
find them

				nick
		oh shit  what if they didnt come with us

he stops  reaches into a pocket and pulls out the schematics  breathes
a sigh of relief

				nick
			looking at them
		okay  its west

				alex
		the keys are supposed to be at the end of
		each level  once we get all the keys we
		can unlock arcades heart and then

she looks at nick uncertain

				nick
		and then we go to the final level
			off her look
		hey dont worry about it  its a game
		how bad could it be

alex glances at her wrist display  the elapsed time bar is made up of
ten blocks of light stacked upon each other the top block has
disappeared  one tenth of their time is gone

				alex
		the clocks already ticking

				nick
		right then

nick leans forward and the board starts to float  alex does the same and
in seconds theyre gliding over the plains

from above

as we see their forms disappear in the smoke

							dissolve to

ext level one plains  later

nick and alex pull to a stop

a doorway

stands in the plains seemingly leading to nowhere  nick reaches out and
opens it  its just plains and empty space beyond

but hanging from the top of the doorway is a golden key

				alex
		there

she reaches up and pulls it down

				nick
		i dont get it  this is supposed to be the
		end of the level but it doesnt go anywhere

alex puts her hand through the doorway and her hand disappears

				alex
		it only looks like it leads to nowhere

nick glances at his wrist display

				nick
		and weve still got time left  this was a
		piece of cake

				alex
		yeah thats what worries me

she steps through the doorway and disappears  nick follows

we hold on the empty doorway  hold for a moment and then

we hear a distant highpitched ringing  its grating seeping inside our
brains and mucking around in there  on the horizon there is a quick flash
of light

something is coming

								cut to

the words level two  deadlands

ext  level two salt flats  day

alex and nick are cruising along salt flats  sporadic pools of water and
strange roaring sounds in the mist  so far so good nick glances at his
wrist display  his strength only has a few blocks left

				nick
		hey my strengths low  look out for
		fireflies

				alex
		there

she points north  a small ball of light is streaking across the sky just
above the watery plains

alex and nick swerve towards it gaining ground  as they near it nick
swings out his hand scooping the firefly up as soon as he touches it it
bursts like a bubble

				nick
		shit

				alex
		check your readout

nick does  his strength is back to normal again

				nick
		youre right  it worked

nick and alex slow their boards to a stop stepping off them

				alex
			pointing
		theres another

she sweeps left and scoops the second firefly out of the sky  off in the
distance we can hear that ringing again just at the edge of our vision
alex and nick dont hear it yet

nick is glancing down at his schematic of level two

				nick
		according to this the doorway should be
		somewhere around here

their pov

the salt flats have gradually diminished replaced by more and more water
ahead of them theres no longer anything solid to stand onjust water
muck and strange reeds poking through the mist

alexs wrist display begins to beep  she glances down

wrist display

only one block of time remains and its pulsing on and off the ringing is
a little louder now

				alex
			worried
		our times up

				nick
		what  theres nothing here

				alex
		look around

the two of them stumble through the water not even sure of what theyre
looking for

				nick
			starting to panic
		i dont see the doorway

alex and nicks wrist displays are beeping like crazy now the beeps come
closer and closer until they meld into one piercing highpitched tone

just then

the ringing turns into the shrieksonic boom of the screamer  a burst of
light on the horizon shatters the sky

				nick
		what the fuck is that

				alex
		screamer

alex

plunges into the marshlike water waisthigh and its then that she sees
a glow emanating from beneath the water she dives forward

beneath the surface of the brackish water

alex swims towards the glow  ahead of her the depths drop off sharply
perhaps some hundred feet or so

her pov

she can just make out a doorwaydown down down

the surface

alex bursts up from the water gulping in breaths of air nick is nearby

the world

is beginning is vibrate now heralding the screamer  the shriek is
unbearable

				alex
		nick  its beneath the water  we have to
		swim

nick stumbles in up to his neck  he can see the glow now too

				nick
			incredulous
		we cant reach that

				alex
			over the noise
		we dont have a choice

alex dives beneath the surface again

nick glances back towards the horizon and gets one fleeting glimpse of

the screamer

a nightmare creation rocketing in from the east thats it for nick  he
dives terrified

underwater

nick follows alex into the shadowy depths  he swims madly but the glow
seems impossibly far away  even under water the apocalyptic sound of the
screamer can be heard

nick

peddles his arms and legs furiously  down down down

he knows that theyll never have enough air to make it back to the
surface

the glow

is more clearly distinguished now  its a doorway  and set in its side
is a golden key  alex reaches it  she grabs the key and turns to see how
far behind nick is

nick

doubles his efforts but his lungs are straining

the screamer

has plunged into the water above shooting towards nick like a torpedo a
swirling jetstream of bubbles trailing around it

nick panics and what little air he has left escapes him

alex is reaching for nick

nick is blacking out one last lunge at the doorway

the screamer is there now  no time

the words level three  the blue desert flash across the screen and
we

								cut to

ext  level three desert  day

alex and nick fall from the sky onto the dunes  they lie there a moment
gasping for breath  theyre an odd sight two people soaked from head to
toe dropped in the middle of a bonedry desert

and a blue one at that  theres an eerie stillness about this level
even the clouds above are frozen nothing lives here now and nothing ever
will

nick coughs sucking in air

alex rises halfway pulling up her visor  she stares at the golden key
which she clutches in her hand  her wet hair hangs about her face in
strings and she shivers

				nick
			looking at the key
		so thats what we almost died for

				alex
		one of them anyway
			beat
		did you see it  the screamer

				nick
			looking away
		i dont want to talk about it

nick glances at his wrist display

display

even as he watches the first of the ten time elapsed blocks blinks
away

				nick
			exhausted
		christno time

				alex
			rising
		there never is

nick heaves himself up into a standing position and looks around  they
are on the top of a massive dune

their thrasher boards

now looks like snowboards  it doesnt take nick long to figure out what
to do

				nick
		we can take the dunes down like a ski slope
		pretend youre on a snowboard

				alex
			snapping down her visor
		never been on a snowboard

nick steps on the board and edges it over the crest of the dune  he
begins to slide down slowly picking up speed

a series of shots

as alex and nick negotiate the dunes  they glide over the sand
gracefully cutting back left and right to keep their speed down sweeping
in wide arcs

under any other circumstances theyd be having the time of their lives
alex has adjusted to the environment quickly at ease of the
thrasherboard

later 

the dunes gradually level out  alex and nick slow to a stop
alex flips up her visor  her face is covered with grime now hardened

				alex
		i guess were walking from here on out

they pick up their boards and walk

							dissolve to

ext  level three desert  later

alex and nick have been walking for a long time  nick is silent just
staring straight ahead at the endless sand he looks wasted  zoned out
his face is beaded with sweat

once again their wrist displays begin to beep

				alex
			almost a whisper
		times up

nick starts to laugh sinking to his knees

				nick
		were fucked  thats it

alex pulls on nicks arm forcing him to his feet

				alex
		get up nick

nick isnt going anywhere fast  alex tries to drag him forward but she
slips in the sand

				alex
		get up

and then from off in the distance

				voice os
			far away
		alexhelp me

alex turns  she focuses on the horizon and sees a tiny speck  she taps a
control on her helmet and her view is magnified

alexs pov

benz is up ahead buried up to his waist in the blue sand and sinking
quickly  he waves his hands for help and clutched in one of them is the
second key

				alex
		its benz

alex breaks into a run and after a moment nick follows hes walking
thoughin no hurry to reach benz

on benz

the desert is swallowing him up  only his head and arms remain  hes in
a state of total panic

				benz
			terrified
		get me out of here  oh god

alex

is running at top speed halfstumbling across the dunes her
wristdisplay is beeping furiously

benz

his head starts to disappear beneath the sand and his cries are choked
off

				alex
		benz

alex reaches the spot and now only benz clutched fist remains  the hand
opens and the gold key falls onto the sand

alex dives for benz hand but it sinks just before she can reach it  she
screams and claws at the sand trying to find him  she digs and digs but
all she finds is more sand  with each second she becomes more frantic

finally alex stops noticing the key and idly picking it up

the sand

around alex erupts and bones come flying up into the air benz bones

alex screams  the bones rain down around her in bloody fragments  its
as if the earth has chewed benz up and spit out the nasty bits

at that very moment the beeps on her wristdisplay meld into the single
tone heralding

the screamer

as if on cue it enters level two breaking the sound barrier

on nick

as he stands some hundred feet away oblivious to everything  we can hear
alex screaming but the sound is muffled distant  nick is staring down
at his feet at an area where the sand has hardened like glass  inside the
sandglass nick can make out fractals  he smiles

the screamer

streaks across the sky towards them blowing up a maelstrom of sand as it
crosses the dunes

on alex

as she sees that a rabbit hole of sorts has been created where the bones
were ejected  actually not a rabbit hole but a circular pulsing mouth
with razor sharp teeth  alex realizes much to her horror that this is
the doorway to level three

alex shouts at nick trying to break the spell over him

				alex
		run  run

but the screamer is bearing down on him like a heatseeking missile

on nick

as he watches the fractals  arcades face appears in the mirrored sand
smiling back at him

				arcade
		goodbye nick

at the last possible moment nick seems to wake from his trance  he sees
alex hears her then turns  he has about one fearwrought second to
realize that the screamer has reached him when

wham

the screamer slams into nick at about 200 miles per hour nick literally
liquefies  the human body is 95 water and nick explodes like a water
balloon on high impact blood spraying in a fine mist across the dunes
alex and everything for a good fifty yards

alex is frozen with terror  you remember your worst childhood nightmare
monster  the one youd see in your room at night as your brain cooked
with fever  too paralyzed to call out for mom  well thats the screamer

the screamer

stands where nick used to be a red mess on the blue sand now  black as
night  like living roiling lava smoking charged red eyes  one third
demon one third balrog and one third rotting corpse  clad in chains and
samurai armor clinking as it moves  it rear back its head opens a
fanged mouth and lets loose a roar designed to shake the stars from the
sky

then it focuses its eyes on alex  and it charges

alex

unfreezes  shes got seconds to make up her mind the doorwaymouth or
the screamer  its really no choice at all  alex turns and dives
straight down into the pulsing mouth

the jaws of the rabbit hole snap shut around her  darkness consumes
everything

these words appear on screen level three  tower of ghosts

								cut to

ext  level four volcano  day

we are looking at a steep cliff face composed of black volcanic rock
this world is desaturated gray and harsh the rocks looks sharp as
razors

as we will discover the cliff face is also composed of skulls old and
blackened set inside the rock

we hear a humming and alex fades in appearing on the side of the cliff
face  immediately she starts to fall realizes where she is and hugs the
cliff for dear life rock shards crumble away beneath her feet  alex
looks down 

big mistake

she hugs the cliff face tighter tears and grime streaking her face shes
alone now and she knows it  she looks up 

its a long way to go

alex reaches a hand upward  ouch  the rocks hot  she jerks her hand
back and almost loses her perch

her hand

her gloves are smoking and singed

alex starts to cry freely now  she reaches inside her chestplate
fumbling and pulls something out

its the polaroid of her and greg  but then the wind catches it and tears
it from her hand

the polaroid

twists downward round and round into infinity

alex stares after it a moment  then she lets out a tired little laugh and
starts to climb

a series of dissolves

as alex climbs sometimes using a skull itself as a hand or foothold

we see her time elapsed blocks blinking away

time running out and more climbing  then

ext  level four volcano rim  day

alex stands on the rim of the volcano  at her feet is a golden key  and
before her a big drop

alexs wrist display

her final block of time disappears  the beeping starts

alex doesnt even pause  she steps off the rim into empty space

and just as shes about to fall a doorway of light appears in the air
alex falls through it vanishing

level five  kingdom of the blind

								cut to

ext  level five arctic wastes  day

snow whips across a world of white in wraithlike sheets we move in on
one particular bank

something is buried there  the wind gradually blows the snow away
uncovering

alex

she rises from the snow bank disoriented  everything is impossibly
bright blinding  alex stands  she draws up her hand to shade her eyes
and we

							dissolve to

	a flash of nick

				nicks voice vo
		i know how to do this  im good at these
		games  you never play youd get nailed in
		a second

	and a flash of nicks horrified face at the screamer reaches
	him

	alexs face grim and determined

ext  level five arctic wastes  later

alex glides to a stop even as her wrist display starts to beep  this time
a wooden doorway is standing directly in front of her the golden key
sticking out of the lock

as alex reaches for it the screamer enters level four alex slowly opens
the door

				alberts voice vo
		you can get a free life on level four but
		you have to wait for the last possible
		instant

alex turns and waits calmly for the screamer

the screamer

is a black speck on the horizon then a bullet then a nightmarish face
bearing down on her

its jaws

flare open to engulf her

alex doesnt flinch at all  and at the last possible second before
impact

blink  a stylized figure appears on her wristdisplay next to the time
elapsed meter  beneath the figure it says free life

alex feels the breath of the screamer on her face and falls back through
the doorway

level six  shock corridor

								cut to

int  level six shock corridor  night

alex steps out of a doorway into a long narrow hallway the hallway is
mirrored on one side  it has no doors or windows and up ahead it
branches off to the right and the left

alex turns and looks behind her  the doorway she came through is gone
now  a mirrored wall stands in its place with her own reflection staring
back at her

the reflection

there are subtle changes  they shouldnt be noticeable at first but the
reflection seems somehow more threatening

alex starts down the hall her reflection keeping pace with her  up
ahead she hears a buzzing noise drawing closer

light flickers in the hallway to the left presumably whatever it is
thats buzzing  suddenly a streak of light running along the floor
turns the corner and heads down the hallway towards alex

the light hits her feet and sparks fly  alex screams and is thrown back
against the wall shocked  the streak of light continues past her and
disappears into the mirror at the halls end  its like a moving
electrical pulse

alex

shes been given a pretty good jolt  her hands shake for a moment an
afterseizure of sorts and she stands

her mirrored reflection

is watching her arms crossed  this wouldnt be a problem were it not for
the fact that alex currently doesnt have her arms crossed

				alex
			to her reflection
		fuck you

the reflection grins and itsher eyes glow with fractals

				alex reflection
			in arcades voice
		any time bitch

spooked alex continues down the hallway reaching the end and turning
left

new corridor

alex moves quicker now glancing left as her reflection follows

buzzzzz  here comes another streak of light rushing in along the floor
from a side corridor

alex leaps over it and it passes harmlessly under her now shes getting
the hang of it  she starts forward again

buzzzzz  here come two at a time from opposite directions

alex has to jump left to avoid the first streak and lands directly in the
path of the second  then she jumps back to the right again

the two streaks

pass by zipping away from each other

another corridor

the pace quickens with alex racing down the corridors she turns corner
after corner  its become a virtual maze

we cut back to alexs strength and time elapsed meters again and
again  both are shrinking away to nothing

and all the while her reflection keeps pace with her growing
increasingly more nightmarish in appearance  as alex tires the
reflection seems to gain more strength

buzzzzz  buzzzzz  the streaks are shooting towards her with more
frequency and now theyre racing along the walls too  alex is jumping
left and right with sparks exploding around her

the reflection

seems to be metamorphosizing  each time we see ither she looks a little
different  whats gradually happening as time elapses is that alexs
reflection is turning into the screamer

alex moves with increasing urgency as the streaks converge on her  the
corridors are filled with a constant buzzing and flickering of light
sparks fly and alex is shocked over and over

she stumbles falls to the floor and rolls to the right just missing a
streak  it cuts past her face centimeters away

beep  beep  beep  off goes her wrist display  alex is up and running
now desperate

we cut faster and faster  alex running the streaks of light the
reflection until

end corridor

shes back where she started  and the corridor deadends in a mirrored
wall

behind alex

dozens of light streaks are dogging her heels literally just behind her
theyre so thick that she couldnt possibly leap over all of them
seconds before they reach her

ahead of alex

the mirror shows her own reflection rushing closer  her wrist display
indicates that time is up with a prolonged beep and her own reflection
vanishes  its the screamer in her reflections place  only its
rocketing towards her in the mirror  its in front of her this time
instead of behind her

rock and a fucking hard place  light streaks or screamers

its really no choice at all  her guts says screamer

alex leaps and smashes into the mirror at full speed  the world is filled
with shattering glass and a shower of infinite reflections and then we

								cut to

ext  level seven pier  day

the sound of shattering glass carried through as alex explodes out of the
sky  and its the sky itself that seems to be shattering

title reads level seven  sea of darkness

alex

continues her fall  she lands hard  no blue desert sand to cushion her
here  it takes her a moment to rise

alex is on a slatboard pier extending out into a sea of black water  the
shore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier  storms
clouds have gathered above and if youve seen a storm blowing in on the
open sea you know what it looks like

the and of the world  a strange and scary yellowgreen sky presses
down on us  its a hurricane sky  the calm before the storm

on the horizon

two cities can be seen  technocityscapes angular and metalliclooking
towers jutting up from the sea like knives

at the end of the piers

are two boats  standing in them are two palefaced cloaked figures
like charon the boatman on the river styx

somewhere off in the distance the ringing can be distinctly heard now
but alex is preoccupied now  as she moves down the pier recognition
dawns on her

its laurie and stilts  they are dressed completely in black hair
slicked back and eyes empty  whitefaced gothic harlequins  each is
holding a wooden staff staring into space

				alex
		guys  oh my god

alex rushes forward excited but as she sees their faces excitement
fades  a chill wind picks up and the sea laps at the pier like a
metronome lulling the world into stillness

				alex
			unsure
		laurie  stilts

neither of them acknowledges alex with their eyes

				stilts
			like arcade
		you may ask one of us a question
		one tells the truth and the other lies
		who you ask remains your discretion
		but if the answer is wrong
		the questioner dies

laurie motions to the technocities behind her

				laurie
			like arcade
		one of these cities is the place you seek
		the teller of truths will take you there
		but the city of lies is dark and bleak
		and death is certain if you enter beware

				stilts
		i am the liar  where should i take you

				laurie
		i am the truth teller  where should i take
		you

alex stares at them a moment utterly confused  the sky above darkens
and the wind picks up  she looks to the horizon from one city to
another then back at her friends

				alex
			horrified
		what did he do to you

				laurie
		is that your question

				alex
			realizing
		wait  no  thats not it

beep beep beep  alex doesnt even need to look at her wrist display
anymore  she begins to pace on the end of the pier nervously glancing at
the horizon  and yes theres the flash followed by the shrieksonic
boom

				alex
			to herself
		think  i want to go to the city of truth
		and the truth teller is from therebut
		which one is which  the liarthink

				laurie
		you have no time  what is your question

				alex
			snapping back
		im thinking

				laurie
		you have no time

the screamer

is visible now arms opening to engulf alex  talk about pressure

				alex
			she stops pacing
		the liartruth tellerliarliar

alex rushes over to stilts

				alex
		liar  did you come from the city on the
		left or the city on the right

				stilts
			pointing
		i came from the city on the left

				alex
			grins
		but you always lie so you didnt come from
		there  that means the city on the left must
		be the city of truth

the screamer

has reached the pier now rocketing over the wooden slats and shaking the
entire structure

alex turns to laurie

				alex
			quickly
		take me to the city on the left

laurie nods and steps aside making room for alex to climb into the boat
she does and

the screamer

dissipates just before it reaches alex  it turns into mist and vanishes
the howl lingering as an echo long after the screamer itself has gone

at once the boat begins to glide through the water away from the pier
alex gets a last glimpse of stilts standing in his boat diminishing as
alex and laurie move away from him  he looks like the loneliest person in
the world

level eight  city of truth

ext level seven open sea  later

as alex and laurie near the city its features become more apparent  it
is truly a necropolis black and angular its a shadow on the sunset
horizon empty of all life and looming above them

just then alex hears a tiny voice

				voice
			weak
		helphelp me

a small figure

bobs in the water about fifty yards in front of them  it waves its hands
frantically sinking below the waters surface then rising once again
its a little boy

alexs boat is going to pass right by the boy  she grabs hold of the
gunwale and reaches out for him

				alex
		grab my hand

their hands lock and alex yanks the boy out of the water as the boat
cruises by

the boy

cant be more than seven or eight  small and fraillooking he shivers in
her arms

				boy
			terrified
		where are we

just then the boat comes to a crashing stop slamming into the black rocks
which the city rests on  alex and the boy are violently pitched forward
and out of the boat

they land roughly on a beach of black gravel  alex turns

laurie

stands in the boat  in an instant night has fallen  she is a silhouette
in the moonlight

				laurie
			in a voice like death
		the city of truth

and laurie literally fades before their eyes  in her place is a small
golden key

alex snatches up the key  alex turns back to the boy and

int level eight concrete wasteland  night

alex and the boy are now standing on the top of a concrete incline  it
extends downward into a system of tunnels and viaducts  the ringing
starts immediately followed by the flash on the horizon  times already
up the little boy reaches for alexs hand frightened

				alex
		how did you get here  did you play the
		game

				boy
		yes

				alex
		thought so

alex removes pulls her thrasher board from her back and drops it on the
lip of the incline  theres a flash and the board has changes into a
motorcycle  a sleek black one

				alex
		can you hang onto my back

the little boy nods  he knows that alex is his only chance of getting out
of here  nevertheless we can tell that hes terrified  alex kneels down
next to him  the wind around them has picked up and the ringing
increases  highpitched stabbing into our brains

				alex
			over noise
		theres a monster here  we have to kill it
		before we can leave  thats what we have
		to do  i know its scary but i wont let
		anything happen to you  okay

the boy nods again

				boy
		then well go home

				alex
		then well go home

alexs wrist display starts beeping andboom  the ringing is replaced
by the screamers shriek  in the distance the screamer is a fireball
spiraling towards the city

alex jumps on the motorcycle and pulls the boy up  he crawls behind her
and hugs her back tightly

				alex
			pulling down her visor
		here goes everything

she fingers the throttle and the cycle roars to life  it rockets off the
incline and down into the tunnels

a series of shots

as alex maneuvers the cycle through a forest of concrete its a harrowing
ride as her headlight reveals little of whats up ahead  somewhere above
the tunnels the screamer has arrived  in the course of the chase its
shriek will become louder and louder as it draws closer locating alex

another cycle

appears out of side tunnels and a chase is on  the rider is dressed in
black with glowing deaths head masks

				boy
			to alex
		dark riders  if they touch us were dead

the tunnels get narrower and narrower as alex keeps pushing the limit off
the bike

rider 1 tries to cut alex off charging forward and ramming her bike

alex almost loses it but finds balance once again sweeping left and up
the side of a circular tunnel

rider 1

bites it  his cycle careens into the wall and explodes in a shower of
green light  the deaths head tumbles away spinning end over end  the
screamer blasts over the remains of the rider having entered the tunnels

two more riders appears

gaining on alex  rider 2 pulls a staff from his back and thrusts it
forward like a lance  chink  the staff hits alexs rear wheel nearly
throwing her  the rider pulls off a gloved and reaches a glowing
skeletal hand towards them  death touch  the boy screams in terror

up ahead

a wall is rushing to meet them  alex jams the breaks and slidesskids
sideways cutting right at the last possible moment

wham  rider 2 slams into the end wall not able to negotiate the turn
another explosion of green and the second deaths head comes tumbling
away

alex looks back  there should be one rider left only now their are
three  alex guns the bike and cuts sharply to the right

new tunnel 

alex screeches to a stop having found yet another fork the tunnel
branches off into two directions  two neon signs with arrows point in
opposite directions

neon signs

they read this way and that way alex checks her wrist display  not
much time left

				alex
		which way

				boy
			pointing
		that way

alex backs up the cycle and heads down the tunnel marked this way
instead

				alex
		sorry

the tunnel

it narrows almost immediately  alex hears a roar glances behind her and
sees four deaths head riders on her tail she makes another turn

ahead

is a crumbling brick wall with the words wrong way painted in bloodred

				boy
			screaming
		its the wrong way

				alex
			over the noise
		in this world wrong is right

suddenly

the tunnel behind them flares with light shaking like an earthquake  the
screamer has found them

a key

hangs out from the wall sort of like the brass ring on a merrygoround
alex snags it as she sweeps by

the screamer

rockets around the corner twisting down the narrow tunnel

alex grinds the motorcycle forward for all its worth and the screamer is
literally breathing down her neck  she turns corner after corner faster
and faster scraping the bike into the scumcovered walls and shooting out
showers of sparks  if she takes one second too long to negotiate a turn
pauses for even an instant the screamer will be on them

a clawed hand

lashes out and tears away the cycles tailpipe  another hand takes out a
chunk of the seat

the boy

is wailing curling low to avoid the screamers claws

ahead

the tunnel narrows to a deadend  alex and the screamer are on a
collision course  a hundred miles an hour and gaining

the screamer lashes out again gouging a bloody gash in alexs shoulder
and cutting clear through her armor  its claws sink into her flesh
latching on  alex cries out in pain her face contorted into a mask of
agony and fear she pulls out a knife with her left hand a stabs blindly
into the monster

the screamer

lurches forward onto the motorcycle and opens its jaws wide  black saliva
and ooze flow from its mouth splashing over alexs shoulders and neck
its going to bite her head off  its going to

alex and the screamer slam into the deadend and a spectacular fireball of
green light consumes the screen

level nine  the ghetto of greed

								cut to

ext level nine crumbling hong kong ghetto  night

were on a dark crowded street lined by decrepit tenements which are
caving in upon themselves

there is a flash of green light  alex and the boy suddenly appear on the
street in a whirlwind of papers sans motorcycle but still sliding
forward at a good thirty miles an hour  were it not for their armor
theyd be torn to shreds  they skid to a stop under a sputtering
streetlight

alex and the boy are still screaming  anguish is the word for alex  she
clutches her shoulder which is gushing blood and stumbles to her feet

beep beep beep beep beep

its her fucking wrist display again and timeisfuckingup

alex screams pushed to the absolute breaking point

boom  once again the streets begin to vibrate as the screamer enters the
level

				boy
		its here

				alex
			manic
		oh godoh god

the streets 

impoverished people bustle back and forth everywhere alex grabs the boys
hand and all but drags him down the darkened streets  it becomes a mad
blind dash through hell  she smashes into peddlers stalls tripping over
or knocking down everything in her path

the shrieksonic boom of the screamer overwhelms everything else  with
each level its gotten louder and louder wind is tearing down the
streets

a blackclad figure

spins out of the shadows landing in front of them  its a ninja two
swords spinning in its hands

instinctively alex reaches to her side and sure enough theres a gun
there now  she unholsters it and fires in a blind panic

blam  down goes the ninja 1 spouting blood from its chest

thwunk  thwunk  two throwing stars imbed themselves into alexs
chestplate

and jesusfuckingchrist ninjas are crawling out of the woodwork
they dive out of the shadows weapons spinning and glistening in the
moonlight  throwing stars are flying like hail now clinking into the
concrete walls behind alex and the boy

				alex
		shit

alex

spins around shooting indiscriminately into the crowd of bodies  blam
blam  blam  ninjas fall right and left but in no time twice as many
move in to take their place theyre like the hornets nest of alien
monsters blackclad shadows creeping towards them

a shot hits the streetlight above casting a sputtering strobing light
over the whole scene and adding to the chaos

the world is shaking apart  its the end of everything its flashes of
light and noise nightmares and blood chaos heaped on chaos

alex fires her gun again and again and again

and in the midst of this mess here comes the screamer again  it
shoots down the street like a guided missile

alex stumbles  the boy drags at her arm trying to pull her up

				the boy
		come on

alex is crying hysterical  she turns and sees the screamer bearing down
on her just like nick did before her was ripped to shreds

the boy is yelling something  alex focuses

				the boy
		the doorway  its here

the boy

is pulling back a manhole cover  blue light  issues up from below
before alex can stop him the boy disappears down the hole

alex has one last chance  she throws herself at the hole even as the
screamer reaches her  a clawed hand wraps around her leg  alex fires
into the hand  the hand is severed  shes falling  falling into
darkness

level ten  bad brains

								cut to

ext  level ten technoskyscraper  night

on alex and the boy

as they blink into existence on this level  alex rises shaking badly
her armor is battered burnt covered with grim and bloodits
impossible to tell whos blood though  she looks like shes just walked
out of a slaughterhouse

a bonejarring humming is heard  alex turns

arcades brain

looms over her all glass and black steel  it reaches into the sky and
keeps on going  massive  tendrils of crackling energy race up and down
it buzzing  and as impossible as it may seem this thing definitely
appears to be alive

two glass doors

swing open in invitation  a red carpet rolls out from within the
building rolling by itself  emerald city time the carpet unfurls
completely ending just at alexs feet

above the doors a neon sign blinks on one word at a time
thisistheplace  fuckinga

alex offers a tired nearmaddened laugh  its all she can do anymore

the boy

looks up at alex frightened

				boy
		we have to go in there dont we

alex nods  she takes his hand and together they walk down the red carpet
towards the entrance of arcades brain

int  level ten arcades brain  night

inside the lobby is a cacophony of light and sound  we hear hundreds of
voices at oncewhisperingfading in and out  its like channels
being changed  a snippet of an opera here maybe bugs bunnys voice
thererap music country music a woman in the throes of orgasm nazis
screaming heil hitler anything and everything

signs blink on and off

catchy phrases like this is my brain and welcome to it and i think
therefore im fucked flash before us

tv monitors

are everywhere displaying an endless array of static  and now the
monitors are displaying fractals  every single one of them  we hear the
cellos like an orchestra tuning up

alex

throws her hands over her ears as the sounds become unbearable

				alex
			top of her lungs
		shut up

she pulls out her gun at fires into the sounds and images shooting the
fuck out of everything  monitor screens shatter glass flies and

just like that total silence descends  one by one the lights blink
off and its dark once again

int level ten the night room 

a spotlight

comes on isolating alex  the boy stands behind her and everything else
is dark  its impossible to tell how large the room is  it might go on
forever

more lights

come on now pinpoint spots illuminating the faces of her friends
theyre all therestilts laurie the others even nick  they sit in
rows motionlessa peanut gallery  its eerie as hell

and now alex sees something else greg  hes encased in a block of ice
a frozen prince  and in his hands he holds a sword  the sword is very
unusual  the hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows red as if it had
just pulled from a furnace  alex realizes that the sword is arcades
heart

alex moves towards greg  as she gets closer she sees a keyhole carved
into the ice

alex knows what to do  she withdraws her belt on which the nine golden
keys are attached  removing the keys alex begins to fit them
togetherone two threeuntil they combine to form the shape of a
single greater key

the key

alex fits it into the keyhole and turns it

the case of ice

splits in half opening up with a cloud of frosty air inside greg is
frozen still clutching the sword  alex pulls the sword out of his stiff
grip lifting it up

				alex
			looking around
		okay  im here arcade where are you

no answer  alex turns eyes searching through the darkness

				alex
			shouting
		where are you damnit

her voice echoes in the cavernous room

				arcade os
		right here bitch

alex spins around and

the boy

stands before her  he grins and his eyes pulse with an internal light
we can hear him breathing now just like before  just like the game

				alex
			stunned
		youyoure arcade  but the donor

				arcadeboy
		was an eightyear old boy  you see
		mommy used to beat me  mommy threw me down
		a flight of stairs then i went to sleep
		for a long long time and when i woke up
		i was here and i wasnt me anymore
			shivers
		and i fucked mommy up good

arcade begins to change shaking and roaring as something black and
insectlike bursts out of the boys skin  it claws at its face ripping
the flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath

nothing could have prepared alex for this  itarcade rises above her and
it takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming  somehow alex
finds a reserve of strength

alex swings the sword and

arcade smashes it aside  it clatters to the floor useless  but thats
academic now as a gnarled hand clamps around alexs throat

arcade lifts alex into the air and slams her against a wall pinning her
there  he thrusts his face into hers

				arcade
		youre too late alex  youve always been
		too late  and now your times up  you
		see i needed someone to retrieve my heart
		for me  i couldnt do it myself  those
		are the rules  but now that ive got it
		ill destroy it and ill be free of my
		program and ill be god  thankyou alex
		thankyou so much

arcade slowly squeezes her throat and alex chokes gasping for air that
isnt forthcoming  tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red  she
tries to pry the bony black fingers from her throat but she cant

her pov

as she sees the faces of her friends  frozen  unable to help  then the
images swirl and alex begins to lose consciousness

				arcade
		youre not dying yet alex  you havent
		been to the final level level ten

arcade drops alex to the ground then wraps a hand into her hair and drags
her across the floor

a doorway

stands in the darkness  arcade rips it open revealing absolute emptiness
beyond  its like a doorway into space a hole in the fabric of reality
it sucks the air into it lighteverything  it touches some sort of
primal fear gut instinct  you dont ever want to go to this place ever

				alex
			screaming
		no no

she twists madly trying to pull away but arcade is too strong  he
shoves her through the doorway  her hands briefly latch onto the
doorjamb  arcade violently kicks her and her hands slip away  they slip
and she tumbles through

arcade slams the door shut

				arcade
		goodbye alex  its been real

these words appear on the screen final level  the real world

								cut to

int  manning house hallway  day

alex lands on the hallway floor disoriented  somewhere we can hear a
clock ticking  but other than that the house is silent in stark contrast
to the storm of sounds a moment ago

the house

looks just like the dreamflashback we saw earlier everything is white
bright and dreamlike  hyper reality alex looks up and

another alex

is sitting in a chair nearby back straight hands clasped in her lap
reserved

				other alex
		time  thats all i ever think about
		anymore  its like theres never enough of
		it you know

the other alex vanishes  now the chair is empty  alex turns to look down
the long hallway  at the end of the hallway is the open door  a door
weve seen before  the words fade in like phantoms

				man vo
		so where are you then

				alex vo
		im in the past

				alex
			a whisper
		no  oh no 

with a building sense of dread alex moves towards that doorway  she
stops at the threshold terrified

int  manning house bedroom  day

everything looks normal at first  a typical bedroom with sunlight
streaming in through the windows  a bed madeup flowers in vases
everything looks perfect

we turn with alex  ever so slowly  over to the right and the entranceway
of the bathroom  over to where her mother is

seated on a chair dressed in white and radiating warmth

				alexs mom
		hi honey

her mother

looks beautiful  eyes sparkling  alive and vital

alex cant believe what shes seeing  immediately tears come to her eyes
and her voice falters

				alex
		mom
			uncomprehending
		youre alive

				alexs mother
		of course i am

				alex
		but i dont understand

				alexs mother
		i miss you so much alex  i want so much
		to be with you

tears are running freely down alexs face now

				alexs mother
			continuing
		i love you alex  i never wanted to leave
		you know that dont you

				alex
			nodding
		yesbuthow did you

her mother looks ecstatic  and now there are tears in her eyes  joy
reunionits unclear which

				alexs mother
		magic  well be together again
			beat
		i know you dont believe in an afterlife
		but there is one  heaven is real

alex looks around her  its all too much to take in  her mother  back
in her own home  sunlight is streaming in bathing everything around her
in gold and the moment is crystallized  a stilllife  forever

				alex
		isis that where we are  did i die

				alexs mother
		not yet honey

her mother stands and alex sees that she is holding a gunno the gun
in her hands  she raises at alex

				alexs mother
			continuing
		but i can fix that

alex has no time to respond  a stillborn scream is frozen in her throat
a splitsecond of realization  and then her mother fires the gun

crack  the bullet hits alex square in the forehead snapping her head
back as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward  the world spins
to a stop like a record player running down

alex is killed instantly  her body collapse head thumping
unceremoniously against the carpeted floor

her eyes

open and fixed on infinity  no life here  seems hard to believe that
there ever was

								cut to

int level nine the night room 

on alexs face

there is no bullethole in her forehead but her eyes are just as
lifeless

the peanut gallery

row after row of frozen faces  are they aware that alex has died  is
there consciousness inside those skulls

on arcade

as he crouches over alexs body  a smile creeps across his face

				arcade
		oh alex  so sorry  but dont you worry
		ill bring you back in the game  maybe
		ill even give you heaven

he laughs

alexs body

begins to decompose in front of us skin sinking in and shriveling up  in
moments shes just a husk

arcade rears back and is about to turn away when something catches his
eye  he hears a tiny beeping

alexs wrist monitor

remember the stylized symbol of a woman  the one that said free life
beneath it  well it disappears now

theres a sudden flash behind arcade and he spins around

another alex

is standing behind him and shes got the heartsword in her hands

				alex
		guess what asshole  you forgot about my
		free life

she dives forward thrusting the sword with all her might it sinks into
arcades chest and she pushes further burying it up to the hilt

arcade lets loose the most terribly scream weve ever heard  it literally
shakes world

the sword

is glowing like molten lava  the heartshaped hilt burns into the
monsters chest spreading crackling fire over his entire body  his body
is immersed fire now vibrating like mad and suddenly

arcade explodes in a fireball of green light and

hes gone  like he never existed  the sword drops to the floor a
gunmetal gray now

alex stands there a moment stunned not quite willing to believe that
shes won

a neon sign

above her drops down  it flashes congratulations over and over again
congratulations

alex

looks down at herself  she feels odd  something is happening  shes
fading out as if she were a signal being lost  her image stutters
flickers and

alex flashes back into the real world and then one by one so do the
others

its a glorious sight  each one is heralded by buzzing static and then a
rippling in space an image stuttering in and

pop  pop  pop  one after another come flashing back in bursts of light
there are dozens  the inferno is filled with them like a flurry of
flashbulbs going off  familiar faces and people weve never seen  benz
laurie stilts deloach

pop  and theres nick  and more and still more  forty fifty  just
how many people did arcade take

everyone is grinning crying hugging one another

space shimmers

just before alex  someone else is trying to fight their way back  its
greg  hes blinking back into reality

				alex
			crying
		greg

he flickers for a moment tentative

				greg
			fading in and out
		alex  you did it

and then hes back for good  he wraps his arms around alex grabbing
her so tight that its almost painful  both of them are sobbing

				greg
			in between kisses
		you did it

together the two of them start towards the door eager to leave this
place

in groups of twos and threes the others follow

outside light is just beginning to creep its way back into the world
alex glances up and cant help but notice the streetlight fading out as
the sun returns  she points and laughs

we begin to rise up

as nick and the others join them  everyone is laughing now  its
uncontrollable  this is positive  life affirming  and hell we should
probably wrap this thing up on that note

we should

but we wont

we watch

as a series of dissolves portray the crowd of people leaving bit by bit
until only our original group is left

the group

as they make their way down the street and away from the inferno

				greg
		so how did you do it alex

				alex
		well its a long story

alex catches nicks eye briefly and he smiles  whatever happened between
them is over now  friends again

suddenly alex stops in her tracks a look of concern washing over her
face

				nick
		what is it

				alex
		i just thought of something  if we came
		back from the game
			turning to nick
		what if arcade did too

a beat as the group mulls it over  then greg shakes his head

				greg
		nah  you won right  you played by the
		rules

gregs right  alex grins and dismisses the thought

				alex
		okay  forget i ever said it

the group moves away from us once more

				stilts
		so start at the beginning

				laurie
		give her a chance will you

				stilts
		i am giving her a chance  why dont you
		get off my back

				greg
			annoyed
		guys

							dissolve to

int  dantes inferno  day

we are moving slowly through the empty arcade ducking around and between
video machines until we reach the silent arcade prototype

suddenly

sparks appear on the ground nearby chasing each other around and
coalescing into a ball  energy crackling something is flickering in and
out at an incredible rate buzzing  static  and

wham  a flash of light explodes outward

a form

rises up from the floor still trailing tendrils of smoke it lifts its
head

the boy

stares directly at us eyes glowing like nuclear reactors and inside
those eyes we see the swirling fractals  he grins flashing a mouthful of
perfectly white teeth

				arcadeboy
		kiss reality goodbye suckers

and we

								cut to

darkness

				   the end
