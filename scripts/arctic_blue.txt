arctic blue

fade in

1	ext  boreal forest  alaska  aerial shot  day

flying  not at the intangible height of a jet but at
spitting distance from the treetops  were in central
alaska the big lonely just north of the arctic circle

a thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deeppile carpet  up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn

on the horizon the hills rise to meet the endicott
mountains a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face  this is how all
north america once looked  raw indomitable

then abruptly coming into the scene is a colossal etching
across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin
bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon  or a scar
depending on your point of view  is the 800milelong
transalaskan pipeline

even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant
by the vastness of the land  it goes on and on and on

dissolve to

a lone man walks along the haul road a onelane gravel
trail running parallel to the pipeline  the weather turns
sour  rough wind and stinging snow cut across the mans
path

dissolve to

the man is eric desmond twentyfour cleanshaven
determined  hes clearly out of place here dressed in a
business suit and a light camelhair topcoat

eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow  a
predators tracks those of a wolf or coyote  but the
footprints ahead have faded covered by the snow and wind

dissolve to

the weather becomes more oppressive  heavy snow gale winds
and subzero temperatures make his progress tortuous  eric
strives stubbornly forward
								
								continued
1	continued

dissolve to

eric has gathered some branches  he tries to make a fire
moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar
of his insufficient coat and his skin is split raw from the
cold

his hands are too numb to hold the matches  after several
attempts at striking one he slumps down next to the pile of
wood exhausted and frustrated

dissolve to

the snow has covered the pile of branches  eric still sits
next to it partially covered in snow himself

eric

his face is a death mask eyes halfopen and dull lips a
purplish blue bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over
the wind howls around him  the snow sticks to his eyelashes
and hair without melting
									
									end dream

2	int  dark bedroom  night

eric bolts up in bed  next to him anne marie gauvin sits
up and hugs him  all that can be seen of her in the dark is
a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair  after a
moment eric kisses her  he shakes off the dream and lies
back down

3	ext  haul road and pipeline  close  day

a metal sign peppered with shotgun holes is posted near a
pipeline support piling
						
			pipeline utility corridor
				  private property
				  no   trespassing
				  no	  hunting
				  no	 trapping
				  no	 shooting

wider

eric walks quietly past the sign intent on something ahead
of him  although still somewhat boyish in appearance hes
confident and resolute in attitude  his clothes have a
distinctly western feel lucchese boots levis 501s mahan
cotton shirt  his down parka is unzipped in the sunny
windless fortydegree afternoon
								
								continued
3	continued

he pauses then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a
fourpower scope mounted atop it  he peers through the
scope

his pov  through scope

he puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big
ivorywhite timber wolf fifty yards away

back to scene

anne marie stands beside eric a nikon with a telephoto lens
in her hand holding her breath in anticipation  shes
twentythree pretty with soft features and piercing blue
eyes  she wears eddie bauer womans gear like she was born
in it

eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger
but instead of a loud retort there is only the dull pop of
a co2powered dart gun

new angle

the tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolfs fleshy
shoulder  the wolf takes off running but almost
immediately slows sits then lies down

eric and anne marie hurry over to the wolf who is breathing
deeply  eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur
					
					eric
			what a beauty
			to anne marie
			hand me the transmitter

anne marie passes to eric a tiny weatherproof homing device
attached to a steel collar band  eric puts the collar
loosely around the wolfs neck and crimps it in place all
the while talking soothingly to the semiconscious animal
anne marie smiles at erics tenderness and snaps some
photos

with the collar in place and transmitter activated eric
backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its
narcosis
					
					eric
			continuing
			hes coming around fine
					
					anne marie
			be right back  i left my
			camcorder in the car
								
								continued
3	continued  2

follow anne marie

as she hurries back to their international scout  on the
door of the scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick
under which are the words
						
			northland petroleum corp

anne marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera

angle on eric and the wolf

eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and
trots unsteadily away  near the treeline the wolf turns
glances back at eric and then disappears into the forest

new angle

anne marie is taping the wolfs retreat  looking through
the viewfinder she crosses a gully between a pipeline
piling and a rock formation  eric turns toward her and a
glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye
					
					eric
			anne marie  stop

she glances down  something metal is halfburied in the
dead leaves and gravel
					
					eric
			continuing
			dont move

eric runs over  he pokes at the object with a stick  with
a snap a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half  anne
marie jumps back  eric brushes the dead leaves on the
ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the
gully
					
					eric
			continuing
			goddamn trappers

he angrily rips the trap out of the ground unearthing
several others attached to one another by a long chain
					
					eric
			continuing
			takes nerve laying traplines on
			restricted land

eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the
pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring point
								
								continued
3	continued  3

using the scope as a telescope he scans up and down the
haul road
					
					anne marie
			what are you doing
					
					eric
			he still might be around  i saw
			fresh tire tracks coming in

his pov  through scope

the road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon
north and south  in the distance a jeep is parked on the
haul road  near it a man climbs down into another shallow
ravine

back to scene

eric hurries down the footpegs
					
					eric
			man and a jeep about a mile and
			a half down

he jumps into the scout  anne marie stuffs her cameras into
the hatchback  as soon as she climbs in eric tears out

4	int  scout  moving shot

it races along the dusty gravel road at 60 mph

5	ext  haul road

startled at the approach of the scout the trapper uproots
his traps and runs out of the ravine  he whistles and
another trapper appears nearby

6	int  trappers jeep

they pile into their dilapidated allterrain jeep  its
oddly wellequipped however  bolted to the dashboard is an
expensive tape player and a beatup radio beacon receiver
with a round locating screen  they zoom off

7	int  scout  moving shot

eric stomps on the gas  the dust from the jeep obscures his
view but hes gaining on them anyway  anne marie hangs on
and squints her eyes against the choking dust



8	int  trappers jeep  moving shot

the driver is lemalle 35 a tall ugly rawboned canadian
his entire outfit is made of animal hide  he has long red
hair and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic
sneer  while driving he scans along the pipeline
					
					lemalle
			where the fuck did you drop
			corbett off

in the passenger seat mitchell 38 chews tobacco and
looks grim  hes a squat flatfaced okie with curly
matted hair and tired grey eyes  hes dressed in a brown
long coat and has a colt 45 peacemaker in a quickdraw
holster strapped to his leg  despite his intimidating air
confrontation is not his style

he spots a figure up ahead where the road crosses a muddy
creek
					
					mitchell
			hes over there

9	ext  haul road

turning sharply the trappers jeep splashes through the
creek bed without slowing  bouncing it comes down hard
against the axledeep bank at the creeks high water mark
lemalle tries to back out but cant find traction in the
mud

eric stops the scout thirty yards behind them

10   int  scout

eric opens his door  to anne marie
					
					eric
			stay here
					
					anne marie
			be careful  therere two of
			them

eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to anne
marie
					
					eric
			if i unzip my parka stick this
			out the window

11   ext  haul road

eric confidently approaches the jeep
								
								continued
11   continued

then a third trapper climbs from the creek  hes got a
line of traps slung around his neck and a world of
experience on his face  hes ben corbett a lifelong
huntsman somewhere past forty weathered beyond his years

he has a feral nose thick beard and dark smart hunters
eyes  he wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt cotton
coveralls and vaporbarrier mountain boots  on his belt is
a holster rig cradling a 44 magnum revolver

eric slows down  he didnt expect to face anyone as
formidable as corbett

12   int  ext jeep

emboldened by corbetts presence lemalle reaches into the
back seat and grabs his 65 by 55 swedish military carbine
					
					corbett
			to lemalle
			no shooting  lets see whos so
			interested in us

corbett has an incongruously affable voice  he throws his
traps into the jeep then strides closer toward eric
					
					mitchell
			to corbett
			aint worth it ben

13   ext  haul road  creek crossing  long shot

as corbett comes closer eric realizes this might notve
been a great idea  corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the
air as if by this he can gauge his opponents mettle
					
					eric
			you got two counts against you 
			trapping out of season and
			poaching on restricted land
					
					corbett
			cant be much of a crime if all
			they got minding the area is a
			cocky kid
					
					eric
			i got your plate number asshole
			maybe you feel like spending a
			few months in jail

corbett just smiles
								
								continued
13   continued

but lemalle rankled sticks the carbine out the jeep
window

seeing the rifle pointed at him eric freezes then slowly
unzips his parka
					
					lemalle
			ben  sure you dont want me to
			drop the fucker

corbett doesnt answer  then his eyes narrow and he looks
past eric at the scout

corbetts pov

the passenger in the scout sticks what looks like another
rifle out the window

back to scene

eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure anne
maries backing him up
					
					eric
			you leave and dont come back
			thats the end of it

after a long moment corbett smiles again then turns away
from eric  he motions lemalle to the front of the jeep

frustrated lemalle slams back the safety on the carbine and
throws it in the back seat

angle on trappers

mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine
lemalle and corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut
while pushing corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp
piece of granite   he cusses and pushes harder

14   ext  haul road  creek crossing

eric walks back to the scout  he feels the trappers eyes
on his back but forces himself not to hurry

the trappers free their vehicle  corbett gets in the
drivers seat and they take off

15   int  scout

anne maries hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic
tranquilizer rifle back in the window
								
								continued
15   continued

					
					anne marie
			unnerved
			great idea  pointing a lousy
			dart gun at some nut with a
			highpowered hunting rifle
					
					eric
			bastards took off though didnt
			they

16   ext  boreal forest  later that day

the trappers have left the flatlands of the haul road area
now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills

17   int  trappers jeep  moving shot

corbett broods while driving  mitchell looks out the
window  the silence makes lemalle uncomfortable
					
					lemalle
			all this fuckin land and were
			locked out  makes me puke
					
					corbett
			jawing about it wont change it
					
					lemalle
			three hundred seventyfive
			million acres in this state  im
			real tired of runnin into
			people
					
					mitchell
			then dont look to your left

18   ext  sportsmens camp

a brandnew land rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a
bend in a small river  scattered about is an assortment of
expensive camping gear beer cans spent shells and other
garbage

three toymacho vacationing sportsmen are guzzling beer and
blasting fish in the shallow river with 12gauge shotguns
they look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and
stops

19   int  trappers jeep

lemalle grabs his carbine
					
					corbett
			leave it here
								
								continued

19   continued
					
					mitchell
			lets keep going  were only an
			hour from devils cauldron
					
					corbett
			pats mitchells shoulder
			relax  i just want to ask them
			how the hunting is

20   ext  sportsmens camp

corbett gets out of the jeep  he regards the sportsmen
their shotguns and their mess with illconcealed contempt

the sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch corbett  he
walks around the camp spotting a rubberlined rucksack
stuffed with dead ermine  after a long tense moment
corbett smiles
					
					corbett
			looks like youve had some luck
			wheres your guide
					
					sportsman 1
			were on our own if its any of
			your damn business
					
					corbett
			re ermine
			you did real good

he crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur
					
					lemalle
			to corbett
			no swinging shit  theyre over
			their goddamned limit
					
					corbett
			to sportsmen
			my friend is right  supposed to
			have a licensed guide when youre
			on this land too
					
					sportsman 1
			hey we paid our fuckin permit
			fees

lemalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire  no one
notices that in the bg quiet sportsman 3 unzips his
parka exposing a 45 peacemaker in a belt holster
								
								continued
20   continued
					
					sportsman 2
			i were you id drive right on
			outta here again  now
					
					corbett
			calmly
			this was my roaming land til
			the government took it over
			only innuit can hunt here now
			and tourists like you

corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of
the land rover  pissed sportsmen 1 and 2 step closer to
him
					
					corbett
			continuing
			according to tribal law hunters
			passing through the land of
			another tribe can only take game
			to survive  they can eat the
			meat but have to surrender the
			hides

lemalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the
ermine
					
					lemalle
			want the meat
					
					sportsman 1

			fuck you dirtball

corbett chuckles and mitchell spits

wider

lemalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the
land rover many still in their packages  he helps himself
to some sandwiches and a 12pack of beer
					
					lemalle
			i say shoot em bury em with
			their shiny new car
					
					mitchell
			to lemalle
			if youre gonna take something
			take it and lets go

corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack
								
								continued
20   continued  2

new angle

suddenly sportsman 3 reaches inside his parka and pulls
the pistol  he swings it toward lemalle

lemalle looks up when he hears the hammer cock

there is a deafeningly loud shot

sportsman 3 falls down dead at lemalles feet

off to one side corbett holds a huge smoking 44 magnum
sixshooter in his hand

shotgun in hand sportsman 1 gauges his chances of blasting
corbett  nil  when corbett turns to him he lies the
weapon down  sportsman 2 rushes to his friend

looking bleak mitchell spits again  corbett crosses to
lemalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to
steal  chastised lemalle smolders  after a moment
					
					corbett
			to sportsmen
			put him in your truck  smell of
			blood will attract the bears
			to trappers
			lets go

as corbett walks to the jeep hes too angry to notice that
hes stepped in a patch of mud under the land rover

near the jeep lemalle stops and pulls them into a huddle
					
					lemalle

			i dont believe in leavin
			witnesses behind ben
					
					mitchell
			it was self defense  leave it at
			that
					
					lemalle
			you think those fucks will tell
			it that way
					
					corbett
			ending the argument
			well get a head start before
			they go crying to the law

corbett turns and fires two rounds from his 44 into the
engine of the land rover  the sportsmen stare and sputter
								
								continued
20   continued  3
					
					corbett
			continuing to sportsmen
			you can pack out of here  two
			three days hike along this river
			at most  weather should hold
			this early in the season

corbett and mitchell get in their jeep

lemalle

isnt yet satisfied  he walks back over to the sportsmen
kneeling beside their fallen friend and crouches right
beside them  intimidated sportsman 2 looks away but
lemalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him
					
					lemalle
			think im pretty  you better
			forget how we look cause next
			time they wont keep me from
			killing you  this land aint
			quite civilized you know

he unsheathes his buck knife  below frame he slices across
the forehead of the dead sportsman peels back his scalp and
cuts it loose indianstyle  the sportsmen are stunned and
sickened

angle on trappers jeep

corbett looks at mitchell and wearily shakes his head
					
					mitchell
			at least he scalped the dead one

21   ext  devils cauldron  dusk

devils cauldron hot springs is a cluster of twenty tiny
dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk  the town
squats ugly and temporarylooking in a dirt clearing fifty
miles north of the arctic circle  thirty miles east of the
pipeline its almost dead center of interior alaska

at the edge of town is a gravel airstrip  mixed with the
prospectorera sodroof cabins are a few prefabricated
houses  the boon brought by men building the pipeline is
long gone  now only a few itinerant loggers natives and
bush dwellers remain to fight boredom each other and the
depression of the oncoming winter

enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually
blanket the valley with fog  the spa is logwalled and
horseshoe shaped with partitioned baths inside  facing it

21   continued

are a mudwalled fire bath a wooden steam bath called a
maqi six oneroom cabins for let and an unused dance hall

leo meyerling opens the tailgate of a dodge truck with the
northland petroleum logo and district supervisor on the
door  meyerling is short and bald with a completely
disreputable face  he staples a poster on a wall  it has a
picture of him on it and
						
				leo meyerling

			 vote for the peoples friend

22   ext  kenais general store

corbett and the other trappers drive past meyerling and park
their jeep as the sun disappears behind the foothills

23   int  kenais general store

a handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church
meetings reads live each day so you can look every damn
man in the eye and tell him to go to hell  there is a post
office in the corner with some combination boxes and a
wicketless window

the trappers come in  corbett sits in a chair and pulls his
boots off  one of his wool socks is wet  he nods to the
man sitting in the other chair sam wilder  wilder is short
and tough with a full head of crewcut grey hair and
weather ravaged face that makes him look older than his
sixty years
					
					corbett
			hullo sam  slow day
					
					wilder
			wary
			benboys  yeah real slow and
			id like to keep it that way
					
					corbett
			conciliatory
			just passing through

a chubby inupiat interior eskimo wearing thick glasses
several heavy sweaters and batteryheated socks fusses
behind the counter  hes earl kenai owner of the hot
springs spa and the general store

lemalle chews on a handful of bear jerky  kenai stares at
lemalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky  corbett
pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to kenai

corkboard
					
					meyerling
			i hope i can count on you
			gentlemen to vote for the
			peoples friend this november
					
					corbett

			money in your pocket and you can

meyerling smiles like a toad then slaps another poster on
the wall  lemalle throws his knife and it sticks in the
poster between meyerlings spread fingers  meyerling jumps
back and the trappers laugh  meyerling looks to wilder for
support
					
					wilder

24   ext  devils cauldron valley  long shot  night

an early storm has blown in from the north bringing
whipping winds and freezing rain

25   int  rental cabin

corbett peers out the tiny window frowning  lemalle cleans
his carbine while eating beans and bacon  mitchell hunches
over a table  hes making a scrimshaw  delicately
engraving using homemade tools on a palmsized piece of
whale bone  he rubs his eyes and looks up at corbett
					
					mitchell
			so much for the walking weather

26   ext  haul road  the turtle  day

the winds have died down  the rain has turned to a light
snow

a mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the haul
road  its a doubleunit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass
and aluminum pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires
the front module is 12 by 24 the rear 12 by 18

an extendedcab pickup pulls up and sam wilder gets out
the gravelanddirt haul road paralleling the pipeline for
400 miles is closed to the public  an arriving vehicle
therefore is news  the front door of the dwelling opens
eric and anne marie come outside delighted to see wilder
								
								continued
26   continued
					
					wilder

					eric
			 we appreciate the company
			anne maries getting cabin fever
			already

anne marie shoots a look at eric but doesnt disagree 
this is obviously an issue with them  wilder looks with
amusement at the mobile dwelling
					
					wilder
			whatd you say they call these
			spaceships
					
					eric
			mobile arctic dwelling  mad
					
					anne marie
			i call it the turtle as in

26   continued  2

looking past wilder eric points out some smoke on the
horizon
					
					eric
			hey sam look over there  black
			and white smoke
					
					wilder
			damn  likely thats an sos
			have to pass on that lunch
					
					eric
			well go with you
									
									cut to

27   ext  sportsmens camp  later that day

everything seems peaceful enough  the sos fire made from
burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black
smoke has burnt down to embers

eric anne marie and wilder pull up in wilders pickup

the two sportsmen sit in the front seat of the land rover
but they dont react to the arrival of the rescuers  in the
back seat a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass

something is amiss  eric shoots a look of trepidation at
anne marie as they get out of the pickup   wilder pulls the
door of the land rover open

a sportsman slumps out onto the ground  his eyes are open
and his tongue pokes out between his lips  his skin is
bluewhite he looks in fact much like erics nightmare

startled eric steps back  anne marie gasps with horror
wilder unzips the sportsmans light windbreaker and listens
for a heartbeat  nothing
					
					wilder
			stupid goddamn greenhorns  froze
			to death
					
					anne marie
			its not even winter
					
					wilder
			they got wet in the rain  core
			body temperature dropped got
			drowsy probably didnt even know
			what was happening

eric stares at the dead sportsmen
								
								continued
27   continued
					
					wilder
			continuing
			question is why they sat here
			when the storm moved in  check
			their stuff while i sniff around

wilder tries the ignition  the starter turns over but the
engine makes a horrendous grinding  he walks to the front
of the vehicle  noticing the bullet holes in the grille he
bends down for a closer look

new angle

eric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentiful
supplies  still in their packages are some matchboxsized
elt locating beacons
					
					eric
			they had emergency locater
			transmitters but didnt use
			them
			opens one up shakes his
				head
			maybe because they didnt bring
			batteries

close

anne marie opens the back door of the land rover  she pulls
back the camping blanket and uncovers the third
sportsman  the torn red flesh on his head and his
buggedout eyes are a hideous sight

anne marie screams and stumbles away

28   ext  sportsmens camp  land rover

eric runs over to her as she tries to catch her breath

wilder looks at the third sportsman and angrily kicks the
side of the land rover
					
					wilder
			im too old for this shit
					
					eric
			any idea who couldve done it

sourly wilder points to a patch of frozen mud under the
vehicle
					
					wilder
			a certain sonofabitch bastard
					more
								
								continued
28   continued
					
					wilder contd
			wearing a damaged mountain boot
			left a footprint clear as an

wilder examines the sportsman finding the bullet hole in
his chest
					
					wilder
			continuing
			even for ben corbett this is
			nasty  mans got balls  he was
			sitting in devils cauldron when
			i left calm as can be
					
					anne marie
			thank god  you can arrest him
					
					wilder
			not necessarily  corbetts awful
			hardbitten these days

wilder leans against the land rover feeling tired
					
					wilder
			continuing
			his old roaming areas all
			private reserve now  normally
			long as he stays civil in my
			jurisdiction i let him be
			beat
			wont be able to take him by my

eric looks hard at the dead sportsmen
					
					eric
			quietly
			ill go into town with you
					
					anne marie
			eric leave it alone  its not

					eric
			shakes his head
			no way can he get away with this

corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy
inupiat hooker dixie

he looks up as eric comes into the spa  eric holds
corbetts boots which have been repaired  eric pauses when
he sees corbett  there is a flash of recognition between
them

eric glances down at corbetts duffel bag which sits on the
floor next to corbetts tub  corbetts magnum rests on top
of it well within reach  corbett notices erics interest
in it  he leans back and smiles

wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to eric

corbett grabs his boots from eric and finds himself facing a
revolver which eric has been hiding inside one of the
boots
					
					corbett
			continuing smiling

wilder has come in the back way and stands behind corbett
with a 12gauge shotgun  he kicks corbetts magnum out of

wilder comes out of the spa with his shotgun and corbetts
duffel bag cradled in his arm  handcuffed corbett walks in
front of him

kenai looks down to avoid eye contact with corbett as he
goes by  corbett stops next to eric and smiles

as he leads corbett along the boardwalk to the other end of
town  they approach a prefab house perched on skids under a
tall antenna tower  mounted above the shack a dc wind
charger turbine spins lazily in the faint breeze  from
within the cabin comes an anomalous sound  mtv  wilder
knocks on the door

arthur neff a pastywhite 45yearold extexan pulls the
door open  his customary grin fades when he sees corbett

33   int  neffs house

wilder pushes corbett inside past neff

an old primergrey station wagon rattles into town and
parks  with an unlit cheroot stuck in his mouth viking
bob corbett gets out and stretches  hes 38 sixfootsix
with sandy hair beard ruddy skin and his brothers dark
eyes

he looks around for some sign of life  he spots neff

to corbett

					wilder
			back against the bars  now

wilder handcuffs corbetts hands to the cell door bars then
quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across corbetts face
covering his mouth

stuffing a 357 magnum in his belt wilder coatless slips
outside

as soon as hes out the door corbett cranes his neck and
painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner
of the door hinge

40   ext  wilders cabin

the look on wilders face tells kenai to shut up  viking
bob realizes somethings up
					
					wilder
			your brother and the boys left me
			some traps to sell for them
			theyre gone 
					
					viking bob
			 to cache  so i heard  ben

			charge

42   ext  wilders cabin

wilder pulls his 357 out
					
					wilder
			sorry bob  ill have to keep

viking bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at wilder then
punching him in the gut  wilder sprawls among the junk
dropping his revolver  kenai freezes not about to take
sides

before viking bob can come at him again wilder grabs for
his 357 viking bob jumps back and bolts for his car

he dives into his station wagon and starts it up  as he
drives past wilder pops off a few rounds but viking bob

on the monitor it shows footage of the traps under the
pipeline piling  eric comes out of the back module holding
two elt pendants  he glances over at the monitor and nods
approvingly

			re elts

eric activates the elts  they emit an sos pattern of radio
waves  three short three long and three short  this is
visible as rhythmic interference on anne maries video
monitor

she does so by seductively undressing for the camera  shes
seen on the monitor illuminated by the light from the hot
stove  eric appreciates the show  he crawls toward her
					
					anne marie
			continuing
			hightech in the wilderness
			gets me excited too

laughing he wrestles her to the rug

44   ext  hills above devils cauldron  night

waiting

he hears an engine starting in the distance  sitting up he
grabs some binoculars

in the bright moonlight two people are seen in wilders

viking bob turns and takes the literal high road  a narrow
trail above the roadway that wilders truck is on

he zooms ahead and gets in front of his quarry then drops
back down onto the road and waits in ambush

as wilders truck approaches viking bob turns on his bright
lights and crouches behind his car door with a shotgun

wilders truck screeches to a stop

closer

kenai gets out with his hands up

viking bob slowly approaches wilders truck
					
					viking bob

49   int  the turtle  later that night

a bottle of erics scotch sits almost empty on the table
beside wilder  wilder dozes in a chair facing corbett

corbett is awake  he contorts his body to bring his
handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of
him  he eyes wilders 357  its in a lefty sam browne
holster  no way to take it without waking wilder

corbett stands and inches toward the door  as he pulls it
open the insulation makes enough noise to stir wilder

wilder gets up and pushes corbett back into his chair
					
					wilder
			goddammit i dont need this
			aggravation  ill shoot you
			ben  bank on it
					
					corbett
			i dont want to hurt you sam
					
					wilder
			im not too old to knock the snot
			out of you
					
					corbett
			nothing personal

wilders mind clears enough to realize that corbetts hands
are in front of him  he reaches for his 357  corbett
butts into wilders midsection with his head  amazingly
wilder stays on his feet

corbett hurries back to the door  wilder lunges
bulldetermined to hold onto him  corbett smashes wilder
across the face with his clenched hands  wilder goes down
hard hitting his head on the table and stays there
corbett instinctively kneels to see if wilder is still
breathing  but then hearing movement in the rear module
corbett flees



50   int  the turtle  rear module

eric is pulling on his pants

51   int  the turtle  front module

eric rushes in  the outside door is open and wilder lies on
the floor   his holster is empty  anne marie comes in and
crosses to wilder

eric pulls a floor trap door open and digs through the
companyissue equipment coming up with a huge remington
boltaction bear rifle  unfamiliar with weapons eric tears
open a box of shells and fumbles to load the rifle

52   ext  the turtle

corbett is trying to start erics scout

eric fires a loud warning shot from the turtle doorway
					
					eric
			you want to try that handgun
			against this rifle go ahead

corbett sits in the scout for a long moment weighing his
odds  he takes his hands off the steering wheel

eric shoots again this time smashing the sideview mirror
and window next to corbetts head

still handcuffed corbett gets out of the scout  holding
the 357 gingerly by the butt he puts it on the hood of the
scout
					
					corbett
			some day you might have to face
			me without a gun

53   int  the turtle

eric leads corbett in  anne marie is cradling wilders
head shes crying  eric looks at wilder  there is blood
coming from his ear and hes fading fast

eric nods again  wilder holds his gaze on eric then simply
stops breathing

corbetts benign attitude is chilling

sturdy metal bracket of a wall unit

54   ext  cache alaska  moving shot  night

viking bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt
road  the huge night sky all but smothers the weak light
from the town up ahead

cache seems a mistake  a jumble of unpainted buildings in
the middle of a big nothing twenty miles north of the
arctic circle  still its more animated than devils
cauldron  there are a hundred permanent residents several
taverns and a threestore flyin shopping center

even though its the middle of the night people roam the
streets drinking and socializing  with only a couple feet
of snow on the ground this is still summertime  under
storefront awnings drunken indians sleep on the concrete

viking bob cruises the main drag looking for the other
trappers  he spots their jeep in front of a
dangerouslooking saloon called the bear sign inn

as he parks and gets out of his station wagon  he hears a
familiar voice around the side of the building

mitchell runs out in front of them and blasts the front of
the scout with his 45 peacemaker  steam hisses out of the
radiator  eric floors it and races past mitchell almost
hitting him

mitchell and lemalle shoot at the retreating vehicle  one
of the scouts back tires gets blown out

67   int  scout  moving shot

eric slows shifts into fourwheel drive and continues
driving on the rim

68   ext  pumping station

chewing an unlit cheroot viking bob pulls up next to
mitchell and lemalle in the trappers jeep  they pile in

69   ext  haul road

eric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle

70   int  trappers jeep  through windshield  moving shot

as the scout heads for the feldspar creek bridge it
disappears from sight over a hill

71   ext  haul road  feldspar creek

viking bob zooms over feldspar creek  they come over the
rise but the scout still cant be seen ahead of them

reverse angle

the scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed
below the haul road  above the trappers speed past without
noticing

after giving the trappers time to get around the next bend
eric drives the scout up the embankment and crosses back
over the bridge

72   int  scout

eric stops the vehicle  he grabs a fivegallon gas can and
a piece of cloth from the back

73   ext  haul road  feldspar creek

the prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the army
corps of engineers left over from the building of the
pipeline  eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and
the honeycombed underside of the bridge  he puts the rag
inside the spout of the can lights it with a match and runs
like hell back to the scout



74   ext  haul road

the trappers realize their quarry is missing  viking bob
slams on the brakes and looks around

75   int  scout  moving shot

eric speeds away
					
					corbett
			theyll still catch us  all
			youre doing is pissing them off

76   ext  haul road  feldspar creek

the gasoline can explodes tearing the bridge couplings away
from the concrete abutment

77   ext  haul road

the trappers see the explosion behind them  they turn
around and head toward it

78   ext  pumping station  hangar

eric parks the scout sideways to block the way to the
airstrip

with the magnum at the ready eric cuts corbetts handcuffs
loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar

the leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on
rollers  eric unlocks it and rolls it back  inside is a
cessna 182 dusted with snow and ice blown through the
cracks by crosswinds  eric brushes the windshield with his
sleeve

79   ext  haul road  feldspar creek

the trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge
burning and disconnected from the creek bank

80   int  hangar  cessna

eric helps corbett into the cockpit then secures his
handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope

81   ext  haul road  feldspar creek

viking bob assesses the damage to the bridge  loose from
the abutments it wobbles like a diving board  below the
water is too deep and fastmoving to be traversable



82   int  hangar  cessna

eric tries to turn the engine over  the starter is sluggish
from cold and lack of use

83   ext  haul road  feldspar creek

viking bob looks at the others bursting with frustration
he climbs into the drivers seat
					
					viking bob
			get in  we can jump it

they hop in  he screeches backwards to get a running start
revs the engine pops the clutch and tears toward the
bridge

as they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle
under them  with a sickening wrenching the crossbar
supports crumple

the jeep flies through the stillburning gasoline becomes
airborne and scrapes to a rude stop on the edge of the
pavement on the other side the back wheels dangling in
space

lemalle and mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end
of the jeep onto solid earth

84   int  hangar

eric finally starts the plane and taxis out onto the landing
strip

85   ext  pumping station

the trappers drive up to where the scout blocks their path
they pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing
strip

it picks up speed and takes off

angle through window  aerial shot

below the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads
lemalle points his carbine at it but viking bob pushes the
rifle down

87   int  cessna  aerial shot

corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him



88   ext  pumping station

viking bob watches wideeyed with fury  mitchell spits
lemalle punches the wall  then he turns and repeatedly
blasts the scout parked nearby with his carbine

89   int  cessna  aerial shot

erics knapsack an emergency kit and several fivegallon
cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats
					
					eric
			how the hell were they smart
			enough to find us
					
					corbett
			smart  sure  thats why im
			sitting in this plane and theyre
			down there blowing me kisses

eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the
southwest  corbett notices that eric seems a little unsure
of the controls
					
					corbett
			continuing
			been driving long
					
					eric
			i needed a pilots license to
			take the job here so i got one
			in six weeks
					
					corbett
			that makes the flight more
			interesting

eric ignores the jibe  he stays at 2000 feet making the
landscape all the more immediate

corbett stares out the window and broods  he spots an open
snowcovered area where some dark blotches mar the
whiteness
					
					corbett
			continuing
			see the blood  pack of wolves
			took down a moose  greedy
			gutripping sons of bitches  id

			mitchell  id let bob worry

			wed drop supplies  wed land
			tell the pilot to come back for

another angle  aerial shot

while talking in an even tone corbett intently studies the
instrument panel and scans the landscape below
					
					corbett
			the idea was to get to the
			supplies before the bears did
			along the route wed set our

			three months

corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains above
the tree line
					
					corbett
			continuing
			lot of times we didnt even have
			a landing strip  wed set down
			on a plateau like that one
			there  yeah that ones easy
			you could glide right in

suddenly he turns in the seat and pins eric against the
door with his left foot

the plane flies erratically  with his right foot corbett
kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel
jamming it on

90   ext  cessna  aerial shot

the lever used to empty the fuel tanks in case of
emergency does so with great expediency  all the gas is
instantly discharged



91   int  cessna  aerial shot

corbett releases eric and calmly sits back up in his seat

eric rubs his neck incredulous  corbetts move was too
fast and too outrageous  in a moment the engine sputters
to a stop  eric struggles to hold the stick steady and
glide the plane down to the plateau corbett pointed out
					
					corbett
			hope you got your moneys worth
			on those lessons

92   ext  cessna  aerial shot

theres an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the
plateau  eric pushes the cessnas nose down  the plateau
comes up fast

the plane drops lower and lower pitching and yawing in the
wind

it crash lands its metal underbelly screeching as it hits
the jagged granite under the snow  it stops suddenly
flipping tail over nose

93   int  cessna

it rests upside down in the snow  the men are dazed

behind eric one of the extra fuel cans now hanging upside
down leaks gas  in front of him the engine is on fire

eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself but his leg
gets caught in the tangled belt  he pulls out a swiss army
knife and cuts the rope binding corbetts handcuffs to the
seat  corbett pushes the passenger door open  panicking
eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt painfully
wrenching his ankle

94   ext  cessna

corbett rolls out into the snow  with no time to grab his
supplies eric clambers from the wreckage  he and corbett
crawlroll down the incline of the plateau away from the
plane

a moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine
and the cessna explodes

wider

eric tries to stand  he cries out and falls into the
powdery snow clutching at his ankle

corbett realizes eric is at a disadvantage  but before he
can bolt eric grabs for the 357 magnum under his coat  he
lies on the snow gasping pointing the gun at corbetts
midsection

			stay put
					
					corbett
			you got the belly to look me in
			the eye and pull the trigger

eric cocks the guns hammer with his thumb
					
					eric
			be no different than shooting a

the men face off for a tense moment

corbett smiles and zips up his jacket dispelling the
tension  letting the hammer down eric looks back at the
burning plane
					
					eric
			continuing
			next time you want to kill
			yourself dont include me
					
					corbett
			i took the odds on getting down

			you sound like the tourists

			you  you wont make it off this

corbett drops his facade of conviviality  eric is too angry
to be intimidated  he takes the scarf from around his neck
and wraps his ankle with it

			lets go

eric holds his wristwatch up points the hour hand at the
sun counts forward to noon and accordingly makes an
approximation of their direction
					
					eric
			continuing
			last time i checked the flight

			waiting for a goddamn taxi

grimacing with pain he gets up  clutching the magnum he
shoves corbett in front of him and starts walking  corbett
frowns  its tough to trudge through the snow with his
arms cuffed tightly behind his back

eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register
on his face  they wouldnt be farther from the rest of
humanity on another planet  smelling fear on eric corbett
enjoys the view  and waits

95   ext  endicott mountains  later that day

the endicott range is full of jagged peaks icy streams and
gnarled tundra valleys  squinting in the glare of the snow
eric and corbett trek through the grandiose gates of the
arctic area  the smoldering plane wreckage is a hardwon
snowcovered mile behind them

intricate patterns of fragmented rock strips of scruffy
tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely foreboding
mosaics upon the landscape  the air is still  the silence

is itself a disconcerting presence  ten miles ahead and two
thousand feet lower the forest begins  but here on the
rock face of the mountains eric and corbett might as well
be in a desert

determined and dour eric pushes on
					
					corbett
			continuing
			why in hell you care enough about

its all academic  the sheer magnitude of the surroundings
makes them feel theyre the only people in the world
									
									dissolve to

96   ext  endicott mountains  dusk

the sun drops behind the mountains  a wind whips up
chilling the men through their clothing  eric tries not to
shiver  he spies a small rock formation with a granite
elbow protruding from it making an enclosed triangle of
solid rock
					
					eric
			well stop here dig out a snow
			shelter
					
					corbett
			snow shelter  okay  you dig
			ill have a little sitdown

corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while eric digs near
the rocks  although he knows corbett is testing his every
move eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him
					
					corbett
			continuing
			even in the drifts this snows
			too powdery to make a shelter
			when youre done jerking around
			reach down the back of my coat

eric approaches him suspiciously  he puts his hand down
through corbetts collar  something is stowed inside a
homemade flap in the lining of his coat  eric pulls out a

folded nylon tarp with twine threaded through corner
eyeholes  he shakes the eight by eight orange tarp open

eric and corbett have stretched the tarp out tentstyle next
to the granite rock formation making a minimal but
functional refuge from the cold night

98   int  nylon shelter

the men huddle inside the tarp  eric keeps a wary eye on
corbett  at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake
eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it  its swollen to the
size of a softball

while poking the 357 in corbetts ribs eric onehandedly
unlocks corbetts right manacle pulls his arm through the
granite elbow then locks it back up again  hes learning
									
									fade to

99   ext  haul road  dream   as in scene 3

eric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit

ahead and his prey becomes visible  but it isnt a wolf
its corbett  his hands and face are covered in blood

light and color

eric and corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream
bisecting their path  its simple  to continue they have
to cross it  corbett takes in the scenery in no particular
hurry  frustrated but making dead sure hes always got the
drop on corbett  eric puts a tentative foot on the ice
					
					corbett

frowning corbett tentatively steps onto the ice and inches
across the fifteen feet to the other bank

he turns and indeed eric is right behind him

			wait til im across

eric doesnt want to be too far from his prisoner  he keeps
coming  the ice groans and hisses under their weight

corbett is three feet from solid ground  he drops to his
knees then stomach and rolls like a log the rest of the
way

eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across  the ice
makes an ominous cracking and water begins to seep through
air holes

standing corbett weighs his chances of bolting from eric

eric crawls doubletime  he makes it onto solid ground just
as the ice under him breaks off in a big thin clear plate

closer

eric sits on some rocks  corbett glares it him
					
					corbett
			most dangerous thing in the

106  ext  endicott mountains  day

eric limps further down from the mountains  corbett keeps
pace in front of him and his magnum  as their altitude
decreases there is ever thicker vegetation

their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the
distance  the magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings
cannot be overstated  picture the most rustic overwhelming
wilderness imaginable and then make it ten times larger

new angle  later

the mens way is once again interrupted this time by a
sheer granite drop the steep decline would be tough to
negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear
corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head
					
					corbett
			have to backtrack find another
			way down
					
					eric
			forget it  it would take days
					
					corbett
			assessing the drop
			going to be a bit of a challenge
			with handcuffs on

eric realizes hes right  after some deliberation eric
cautiously approaches him  with the 357 cocked and ready
he undoes one of the cuffs leaving them hanging from
corbetts wrist  he then unthreads the nylon twine from
corbetts tarp

angle  granite sheer

eric and corbett are tied belt to belt with the nylon
rope  corbett inches down first feet spread for maximum
footing gloveless hands grasping at anything

eric mimics corbetts moves and follows the same path
unable to grasp the rocks effectively he stops and takes
his gloves off  continuing he winces  the rock is cold
and sharp  his hands are soon numb and bloody  even in the
dry belowfreezing air eric is sweating

he looks down and hangs on more tightly  sliding to level
ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger
corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks  eric
is right above him
								
								continued
106  continued

suddenly corbetts foot slips  his right hand
instinctively goes for a hold  the dangling handcuffs snare
on a protuberance knocking him off balance

the fulcrum of corbetts body leans out into the empty air
eric moves down a little braces himself and extends his
leg giving corbett something to grab  corbett takes hold
of erics shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock
wall  adrenaline screams through erics system

corbett looks up at eric  a careless move will send them
both tumbling  eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits
for the worst

after a long moment corbett regains his balance and lets go
of erics foot  he continues his descent  eric lets out
his breath and tries to swallow  his mouth is as dry as the
granite

107  ext  treeline  later that day

handcuffed again corbett hikes in front of eric along the
top of some foothills  now and again he glances behind
gauging erics weariness waiting for a moments
carelessness  around them there is heavy vegetation now 
snowcovered sedge tussocks kneedeep muskeg and twisted
thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through
above them ominous clouds and sharp cold winds are coming
down from the north

but below a mile ahead the edge of the forest is like the
hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward
the combination of altitude and latitude creates an
amazingly sharp topographical dividing line  within a few
thousand yards the landscape abruptly changes from scrub
brush to thick coniferous forest
					
					corbett
			better get into those trees
			before that squall blows down

then corbett pauses as a walloping sound echoes across the
foothills

just ahead two enormous bull moose are fighting  they ram
each other with sixfootwide antlers

corbett stares transfixed admiring
					
					corbett
			you talk about ecology  there
			it is

eric turns surprised at corbetts unabashed awe

catching the mens smell the moose bound away and the spell
is broken

111  ext  forest  campsite preparation montage  evening

the storm brings gusting winds and belowzero temperatures
eric and corbett move through the storm in slow motion
both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common
enemy  the snow and wind cut through their clothing like
razors  they poke around for dead wood with which to make a
fire  the trees are small and healthy little is found
					
					corbett
			shouts over wind
			just gather birch  itll smoke
			like hell but itll burn green

awestruck by the intensity of the storm eric tears branches
from birch trees and piles them in corbetts handcuffed
arms

they hurry back to the nylon tarp strung between two tree
trunks flapping violently in the storm  hunching against
the wind eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his
pocket for some precious matches  his fingers are so cold
he cant hold them and he drops several in the wet snow

angry he shoots a look at corbett corbett is holding his
hands inside his coat  he pulls them out and quickly takes
the remaining matches from eric

crouching down back to the wind corbett grasps a match
between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it  he holds
the flame next to the kindling  it doesnt catch fire
immediately  corbett lets the match burn out against his
fingers  he tries another match  this time a flame takes
hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment

on his knees and elbows corbett nurses along the tiny fire
eric cant control his shivering  he gets on his knees next
to corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the
wind  corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame not

burns along nicely

rages outside  eric empties his pockets of eskimo potato
reindeer lichens bistsort sorrel and other plants for his
dinner

corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree
branch and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next
to a small animal burrow outside the shelter  a squirrel
sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate

corbett sits catlike ready to pounce  eric grimaces as
corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrels squeals os
abruptly cease

			sure  the peoples friend  kiss
			your ass with precision if
			theres a vote in it


corbett eats the squirrel eskimostyle  raw  he uses the
knife like a native too holding the meat in his teeth
then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice
eric stares disgusted  off his look
					
					corbett
			continuing
			always eat your meat raw when the
			weathers cold  does you more
			good long as the entrails look
			clean

corbett uses snow and the squirrels fur to wipe the blood
from his face then wipes the knife off and lays it open
next to his leg
					
					eric
			ill hold onto that

with a wry smile corbett pushes it back over to eric
while eric eats his dinner corbett listens to the storm and
watches him eat
					
					corbett
			sure love to know where you fit
			in up here
					
					eric
			im here to do my job
					
					corbett

corbett smiles  maybe hes beginning to understand eric
					
					corbett
			folks come to alaska for a real
			short list of reasons  money
			adventure  solitude  those
			cover most everyone  but
			frontiers also draw another type
			of man  one with a demon in his

			it to rest
					
					eric
			yeah
					
					corbett
			yep  sometimes they do but
			usually they end up crazy or
			dead

eric ponders corbetts words as he eats

114  int  the turtle  night

anne marie is frantic with worry  she has the amfm radio
on for company
					
					radio vo
			this is tundra topics on
			kfar  remember as the nights
			get longer be sure to stay on a
			regular sleep schedule  the
			depression from the coming of

anne marie tunes the radio to pipeline of the north on
kiak

			john byers was hospitalized in
			fairbanks today for an infection
			in an abscessed tooth  mr byers
			had a toothache and attempted to
			remove the tooth himself with a
			pair of pliers

suddenly a bump rocks the turtle  someone is outside
startled anne marie turns the lights off and looks out the
window

no sign of a vehicle or a person  as she pulls on her
parka she glances at the big rifle leaning against the
wall but doesnt touch it

115  ext  the turtle

her visitor whoever it is is behind the turtle  anne
marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead

new angle

a foraging grizzly sniffs around attracted by the smell of
fresh carrion  wilder  eight feet tall and elevenhundred
pounds its used to having its way  right now its
hungry

with a casual swipe of its paw its massive claws puncture
the turtles aluminum skin popping open the door of the

utility compartment  the bear pokes its head inside and
wilders body slumps out into the snow  the bear pushes at
the corpse with its snout  salivating it prepares to dig
in

anne marie looks around wondering what the hell to do next
wilders snowmobile is a few yards behind her parked
against the side of the turtle  she inches toward it
testily the bear looks up sniffing loudly

keeping her eyes on the bear anne marie feels for the
snowmobile ignition keys  theyre not there  she feels
around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road
flares

anne marie ignites the flares  they illuminate the area
with an eerie reddish glow  she yells at the bear wields
the flares like excalibur and moves forward

the bear reluctant to leave so hearty a prehibernation
meal growls and cocks its head back and forth to assess the
threat  as anne marie inches ahead the bear stands on hind
legs to its full height to meet the challenge
								
								continued
115  continued

anne marie tosses a flare toward the bear  it grunts when
the flare hits it and shuffles backwards  anne marie
throws another flare  with a roar from hell the bear
charges  anne marie falls back  still holding the last
flare shes forced into a crawl space under the turtle

angle  under the turtle

anne marie tries to squeeze out the other side but shes
pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground  the bear
swipes at her its huge paw inches away  anne marie jabs at
the paw with the flare but that only makes the bear more
quarrelsome

she twists around looking for a defense  above her is the
cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the
turtles electrical system  she tugs at it but it wont
budge  the bear sniffs at anne marie with its big wet
snout  anne marie notices warning a sign on a control
valve
					
					  danger
					
					  black water
					
					  untreated sewage

grimacing she tries to turn the valve  after much effort
it snaps and opens releasing a stream of fetid sewage

wider

the bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff  howling
unhappily it backs away grunting and sneezing  greatly
offended its appetite gone it lopes into the forest

anne marie squirms out from under the turtle and gagging
from the horrible smell pulls off her wet parka
									
									cut to

116  ext  woods near the turtle  series of shots  night

wearing one of erics coats anne marie stands in the center
of three similarlysized trees  a flare supplies the light
the big remington rifle leans against the tree closest to
her

she tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a
sturdy tree branch twentyfive feet from the ground  then
she throws the other end over an opposing branch and
stretches the rope like a clothesline
								
								continued
116  continued

she attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the
first and throws it over a third tree branch midway between
the other two  she kneels and ties something below frame to
the crosslength rope

pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope she hoists
something heavy to the level of the branches  the flare
burns out plunging the area into darkness

anne marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and
nervously tries to light another flare  as she does the
forest seems closer sinister filled with lurking ogres
seized with an instinctual fear she grabs the rifle and
runs back to the turtle
									
									fade to

117  ext  endicott foothills  day

the storm has passed leaving a fresh covering of powdery
snow in drifts like sand dunes  eric and corbett trek
toward devils cauldron through the everthickening forest
corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in
strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses  eric using a
tree branch as a walking stick still limps on his sore
ankle  for the first time he keeps the magnum stuck in his
waistband
					
					corbett
			theres a cabin maybe twenty
			miles south of here
					
					eric
			kneels to adjust his ankle
				wrap
			too bad were heading west
					
					corbett
			theres a snowmobile inside a
			day we could be on the yukon  i
			got money there  remember that
			five thousand  make it ten  be
			smart  take it and walk away
					
					eric
			bristling
			you dont get it do you

corbett takes advantage of erics poor peripheral vision
from the visor by kneeing eric in the face  eric falls
backwards into the snow  corbett takes off like a
jackrabbit  eric spits out some blood shakes the stars out
of his eyes and yanks the 357 from under his coat
								
								continued
117  continued

					
					eric
			continuing
			stop

corbett bounds through the snow dodging trees and
snowcovered rocks

eric squeezes off a shot and is startled by the recoil and
the blast  he scrambles to his feet and shoots again

corbett zigzags and disappears from sight over a snowbank

new angle  follow corbett

corbett runs over a frozen stream invisible under a cover
of snow  suddenly the ice shatters under him  corbett is
immersed in frigid waistdeep water  he gasps from the
sudden temperature drop

eric

hobbles after him cussing bitterly to himself

corbett

crawls to solid ground  disoriented from the shock to his
system he rolls over to catch his breath

wider

eric appears over a snowbank

corbett tries to run but his frozen waterlogged legs feel
like pig iron  stumbling and panting he looks for a safe
place to cross the stream  eric easily catches up to him
corbett sits in the snow shivering  he looks up as eric
trots over

eric glares at corbett and rubs the bruise on his cheek
					
					corbett
			nothing personal  just wanted to
			see what youd do

noticing corbetts sopping legs eric becomes furious
					
					corbett
			continuing
			have to get these wet things off

fuming eric helps corbett up

118  ext  endicott foothills  evening

the sun sinks below the horizon creating across the
mountains a spectacular show of color and shadows  the wind
howls

119  int  nylon shelter

eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter  corbetts
pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it  he
huddles under the tarp covered by his coat drowsy and
listless
					
					eric
			stay awake  you want to go
			hypothermic
					
					corbett
			if that means freeze my balls
			off no thanks
			yawns
			ill be okay

eric examines him  corbetts skin is white and rigid his
lips are pale blue  he scowls at eric
					
					corbett
			continuing
			told you im fine
					
					eric
			holds up three fingers
			how many do you see
					
					corbett
			irritable
			what  fuck off  save yourself
					
					eric
			you dont feel cold
					
					corbett
			its a spring day

he starts to doze off  the shivering hes been repressing
now racks his body  eric sits him up closer to the fire
and puts his own parka over corbetts shoulders  with his
foot eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to
								
								continued
119  continued

corbetts legs  eric rubs his arms and hands but it isnt
enough  eric loathes the specter of death even corbetts
he shakes him trying to keep him awake
					
					eric
			wake up goddammit  youve got
			classic hypothermia 
			crankiness fatigue cant feel
			your coldness  worst thing you
			can do is fade out

corbett is headed someplace far away  sighing eric turns
him so his back faces the fire  he unbuttons corbetts
shirt then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across corbett
eric gasps  corbett feels like a slab of ice  corbetts
teeth chatter  hes completely unconscious
					
					eric
			continuing
			one more thing  this doesnt
			mean were going steady

dissolve to

later corbett rests fitfully  it could go either way
eric chews on some roots and pokes at the fire to keep it
lively

dissolve to

its night  some color has returned to corbetts skin
eric turns as corbett mumbles and clutches at the front of
his shirt  his eyes open  he tries to sit up but hes too
weak

120  ext  haul road  the turtle  night

the aurora makes a dazzling display in the cold clear sky
below the only light on the endless expanse of dark earth
comes from the turtle

flashlight in hand wearing one of erics coats anne marie
refuels the generator  something catches her eye 

anne maries pov

in the distance headlight beams jostle along the haul road

back to scene

anne marie caps the diesel fuel can and stows it away

			its about time

she hurries back into the turtle



121  int  the turtle

anne marie brushes her hair and makes herself presentable

122  ext  the turtle

the vehicle gets closer  its the trappers jeep  it slows
and parks on the haul road next to the turtle

123  int  the turtle

anne marie peers out the window  she gasps as she
recognizes the jeep  ducking from sight below the window
she grabs erics coat and hurries into the rear module

124  ext  the turtle

mitchell stays in the jeep  viking bob and lemalle get out
and walk cautiously toward the turtle

lemalle stands midway between the jeep and the turtle
cradling his carbine  viking bob goes up the steps

125  int  the turtle  rear module

anne marie remembers something she shouldve taken with her
the rifle  too late  she hears viking bobs footsteps os
come up the wooden stairs outside

126  ext  the turtle

viking bob knocks on the front door  he peers through the
sheer curtain on the window into the front module
					
					viking bob
			hullo

he shrugs to the others then tries the door  its
unlocked

mitchell gets out of the jeep spits and follows the others
in his hand close to the colt peacemaker strapped to his
leg

127  int  the turtle

anne marie climbs out a window in the back  she closes it
behind her just as viking bob pokes his head in the rear
module

the trappers snoop around noticing that the coffee pot is
still warm etc  the emptiness is ominous  lemalle picks
up the big remington bear rifle  he opens the breech to
determine if its loaded and sniffs the barrel to see if
								
								continued
127  continued

its recently been fired  viking bob notices the damaged
radio
					
					viking bob
			somebody left in a big hurry
			to lemalle
			check outside

128  ext  the turtle

lemalle goes outside and shines his flashlight around

new angle

in the back anne marie drags an evergreen tree branch
behind her to cover her tracks in the snow then climbs into
the utility compartment where wilders body was stored

a moment later lemalle comes around the corner  he notices
bear tracks and scat from the prior nights visit
					
					lemalle
			calls out to others
			grizzly sign  looks fresh

viking bob and mitchell converge with lemalle  they point
their flashlights around spotting footprints and marks
going off into the woods

129  ext  woods near the turtle

tense and silent the trappers follow the marks  a breeze
rustles the needles of the evergreens around them  they
stop at the point the footprints end  a rhythmic creaking
above them makes lemalle shine his light upward

new angle

the light reveals wilders feet swinging back and forth
above their heads  his body is suspended in the manner of a
trail cache  viking bob lets out a startled grunt  he and
mitchell shine their lights on wilders face
					
					mitchell
			its sam wilder
					
					viking bob
			musta wanted to keep him from the
			bears  if ben killed him he
			sure as hell wouldnt hang him up

the trappers look glumly at one another

130  int  utility compartment  the turtle

anne marie jams herself behind a pile of her photo
equipment  she stops as she hears the trappers boots os
crunch in the snow past her and go inside the turtle

131  int  the turtle

the trappers peel off their overcoats  they look around at
the comfortable surroundings
					
					mitchell
			i should get me a job with an oil
			company

he sits on the couch and lays his scrimshaw and engraving
tools out on the coffee table  lemalle helps himself in the
wellstocked larder
					
					lemalle
			i say we eat torch this fuckin

lemalle digs through the cupboards and comes up with a fresh
bottle of scotch
					
					viking bob
			go easy
					
					lemalle
			cool out  i aint about to get

									cut to

132  ext  the turtle  later that night

flashlight in hand gloriously drunk lemalle stumbles
outside  he crosses to the jeep to grab a box of twinkies
and as long as hes at it take a leak in a snowbank
blearyeyed he notices the damage to the utility
compartment inflicted by the bear

he walks to it stepping over the bear scat  he marvels at
the size and depth of the clawmarks
								
								continued
132  continued
					
					lemalle
			big mother musta wanted something
			real bad in here

lemalle tries the door but its jammed shut  he tucks his
flashlight under his arm and gives another tug  this time
the door cracks open

closer  his pov

he peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in
a pair of eyes stare back at him

wider

lemalle jumps back startled and pulls out his knife   he
tries the door again  it wrenches open

hes looking at his own face in one of anne maries
mirrored photo reflector boards

letting his breath out lemalle pokes around the equipment
in the compartment  ever larcenous he pulls a few items
out examines them and disinterested leaves them in the
snow  doing so he comes close to uncovering anne marie
who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the
compartment

nothing in the compartment catches lemalles fancy  leaving
the door hanging open he wanders away

133  int  utility compartment  the turtle

after hes gone anne marie reaches over and closes the
door  she can hear the trappers os conversation inside
					
					viking bob os
			i know in my gut he was here
			first light we try to get scent

sighing anne marie stuffs her hands inside her parka and
tries to get comfortable  its going to be a long night
									
									fade to

134  ext  endicott foothills  dawn

eric and corbett wearily trudge through the woods  corbett
has the tarp wrapped around him for extra warmth  as he
walks he sniffs at one of erics eskimo potato roots and
takes a tentative nibble

they walk in silence  corbett tightens the tarp against the
cold air and looks at eric
					
					corbett
			continuing
			dont judge me  youre a joke

					eric
			yeah it is fucked up  but its

eric smashes his fist into corbetts face  corbett reels
back more surprised than hurt  eric moves in furiously
throwing punches  corbett plows his clenched fists into
erics midsection doubling him over  gasping eric rams
his head into corbett and they fall into the snow

despite the handcuffs corbett gets a few blows in  they
wrestle fiercely and eric ends up on top of corbett  hes
about to throw another punch when corbett looks up at him

eric lowers his fist and climbs off of corbett  corbett
gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence

135  ext  devils cauldron  day

sunday morning  chimney smoke rises straight up in the
still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging
above the devils cauldron valley

a scratchy recording of a hymn we will gather at the
river plays through a pa system echoing forlornly off the
hills  the people of devils cauldron walk through the new
snow to the center of the settlement  some older women
mostly head for the dance hall where the hymn originates

136  int  dance hall

the women sing along with the hymn  they face a shelf
holding the pa a rusty tv and record player  and in front
of the shelf an unmanned pulpit

137  ext  devils cauldron

the men including neff split off from their mates and go
into the maqi

primitive steam bath   kenai sits closest to the fire  his
thick glasses are steamed up but he finally looks warm

					viking bob
			exasperated
			what you gonna do with it  large
			bores for shit on small game

to demonstrate he rapidfires several shots from the hip
taking the radio antenna off the roof of the turtle
shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession and
blasting the door latch off the utility compartment

pleased lemalle slams back the bolt ejecting a spent
shell  he glances curiously at the door of the utility
compartment and starts toward it

lemalle climbs into the back of the jeep  with viking bob
driving they pull away

grinning maliciously lemalle hangs the remington out the
window as they retreat  taking careful aim he shoots

142  ext  the turtle

lemalles bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator
the kerosene fumes explode splattering burning kerosene on
the rear module of the turtle

the trappers dont slow down to enjoy the show  viking bob
hurries on to more important business

143  int  utility compartment  the turtle

as soon as the sound of the jeep fades away anne marie
clambers out of the utility compartment  haggard and numb
with cold she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously
devours the rear module  shielding her face from the
flames anne marie reaches under the accordion cover between
the modules  with great effort she unbolts the coupling
bracket

144  int  diesel rig  the turtle

anne marie starts the engine slams it into gear and
lurches the front module away from the burning rear module
she shuts the motor off and trying to hold back the tears
watches the rear module burning
									
									dissolve to

145  ext  devils cauldron  night

bone weary eric and corbett walk toward town staying on
the outskirts to avoid being seen  they look at one another
 this moment seemed impossible not very long ago  no one
seems to notice as they limp into wilders cabin



146  int  wilders cabin

its dark  eric locks corbett up in the holding cell not
noticing that corbett seems almost pleased to be there  he
blocks the windows pumps up the pressure on the white gas
lantern and heads back outside again

through his pockets for some food  all he comes up with is
the stump of a candy bar  viking bob looks at him
impatiently
					
					viking bob
			look we pull bens ass out of

			insulted
			im right fuckin here with you

to prove his point lemalle trots from dwelling to dwelling
looking through windows and letting himself in through any
unlocked door  this proves fruitless so he lets out a
frustrated yell  pointing the remington skyward he lets
off a couple thunderous shots that echo back off the
foothills

cautioning her to stay put he crawls to the window and
tries to see through the snowfall  after a moment of

the drone of the approaching plane is ever louder  kenai
stands and pulls on a succession of sweaters  dixie looks
at him

he straps on a holster under his sealskin coat

195  ext  devils cauldron  airstrip  long shot

the big 4prop plane is about to touch down on the far side
of the snowcovered airstrip

196  int  dance hall

anne marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside

197  ext  hot springs spa

lemalle follows the footprints to the door eric left ajar
he peers inside

198  int  hot springs spa

its tombquiet except for water dripping and pipes
creaking  lemalle looks around  the sound of a small ding
against metal above him gets his attention

he sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him
he finds a metal ladder slings his rifle over his shoulder
and climbs up  hearing another sound on the far side of the
catwalk he hurries across holding onto the pipes for
balance

lemalle is directly above the huge central pool  he ducks
to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling
to a dark corner below  suddenly the twine snaps tight
pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling  the door
swings down and knocks lemalle off the catwalk  with a
yelp he splashes into the water below

new angle

hidden in the shadows eric drops the end of the twine and
rushes toward the front door with corbett in tow
					
					eric
			to corbett
			thatll keep him out of the cold

lemalle

climbs out of the central pool soaked   he pulls his wet
jacket off and furiously throws it down



199  ext  hot springs spa

eric leads corbett around the back of the spa  a gunshot
rings out nearby and a bullet hits the wall above erics
head

mitchell

has seen their faint silhouettes through the snow  he
purposely shoots over their heads so he doesnt hit corbett

angle behind hot springs spa

eric and corbett crouch down and double back   they are
once again swallowed up by the snowfall

200  ext  alley

viking bob follows their footprints in between the
buildings  he continues to a point where they converge to
one set then stop  he smiles at the naivete of erics
ploy  looking at the boardwalk railing above he assumes
eric and corbett have swung over it onto the icedover
boardwalk  pleased with his deduction viking bob continues
along the alley

snap  viking bob lets out a horrible howl and falls on his
back in the snow  biting into his right calf is a huge
conibear leg trap  in extreme pain he struggles to lever
it open with the barrel of his rifle

201  ext  kenais general store

corbett shoots eric a dangerous look as viking bobs cries
carry though the town
					
					eric
			hell live

202  ext  alley

hearing viking bobs cries mitchell backtracks and rushes
to viking bobs aid  between them they manage to yawn open
the jaws of the trap and free viking bobs leg  viking bob
tries to walk but the leg wont support him  the bone is
broken  bitterly frustrated he waves mitchell on  in
agony viking bob eases down in the snow  he tears a strip
of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the
bleeding

203  ext  hot springs spa

anne marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip
suddenly the hot springs door bursts open and lemalle
lunges at her  stripped of his wet clothes hes wrapped
								
								continued
203  continued

in blankets and furs his feet protected by sacks lashed to
them  his wet body and hair steams in the frigid air

anne marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from
him  she falls hard on her back knocking her wind out
scrambling for footing in the snow lemalle drops his rifle
he comes at her again  anne marie moves away and pulls the
44 magnum out  lemalle stops and glares at her
					
					anne marie
			gasping
			dont make me shoot

she gets up keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him
lemalle glowers menacingly
					
					anne marie
			continuing
			were going to sams cabin  you
			can stay in the jail until this
			is over

lemalle slowly crouches down for his rifle  anne marie
wields the handgun at him but he doesnt stop
					
					lemalle
			want to chance it with that
			hogleg  you cant even hold it
			up  better drop me first shot
			bitch or ill rip your fuckin
			lungs out

taunting sneering lemalle stares her down  anne marie is
paralyzed  feeling that hes won lemalle wraps his bony
fingers around the stock of the remington

anne marie closes her eyes and fires  pulling the rifle
close lemalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet  anne
marie fires again and again  shot lemalle hobbles away
leaving a trail of blood in the snow  numb anne marie lets
her arm fall

204  ext  boardwalk near wilders cabin

eric looks around at the sound of the shooting fearing the
worst  he pulls corbett off the boardwalk and they cut
across open ground toward the airstrip depot

205  int  hot springs spa

ransacking for things to wear  kenai turns startled when
he hears footsteps  its neff and meyerling

206  ext  yards behind airstrip depot

through the snow eric can see the faint outline of the
plane on the runway  he and corbett hurry toward the back
of the airstrip depot

as they wend their way through the junkfilled yards eric
catches a glimpse of movement around a corner reflected in
a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper

206  continued

erics pov  reflection

peacemaker in hand mitchell is behind the depot coming
right for them

wider

eric takes out the homemade flashbomb  he lights it tosses
it toward mitchell and covers his eyes  it explodes with a
muffled pop and a bright flash of white light

mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes  the flash
has temporarily clouded his vision

eric moves corbett to another approach to the depot and
waits for mitchell to move on

207  ext  rear wall of airstrip depot

mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his
shoulder stops him  its lemalle oblivious to the profuse
bleeding from his right shoulder  mitchell blinks still
having trouble seeing  lemalle gestures for him to be quiet
and points in eric and corbetts direction
					
					lemalle
			whispers
			over there

he hoists his remington
					
					mitchell
			whispers
			hold it  you might hit ben
					
					lemalle
			bullshit  i hit what im aiming
			at
					
					mitchell
			let em come closer first

but lemalle is too anxious  he swings the rifle up
lefthanded and shoots

new angle

the bullet just misses eric  he panics and wildly returns
fire with the 357

angle on eric and corbett

as they hear lemalles labored footsteps run past them
nearby  eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the
depot  there is no further movement

eric waits a moment then leads corbett cautiously toward
the depot

209  ext  rear wall of airstrip depot

reaching the rear wall they practically stumble over
something  its mitchell lying on the ground near the
wall badly wounded by erics barrage  eric gasps
anguished corbett kneels next to mitchell  mitchell pulls
him closer
					
					mitchell
			glad to see youre okay  i told
			lemalle not to shoot
			tries to smile
			had some fine seasons didnt
			we

mitchells grasp on corbetts coat relaxes as he dies
horrified eric stares at the man he killed  noticing the
scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from mitchells
pocket corbett picks it up
					
					corbett
			to eric
			fifteen years on the trail with
			this man i never saw him rise to
			anger

glaring at eric corbett dips his hand in mitchells blood
and suddenly smears it across erics mouth  repelled eric
pulls back
					
					corbett
			continuing bitterly
			your first kill  how does it
			taste

wiping his face sickened and desolate eric has no reply

wider

then from somewhere close by lemalle fires at them  eric
stuffs the 357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the
padlock off the back door of the depot  he pushes corbett
inside



210  int  cargo plane  cockpit

the ponytailed exhippie pilot shuts his engines off and
removes his walkman headphones  hearing lemalles
continuing gunshots the pilot pulls his door closed and
turns on his twoway radio
					
					pilot
			into radio mic
			circle this is bmy955  i just
			touched down in devils cauldron
			nobodys here to greet me like
			usual and theres gunfire  im
			getting scarce

with that he starts his engines up again

cut to eric in depot

who turns startled when he hears the engines coughing to
life os

211  int  cargo plane  cockpit

the pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take
off  he looks up surprised as the passenger door suddenly
opens

wider

anne marie slides onto the seat
					
					anne marie
			you cant leave yet
					
					pilot
			its my responsibility to get
			this aircraft out of here safely

anne marie points the 44 at him
					
					pilot
			continuing
			you got to be kidding
					
					anne marie
			leave the engines idling  go
			back and open the side door


shaking his head and muttering the pilot unfastens his seat
belt climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment
and obliges the little lady with the big gun



212  int  airstrip depot

the depot as temporarylooking as the rest of devils
cauldron is a boxcarshaped loading dock and warehouse with
a corrugated steel roof  boxes wood palettes and hand
dollies are piled haphazardly about

eric and corbett navigate through the piles of boxes
inching toward the front door  the door leading to the
plane

suddenly a string of overhead lights come on  eric goes
for the 357 then stops when he sees meyerling kenai and
neff have come in the front door  kenai stomps his feet and
shivers  grandstanding for the others meyerling steps
forward
					
					meyerling
			nobody wants any more killings
			we all agree to that correct
			no one argues
			thats good  now eric youre
			gonna hand your prisoner over to
			us
					
					eric
			fuck you
					
					meyerling
			this isnt your concern  its
			over here and now
					
					corbett
			to meyerling
			sure when you put a bullet in my
			back on the way out  easier for
			all involved
					
					meyerling
			not a bad idea  face it ben
			theres no room in alaska for you
			any more

meyerling pokes with his foot at a tippedover rack of
eskimo paraphernalia  masks furs big skin drums fish
and bearspears
					
					meyerling
			continuing
			youre as antiquated as this
			shit

meyerling moves toward corbett but eric stands in his way
								
								continued
212  continued
					
					eric
			keep back
					
					corbett
			youre quite a piece of work
			meyerling  the tide changes you
			ride right along with it

eric looks at neff
					
					eric
			neff you know better than
			this
					
					neff
			youre an outsider mr desmond
			step aside stay out of it

kenai and neff move in with meyerling  eric stands his
ground and reaches for the 357 in his belt

new angle

suddenly lemalle stumbles into the depot the blankets and
furs dragging at his feet  his right side is bathed in
blood  halffrozen bled dry he looks ready to drop down
dead  in his left hand impossibly he still clutches the
massive remington

he hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he bolts a
round into the chamber with his injured right arm  bracing
himself he levels the rifle at eric

hearing the action of the rifle eric turns

corbett reaches down grabs a rusty eskimo spear in both his
handcuffed hands and hurls it

there is a deafening roar as lemalles rifle discharges

lemalle flies back from the recoil  and from the spear
stuck clear through his chest

some packing material above erics head smolders ignited by
the muzzle blast

new angle

there is a moment of silence  corbett looks at the other
weapons near him and then at meyerling  threatened
meyerling pulls out a 380 automatic  before eric can do
anything meyerling fires

the impact of the bullet throws corbett against some boxes

212  continued  2

with a yell eric jumps meyerling and rips the gun from his
grasp  enraged he pummels meyerling with it until kenai
and neff pull them apart  eric wrenches away from them and
scrambles to his feet with meyerlings gun in his hand
					
					eric
			continuing
			anybody moves and ill shoot

holding the 380 on them eric crosses to corbett  bleeding
from the abdomen hes trying to stand up
					
					eric
			continuing
			can you walk
					
					corbett
			wounds a throughandthrough
			missed my liver i think
					
					eric
			lets get out of here

cautiously backing away from the others eric helps corbett
get up and shuffle toward the os sound of the cargo plane

213  ext  devils cauldron  airstrip

anne marie jumps down from the cockpit  she and eric lift
corbett into the plane

214  ext  cargo plane

as it taxis and lifts off

215  int  cargo plane  aerial shot

while eric takes corbetts handcuffs off anne marie looks
at his wound  he waves her away
					
					eric
			how come you didnt let him shoot
			me
					
					corbett
			softly
			like i said id still be up on
			that mountain frozen solid it
			wasnt for you
					
					eric
			well get you to a hospital soon
			as we get to fairbanks
								
								continued
215  continued
					
					corbett
			so they can patch me up and put
			me in a cage  forget it
			meyerlings right  im a
			dinosaur  greedy bastards like
			him its their turn with this
			land  put me in the woods let
			me live or die on my own

he painfully pulls himself into a sitting position
					
					corbett
			continuing peers out
				window
			look down there tell me what any
			of this matters  struggles of
			men get swallowed by the bigness
			soon there wont be a trace of
			our troubles or us
					
					eric
			youre wrong  everything we do
			leaves its mark  you said it
			yourself  there are hundred
			yearold footprints in the
			tundra

too tired to argue corbett leans back against the window
he takes mitchells scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at
it

extreme close up  the scrimshaw

the exquisitely beautiful and detailed engraving depicts a
grizzly beside a wilderness creek with trees and mountains
in the background

corbett

clutches the scrimshaw in his hand and closes his eyes

new angle  aerial shot

eric sighs as he looks at the blood  mitchells blood 
on the back of his hand  he stares at corbett for a long
moment  then resolved he climbs up front and says
something to the pilot  grumbling the pilot adjusts his
controls

corbett sits up surprised  he and eric exchange a long
look then corbett crosses to the open door and gingerly
steps down onto the snowcovered runway
