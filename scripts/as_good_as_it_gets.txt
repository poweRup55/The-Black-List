               fade in

               int apartment building new york hallway  night

               angle on apartment doorway as it opens and an enormously 
               sweetfaced elder woman steps out bungled up against the 
               cold  turning back to call inside to the unseen love of 
               her long life

                                     sweetfaced woman
                         im just going to get some flowers 
                         dear ill be back in twenty minutes 
                         its tulip season today im so happy

               and now she turns and faces the hallway her sweetness 
               dissolves in a flash replaced by repulsion and that quickly 
               she has reversed herself and reentered her apartment 
               closing the door as we consider her vacated

               pov  melvin udall

               in the hallway well past 50 unliked unloved 
               unsettling a huge pain in the ass to everyone hes ever 
               met right now all his considerable talent and strength is 
               totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator 
               door he holds open

                                     melvin
                         come here sweetheart come on

               on dog

               sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting melvin 
               lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt who 
               has ignores him

                                     melvin
                         wanna go for a ride okay sweetie

               the dog lifts his leg at the precise moment melvin lunges 
               and picks him up with a decisive heft  so that dog urine 
               squirts the hall wall for a second or two the dog sensing a 
               kindred spirit starts to growl and bark

                                     melvin
                              a malevolent tone
                         youve pissed your last floor you 
                         dogeared monkey

               the dog takes a snap at melvin but the man is much meaner 
               and quicker than the dog  he holds his snout shut with his 
               hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute

                                     melvin
                         ill bet you wish you were some sort 
                         of real dog now huh dont worry 
                         this is new york if you can make it 
                         here you can make it anywhere you 
                         know you ugly smelly fuck

               and with that he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets 
               go we hear a fading series of pleading anoooos from the 
               dog fade to nothingness as another apartment door opens 
               emitting the loud sounds of a party and simon nye early 
               30s simon has been born and raised with gothic horror and 
               its strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a 
               gifted decent man

               int apartment building new york hallway  night

               frantic he bolts into the hall melvin is just about to 
               enter his apartment

                                     simon
                         verdell here good doggie

               he notices melvin at the far end of the hall

                                     simon
                         mr udall excuse me hey there
                              as melvin turns

                         whats he look like

               melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is 
               directly opposite simons

                                     simon

                         those wide noses perfect for smelling 
                         trouble and prison food

                         hope you find him i love that dog

               simon terminally nonconfrontational still finds himself 
               compelled to turn back toward melvin

                                     simon
                              directly
                         you dont love anything mr udall

               simon closes his door leaving melvin alone in the hallway

                                     melvin
                         i love throwing your dog down the 
                         garbage chute

               int melvins apartment bathroom  night

               melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door counting to 
               five with each lock he turns the lights quickly on and off 
               and on five times and makes a straightline towards his 
               bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens the 
               medicine chest

               int medicine chest

               scores of neatly stacked neutrogena soaps he unwraps one  
               begins to wash  discards it  goes through the process 
               two more times

               int simons apartment entrance hall  night

               a group of party goers enters  followed by a handyman 
               holding verdell who looks and finds

               simon

               who looks up  lights up  and tears up as he moves quickly 
               toward the group and his dog

                                     simon
                         thank the good lord wow my

                         he always liked me

               as simon goes past him to take the dog from the handyman

               jackie franks junior partner barking a laugh at the party 
               goer  verdell barking some love as the others greet simon 
               jackie directs the group inside jackie lingers looking on 
               affectionately as simon picks some awful sticky gunk from 
               the dogs body he puts verdell down to reach for his wallet  
               the tiny dog yaps in protest

                                     simon
                         just for a second okay

                                     simon
                              kissing him on the 
                              mouth

                              smiling
                         in the basement garbage bin eating 
                         diaper shit

               simon reacts  then notices the handyman tongue in cheek 
               trying to suppress his amusement

                                     simon
                         go ahead john you earned your fun
                              looking at verdell

                         i mean even if he got on the elevator 
                         how

                         maybe some nice neighbor shoved him 
                         down the garbage chute

                                     simon
                         my god no

               he stares out frank frustrated following

               int melvins apartment  office  night

               quiet  safe  just melvins voice reading aloud as he 
               writes

                                     melvin
                         somewhat in the dark she had 
                         confessed and he had forgiven this 
                         is what you live for he said two 
                         heads on a pillow where there is 
                         only the safety of being with each 
                         other how she wondered could she 
                         find such hope in the most shameful 
                         part of her

               he barely reacts as we hear a loud knocking at he reads

                                     simon os
                         mr udall

               but melvins into it his fingers flying as he reads

                                     melvin
                         at last she was able to define love 
                         love was

               more knocking

                                     simon os
                         mr udall id like to talk to you

                                     melvin
                         love was

               he almost has the rest of the sentence  the meaning of 
               love  but the knocking throws him

                                     melvin
                         sonofabitchpansyassedstool
                         pusher

               he burst from his chair

               int apartment building new york  hallway  night

               as simon hears melvin through the door and takes a step back

               melvin throws open the door he looks demonic

                                     melvin
                              loud and angry
                         yeeeess

                                     simon
                         maybe this can wait

               frank signals encouragement as melvin opens the door

                                     simon
                         i found verdell mr udall

                         well thats a load off

               melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to close 
               the door when simon has another burst of bravery

                                     simon
                         did you do something to him

                                     melvin

                         hanky against your face because the

               frank waits patiently as melvin jerks his door back open

               a crowded and dirty street and here comes melvin his walk 
               is brisk  an animal wanting to pass through the danger 
               without giving off the scent of its mounting fear at times 
               he places his palms together and extends his arms cutting a 
               path through people we will be very pointed in the fact 
               that he avoids stepping on cracks

               closer on melvin

               his eyes focused on the terrain

               int carols restaurant  day

               carol connelly talks with another mother  a customer you 
               would not guess it but her working hours tend to be the 
               most carefree time of the day she is telling a story about 
               her son for the umpteenth time

                                     carol
                              to the mothers little

               the mother nods too sympathetically that she does but carol 
               interrupts her

                                     carol
                         no no no i got a date tonight

                         eat everything

               melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a table 
               towards the back and is obviously surprised to find a man 
               and woman sitting at the table

                                     woman
                         it just came out of me i said you 
                         love me the way a remote control 
                         loves a tv as long as i switch every 
                         time

                                     her male companion
                         wonderful

                                     melvin
                         people who talk in metaphors can 
                         shampoo my crotch
                              on their look
                         eat up

               they turn away  melvin walks a few paces to the waitress 
               station where two waitresses lisa and carol are talking

                                     lisa
                         pay me back next week

                                     carol

                         the rules oh excuse me melvin

               she puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of 
               the way he gulps at the contact since no one else ever 
               touches him but covers his selfconsciousness

                                     melvin
                         im starving

                                     carol
                              firmly to lisa
                         will you please take it

               melvin intentionally moves a step in her path with stealth 
               so that she must touch him again to get him out of the way

                                     lisa
                         this way you take a cab home so you 
                         have time to get ready for the date

                                     carol
                         ready is not my problem

               she barks a mirthless though hearty laugh if we could read 
               melvin which we cant wed see him unsettled by the date 
               talk to carol he is as harmless as furniture

                                     carol
                              to melvin

                         says mom i promise not to get a 
                         fever or cough during your date

               the other waitresses and the short order cook all go awww

                                     carol
                         i know hes just the best

                                     melvin

                                     carol

                         table behave this once you can 
                         sit at someone elses station

               the two waitresses signal their protests

                                     carol
                         or you can just wait your turn

               melvin walks back into the restaurant proper he hangs 
               near their table his discomfort builds in this limbo 
               then

                                     melvin
                         how much more you got to eat your 
                         appetite isnt as big as your noses 
                         is it

                                     woman

                                     man
                              to woman
                         lets go 

               the woman starts to protest

                                     man
                         lets leave were going

               melvin sits down at the table  and takes from his pocket a 
               plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed as he opens 
               his utensils

                                     carol
                         bryan says he doesnt care how long

                         im gonna miss the excitement but 
                         ill handle it

               there is in carols attitude toward melvin some ingredient 
               of selfsatisfaction  that she is the only one in the place 
               who can handle him she starts to clear the table

                                     melvin
                         the tables fine if it had some

                                     carol

               on carol

               stunned some crazy streetfreak has slipped under her perfect 
               guard and momentarily devastated her melvin senses that 
               hes gone way too far he wipes his knife

                                     carol

                         you crazy freak do you

               a beat and then melvin nods hardly breathing  backing 
               down

                                     carol
                         okay ill get your order

               she walks away melvin watches her biting his lower lip he 
               takes some napkins and cleans the table himself

               int carols apartment  night

               she is underneath a younger cuter man on the living room 
               sofa he is expertly into foreplay she begins to make noises 
               as she responds each time startling herself with her own 
               noise and trying to reign it in

               shes two women here  one speeding the pleasure highway  
               the other  functional mom so blown away by the emergence 
               of this sexy self that she laughs the young man stops and 
               looks at her

               his eyes try to burn into hers she is getting excited but 
               doesnt know how to play it he pushes one of the fingers 
               of the hand caressing her face toward her mouth she closes 
               her teeth his fingers attempt opening her mouth she stops 
               him

               and so with earnestness and caring she has transformed the 
               sex into something more intimate  and talk about egg in 
               your beer hotter things are getting wild when we hear from 
               the distance a child spencer calling and coughing

               she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her mother 
               beverly is listening to music on headphones she takes 
               them off when she sees carol then hears the cough

               carol now goes into her sons room

               int spencers room  night

               the room is a monument to horrible sleepless nights two 
               drugstore dehumidifying filters a nebulizer breathing 
               contraption a waste basket a night stand filled with 
               medicine a blood pressure kit along with some stacks of 
               sevenyearold toys and a small tv wedged into the tiny space

                                     spencer
                         im sorry

                                     carol
                         dont be silly how bad

                                     spencer
                         not bad

               carol feels his head thats okay then he coughs  trying 
               to suppress it then a bigger cough they each know what 
               that signals she brings up a waste basket as he throws 
               up she comforts him he apologizes she loves him

               int living room  night

               as she reenters he is taking a cigarette from a pack

                                     carol
                              a bit panicked
                         you cant smoke he cant take 
                         smoke

               he palms the cigarette  resumes making out  his hand 
               squeezes her breast  then he stops and looks at his hand

               she looks down and sees a bit of throwup he picked up while 
               feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme 
               distaste she barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment but 
               speaks the truth

                                     carol
                         oh god i dont even notice 
                         anymore

               she crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel tries to make 
               light

                                     carol

                                     carol
                              perturbed
                         that wasnt an apology

               she notices his demeanor  how he avoids looking at her  
               how uncomfortable he is

                                     carol
                         hey this is just a little throw
                         up  its nothing to be so 
                         embarrassed about really
                              as he shifts 
                              uncomfortably
                         thanks for the dinner let me write

               carl beckons to vincent who joins him trying to conceal his 
               pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest

               int simons apartment  day

               there is a knock at the door  simon crosses to answer he 
               is more relaxed than weve seen him  a man at peace humming 
               to his favorite music talking to his dog who scratches at 
               the door simon opens the door to vincent

                                     simon
                         sorry i was out in the studio doing 
                         some work and i forgot about our 
                         appointment

               he leads the way back toward the studio  chatting away  
               unaware that vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing 
               the expensive apartment

                                     simon
                         i usually make such a big deal out 
                         of picking models but carls so 
                         thorough ill bet he drove you nuts 
                         checking your references

               and he turns and sees the naked model

                                     simon
                              taken aback
                         this isnt a nude

               vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes

                                     vincent
                         just kidding around
                              then mutters
                         so much for love

               int simons apartment  studio minutes later

               vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly 
               uneasy simon

                                     simon
                         exactly what is your previous 
                         experience

                                     vincent
                         how about that pose
                              singsong
                         this is not fun
                              then
                         give me some direction

               vincent has instinctively put simon on the defensive he 
               tries not to show it

                                     simon
                         nothing i just watch till something 
                         strikes me do anything you think of  
                         try different thing until i say 
                         hold that pose then just try and 
                         comfortably hold it

                                     vincent
                              trying another space
                         the fact that you havent said hold 
                         it means i havent done it right 
                         is that correct i havent done it 
                         right

                                     simon
                         no okay what i do is watch and 
                         wait for um you ever watch someone 
                         who doesnt know youre watching 
                         an old woman on a bus kids going to 
                         school and you see this flash come 
                         over them and you know immediately 
                         that it has nothing to do with 
                         anything external  that its in 
                         respond to a private thought they 
                         just had they are just sort of realer 
                         and more alive and when you notice 
                         it so are you if you look at someone 
                         long enough you discover their 
                         humanity

               vincents slackjawed expression changes he feels an 
               intellectual tingle to be having this conversation

                                     vincent
                         i know exactly what you mean

               theres a joy in him at this moment  a bit of purity

                                     simon
                         hold it

               vincent does so  hums a bit of satisfaction to celebrate

               int restaurant  day

               carol and leslie another waitress are waiting for their 
               order at the cappuccino bar leslie is telling the story of 
               the traumatic audition which may have turned her life carol 
               is rapt

               as they pass melvin she does not break stride nor give him 
               notice though she is aware of him  resentfully so  hard 
               not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary 
               on her every action

                                     melvin

                         me listening to the story from the 
                         upset friend now she drops off 
                         the cappuccino and smiles at the 
                         putzette who doesnt even say thank 
                         you no the putzette wanted the 
                         whipped cream so back she goes and 
                         now she has to pass him again and 
                         its getting tougher to make believe

                                     carol
                              reluctant forgiveness

               melvin stops  she passes behind him to deliver an 
               uncharacteristic rabbit punch

               the greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary as simon puts the 
               finishing touches on his painting of vincent a beat and 
               then a strange figure crosses between the camera and the

                         you can put on anything you want 
                         now i might be sort of done here

               vincent quickly and expertly picks a cd to meet his immediate 
               needs and puts it on  dying a little at every second of 
               silence during the transition then loud music plays

               vincent even goosing the volume simon does a take  he 
               gestures vincent to take it down  which vincent does

               angle  apartment

               where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress  
               vincents two friends from the street sweeping all objects 
               into large sacks  one of them doug pauses to look past 
               the terrace to the studio

                                     doug
                         lucky vinnie  hes a painting

               int simons apartment studio  day

               music plays  simon cleaning up his stuff

                                     vincent
                         so youre practically finished huh

                                     simon
                         yes well theres one more stage  
                         trying to figure out if its any 
                         good

               simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another perspective

               he focuses  then the smallest shy nod of selfapproval  
               hes finished vincent is desperate to distract

               close on dog as verdell awakens stretches and pricks his 
               ears he moves quickly to the closed door and starts to 
               frantically scratch attracting simons attention

               as simon keeps walking vincent shoots over to the canvas

                                     vincent
                         wait  i want to see the painting

                                     simon
                         just a second  he has to go

                                     vincent
                         please no

               simon opens the door and verdell shoots out like a bullet

               vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown to see his 
               humanity captured  to be immortalized

               int simons apartment  living room  day

               doug and evan are nearly to the front door as verdell stops 
               them with a vicious growl and bark

               simon is distracted  looking down at his pet so that he 
               continues to walk toward doug and evan not noticing them  
               vincent terribly afraid appears behind simon

                                     simon
                              to vincent
                         whats the matter sweetheart

               he instantly stops shocked frozen his eyes on the stranger 
               doug looking at him now vincent comes in doug greets him

                                     doug
                         yo

               simon turns to vincent

                                     simon
                         why are you doing this

                                     vincent
                         no no no hey that painting in 
                         there i just want to tell you

               now evan appears holding a brass hat rack

                                     evan
                              to vincent
                         what are you doing cruising him

               and he uses the hat rack first as a spear then as a club 
               as the brief savage attack begins

               on verdell

               as he starts to go toward simon and then scurries back in 
               fear the three attackers leave now silence a single bark 
               from verdell

               int apartment building new york  hallway  dusk

               a mass of official people clutter the hall as a gurney is 
               whisked down to the elevator its impossible to tell if 
               simon is awake or dead melvin is standing against the wall 
               near his door a cop ray interviewing him

                                     ray

               int apartment building new york  hallway  another angle  
               night

               frank standing upset anxious holding a dog bowl a leash 
               and verdell who is more upset making pathetic little crying 
               sounds

               as we focus briefly on verdell frank is talking to the 
               sweetfaced woman

                                     sweetfaced woman
                         ive been praying for him since i 
                         heard

                                     sweetfaced woman
                         oh lord  ive got all these antique 
                         knickknacks or else id be glad

                         bathroom no okay thanks
                              as he turns away and 
                              she closes the door 
                              he adds
                         old bitch damn dog

               a short laugh makes us realize that melvin has witnessed and 
               enjoyed franks hostile mutterings

               verdell starts whimpering as a pissed frank approaches his 
               mugger

                                     frank

                                     frank
                         thanks for looking after him

               frank pushes open the door to melvins apartment and places 
               verdell inside

               int melvins apartment  night

               music in as frank pulls the door partially closed to block 
               verdells escape

               the music represents verdells state of mind  trapped in 
               the apartment of the man who tried to kill him we stay with 
               the dog during the os dialogue as his head turns in panic 
               we see his various povs as the dialogue continues os

                                     melvin os
                         hey where are you going you cant

                         tomorrow

               int melvins apartment  living room  night

               melvin enters  the dog cowers in the shadows now melvin 
               sees him

                                     melvin
                         youre dead

               verdell stops  gives melvin wide berth  slinking along 
               the far wall melvin finds verdells fear of him a bit 
               calming

                                     melvin
                         i dont have dog food and i wont 
                         want dog food here youll eat what 
                         we have youll eat what we eat

               melvin exits verdell is in a major funk

               int melvins apartment  kitchen  night

               melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped 
               meat sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the room

                                     melvin
                         dont you touch anything

               int melvins apartment  living room  night

               verdell cringing as his new master approaches  music 
               continues ominously melvin sets the bowl down and exits

               verdell breathes excitedly though looking alternately in all 
               directions his recent past making him suspect this feast 
               is a trick he sniffs cautiously  then dives in  gothic 
               music changing on a dime to score his rapture from os 
               we hear the sound of running water as steam escapes the 
               bathroom  then music out  as melvin returns ignoring 
               verdell he sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly

               its odd verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the 
               bowl with his tail to melvin then melvin begins to play and 
               sing monty pythons always look on the bright side of life 
               with its cheerful whistle refrain verdell looks over with 
               surprise and pleasure but just as mood lifts and warmth 
               threatens melvin stops abruptly turns out the lights and 
               exits

               int hospital corridor  day

               is startled  the bottom drops out  leaving him awed by 
               his misfortune

                         ways to break a date she laughed 
                         the only sensible ambition he had

               carol in bed on the pullout sofa she is in turmoil 
               there is thunder but no rain she walks to the kitchen

               she is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits

               int beverly bedroom  night

               the room is on an air shaft and this is where carol shares a 
               closet with her mother who is now asleep

               carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet leaving her 
               nightgown on the floor there is something sexy here the 
               woman in carol churning she plops on a summer dress  no

               carol crossing to manhattan she looks as if shes on her 
               way to some final exam where she has no notion of the subject

               hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the rains 
               come we are in a familiar neighborhood

               angle on melvin and simons apartment house

               as carol consults the slip of paper with the address on it

               int new york apartment building  night rain

               as she enters building and realizes its not just that shes 
               wet  the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet tshirt 
               contest the fabric clinging to her breasts like the old 
               movie poster of the deep

               int new york apartment building  hallway  night

               as carol passes simons door stands in front of melvins 
               apartment  twists herself to ease nervousness and knocks 
               on the door then rings the bell finally carol hears 
               muffled throat clearing on the other side of the door

                                     carol
                         uh udall

               as we hear him unlock the door carol looks at her breasts 
               and gasps she grasps the fabric and holds it straight out 
               just as melvin opens the door his hair is static city 
               standing on end as he periodically gives it selfconscious 
               pats

                                     carol

                              tearing suddenly
                         though you have no idea what its 
                         like to have a real conversation 
                         with a doctor about spencer

                         that sounds im worried that you 
                         did this because

               she pauses  the beginning of an extraordinarily long 
               silence finally

                                     melvin
                         you waiting for me to say something
                              as she shakes her 
                              head

                         will never ever sleep with you 
                         never not ever

               melvins reaction well hell never get credit for the brief 
               but intense inner struggle  the struggle not to scream 

               not to cry  to process the sudden and stunning hurt during 
               his half turn away from her  and then answer hoarsely

                                     melvin

               carol is amused surprised maybe in some small way ever 
               taken by his style but top priority is clarity

                         complain

               carol is amazed at herself that she might not be able to 
               stem the flow wideeyed with apprehension she looks at 
               her mother who in return only nods permission for carol 
               to let it go a last defiant snort from carol  and then 
               she is overwhelmed the headline comes first

                                     carol

                         inside you all the time without 
                         that you just start thinking about 
                         yourself  and what does that ever

                         moving in the wrong direction 
                         away from when i even remembered 
                         what it was like to have a man to

                         he ought to answer back so i wrote 
                         that
                              reading from the

                         that you had to wait two seconds for 
                         a coffee filler

               melvin wants to disappear but carol is getting into it  
               emotionally moved by her own words

                                     carol
                         and im sorry for never spotting 
                         right there at the table in the 
                         restaurant the human being that had 
                         it in him to do this thing for us 
                         you know what im just going to 
                         start from the beginning i have 
                         not been able to express my 
                         gratefulness to you even as i 
                         look at the word grateful now it 
                         doesnt begin to tell you what i 
                         feel for you

               judge as off the circumstances  a quick burst of ymca

               melvin stops the music and chuckles

                                     melvin
                         just wanted to see what youd do 
                         no we have greatness here

               he goes for another cd labelled for use to pep things up

               the car turns onto seventh as we hear beautifully selected 
               music

                                     carol os
                         hey i like this music

               ext road  day

               a short time later carol is now driving

                                     carol
                         im sure simon they did something 
                         real off for you to feel this way 
                         but when it comes to your partners  
                         or your kid  things will always be 
                         off for you unless you set it 
                         straight maybe this thing happened 
                         to you just to give you that chance

                                     melvin
                         nonsense

                         what melvin has to say raise their 
                         hands

               simon does not raise his hand simon and carol have thus 
               declared their majority

                                     simon
                         do you want to know what happened 
                         with my parents

                                     carol

                         full attention

               ext highway  curbside  convertible  day

               she takes the car curbside and parks

                                     carol
                         now go ahead

               simon looks back at melvin as does carol he looks innocent

               several beats  melvin almost says something  a hidden 
               hand gesture from carol stops him finally

                                     simon
                         well i always painted always and 
                         my mother always encouraged it she 
                         was sort of fabulous about it 
                         actually and she used to i was 
                         too young to think there was anything 
                         at all wrong with it and she was 
                         very natural she used to pose nude 
                         for me and i thought or assumed 
                         my father was aware of it

                                     melvin
                         this stuff is pointless

                                     carol
                         hey  you let him

                         in on one of those painting sessions 
                         when i was nine  and he just started 
                         screaming at her  at us  at evil 
                         and

                                     melvin
                              very quickly
                         my father didnt leave his room 
                         for 11 years  he hit my hand with 
                         a yardstick if i made a mistake on 
                         the piano

                                     carol
                         go ahead simon your father walked 
                         in on you and was yelling and 
                         really come on

                                     simon
                         i was trying to defend my mother and 
                         make peace in the lamest way i 
                         said shes not naked  its art 
                         and then he started hitting me and 
                         he beat me unconscious after that 
                         he talked to me less and less  he 
                         knew before i left for college my 
                         dad came into my room he held out 
                         his hand it was filled with money 
                         a big wad of sweaty money
                              gathers himself
                         and he said to me i dont want you 
                         to ever come back i grabbed him 
                         and i hugged him he turns and 
                         walked out

               carol whose life has been rugged but basic feels as strange 
               as she does moved by simons trauma which is so much more 
               complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles she looks 
               out her window  then kisses her fingers and touches them 
               to simons cheek a nice understated gesture of friendship

                                     carol
                         well you know  i still stay what

                                     melvin

                         style okay here i goes clearly 
                         a mistake
                              this is hell for him
                         i have this  what ailment and 
                         my doctor  a shrink who i used 
                         to see all the time he says 50 or 
                         60 percent of the time a pill can 
                         really help i hate pills very 
                         dangerous things pills hate i 
                         am using the word hate about pills 
                         my compliment is that when you came 
                         to my house that time and told me 
                         how youd never  well you were 
                         there you know the next morning 
                         i started taking these pills

                                     carol
                              a little confused
                         i dont quite get how thats a 
                         compliment for me

               amazing that something in melvin rises to the occasion  so 
               that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly  then

                                     melvin
                         you make me want to be a better man

               carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip 
               under her guard she stumbles a bit  flattered momentarily 
               moved and his for the taking

                                     carol
                         thats maybe the best compliment of 
                         my life

                                     melvin
                         then ive really overshot here cause 
                         i was aiming at just enough to keep 
                         you from walking out

               carol laughs

                                     carol
                         so how are you doing with those pills 
                         well i hopahopahopa

                                     melvin
                         takes months to know they work 
                         little by little
                              holds his head then
                         talking like this is exhausting

               carol moves to the chair next to him she sits very close  
               he tenses

                                     carol
                         have you ever let a romantic moment 
                         make you do something you know is 
                         stupid

                                     melvin

               tight shot

               for the kiss their faces are close  she looks at him

               she closes her eyes  her face moving toward him  he is 
               wideeyed and afraid his face almost moves away  in a 
               shot this close its almost flight but now his head moves 
               back and he receives her kiss it is brief carol smiles 
               encouragement to him and herself melvin cant bear the 
               pleasure

                                     melvin

                         came into breakfast when i saw you  
                         i thought you were handsome then

                         exposed tell me why did you bring 
                         me

               melvins voice is soft  hesitant okay vulnerable as 
               he holds up his hands in a stop signal

                                     melvin
                         well ah thats a personal

                         me why you wanted me here its okay

               she kisses him again

               we are on simon settling in for sleep when instinct or sounds

               carol sitting at tubs edge  a towel around her and now as 
               simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair

               and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair 
               and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the 
               bed where he turns on the light and stares at carol

               simons pen moves across the blotter  carol sees him 
               earnestly engrossed a beat of indecision and then shyly but 
               deliberately she lowers the towel hes right shes

               he struggles with the cast and then decides to struggle no

               melvin has been reduced to straight talk as carol brings the 
               bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in her 
               suitcase

                                     melvin

                         that seems like a good choice

                                     carol

                         see theres an example i dont 
                         know whether youre being cute or 
                         crazy now

                                     melvin

               he nods his head yes

                         its really something that youre 
                         looking after simon and what i said 
                         on the street that was a bad thing 
                         to say and it made me sick to my 
                         stomach it was a bad thing to say 
                         and id be lying if i didnt say 
                         that i enjoyed your company but 
                         the truth is you do bother me 
                         enormously and i know  think  
                         that its best for me to not have 
                         contact with you because youre just 
                         not ready and youre a pretty old 
                         guy to not be ready and im too 
                         old to ignore that but there were 
                         extraordinary kindnesses that did 
                         take place so thanks for the trips

               shes just broken up with him but shes being nicer than 
               ever its hard to know whether to die or not

                         logically  the best thing you have 
                         going for you is your willingness to 
                         humiliate yourself if it gives you 
                         one chance in whatever  so go catch 
                         her offguard

               ext carols apartment building carols neighborhood  
               night

               as he parks he exits the car  now wary looks at his 
               watch hesitates walks reluctantly into the apartment 
               house

               int carols apartment building  vestibule  night

               as melvin looks at carols doorbell with great uncertainty

               int carols apartment  night

               carol in a cotton wraparound dressbathrobe sitting 
               directly in front of a fan the windows open reading one 
               of melvins books

               there is the briefest possible sound of a doorbell someone 
               has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly  so briefly 
               that shes not certain its her doorbell  until the same 
               brief sound repeated she walks to her wide open window 
               and looks over

               her pov

               the convertible at the curb

               back to scene

               she hesitates 

               int carols apartment building  vestibule  night

               as melvin gives up and starts out turning as the sudden 
               blast of being buzzed into carols life sounds he bolts for 
               the door and enters

               int carols apartment  night

               she opens the door she hears the sound of melvin sounding 
               heavily up the stairs he reaches her side

                                     carol

                         cause of being woken up and it 
                         would make my job impossible so 
                         then i wouldnt even try

                         time

               he half turns to leave

                         i wasnt asleep

                                     melvin

                                     carol
                              losing it a bit
                         is it a secret what youre doing 
                         here

                                     melvin

                                     carol
                         because

                                     melvin
                         it relaxes me id feel better 
                         just sitting on the curb in front of 
                         your house than anyplace else i can 
                         think of or imagine

               carol has not ever heard anything like that before its 
               sort of sexy in its sincerity

               another angle

               as we see in the bg that beverly standing near her door 
               down the hallway has heard at least this last part

               melvin of course cannot leave well enough alone

                                     melvin
                              serious
                         wait a minute im overstating here 
                         maybe the inside stairs i dont 
                         want to sit with my feet in the 
                         gutter what does that serve it 
                         only

               but suddenly carol is shouting to the heavens

                                     carol
                         stop it why cant i have a normal 
                         boyfriend why get out of here 
                         just a regular boyfriend who doesnt 
                         go nuts on me

                                     beverly
                              butting in
                         everybody wants that dear  it 
                         doesnt exist
                              as carol turns to 
                              her
                         sorry didnt mean to interrupt

               she disappears into her room carol snorts a laugh  gathers 
               herself a beat

                                     melvin
                              hopefully
                         boyfriend

                                     carol
                         oh come on in and try not to ruin 
                         everything by being you

                                     melvin
                         maybe we could live without the wise 
                         cracks

               she looks at him  then

                                     carol
                         maybe we could

               melvin glances at the cracked pattern of carols kitchen 
               linoleum and stalls at the door

                                     melvin
                         it feels a little confined here 
                         lets take a walk

                                     carol
                         see its four in the morning a 
                         walk sounds a little screwy to me 
                         if you dont mind

                                     melvin
                         if you need an excuse theres a 
                         bakery on the corner theres a shot 
                         itll open soon  that way were 
                         not screwy  were just two people 
                         who like warm rolls

                                     carol
                         okay

               ext street  near bakery  night

               they walk quietly  melvin still walking with his usual 
               attention to where he steps

               carols pov

               melvin walking  and though we can see an improvement  it 
               is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids stepping 
               on the lines

               back to scene

               carol sighs it is the sound of possibilities crashing down

               melvin looks at her  embarrassed selfconscious  his 
               habits making him appear unworthy

                                     carol
                              gently almost 
                              lovingly
                         im sorry melvin  but whatever 
                         this is  is not going to work

               on melvin

               he takes this hard it forces him to halfwhisper something 
               he hasnt at all said to himself given his history 
               this is an extraordinary intimacy

                                     melvin
                         im feeling ive been feeling 
                         better

                                     carol
                         melvin even though it may seem that 
                         way now  you dont know me all 
                         that well
                              as he scoffs
                         im not the answer for you

               she starts to turn he tugs at her arm as she turns back to 
               him

                                     melvin
                         hey ive got a great compliment for

               on carol

               she stands on the precipice of being transported away from 
               the logic which has been her lifeline

                                     melvin
                         i think most people miss that about 
                         you and i watch wondering how they 
                         can watch you bring them food and 
                         clear their dishes and never get 
                         that they have just met the greatest 
                         woman alive and the fact that i 
                         get it makes me feel great about 
                         me
                              a real question filled 
                              with concern for her
                         you got a real good reason to walk 
                         out on that

               that last question clearly a true question not the least 
               rhetorical  she considers her answer then

                                     carol
                         no its certainly not no  i dont 
                         think so no

                                     melvin
                              tentatively
                         im gonna grab you
                              with conviction
                         i didnt mean it to be a question 
                         im gonna grab you

               he kisses her an awkward bomb of a kiss they separate a 
               tense beat then

                                     melvin
                         i know i can do better

               they embrace again he does indeed do much better a first 
               class smooch camera moves down to see his foot land squarely 
               on a crack in the sidewalk without his knowledge they break 

               look at each other without a notion of where to take it from 
               here and the almost in unison begin to walk away from camera 
               melvin following a path that avoids cracks suddenly the 
               lights of the bakery turn on as it opens for business

                                     carol
                         warm rolls

               they walk to the bakery melvin avoiding the cracks as they 
               enter the bakery a worker moves toward them to clean the 
               entranceway melvin forced to step back onto a crack this 
               time notices  registers the momentous fact and joins carol 
               inside as we

                                                                  fade out

                                         the end
