        fade in

        ext plaza colonint bank  day 1980

        black and white  the past was so clearcut  or was it

        tiled roofs the stark white stucco of a colonial town
        square  black iron bars at a bank  a briefcase carried 
        in a mans hand  a snipers rifle being assembled  thick
        blocks of hundred dollar bills  placed in the briefcase  
        a mans teeth as he smiles grimly at the sight 

        sounds over a subjective view  the briefcase snaps shut  
        a vault door slams  rubber soles walk a tiled floor  
        ahead brilliant white light suffuses the exit  like 
        the way people describe neardeath eperiences  were 
        either going outdoors or over to the other side 
 
        a long rifle silencer juts from a window  we see the
        shooter from behind a view over his shoulder

        in the bank the man crushes out a cigarette  a pause
        and a deep exhale as we step outside into a flood of light  
        in answer the low puff of a silencer

        only the plaza pigeons notice  as they take flight 

        a man lies dead on the cobblestones  and as we look up 
        toward the window theres nothing there  the pigeons
        wheel above the plaza  we follow finally losing them
        to the sky  slowly that sky bleeds from gray to blue

        and as we pan back down

                                                   dissolve to


        ext marsh  sunset

        were no longer in a plaza but in a vast marshland  not
        in the past but in the present  the sun sparkles over
        the water  two silhouetted figures move past in the dis
        tance  one walks a little behind the other

        the man in front is ketcham  he wears an expensive suit
        and gucci loafers  he swats at flies nearly too small to
        see curses under his breath at the calfdeep mud

        the man behind is rath  he moves easier the flies dont
        seem to bother him at all  his jeans are tucked into 
        rubber boots  he holds a silenced 22 at his side  like 
        it was part of him 

        they continue until one of ketchams shoes is sucked off
        by the mud

                                ketcham
                  awshit

       ketcham balances on one leg holding his silksocked 
       foot in the air  the shoe disappears filled with mud

                                ketcham
                  when i first saw you i wasnt 
                  scared  i was just wondering why 
                  you were dressed like that
                         re  mud
                  now i know  
		
       ketcham pulls off his sock sticks his foot in the mud
       he smiles  it feels good  he pulls off the other shoe 
       tosses it  grabbing for the other sock he loses his 
       balance and sits down in the mud 

       rath waits patiently as ketcham laughs at the absurdity
       of it all  ketcham finally pulls the sock off then 
       stands digs his toes into the dark wet earth 

                                ketcham 
                  this feels good 
		
       they move on rath still a little behind  ketcham enjoys
       the new sensation but after a bit the pleasure fades 

                                ketcham
                  its twisted but im honored  
                  youre the best  it means at 
                  least theyre still afraid of me 
			
       ketcham looks ahead as they close on a grove of trees 
       he knew they were going somewhere but its a chilling
       realization all the same 

                                ketcham 
                  i knew this day would come  but 
                  this morning i couldve sworn i 
                  was going to live forever 
		
       theyre only a few steps away from the first of the 
       trees  desperation begins to creep into ketchams voice

                                ketcham
                  any chance of you telling me who 
                  the contractor was  huh
                         off no answer
                  at least tell me how much i was
                  worth  a dime  two
		
       theyre into the trees  ketcham doesnt need to be told
       he stops just where a dead branch hangs from a tree 

                                ketcham
                  here

       rath uses the 22 to gesture ketcham to the left  ketcham 
       gives the branch a wistful smile  leaving his last hope 
       behind he takes a few steps over 

                                ketcham 
                  we both play the game rath  
                  sooner or later the wheel turns
                  for everybody  whos got your
                  bullet  what kind of shoesll
                  you be wearing when the day comes

       raths answer is to move directly behind him  ketcham 
       is finally showing his fear

                                ketcham
                  whatever the contract is ill
                  double it  just say you couldnt 
                  find me  buy yourself some good 
                  karma 

       ketcham cant see but he almost senses it as rath raises 
       the silenced 22 to the back of his head 

                                ketcham 
                  oh god  dont pull yet not yet
                  christ ive done some bad things 
                  in my time
                         trembling
                  i cant die like this  not like 
                  a mark  im not a mark
		
       finally ketcham begins to just cry  nothing left to say  
       a man in mourning for himself  but rath is not 
       unaffected not without his own peculiar version of mercy

       keeping the 22 steady an inch behind ketchams head 
       rath reaches into his jacket  he pulls out a second 
       nearly identical silenced 22  ketcham looks down 
       curious as the clip drops into the mud at his feet  

       rath ready to fire at any sign of trouble gently eases 
       the gun into ketchams hand  ketcham looks down smiles  
       its his gun his dignity

                                ketcham
                  hello old friend 
                         hefts it knows
                  one in the chamber

       slowly so rath can see ketcham raises the 22 sets the
       tip of the silencer against the side of his head  he 
       squints at the sun the last thing hell ever see

                                ketcham 
                  last few years ive been looking 
                  for a sunrise  maybe a sunsets 
                  better
                         a beat
                  thanks rath
		
       the sun disappears over the horizon  ketcham squeezes 
       the trigger  the silencer whispers and he crumples 
       begins to sink into the mud 

       rath lowers his gun  he takes a deep breath and lets it 
       out slowly standing alone in the middle of nowhere  we
       tilt down to an extreme closeup of blood in the water


       int hotel room  day late afternoon

       rath closes the curtains  there is a makeshift office on 
       the desk  a cell phone is connected to a laptop computer  
       the prompt flashes expectantly

       on the coffee table we see the dismantled 22 spread 
       clean on a white towel 

       rath stands at a window looking out at the city  he 
       leans forward until his forehead rests against the window  
       he closes his eyes enjoying the cool of the glass 

       a beat  then he looks to the street below  for just an
       instant hes wondering what it would be like to fall 
       breaking from his reverie rath steps to the desk 

       he sits regards the computer with loathing then types 
       in a long access code sequence  he waits

       after a few moments a line of dialogue appears  rath 
       is communicating with someone the contractor

       contractor  where have you been robert

       rath  sick  the flu 


       int contractors office  late afternoon

       extreme closeup of eyes hands mouth computer etc 

       contractor  i dont believe you


       back to rath

                                rath
                  i dont care what you believe
                  i want out  ive had it

       contractor ive been sitting on a prime contract

       but these days something else is on raths mind

                                rath
                  who are you you sonuvabitch

       rath  send the file  ill have the estimate tonight

       contractor  im worried about you robert

                                rath
                  you should be 

       rath  dont be 

       contractor  good  you are my 1

       the screen goes blank  a beat and the word transmitting
       appears  rath stands 

       a slimline printer hums starts to reproduce a newspaper 
       photo of alan branch  strong  hard eyes which rath 
       studies a moment then circles  as a second sheet 
       feeds rath isnt that interested 


       ext city streets  sunset

       mist fills the air  as night comes on rath walks  he
       has no real purpose at the moment  and the crowds dont
       magically seem to get out of his way  he watches them
       laughing talking hurrying this way and that  raths a
       loner  an outsider  life moves around him but hes not
       part of it  at least not this version  the mist turns
       to darkness


       int mall  upscale womens clothing store  night

       rath pauses his eye caught by a scene inside

       a dowager berates a female clerk  the clerk takes it
       stoically nodding placating  huffing and puffing the 
       dowager heads back to the racks  the clerk watches her 
       in exasperation  no one deserves this kind of abuse
       rath is going to continue when on an impulse he decides
       to enter the store instead


       int upscale womens clothing store  night

       rath steps inside begins to look around  the clerk sighs
       to herself  another customer and its almost closing time

       the dowager jams the dress back on the rack and it falls
       to the floor  she ignores it but rath doesnt

                                rath
                  i think you dropped something

       the dowager gives him a look

                                rath
                  maybe you better hang it back up

       and it isnt a question  the woman looks shocked then
       gruffly hanging the dress back up hurries out of the
       store

       tired a bit apprehensive the clerk gives rath a moment
       before joining him

                                clerk
                  can i help you sir  were just
                  closing

       rath suddenly wonders what the hell hes doing here

                                rath
                  im looking for something  i im
                  not sure what
		
                                clerk
                         knows the routine
                  birthday  anniversary

       rath shakes his head  theres something sad about him
       but she misreads it

                                clerk
                  a fight

       rath starts to say something but then stops  she takes
       it as a yes to her question

                                clerk
                  you said something you regret

       a beat  it takes rath a moment to confess

                                rath
                  regret yes

       she thinks decides on a way to get rid of him

                                clerk
                  are you really sorry

       rath nods  he is  finding what shes looking for she 
       holds up an elegant red velvet dress

                                clerk
                  bring this home and shell say
                  shes sorry  but its expensive

       that price tag should get him out of here  a beat
       theres something oddly appealing about the moment  its
       hard to say but rath is charmed  then almost shyly

                                rath
                  shes about your size  would
                  you

       the clerk is caught off guard by this request  she is
       all alone and it is getting late  still itd be nice
       to end the day with a sale

                                clerk
                  give me two minutes


       int mall  upscale womens clothing store  night

       rath stares out the window  theres something mournful
       almost haunting about him  an old soul to be sure


       int upscale womens clothing store  night

       rath scans the empty store then checks his watch  hes
       lost his mind  as he heads for the door the clerk steps
       out  the transformation is stunning  rath stops short
       takes in the beauty of it all

                                clerk
                  what do you think

                                rath
                         soft gentle
                  its perfect

       she cant believe it

                                clerk
                  ill write it up 

       she steps to a desk scribbles out a receipt  rath
       notices an open textbook several lines have been
       highlighted

                                rath
                  college

                                clerk
                  do you think im too old my
                  daughter says im too old to go
                  to school i just sit in right
                  now  i dont have the money yet
                  but i dont want to spend the rest
                  of my life selling somebody elses
                  dresses  i mean youre never too
                  old to have dreams right  to
                  start over

       rath looks away cant hold her gaze

                                rath
                  i dont know

       an awkward beat  then

                                clerk
                  should i wrap it

       rath nods


       back room

       close as she finishes tying the box


       store

       she steps out  her smile fades as she sees hes gone
       the sale is lost

                                clerk
                  damn

       she plops the bow on the counter then notices a wad of
       100 bills sticking out from her textbook

                                clerk 
                         softly
                  damn
		
       she pulls them along with a note written on the back of
       a store business card  she reads it

       insert card  your daughter is wrong

       she steps to the window looks out  raths lonely figure
       exits to the street outside


       int hotel room  night

       outside it is raining  rath is at the window looking at
       a faded photo of his next target alan branch  on the
       street below a fire truck and an ambulance race along 
       sirens blaring  rath crosses to his bed  he reviews
       photos scribbles notes as he scans articles one head
       line  billionaire recluse linked to financing of 
       central american death squads  a photo of a brother
       an obituary mentions car accident

       rath sketches a diagram on a legal pad

       satisfied with what hes got he calls up a box on his
       computer screen and dials an internet number  a beat
       and he enters the access code

       rath picks up the photos of branch  studies the eyes 
       circled the only thing that matters  theyre cruel
       eyes

       the network comes on line  rath takes a brath lets it
       out slow  types

       turning bain heads off  the caretaker just shrugs


       int drug store  magic hour

       from outside we see rath move down the aisles  selecting
       an odd array of items  rolls of gauze  a box of plaster
       of paris  a sling he pays and exits onto the busy
       sidewalk


       ext oakwood cemetery  day late afternoon

                   just witnessed the arrival of
                  recluse billionaire alan branch
                  here attending the funeral of his
                  brother samuel branch who died
                  last week in a tragic car accident

       we move past reporter 1 to

                                reporter 2
                  alan branch has not been seen since
                  testifying at a senate hearing ten
                  years ago  at the time he was
                  questioned for his alleged
       		financing of right wing death
                  squads throughout south and 
                  central america  branch was
                  born in


       security table

       seated a security systems tech checks a name against 
       a drivers license with raths picture  it carries the
       name paul gray  the name rath typed into the computer 
       he looks up and hands the license back to rath

       as he turns we see that under his jacket his right arm 
       is in a cast in a sling close to his side  he moves 
       past a hearse and several limousines as he joins other 
       latecomers who are walking up a hill towards a group at 
       a gravesite


       ext graveside  day late afternoon

       as a soloist finishes the last notes of ave maria  the
       priest invites those assembled to stand  all do except
       for alan branch in his wheelchair  he is ten years older 
       than the photo  now frail but with the same eyes  his
       bodyguards stand on either side

       we see rath move into position across the grave from 
       branch  rath removes a piece of white tape from his cast 
       exposes a barrel opening

       the priest raises his hands all heads bow  branchs  
       raths  though his eyes stay on his mark

                                priest
                  i am the resurrection and the life
                  saith the lord

       as the priest continues rath twists his body slightly
       taking aim with the 22 which must be inside the cast
       hes got a clean shot at the back of branchs head

                                priest
                   shall not die but have
                  everlasting life

       raths about to squeeze the trigger

                                priest
                  amen

       water pelts as sprinklers surge to life on all sides of
       the service area  bad timing  or is it  all heads turn
       several people move to get away from the spray


       ext gravestone  day

       it is bain sighting along the barrel of his silenced
       rifle


       telescopic pov of branch

       in his wheelchair  tight on a spot above his heart


       back to gravesite

       rath spins back to look toward branch  the old mans 
       head is still bowed in prayer  or is it  crimson 
       spreads out across his white shirt  hes been shot 
       through the heart  as one of the bodyguards realizes

                                bodyguard
                  hes been shot

       the crowd panics  people running everywhere  rath 
       spots a young caretaker  wearing coveralls  nonchalantly 
       heading off beyond a mausoleum wheeling a trash can full 
       of leaves  its bain

       rath turns his body to aim  in all the confusion no
       one notices a 22 shell


       bain 

       reacts as a bullet drills the trash can  pulling a 
       snipers rifle from the can he runs dives as another 
       bullet ricochets off the tombstone just in front of him


       bodyguards 

       all this has attracted their attention  drawing guns 
       they charge after bain  he comes up firing silently  
       the bodyguards go down  but now police are on the way


       bain

       stands and tries to run  again hes pinned down as two
       bullets blossom granite around him  he scans the crowd
       has no idea whos shooting at him


       cemetery

       and a small army of policemen are advancing service
       revolvers everywhere

                                policeman
                  drop it  now

       bain makes one last attempt to move  a bullet nearly
       takes off his ear  making a strategic decision he 
       tosses out his rifle and waits for the cops  in an 
       instant theyve surrounded him  they pin him to the
       ground  find his 22 pistol and handcuff him


       rath

       he sidesteps for a clear shot police are everywhere

                                rath
                  move you sonuvabitch  give me a
                  line  goddamnit get out of the
                  way

       cursing again under his breath he wont take the chance 
       of hitting a cop


       bain

       as they hustle him along he ducks and weaves perfectly
       aware of how to take advantage of his human shield  for
       an instant he sees a man  fifty yards away  
       silhouetted by the low sun  watching  bain squints
       against the light cant make him out but knows its
       rath  he ducks


       cemetery

       far ahead rath sees bain being frisked against a police
       cruiser  the cops handcuff him shove him in the back
       his rifle goes in the front  

       in a moment the cruiser rolls out led by a second

       rath hurries across the cemetery headed for


       ext cemetery  upper roadway

       rath climbs into his rentacar  he releases two velcro
       strips and the cast neatly separates  revealing his
       silenced 22 held comfortably in his hand  he slaps in
       a new clip and roars forward


       ext intersection  late day

       rath eyeballs the street  crowded with people and cars
       the police cruisers are gone


       int rentacar  moving  late day

       rath continues reaches under the seat for a portable
       police band radio  he switches it on  garbage until

       the two cops up front by a steel mesh screen  the 
       snipers rifle is in the front seat

       the second cruiser is up ahead leading the way  as 
       city blocks whizz past bain stares back over his 
       shoulder  the street is empty behind them 

       bain stares ahead  silent  behind his back he grips his 
       left hand with his right thumb  slowly he pulls his left 
       thumb out of its socket  the digit folds unnaturally into 
       his palm as bain slides the cuff over his hand


       int rentacar  late day

       speeding along  cop 1 looks back at bain who stares
       out the side window

       as cop 1 looks ahead  boom  bain rears back with both 
       feet and kicks out the side window

       before either cop can even react bain reaches through 
       the rear side window and through the drivers side
       window  as he wrenches back on cop 2s neck


       ext street  late day

       the cruiser skids out of control  it slams into a row of 
       parked cars straightens for an instant before it cart
       wheels end over end lands on its roof

       the second cruiser starts to break as they realize 
       whats happened behind them 

       a silent moment before bain pulls himself out the side 
       window of the wreck  he has blood trickling from his
       hairline

       bain reaches into the cruiser for his rifle  cops 1 and 
       2 hang upsidedown in their seats  cop 2s neck is 
       twisted  broken  groggy cop 1 is still alive

       bain lies flat on his stomach aims back through the 
       window at cruiser two which has turned and is speeding 
       back the other way

       cruiser one


       ext wreckage  late day

       bain looks at the wreckage for a beat and disappears
       between two buildings  the rifle at his side


       int rentacar  sunset

       rath slows as he nears the wreckage  bain is nowhere in 
       sight  rath stops  holding his 22 rath leans low 
       out of the sedan for a quick look  four dead cops but 
       no bain  just a discarded pair of coveralls on the 
       sidewalk 

       rath scans the deserted streets  its a little spooky
       then a shadow moving  across the street 


       ext street  sunset

       rath gets out of his rentacar 22 in hand  as we hear
       a distant siren rath crosses to a chainlink fence peers
       through

       our hearts are in our throats as without warning a big
       watch dog lunges at the fence

       but rath is unphased  he gets back in his car continues
       driving and scanning for any sign of life  


       ext streets  sunset

       he hangs a left coasts then hangs a right  a block
       ahead a yellow cab waits at a red light  rath looks a
       little more determined as it gives him an idea  a police
       car races by


       intext yellow cabintersection  night

       the drivers eyes look to the rearview as headlights
       loom  he winces as his cab is bumped from behind


       ext intersection  night

       rath gets out of the sedan and the driver out of the cab
       as they converge on the bumper

                                driver
                  there better not even be a scratch
                  you dumb sonuva 

       before the driver can finish his point rath knocks him
       cold with a short powerful punch  he catches the man
       drags him over to the safety of the sidewalk

       rath relieves the driver of his cap sticks two hundred
       bucks in his hand and hops into the cab  the light
       turns green and hes off


       int yellow cab  night

       cap on rath is behind the wheel  he turns up the cb 
       hoping to get lucky  calls crackle then 

                                dispatch vo

       rath clicks off shoves the id under the seat  sticking
       the 22 down between his legs he rolls


       ext adams and nine  night

       an empty payphone on the corner  not a soul in sight
       the yellow cab pulls up idles at the curb


       int yellow cab  night

       rath holds the 22 with one hand the door handle with
       the other  tense as a tiger ready to spring

       a couple exit from a dingy bar across the street  rath
       looks over frowns as they start toward him

       in that instant the opposite passenger door opens and
       someone gets in the back  as the door slams shut rath
       checks the rearview mirror

       its bain  he carries his rifle wrapped in his jacket
       for the first time we realize that the front and back of
       the cab are separated by bulletproof glass

       an awkward silence as rath slides the 22 back between
       his legs  bain looks at his eyes in the rearview  bain
       never really saw him at the cemetery

                                bain
                  is there a problem

       as the yellow cab pulls away we get the distinct feeling
       this is going to be no ordinary cab ride


       int yellow cab  night

       rath studies bain in the rearview  bain stares out the
       side window chuckling to himself a thin trickle of
       blood on his temple

                                rath

       but she doesnt want to go  she has other things to 
       consider 

                                electra

       it  turning her gently they continue down 


       ext mustang  parked  day

       electra and rath make it to the car  distraught shes
       still staring back as he gets her inside


       int mustang  driving  day

       electras neighborhood  rath drives away  he glances 
       over at electra who sits clutching hold of pearl  in 
       shock over bob and jennifer shes withdrawn into her
       self  rath knows theres nothing he can say so he keeps
       quiet and drives


       ext chain hotel  night

       the mustang drives up  rath is at the wheel 


       int chain hotel room  night

       electra enters ahead of rath  

       she sets her bag down lets pearl out of the portapet  
       feeling like a prisoner she sits in a chair in the 
       corner  pearl jumps up in her lap

       rath gets a quick feel for the room  after checking the 
       view out the window he draws the curtains

       rath takes off his jacket  pulling off his shoulder 
       holster he sets the rig on the coffee table then sits 
       in a couch opposite electra  the gun is halfway between 
       the two  electra does her best to be nonchalant but 
       shes well aware of the fact

       may be the very first time weve seen rath relax  pearl 
       jumps to the carpet pads her way toward him

                                electra
                  pearl
 	 	
       ignoring her owner pearl leaps up settles into raths 
       lap  as he scratches her ears

                                electra
                  here girl

       electra snaps her fingers but pearl just closes her 
       eyes begins to purr  electra is not happy about this

                                rath
                  she likes me
 	 	
                                electra
                  she likes dead fish too

       as rath looks down at the cat electra looks at the gun
       measuring the distance with her eyes

                                electra
                  what do you call yourself
 	 	
                                rath
                  robert rath
 	 	
                                electra
                  yeah sure  call me electra
                  so are you one of them
 	 	
                                rath
                  used to be
                         checks watch
                  retired

                                electra
                  pardon me if i dont believe you
 	 	
                                rath 
                  if i was going to kill you youd
                  be dead already 

       she pretends to look away but as rath looks down at 
       pearl electra lunges for the gun

       he never moves or even blinks an eye  he just watches as
       she struggles a moment to free the 22 from its holster
       she realizes suspects the worst

                                electra
                  what  its not loaded
 	 	
                                rath
                  its loaded  
 	 	
                                electra
                  i could shoot you  i could be
                  500 miles away by the time they
                  find you

       electra keeps the gun on him but cant shake the feeling
       hes got the upper hand  a long silence 

       rath scratches pearls ears

                                electra
                  stop it  she doesnt like it

       pearl begins to purr  

                                rath
                  afraid youll hit the cat

       rath sets pearl down looks back to electra  waits

       without warning she starts squeezing off rounds  a lamp
       explodes on one side of rath  two tufts of stuffing 
       erupt from the couch on the other side  rath doesnt 
       move

                                electra 
                         steps forward
                  you think letting me get this gun
                  was a mistake dont you  you 
                  think im afraid  dont you
 	 	
       she fires just over his head the round digs the wall

                                electra
                  you dont know shit about me
 	 	
                                rath
                  youre wrong  i 
 	 	
                                electra
                  shut up

       a final step she levels the gun at raths face

                                electra
                  this was supposed to be a good day
                  a payday  forty grand  i was 
                  going to get pearl a boyfriend
                  now two people are dead  im 
                  almost dead 
                         a beat
                  im in way over my head rath 
                  i just want out
 	 	
       for the first time really she looks into his eyes  her
       hand begins to tremble  the gun barrel shakes

                                rath
                  you have the gun  the keys are 
                  on the dresser  go
 	 	
       electra covers rath as she steps over to the dresser 
       scoops up the keys  her next words are more to reassure
       herself than to convince rath 

                                electra
                  i dont have a social security 
                  number a drivers license  i 
                  barely remember my real name  
                  im a ghost i can disappear
 	 	
                                rath
                  i found you  so did he
 	 	
                                electra
                  i want my life back  please 
                  thats all i want 

       rath shakes his head

                                rath
                  im sorry 
 	 	
       electras finger tightens on the trigger  suddenly 
       jerking her arm left she fires a wild shot  a crash
       as a cheap print is obliterated by the bullet

       electra lowers the gun limply to her side lets it drop 
       to the carpet 

                                electra
                  i need to be alone
                         a beat
                  i havent spent this much time
                  with someone in years
 	 	
       near tears electra moves blindly for the bathroom pearl
       at her heel  as electra closes the door behind her

                                rath 
                  neither have i

       he closes his eyes listens as we hear her begin to cry


       int bathroom  night

       her back to the door electra slides slowly to the floor
       as she cries  hugging her knees to her chest it gets
       worse  a lonely desolate moment  as pearl mews

       the bathroom door opens and electra emerges  she watches
       over his shoulder

       rath clicks off the set as the weather comes on  he
       considers the disc  rath has a hunch but wonders if he
       really wants to know

                                rath
                  whats on this

                  code on my laptop could take two 
                  maybe three hundred years

                  i wish i had an insight but it 
                  was all anonymous  just an 
                  intercepted satellite 	
                  transmission

       rath knows that in this case ignorance is bliss 

       rath stands goes into the bathroom

       electra steps over to the bed  the blanket has been
       turneddown  two chocolate mints rest on the triangle

                                electra
                  theres only one bed  i guess you
                  picked up on that

       rath exits the bathroom rolling two towels together

                                rath
                  its all yours

       rath sets the roll on the floor  he switches on a 
       ceiling light directly over it  electra watches under
       stands but teases

                                electra
                  whats that a trick of the trade
                  so you dont get too comfortable
                         off no answer
                  why dont you just tie a string
                  from your toe to the doorknob
 	 	
                                rath
                         doesnt think 
                         twice

       rath sits on the toilet seat and looks at his reflection 
       in the mirror  hes not quite sure he knows who hes 
       looking at  sensing someone else he looks down to where
       pearl stares up at him

                  what if he tries to shoot you
                  before you go into the bank

                                rath

                  fifteen years

       and as they stand side by side suddenly everything is
       clear to electra

                                electra
                  oh my god

       rath finally looks at her

                  your friend nicolai  you said he
                  was taken

                                electra
                         a whisper
                  you killed him

       rath doesnt answer  and suddenly electra is scared 
       again  she looks at him a beat longer then does the only
       thing she can to protect herself  she puts on her 
       sunglasses

       we move in on the lenses see rath reflected in them


       ext new hotel  magic hour

       the cab pulls away


       int new hotel  lobby  night

       rath and electra walk through an archway and start
       upstairs  in front of them walks a newlywed couple  
       kissing and giggling  very much in love  rath pays 
       no attention while electra cant take her eyes off them 


       int new hotel hallway  night

       they reach a landing  to make things worse they have 
       adjoining rooms  rath opens their door enters  electra
       lingers watches the other couple as he fumbles for his 
       keys  watches as she runs her hand over him  he finally
       gets the door open  he pushes her inside 


       int new hotel  room  night

       electra listens to the sounds coming from the other side
       of the wall  laughter quickly turning into passion

                                electra
                         sarcastic

                  not even professionals could pull 
                  that act off

       as the sounds become more muffled electra grabs a glass
       holds it to the wall  rath watches with distaste 

                                rath
                  youre a voyeur

       he doesnt have an answer  she picks up pearl walks
       into the bathroom  as the door locks behind her


       ext plaza colon

       almost deserted a different story after sundown  as the
       last fruit vendor shuts up his cart 

                                bain os
                  un momento  por favor 
 	 	
       the vendor sighs waits as bain carrying a nylon bag 
       steps over  he nods politely scans the fruit picks out 
       two apricots  he hands the vendor a twenty walks on 
       without waiting for his change 

                                vendor 
                  gracias senor 
 	 	
       move with bain as he strolls across the plaza  biting
       into the apricot savoring the taste he looks at the
       bank at the big iron gates barring the front entrance
       but also at the modern metal detectors just beyond

       taking another bite he turns scans the opposite side  
       the hotel paraiso is even gloomier than the first time 
       we saw it  by instinct bain settles on the same window 
       that rath did

       he walks to the bank entrance imagines the sight line 
       back to the hotel  doing his homework 

       finishing the first apricot bain sets the second on a
       column ledge just to the right of the entrance

       bain crosses the plaza to the hotel  pulling free a 
       24 nailed to the entrance he steps inside 


       int hotel paraiso  lobby  night

       an atrium courtyard  the burntout interior hall bal
       conies stare down from four sides  the ceiling is gone

       bain stares up at the moon  it casts broken patterns of
       light across the walls and floor  bain seems almost 
       reverent  like he was in a holy place

       moving cautiously bain starts up the staircase headed
       for the third floor 


       int hotel paraiso  room 302  night

       bain enters  we jump as a floor board gives way with a 
       snap  taking it in stride bain pulls his leg free
       steps carefully over to a


       third floor window

       bain stares across at the entrance to the bank  a good 
       clear view the vertical angle not too extreme 

       he unzips his bag  quickly epertly he puts together
       a snipers rifle complete with a twofoot silencer

       holding up the rifle he closes one eye sights  a click
       as bain squeezes the trigger on an empty chamber  he
       looks up from the sight across the plaza  this is good


       ext new hotel  balcony  night

       holding pearl electra stands looking out at the city
       what holds her attention is the procession moving down 
       the cobblestoned street following a trail of marigold 
       petals to a nearby cemetery  it includes children made 
       up as skeletons 	


       int new hotel  hallway  night

       a waiter pushes a room service cart  we dont see his
       face but we suspect the worst  as he reaches the door
       to rath and electras room 	 	


       int new hotel  room  night

       rath looks up at a knock on the door  drawing his 22
       he steps over stays to the side of the door

                                rath
                  who is it

                                muffled voice os
                  room service

       rath places the end of the silencer against the door 
       head level

                                rath
                  i didnt order room service

       as he cocks back the trigger electra steps in from the
       balcony

                                electra
                  i did

       rath pulls the gun away pauses a moment to collect
       himself  he holsters it opens the door  the waiter
       smiles rolls the cart in 	 	

       as he sets up the plates electra steps over

                                electra
                  excuse me
                         points out balcony

                  what are the flowers for
 	 	
                                waiter
                  families make a path from their
                  homes to the cemetery  so the
                  souls of the dead loved ones can
                  find their way back home

       electra is fascinated  as the waiter finishes rath tips
       him and he exits

                                electra
                  can we go
 	 	
                                rath
                  hell be here by now  this room
                  and the bank  thats it

       disappointed she sets pearl down and steps back out on 
       the balcony to watch 	

       rath pours himself a drink  as he does he notices
       something  theres a slight tremble in his hand  he
       sets the drink down looks to the balcony  after a 
       moment he steps over stops to the side of it

                                rath 
                  i wish i could explain why i 
                  killed nicolai  i may have been 
                  manipulated  i dont know

                  for what its worth im sorry i
                  did it

       a beat  he waits for her to say something cant really
       blame her when she doesnt

                                rath
                  i used to hope the same thing
                  would happen to me  a least its
                  a way out

       it may  finally rath steps out to be with her

       ext balcony  night

       rath steps out  electras gone  not on the ground a 
       floor below  nowhere in sight  rath looks to the 
       cemetery and the fire escape leading from the balcony
       down to the cobblestone street below


       ext old cemetery  night

       a procession emerges from a tunnel through old gates and
       into a cemetery  it includes some american tourists  
       marigold petals and candles are everywhere  there are 
       headstones many of which lie flat  also much wellmade
       statuary

       two local women stand to one side selling coffee and
       shaved ice  solemn but not dreadfully so

       stepping up from the shadows of a darker part of the
       cemetery is electra  she looks on eagerly  this is
       prime peoplewatching territory

       she spots the coffee women starts to move in closer  as
       she passes behind a larger memorial she hears

                                bain os
                  hola  que pasa

       electra freezes peeks around the memorial to see bain 
       not more than four feet away standing near the coffee 
       women  they smile at him  he seems respectful  in 
       fact as bain watches the ceremony hes in his element

       he speaks almost like hes addressing the women but not
       really  electra cant take her eyes off him

                                bain
                  death is like me  quiet a 
                  little scary  sharp hes real
                  sharp  and even though you want
                  to stay away from him you cant  
                  he draws you  you dig him and 
                  fear him at the same time  
                         laughs
                  im a million years old but i
                  look like im thirty


       electra  

       she hurries away into the shadows  in the gloom she 
       nearly trips over a headstone  in the process she sends 
       an old glass candle holder flying  as it smashes


       bain

       at first we dont think he heard it but then he turns
       looks back into the darkness  hes going to turn back to
       the ceremony but he cant  its instinctual 
 	 	
       reaching into his jacket bain heads into the darkness
       the two women watch him go  one looks to the other
       makes crazy circles around her ear with a finger


       darkened cemetery

       electra moves  hears someone behind her  or was it to 
       the left  she ducks behind an angel statue  moments 
       later bain steps up  electra holds her breath as he 
       scans the area  all of bains senses are working 
       including smell

                                bain
                         under his breath
                  jasmine

       his 22 in hand bain moves on

       electra stands moves back  she hasnt gone far when a
       hand slaps down over her mouth  its rath 


       bain

       hes starting to get a little spooked himself  sure 
       that hes cornered someone he leaps around a corner
       takes aim down a row of tombstones  no ones there


       rath and electra

       raths feeling the same way  motioning for her to stay
       put he creeps around a statue sees bain draws a bead 
        but a large group from the procession moves in between
       them  when they clear bain is gone  rath takes 
       electras hand and they move on


       bain

       looking about the feeling passing  then he spots it a
       jasmine in a vase by a stone  bain takes a sniff  
       laughing he turns heads back to the ceremony

                  senor  we have received your 
                  transfer
 	 	
       he hands the receipt to rath who sees a two counts the
       zeros after it  there are seven of them

                                rath

                  could you get the paperwork 
                  together

                  today  you wish to close the
                  account today

       its all the official can do to keep from crossing him
       self  he looks around catches the eye of the one man in
       the building who looks even more official than he does 
       the bank president

       the president steps over confers with his underling in
       low tones  in spanish  occasionally the president 
       glances at rath but mostly he listens  finally

                                president
                  youre aware senor that there
                  may be a withdrawal fee

                  yes i am

       the president looks to the official nods  as the
       official hurries off the president looks back to rath

                                president
                  this will take some time

       to execution dock  well know in a few moments


       int room 302  day

       bains attention is riveted to the hotel steps

       behind him behind the mattress electra raises raths
       22 her hand shaking like crazy


       int bank  exit  day

       no flood of light this time  in fact it looks dark 
       outside  rath is crowded from behind by the guards

                                president
                  thank you for your business senor

       practically pushed into taking a step outside every
       thing is suddenly spinning out of his control  as the
       big doors shut behind him


       int room 302  day

       bain has rath in the doorway  not quite a clean shot 
       but bains willing to wait
 	 	
                                bain
                  take a step  just one little step
 	 	
       electras knuckles are white around the 22s grip  but 
       she cant pull the trigger  bain isnt a cowboy and shes
       not an indian


       ext bank  doorway  day

       rath looks from side to side  theres no car waiting
       in fact the plaza is nearly deserted

                                rath
                  electra  are you there

       head down theres only one way to find out  rath 
       starts down the stairs


       int room 302  day

       bain leans forward his aim rock steady

       the crosshairs are an x on the top of raths head

                                bain
                  look up  i want to see your eyes

       electra better act  nows not the time to be a voyeur


       ext plaza colon  day

       rath stops slowly looks up  he sees the rifles long
       silencer jut from the window bains shadow beyond it 
       hes a dead man but the worst part is not knowing where
       electra is  was he deserted  is she in trouble  in 
       another second it wont matter


       int room 302  day

       about to pull the trigger bain hesitates 


       bains pov  through rifle scope

       he sees the mic in raths ear the cord snaking under 
       his shirt


       room 302

       bain frowns then sniffs the air  theres something 
       strangely familiar in it

                                bain
                  jasmine
 	 	
       bain whips a look back over his shoulder sees raths 
       22 electra who practically shrugs in apology  

                                electra
                  howdy

       the 22 silencer kisses the air  bains shoulder erupts 
       red


       ext plaza colon  day

       pigeons take wing as rath sees the rifle twist up fire
       wildly into the sky  a beat and rath dashes forward


       int room 302  day

       the rifle dropped bain grabs his bag and charges for the
       wall  electra fires twice more misses twice as bain 
       crashes through the lathing into


       room 301

       stumbling blind he falls  the floor opens beneath him 
       to let him pass


       ext plaza colon  cafe  day

       rath races for the hotel  past a man picking up coffee
       cups


       int the hotel paraiso  room 301  day

       electra steps up  the 22 trained on the hole she 
       looks down  bains bag is there but the man himself
       is nowhere in sight  a ghost  electra moves


       int 2nd floor hallway  day

       bain on his back aiming his own 22 at her footsteps
       overhead  he fires


       int 3rd floor hallway  day

       theres no warning blast just bullets silently drill
       ing the floor at her feet  electra runs aware the 
       floor could collapse under any given footfall


       int 2nd floor hallway  day

       bain moves to the railing aims at the stairs

       electra appears on the landing above freezes as she 
       realizes shes exposed

                                rath os
                  bain

       rath in the lobby  before bain can target him hes 
       gone

       so is electra

                                bain
                  two against one  is that your
                  edge rath  you didnt take the 
                  mark  you took the bribe

       bain starts for the stairs

                                bain
                  ill take her even the odds
 	 	
                                electra os
                         scared somewhere
                  i think hes serious rath


       room 205

       rath pulls himself up through a hole in the floor

                                rath
                  youve got something of mine 
                  electra


       3rd floor hallway

       electra looks at the 22 gauges raths position from his 
       voice

                                electra
                  when do you want it back
 	 	
                                rath os
                  now
 	 	

       atrium  hallway balconies

       electra appears at the third floor balcony  rath at the
       second a little further down  bain turns the corner on 
       the staircase

       as electra tosses rath the 22 bain fires  time slows

       raths hand closes around the gun even as hes hit in 
       the shoulder  stumbling back he returns fire

       electra has disappeared from the railing as bain con
       tinues after her  and getting to his feet 

       rath gets to his feet and motors


       3rd floor

       light plays through the lathing  every creak could 
       mean your life  intercut between rath electra and 
       bain as they play the equivalent of the hedgemaze 
       game

       bain fires at a shadow moving against a wall three 
       rooms away

       electra nearly steps into a gaping hole as she looks 
       back at a sound behind her

       rath wheels as the electra whispered name rath echoes 
       oddly  no way to tell where it came from


       3rd floor hallway

       the full length stretched before us  electra steps 
       out from a room  rath appears at the other end  as 
       she starts toward him bain steps out from the opposite 
       end  shes about to get caught in one hellacious 
       crossfire

                                rath
                         dashing forward
                  down

       as electra hits the deck bain leaps forward with a 
       rebel yell  the two men unload their silent 22s  
       sprinting at each other  bain shouting

       rath jerks to a sinewstretching stop as his right leg 
       goes through the flooring  he fires 

       and as bains hit in the thigh he goes down  disappears
       through the floor right at electras feet 


       int floors  day

       move with bain as he tumbles  breaking then continuing 
       his fall at each floor he encounters


       3rd floor hallway

       rath and electra look through the hole  no ghost this
       time  bains down there  motionless nearly buried 
       in debris  rath looks up at electra

                                rath
                  dont move

       rath starts down the hall  a beat and electra is 
       following right behind him


       int hotel paraiso  lobby  day

       the light from the lowering sun slips through gaps 
       cracks and broken window panes casting surreal patterns

       rath steps over to where bain lies broken  22 aimed at
       bain he turns to face electra as she comes up behind

       they embrace a moment before he pulls away  the only way
       to describe him is pissed with joy

                                rath
                  you werent supposed to be here
                  what happened  what the hell
                  happened

       before electra can explain

                                voice os
                  thats no way to talk to a lady


       int lobby  day

       a chill down raths spine  he wheels but the voice has 
       no source  till the contractor steps out of the shadows
       holds a 22 about a foot from electras head

                                contractor
                  its been a long time my friend

       rath turns is stunned at the sight

                                rath
                  nicolai

                                nicolaicontractor

       nicolai motions to raths gun  rath has no choice  he
       drops it  nicolai gestures toward bain

                                nicolai
                  miguelito
                         as rath nods
                  i never pictured him so young  a
                  shame  second best after all

       electra cant believe whats happening  she looks from
       nicolai to rath

                                electra
                  you killed him
 	 	
                                nicolai
                         smiles
                  he did

       nicolai opens his jacket to reveal a bulletproof vest

                                nicolai
                         to rath
                  walking out of that bank was the
                  worst moment of my life
                         to electra
                  he always went for the heart
                  predictable

       nicolai holds up a flattened slug tosses it to rath who
       lets it land on the floor

                                rath
                  fifteen years fifteen goddamn
                  years you let me think i killed
                  you  you sonuvabitch
 	 	
                                nicolai
                  youre forgetting you shot me
                  you sonuvabitch

       rath cant argue the facts

                                nicolai
                  the cold war was ending  i needed
                  to die  to leave no past behind
                  you delivered me
                         looks to electra
                  you my darling must be the mark
 	 	
                                electra
                  and you my darling must be the
                  contractor
 	 	
                                nicolai
                         nods to rath
                  im disappointed robert  you
                  were supposed to kill her
 	 	
       rath is the only one aware that bain has come to

       with his free hand nicolai pulls the disc from his
       pocket looks to electra

                                nicolai
                  youre a thief  a good one
 	 	
                                electra
                         looks to rath
                  im retired
 	 	
                                nicolai
                  i had to use both my best to
                  track you down
 	 	
                                electra
                         re disc
                  let me guess  theres something 
                  on there that would bring you
                  back to life
 	 	
                                nicolai
                         nods
                  youre very good  also a shame

       rath and nicolai regard each other grimly  a moment of
       truth is at hand

                                electra
                         scared
                  hey cant you two just kiss and 
                  make up

       nicolai smiles at her picks the briefcase up off the
       ground  at the same time bains hand moves almost
       imperceptibly to his gun a few inches away

                                nicolai
                  this is sad for me robert
                  sentimental but i didnt want
                  to find you alive
                         a beat
                  first things first

       nicolai motions rath to take a step aside  nicolai moves
       forward  leaning over bain he holds the 22 to the base
       of his skull  the coupdegrace

                                                  nicolai
                  always make sure  you shouldve
                  known better

       as nicolais finger tightens rath dives for his own gun
       nicolai swings his aim for rath enabling bain to grab
       his own 22

       bain fires from the rubble drills nicolai up through the
       chest cavity

       nicolai drops  rath rolls to his feet aims at bain who
       swings his aim to rath  but neither man fires  

                                electra
                  dont do this

       finally bain sticks out his free hand

                                bain
                  ayudame
                         sighs
                  help me up will you

       rath takes his hand pulls bain bloody covered in soot
       to his feet  as rath stares down at nicolai

                                rath
                  im gone
 	 	
       bain considers the implications

                                bain
                  that would make me number one
 	 	
                                rath
                  i can live with that  can you
 	 	
                                bain
                  absolutamente  companeros
 	 	
       bain turns his aim away  rath does the same  electra
       breathes a sigh of relief  rath moves toward her

                                bain
                  im sorry rath

       rath freezes as he hears the hammer cock behind him  
       bain has him dead the 22 aimed at the back of raths
       head

                                bain
                  as long as youre out there
                  ill never be number one

       feeling like a fool rath looks across at electra 
       beat  in a moment of compassion bain turns his aim away

                                bain
                  you want to say goodbye

       rath has nothing to say  he just looks at her

       in response electra raises her sunglasses slides them 
       on  like shes withdrawing away at the end  but wait  
       thats not it at all

       raths eyes flicker wide as he sees bain in the lens
       reflection  rath knows eactly where hes standing

       bain realizes as well  as he moves to fire

       the side of raths coat blossoms as rath shoots through
       it  like a wild west trick shooter

       hit in the chest the gun slips from bains hand  his
       eyes flicker from his wound to rath  rath stares back

       bain goes down hard  hes dead

       rath and electra come together  a beat and they start
       out  on the way electra scoops up the briefcase 
       moment more and theyre gone


       freeze frame

                                                   fade to blackthe end
