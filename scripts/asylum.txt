charging a dollar a ride
fairy tale castle on the hill
licensed to disneyland
and occupied by a dreamer
directing from an ivory tower
built from sweat tears and fear
lawrence contd
as part of his inheritance
not content with money and mortar
pen paper and wife
to carry on and tell the tale
he must aspire to greater things

follow katka back to a couch and table where doug and chris are

bar stool back under the red light

holly
id like to read some prose it doesnt
have a title yet

holly flicks through her notebook

angle dougchriskatka
doug
to chris
here comes her life story all twenty
something years of it

chris
lets hope it dont take that long to
read

holly
as the dawn brings the sun and life to
her body made limp by sleep and the
pleasures of his passion she awakes and
feels her nakedness against the world and
his body lying still next to her stained
bed sheet and a pillow heavy from sweat
are all that remains to validate his
valour in night time combat but she was
not his foe that unseen enemy he forced
his might against last night she was but a
cushion for his blows 


angle dougkatkachris  fade holly sound to background

hollyos
no act of love but willing violence
demanded by one and begged by the other
as life turned to fantasy and reality to
ecstasy a need so deep no light could
reach surfaced like a nocturnal creature
unearthed for momentary and glorious
display left alone in a rosetinted
afterglow dimming fast she tasted the
moisture of her body and wondered why
light came to day and such desires to
her paleskin body

doug
to chris
well she sure isnt normal

chris
fresh from the shrink id say

doug
yeah group bloody therapy time

katka
so why dont you get up and speak something
then we will see who is crazy

doug
ooh well excuse me

on holly
holly
and now as the window lace filters out
a darkened past she reaches for her body
once more her hand glides from breast
to thigh as thoughts of times flow by
her nipples awake and race after a conscious
thought of lustful moments in grassy fields
in time to see reality reap the earth and
leave it barren


angle dougkatkachris

doug drinks chris smokes and katka listens pan audience

hollyos
she has no reason for discontent and
less for hope of what love could be
in a privileged world her eyes wander
once more and her hand follows down his
spine the nails that hide no blood run
down the valley of his buttocks stroking
electric hairs that lead to his well of
life and reason as the tendons in
her fingers tighten her adonis wakes
and her eyes turn to the sky and a
life through netted curtains

holly closes notebook and tentative applause begins as she moves back 
to josh who is clapping politely

josh
when the hell did you write that

holly
just yesterday

josh
shit honey you couldve told me

doug
no but like my dad said theres only
so many ways you can wire a plug

chris
he was an electrician

doug
no he was talking about girls i think

doug
too rightnow the other thing weve
got to do is start clearing up the rubble
can you make a start on that

chris looks down at his clothes

chris
i feel like a mole in this joint so i guess
i might as well come out lookin like one

doug
dont worry ill give you a hand as
soon as i can

doug turns to exit
chris
just two things what do i use to shift
the stuff and where in hell am i gonna
put it all

doug
scout around and see if theres something
check that other corridor if theres
nothing nip out and buy a broom and shovel

chris
and put it on expenses

doug
sureas for the crap ive got an idea

doug leads chris back over to the pipe and surrounding large 
excavation

doug
somehow im going to have to bandaid
that thing since we cant really replace
it and then put a walkway over it

chris
so

doug
well we might as well start filling it in
now as long as you leave enough room
around that end of the pipe  so i can get
to it were set use them wooden boards
to stop it all spilling into the space 
well neaten it up later

chris
you sure got a handle on that word we

chris drags over the boards close to the pipe and lines them up 
follow doug to one of the corridors as he traces some exposed wiring 
back up to the balcony area it leads to a switchboard which is 
hanging off the wall there is a large cable leading out of the box 
and through the side wall near the windows
