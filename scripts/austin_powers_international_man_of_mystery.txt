                         weather changing machine that was in 
                         essence a sophisticated heat beam 
                         which we called a laser  using 
                         this laser we punch a hole in the 
                         protective layer around the earth 
                         which we scientists call the ozone 
                         layer slowly but surely ultraviolet 
                         rays would pour in increasing the 
                         risk of skin cancer that is unless

               the soldier takes austin and vanessa to the tank and puts 
               them in the dipping mechanism

                                     austin

                         die even after they pay me the money 
                         im still going to melt all the cities 
                         of the world with hot magma

                         bottom and died

               int tank area

               austin and vanessa slowly descend towards the water they 
               can see the water bubbling beneath them

                                     vanessa
                         whats your plan

               just then a sea bass jumps out of the water just missing 
               austin

                                     austin
                         first i plan to soil myself then 
                         i plan to regroup and think about 
                         the next move any thoughts

                                     vanessa
                         sadly no hold on i always keep 
                         this on me just in case

               she pulls out a container of dental floss

                                     austin
                         all right i get it i have bad teeth 
                         you have to understand in britain 
                         in the sixties you could be a sex 
                         symbol and still have bad teeth it 
                         didnt matter

                                     vanessa
                         no no no well use the floss to 
                         get to the ledge

                                     austin
                         smashing idea give it to me

               austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental 
               floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo he 
               throws it and it wraps around a radiator and it catches like 
               a grappling hook

               austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack

               meanwhile the slowdipping mechanism is edging towards the 
               sea bass unfortunately austin is still drawing out the 
               floss he keeps pulling out floss

               more floss still the mechanism continues to sink finally 
               the floss line goes taut austin ties it off high on the 
               pole of the slowdipping mechanism

               austin holds out his hand like a surgeon vanessa places a 
               tube of toothpaste in his hand meanwhile the guard is 
               reaching to undo the floss austin places the open tube on 
               his palm aimed at the guard vanessa whistles at the guard 
               loudly he turns around

                                     austin
                         judo chop

               austin judo chops the toothpaste tube sending a stream of 
               toothpaste into the guards eyes

                                     guard
                              screaming rubbing 
                              his eyes
                         my eyes my eyes

               austin folds the tube across the top of the wire grabbing 
               both ends

                                     austin
                         hold on vanessa

               she grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety 
               right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water 
               meanwhile the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared 
               all over his face

               he and austin struggle

               the guard manages to get austin pinned to the ground austins 
               head dangling over the water sea bass circle the water 
               boils dangerously close to austins head

                                     vanessa
                              shouting
                         austin watch out

               austin flips the guard over the sea bass chew the guards 
               head off like a blender

                                     austin
                         not a good time to lose ones head

                                     vanessa
                         indeed

                                     austin
                         thats not the way to get ahead in 
                         life

                                     vanessa
                         yes

                                     austin

                         headstrong
