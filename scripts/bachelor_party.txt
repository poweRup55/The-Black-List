               his head just then raul the eyepatched worker whizzes by 
               behind the guys driving the car in a zigzag pattern right 
               into traffic

               behind them we can see roberto fiddling with the lighter 
               suddenly flames leap out of the car blowing roberto ten 
               feet into the air

               the guys all start to pile into the bus nearby another 
               employee is washing down the garage with a hose

               chulo turns to another mechanic who has his head under the 
               hood of a car

                                     chulo

               manuel waves at chulo who turns hops on the bus rick starts 
               it up and starts to drive away just as the bus clears frame 
               we see manuel connect two wires together at the same moment 
               the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet 
               manuel lights up like a christmas tree screaming in pain 
               there is a beat and then robert falls into frame still 
               holding the cigarette lighter and the car raul is driving 
               enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage

               ext the jean machine  day

               we see a couple of very contemporary looking 15yearolds 
               going into a very now clothing store  like fred segals 
               when the door opens loud rock n roll music blasts out

               int the jean machine  day

               inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving 
               narcissistically to the music like theyre at a disco the 
               cashier phoebe has devoted her life to following the current 
               trends and fads no matter how inane they may be today shes 
               in a reggae mode her hair wound into tight dreadlocks as 
               she sways lost in the ozone to the music a customer 
               approaches her with a purchase

                                     customer
                         id like to pay for these

                         this song is over

               she floats off again

               one of the young male customers approaches an attractive 
               salesgirl this is debbie thomerson ricks intended she 
               seems to be the only sane employee in the place because shes 
               actually working putting clothes on the racks this 
               impression of sanity fits her as she is levelheaded and 
               has a clear sense of herself she can also take a joke thus 
               her engagement to rick

                                     customer

                         right over here

               she leads the customer to the tryon booths the customer 
               enters one we see that the saloonstyle doors of the booths 
               have been hung too high so as he takes off his pants his 
               underwear is exposed to the world we pull back revealing 
               other people in other booths their bare asses clearly in 
               sight no one in the store seems to care however as they 
               are much too busy dancing

               the front door opens and bobbie a very sultry and earthy
               looking girl with long dark hair pushes inside she is 
               oneills girl and debbies best friend shes also someone 
               who would party every night if given half a chance

               the girls screech and jump around hugging each other in 
               sheer joy a male customer moved by this outpouring of 
               affection moves over and gets in the middle of the girls 
               enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once

                                     debbie
                              to customer realizing
                         would you get out of here

               reluctantly the guy retreats back to the calvin klein jeans 
               rack

               new porsche 911 and a jeep all decked out with rifles nets 
               and other hunting equipment as she walks down the path toward 
               the house she sees something off in the distance that 
               startles her

               debbies pov

               a large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side 
               door of the house

               dead it is being carried by a tall handsome hunter he 
               waves to debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside

               int coles smokehouse  day

               debbie opens a rusticlooking door and peers in

               several trophies guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from 
               the wall she makes her way past some sections of an 
               undetermined animals anatomy hanging from hooks suspended 
               from the ceiling finally we see cole whittier a steve garvey 
               lookalike rugged allamerican and heir to the whittier 
               plastic wrap fortune despite his jockish good looks and 
               outward arrogance theres something in his manner that is 
               definitely unsavory

               as debbie approaches him we see that he is butchering some 
               unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of 
               him note for the squeamish all of this is done out of 
               frame the only thing we should hear are the delightful sounds 
               of taxidermy

               margot and darlene start to sink to the floor out of our 
               sight before they disappear we see margot take out her gum 
               and park it on an end table now out of sight the girls 
               watch for a beat then we hear the whirring of darlenes 
               implement our girls screech in horror and hold onto one 
               another in a protective clump

                         thats a good question from the way 
                         i understand it according to supply 
                         side economics when supply exceeds 
                         demand recession is the result 
                         thats why i think we should control 
                         the credit markets and increase the 
                         prime rate that way the consumer 
                         price index will stabilize and we 
                         will have economic recovery

               one gigantic sniff

               angle  desiree

               she lets her long flowing hair hang down over her breasts 
               then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor she rolls 
               on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees

               the donkey takes another step forward and then suddenly 
               rears up on his hind legs snorting he starts bucking wildly 
               the crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk 
               for a few seconds then without warning collapses in a heap 
               on the floor

                         mind

               mr thomerson pushes oneill aside and enters the bedroom

               mr thomerson in the bedroom picks up the receiver as he 
               does so a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece he 
               screams at rick gesturing with the phone in his hand as he 
               dials each move produces a large cloud of powder which 
               causes him to sniffle slightly

                                     mr thomerson
                         i never liked you ive never liked

                         out of my life

               he starts to react from inhaling the powder he puts the 
               receiver to his ear he takes a deep breath and tries to 
               dial another number a large cloud of coke flies up his nose 
               hes stunned he takes another deep drag hes hooked he 
               forgets all about dialing he jams the receiver against his 
               nose and takes deep drag after deep drag

               desiree still wearing her leather mask crosses to him and 
               sits down next to him on the bed he gives her a big wide
