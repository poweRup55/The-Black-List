back to the future

screenplay by robert zemeckis  bob gale

mach 11 1980

int orpheum theater  laboratory of professor emmett brown

the credits began to roll across the tv screen for the movie  close 
encounters as the 34inch cassette finished copying over to beta and 
vhs seventeenyearold marty mcfly looks up from his issue of rolling 
stone where he was checking out an ad for a guitar amp maybe after a 
few more pirated tapes he would have enough money to buy it

marty sets the magazine down and stops the tapes rewinds them then 
takes a pen and carefully writes close encounters original edition on 
the labels he places the master tape in a drawer other titles of 
bootlegged videotapes jump out at him as he does so the empire strikes 
back stir crazy and  superman ii

marty turns off the video equipment and picks up his schoolbooks along 
with the other two videocassettes he walks into another room connected 
to the video lab this one is much larger filled with workbenches 
covered with electronics chemical equipment and dust

marty
professor brown its almost eight thirty  im outta here

professor emmett brown
shhhhhhhh

professor emmett brown hissed his white head bent over what looked to 
marty like a solar cell at 65 he was considered the town eccentric 
an inventor whos inventions didnt always work the way they were 
supposed to professor brown was tall  though his posture had grown 
more hunched with age  and had a mane of shaggy white hair that was 
almost always unruly and uncombed at the moment the professor tries 
to get the cell positioned under the skylight in a certain way maybe 
to catch the sunlight marty stepped closer to him curious on what the 
project was

whatever he was working on it looked old maybe 30 years the professor 
pours some kind of chemical solution into a compartment in the cell and 
plugs a patch cord from it into a voltmeter a light bulb on the panel 
glows dimly and the meter needles moves slightly

professor emmett brown
blast it twenty four measly volts

professor brown throws a flask across the room in his frustration 
shattering it against the wall marty jumps back startled 

professor emmett brown
the power of a million hydrogen bombs
pointing to the sun that shone down though the skylight then to his 
experiment
and we get twenty four measly volts its not fair ive been 
working on this power converter since 1949 and youd think in all that 
time i could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert 
radiation into electric energy but no thirty three years of 
dedication and research and all ive got to show for it is a bootleg 
video operation

marty
that reminds me if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain ive 
got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house  we could 
be sellin new movies on the street before theyre even in the theater

professor emmett brown
a 35mm film chain ill see what i can do 

he turns his attention back to his power converter marty crosses the 
room heading for the front door he pauses at the door next to it the 
one with five locks on it and tried the knob it was still locked big 
surprise he thought with some disappointment

professor emmett brown
wont give up will you marty 

professor brown asks without turning around marty grins

marty
one of these days youre gonna leave this door open and ill find out 
whats in there

professor brown glances at him

professor emmett brown
did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason

marty
nope the way i figure it doors are made to be opened see you after 
school

professor emmett brown
oh  marty  what time did you say it was

marty stopped in his tracks a few steps away from the stairs

marty
eight thirty

professor emmett brown
am or pm

marty
rolls his eyes pro the suns out

professor emmett brown
 oh right right glancing up at the skylights

marty
jeez for a guy with a ton of clocks you sure dont pay much attention 
to time

professor brown looks quickly at all the synchronized clocks around the 
room

professor emmett brown
on the contrary standing up and walking toward marty i may not pay 
much attention to the measurement of time but im very aware of time 
itself i believe time to be its own dimension to be controlled 
to be contained

marty runs down the stairs having had enough of the professors weird 
ramblings

marty
catch you later he called over his shoulder

professor emmett brown
continues speaking to the empty room to be traveled through

he reached into his lab coat pocket and pulled out some keys oneby
one the professor unlocks the locks on the door finally he opens it 
and walked inside

int laboratory of professor emmett brown  locked room

a tangle of equipment was in the center of the room with a number of 
lenses at the end of the maze it resembled nothing so much as a large 
ray gun or laser professor brown stood back and admired it if only i 
could harness enough power he said wistfully

ext orpheum theatre  morning

marty opened the door at the end of the stairs and stepped out on the 
street before the orpheum theater the place had been abandon years 
before its windows boarded over the marquee still spelled out the 
last movie that had played there  assembly of christ professor brown 
resided on the third floor of the structure the only person who used 
the premises now

marty walked down the street headed for wilsons cafe parked a 
hundred feet down the street was a black van the sign on it read 
nrc and two men were carefully putting samples of water from a 
gutter into little test tubes marty glanced at them for a moment 
somewhat curious they ignored him he reached the cafe and went 
inside

int wilsons cafe

the owner dick wilson was sitting behind the counter only thirty
five he already had lost more hair than remained on his head even 
though he was a good hundred pounds overweight he was eating a babe 
ruth candy bar while reading a newspaper

marty
morning dick

dick
setting the candy bar down marty whats for breakfast

marty
gimme some chili fries and a tab

marty glanced down at the newspaper lying on the counter

dick
hot tip bringing marty his drink rubber biscuit in the third race at 
arlington

marty
nods dick whats with those guys out there in the gutter tilting 
his head towards the window

dick
squints out the window and shrugs third time theyve been out there 
this week

 marty watches them for a moment loading up the water samples in the 
van 

marty
whats nrc

dick
shrugs again i dont know national cash register

int high school

later that afternoon marty stared at the textbook page in his hand it 
showed a photo of a mushroom cloud with the words last above ground 
atomic test march 18 1952 atkins nevada he took his pen and wrote 
the letters mm  sp on the cloud and drew and arrow through it like 
a valentine he added at the bottom how about the dance saturday 
well have a blast
in the background his science teacher mr arky droned on with the 
days lecture 

mr arky
there were only three above ground atomic tests in the united states 
so the government took every opportunity to study the effects of 
radiation actual single family tract homes were constructed on the 
test site totally furnished with refrigerators tvs furniture

what a waste of perfectly good stuff marty thought

mr arky
anything you could find in a typical home just so scientists could 
learn what kind of damage an atomic bomb would do to a typical town 
they even put mannequins in the houses just like in auto crash tests

marty tore the page with the picture and note out of his book he 
turned to look at suzy parker the pretty alburnhaired girl across the 
aisle and a seat behind him he quickly folded the page and winked at 
her before tossing it deftly on her desk the teacher didnt notice

mr arky
but the fact remains that today thirty years after those early nuclear 
tests the threat of nuclear annihilation is as great as it ever was 
certainly nuclear annhiliation is something you all must have thought 
about any questions comments ideas

 no marty thought glancing around everyone in the class apparently 
agreed with him

mr arky
anyone im talking about the complete and total destruction of the 
entire world doesnt anybody have anything to say about it

no one raised a hand mr arkys face began to turn red

mr arky
how about you mr jackson he asked raising his voice would you like 
to share some of your wisdom with the class

jackson didnt look up from the textbook ignoring the teacher marty 
felt something brush against his foot and looked down to see the folded 
note that he had given suzy on the floor he leaned over and scooped it 
off the floor mr arky continued to ask for volunteers

mr arky
mr gomez any thoughts miss parker mr crump any reaction

marty unfolded the note and looked at it beside the cloud the words 
thats sick had been written in loopy cursive marty turned the page 
over on the back was the word yes he smiled then was rudely snapped 
out of his thoughts by the science teachers irritating voice

mr arky
how about you mr mcfly

arky asked strolling over to his desk marty quickly crumpled the note 
and shoved it in his pocket before the teacher could see it he stared 
at his graffittied desk top wishing mr arky would go away 

mr arky
did you even hear the question mr mcfly

marty looked up facing the inevitable he might as well give his 
honest opinion

marty
yeah you want to know what i think about atomic bombs well id 
kind of like to see one

mr arky leaned forward so his face was a few inches from martys

mr arky
youd like to see a nuclear holocaust

marty
not a holocaust  

mr arky
mr mcfly here wants to nuke it all just so he can see it

a couple students started to laugh marty sat up straighter glared at 
the teacher

marty
you know damn well thats not what i meant

mr arky
all i can say is thats one helluva attitude mr mcfly lets 
explode a hundred megaton geothermal nuclear device just to see it 

marty felt his face turn red with anger and embarrassment

marty
yeah explode it up your ass

mr arky
unfortunately the way things are going you may get your wish you may 
see the entire annhiliation of the world if not youll certainly see 
the destruction of all out natural resources we can already see the 
air we breathe not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes 
well  see all of our oil reserves depleted in fact all of our energy 
sources yes you people have a lot to look forward to  a lot to see

marty
hey mr arky gimme a break rolling his eyes im seventeen years 
old im not responsible for all these problems

the anger in mr arkys face suddenly vanished he sighed a sound of 
defeat

mr arky
no of course youre not not for the problems no but for the 
solutionsyes

the bell rang ending the school day everyone leaped out of their 
desks and rushed for the door 

mr arky
see you tomorrow

ext high school

ten minutes later marty was outside at the front of school heading 
for a group of his friends who were already giving other students 
videotapes in return for cash

rafe newton
hey marty heading his way sport me fifty til the weekend would ya 
im down to my last twenty

marty shook his head 

marty

rafe newton

marty

donaldson one of his friends stood next to him he looked at martys 
watch

donaldson
hey man what happened to your digital quartz

marty
in the shop so im sporting this antique lifts his left hand with 
the watch on it check out this windup action pointing to the gold 
timepiece

donaldson looked at it with minor interest as the both of them went 
down the front steps of the school

donaldson
hey you wanna come over  get high

marty

donaldson snapped his fingers

donaldson
hey that reminds me  my brothers gettin married next week and im 
throwin a party for him can you provide some entertainment

marty nodded having the perfect thing in mind

marty
yeah i can run something off this afternoon

int orpheum theater  laboratory of professor emmett brown

the man and woman were really going at it now breathing hard and 
moaning typical sounds of sex marty watched for a moment then shook 
his head and turned away from the porno video he was copying for his 
friend twisting the volume down as the couple started to get really 
noisy he fished some cash out of his pocket and placed it in the cigar 
box where he was storing all the money he was saving to use for that 
new amp he got up from his chair and walked out of the room into 
professor browns lab

the professor was lying on his cot asleep with a heavy blanket 
covering him marty walked quietly over to the refrigerator and opened 
it taking out a bottle of coke as he was pulling the soft drink out 
his hand accidentally bumped against an orange lying beside it before 
he had a chance to catch it it bounced out of the fridge and rolled 
across the floor vanishing under the cot

marty set down the coke on top of the fridge and bent down to picked 
the orange up he pushed aside the blanket and saw a crate purple 
radioactive emblems on it marty frowned as he read the labels extreme 
danger radioactive plutonium authorized personal only do not handle 
without radiation suit near the bottom were the words property of san 
onofre nuclear power plant san onofre california

right next to the word california was the orange taking a deep breath 
marty stood up and kicked the orange out from under the cot with his 
right foot he slowly backed away his eyes on the crate before 
picking the orange up and tossing it into the trash can next to the 
refrigerator marty glanced at the professor relieved to see that he 
hadnt woken up

trying to forget what he had seen marty picked the coke bottle up and 
twisted the cap off taking a quick swig from it before walking over to 
a cage with an organgrinder monkey in it

marty
hey shemp softly how ya doin

the monkey gazed back at him with dark eyes marty unlatched the cage 
door and let the animal out shemp quickly climbed up his arm and sat 
on his shoulder marty crossed the room over to the table where the 
power converter was still set up resting on some old blueprints he 
leaned over for a closer look at those

the top blueprint was for something called photoelectric chemical 
power converter the sketch on the blueprint matched the power 
converter that the professor had been messing with earlier marty 
flipped that blueprint back to look at the others onebyone 15 tube 
mechanical home butler it looked like some kind of robot aeromobile 
a weirdlooking flying car and a writeomatic which looked like a 
pen with a suction cup at the end of an attached wire
marty let the blueprints flip back and stared at the power onverter 
the last few rays of the afternoon sunlight filtered through the 
skylight and shone down on the photocell marty looked closer and 
noticed a funnel shaped thingy jutting out of the chemical chamber he 
looked at it for a moment temptation building then reached over and 
poured some of the coke in the funnel
he hadnt even pulled his arm back when a bright spark shot out of the 
opposite end of the device making a loud cracking noise marty jumped 
several feet away his heart pounding almost dropping the bottle in 
his hand

professor emmett brown
what happened 

the professor jumped out of his bed and ran over to the table where the 
power converter sat

marty
well im not sure exactly  i accidentally spilled some coke in here 
pointing to the funnel just a drop

the professor quickly hooked up the voltmeter and light bulb to the 
converter

professor emmett brown
give me that

professor brown snatched the bottle from martys hands he poured some 
more of the drink into the funnel the bulb started glowing brightly 
and the meter jumped the whole thing started to make a humming noise 
professor brown dumped in more coke the light grew even brighter then 
suddenly exploded
marty flinched but didnt turn away he was dying to know what that 
thing was supposed to be doing he wanted to know almost as bad as he 
wanted to get into that locked room several feet away the voltmeters 
needle raised off the scale as the power converter began to vibrate so 
violently that it fell off the table
the professor stared at the floor where the converter lay his hands 
starting to tremble he had a strange look on his face disbelief mixed 
with excitement he looked carefully at the coke bottle

professor emmett brown
whats in this stuff

marty gave a shrug not understanding why professor brown wanted to 
know

marty
nobody knows the formula for cocacola its the most closely guarded 
secret in the world

the professor was silent for a moment his gaze far away he finally 
picked the power converter up and walked across the room taking out a 
key ring from his pocket 

professor emmett brown
ill see you tomorrow

he said as he began to unlock the forbidden door before marty could 
ask him any questions the professor opened the door and shut it firmly 
behind him marty heard the sound of locks clicking into place then 
all was silent

int mcfly house  martys bedroom

that evening wearing headphones plugged into his turntable marty 
walked around his bedroom following the music on his own electric 
guitar posters of rock stars covered the surrounding walls he was 
trying to find the drill he had been using earlier moving the 
miscellaneous junk that covered his furniture and floor with the top of 
the guitars neck under the rolling stone on the dresser were some 
tools  but not the drill a couple issues of heavy metal and the 
lampoon hid some homework on the desk he had forgotten to turn in

the record ended and marty took the headphones off

marty
who stole my drill yelling out the door

martys mom shouted a reply

eileen
dinners ready

with a sigh marty set his guitar down and went downstairs

int mcfly house  living room

he stopped in the living room on the way to the kitchen his father 
george mcfly was sitting on the couch and watching a boxing match on 
the tv

marty

dad continued to stare at the tv ignoring or not hearing the question 
eileen mcfly looked into the living room from the kitchen

eileen

marty

how am i gonna get famous if i dont practice

mom shook her head once a long time ago she had been quite 
attractive now at the age of 47 it was easy to see the toll age had 
taken her brown hair was streaked with grey and her face was puffy 
lined with wrinkles both of martys parents hadnt aged that 
gracefully

eileen

she ducked back into the kitchen

marty turned back to his dad

marty

george

marty
the drill exasperated the power drill i bought you for christmas i 
was using it last night

dad didnt move his gaze from the tv

george

marty shook his head and went into the kitchen sitting down as his 
mother put the food on the table she leaned back into the living room

int mcfly house  kitchen

eileen

martys father continued to stare at the tv fully absorbed in the 
boxing match

george

he makes no move to get up

eileen

george

a moment later a commercial came on the tv and george mcfly finally got 
up and started to roll the tv on its stand to the dining room

eileen

eileen

his dad finished adjusting the tv and sat down

george

marty

marty
oh yeah

george

dad turned his eyes back to the tv as the match resumed marty looked 
down at the newspaper examining the sports scores and his mom stared 
off into space there was complete silence during which the 
sportscaster did his blowby blow on the tv eventually mom spoke 
during another commercial break

eileen
by the way that reminds me gesturing to the tvs burger ad 
saturday night were taking grandma stella out for chinese food

george

marty

so scared you spilled your creamed corn

dad continued to look at the tv not showing any sign of hearing his 
wife

marty

i are gonna go down to the lake and watch the sunrise

his dad looked away long enough from the tv to frown at him

george

marty

his dad turned away to the tv the look on his face puzzled 
unfortunately his mom was not as easily distracted

eileen

marty
mom how else are we gonna see the sunrise

eileen
i dont think i like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl 

mom decided shaking her head firmly marty rolled his eyes

marty
hey ma gimme a break

before they could discuss the subject any further there was a heavy 
pounding on the back door 

eileen
would you answer that george

eileen asked when no one else made a move to her husband ignored her 
heaving a sigh marty finally stood up to answer it

the visitor was not one of his favorite people biff tannen stood on 
the porch his stomach hanging over the pants in his security guard 
uniform his shirt was untucked and the tie was undone the patch on 
his shoulder read special security officer he was a 47yearold jerk 
who liked to push his father around and marty had no need for him 
whatsoever biff felt the same way about him

biff
well well he smirked when marty opened the door if it isnt the 
neighborhood bootlegger al capone mcfly

marty
what do you want biff

biff
show me some respect you little asshole its special officer tannen 
to you

marty
mumbles the day i show respect to biff tannen will be the day i win a 
million dollars whats the matter biff theyre not showing you any 
respect down at the golf course dont they realize what a tough job it 
is keeping the criminal element away from the country club

biff
listen you little asshole i oughta 

marty
what do you want biff 

biff
wheres your old man

marty took a step back and pointed over his shoulder to the kitchen 
biff pushed his way into the house and marty saw he had a broken power 
drill and some bits in hand he suddenly felt sick

biff
hey mcfly whats with this cheapass drill youre giving me thing 
burned up first time i used it almost ruined my whole engine block

marty shook his head in disgust as he sat down again at the table his 
dad immediately turned away from the tv

george
uh  biff pointing to the bits these are wood bits says so right 
here youre not supposed to use them on your engine block

biff
look mcfly i know a lot about tools this is a cheepass drill 
youre just lucky i didnt ruin my engine block next time you buy 
tools let me know ill help you pick out some good ones

he handed george the drill

biff
oh  and one more thing my kids selling girl scout cookies i told 
her you were good for four boxes dont make me a liar

george nodded quickly and biff left slamming the door behind him 
george turned to look at his wife who gave at him a knowing 
sympathetic look

george
how do you like that guy using wood bits on an engine block laughing 
nervously

marty couldnt take it anymore he jumped up from the table and ran 
into the living room grabbing his silver porsche jacket out of the 
closet

eileen
where are you going

ext mcfly house

marty opened the front door and slammed it shut in reply he pulled his 
jacket on as he crossed the front lawn reaching the mailbox he gave 
the numbers on it 777 a good slug then kicked his dads car beside 
it in the street for good measure

ext neighborhood street  night

half an hour later he was walking down a neighborhood street with suzy 
parker 

marty
he just lets himself get pushed around all the time people walk all 
over him and he never fights back never stands up for himself

suzy
no self confidence i guess at least you dont take after him

marty
yeah jesus i wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my 
mom

suzy didnt say anything for a few moments 

suzy
can you imagine your parents in bed together

marty
no way

suzy
me neither ive always wondered whether they slept together before 
they got married you think yours did

marty
hell no the way my mom carries on about sex  you even mention the 
word and she goes into cardiac arrest you shoulda seen her face when i 
told her we were gonna stay up all night saturday he added always 
afraid something is going to happen

suzy
suddenly coy is  something going to happen saturday night

before marty could answer her a skateboard suddenly hit his foot he 
looked up to see two kids about fifty feet down the street running an 
obstacle course the one who had been on the board was slowly getting 
to his feet off the asphalt marty jumped on the board and skated over 
to the kid maybe it was because suzy was there but he showed off as 
he weaved through the obstacle jumping over the last one and landing 
perfectly then flipping the board into the air and catching it the 
kids were wideeyed as marty handed it to the owner

kid
wow youre good

marty grinned and walked back over to an impressed suzy

marty
just like riding a bike  you never forget how to do it

ext suzys house

a minute later they were standing in front of suzys house

suzy
well she said slowly here we are

they stared at each other for a moment

marty
thanks

marty said softly leaning forward and kissing her

suzy smiled and walked to her door

suzy
see you later

marty watched her as she stepped inside then turned around and started 
to walk back home
 a black sedan slowly passed him a moment later marty noticed 
headlights shining from behind him and whirled around to see that the 
black sedan had turned around and seemed to be following him marty saw 
the car had the letters nrc on it like that van had he stepped to 
the side of the street on the sidewalk and the car pulled up beside 
him and stopped two tall men dressed in black suits got out they 
looked like secret service men

nrc agent reese
good evening one said agents reese  points to his buddy and foley 
from the nuclear regulatory commition pulls out id and flashes it to 
marty mind stepping over here

marty
whats this all about

nrc agent foley
routine radiation check

he took a geiger counter from the car and ran it up and down martys 
body nothing happened until it got by his feet especially his right 
foot then it made loud clicking noises the two men exchanged some 
kind of look

nrc agent reese
have you got any identification 

marty handed him his wallet after a moments hesitation

marty
what am i radioactive or something 

nrc agent reese
no no not beyond an acceptable level have you been xrayed recently 
martin

nrc agent foley
perhaps been in contact with some luminous paint foley added

marty
frowning at them no

nrc agent reese

marty

nrc agent foley

marty

nrc agent reese

marty hesitated for a moment before answering they were talking about 
where professor brown lived he remembered the box he had seen under 
the bed suddenly marty had a million questions for the professor 

marty
no

reese finally handed him back his wallet 

nrc agent reese
okay martin you have a good evening now

marty
yeah jamming his wallet back into his pocket right

the two men got back into their car and drove off marty watched them a 
moment then sprinted the other way down the street

ext orpheum theatre  night

marty ran through the streets all the way to the orpheum theater the 
street was deserted save for a newspaper blowing down in the gutter 
reaching the door to the upstairs of the dilapidated building marty 
took hold of the knob and turned it it resisted and he tried again 
hoping it was stuck he juggled it around but it didnt budge no doubt 
about it it was locked marty took a step back and looked up at the 
third floor

a moment later the quiet of the night was shattered by all three of the 
third floor windows being blown out by a huge gush of air jesus marty 
gasped ducking his head as shreds of glass rained down a moment later 
he tried the door again but it was still locked

after weighing the pros and cons of the matter marty broke the glass 
window in the door and reached around to unlock it himself

int orpheum theater  laboratory of professor emmett brown

once inside he ran up the steps to the lab the first thing he noticed 
was that the mysterious door with all the locks was completely  un 
locked a crack of light shone brightly under the bottom of the door 
marty opened it up and stepped inside he blinked wondering if he was 
seeing right

professor brown was standing next to what looked like a old furnace and 
hot water heater thrown together with some boiler room parts he had 
one hand on a rope attached to a metal lever and was messing with some 
dials and gauges with the other hand shemp wearing his organ grinder 
outfit sat on a stool a digital watch on a cord around his neck some 
kind of long tube with lenses in it was pointed at him

marty
professor 

the professor looked up startled

professor emmett brown
get behind that lead shield

the professor ordered pointing to a large grey sheet of metal next to 
the wall marty stared at him incredulously

marty
but professor 

professor emmett brown
get behind the shield im about to release radiation

marty looked at him for a moment more then darted behind the shield 
he watched from around the side of it as the professor pulled the rope 
a tiny bit the next moment all hell broke loose the low hum all the 
machinery made grew louder and high pitched static electricity 
crackled in the air the sounds grew louder and the monkey looked 
around curious a minute later the professor let go of the rope his 
eyes on a watch and a red beam of light  like a laser  hit shemp 
directly in the chest

marty winced at the high pitched noise in the room less then a second 
after the laser  or whatever it was  hit the professors pet shemp 
vanished taking the top of the stool with him air suddenly rushed 
into the room whipping loose papers around the noise died down and 
marty stepped out from behind the shield his heart pounding from all 
he had witnessed

marty
jesus professor you just disintegrated shemp

professor brown shook his head a smile playing around his lips 

professor emmett brown
no marty shemps molecular structure is completely intact

marty
then where the hell is he

professor emmett brown
the appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he you see shemp 
has just become the worlds first time traveller ive sent shemp into 
the future  two minutes into the future to be exact

marty
the future what are you talking about wheres shemp

professor emmett brown
shemp is right here in this roomtwo minutes from now and at exactly 
902pm well catch up to him

marty
now hold on a minute professor hold the phone are you trying to tell 
me that this  all of this here  that this is  its a  a  

for some reason he couldnt get the words out

professor emmett brown
a time machine

professor brown confirmed with a nod

marty found a chair and sat down in it quickly before his legs could 
give out on him

professor emmett brown
i always knew it would work i knew it would work when i built it 
thirty three years ago but i was never able to harness enough power to 
test it power is the key massive amounts of energy to accelerate 
matter to the speed of light while creating an intense gravitational 
field but generating that kind of energy has never been possible 
until this afternoon

marty took a couple of deep breaths as he waited for the room to stop 
spinning around him

marty
a time machine because of that coke

professor emmett brown
precisely nods

he walked around the room pointing out various parts of the machinery 
as explained

professor emmett brown
the power converter now operating at peak efficiency thanks to the 
chemical makeup of cocacola channels energy into the flux capacitor 
which releases several jigowatts in a fraction of a millisecond 
electron acceleration takes place here and the result is the 
temporal displacement beam you saw a few moments ago the entire 
process is triggered when i release the rope

marty finally stood his legs still shaking a little from the shock

marty
i thought that power converter thing operated on solar energy theres 
no sun pointing to the ceiling and walls

not only was it night out but all the windows had heavy shades drawn 
over them

professor emmett brown
solar energy would have worked just fineif i could have placed the 
converter about a mile from the surface of the sun instead ive 
created similar conditions in this reactor here pointing to the rope 
the higher i raise the cadmium rods the more energy i release from the 
plutonium core and the further through time i can send an object

marty snapped his fingers suddenly remembering

marty
the plutonium thats what i came over here for professor where did 
you get that stuff

professor emmett brown
why

the inventor stared at him with suspicious his eyes narrowed

professor emmett brown
i just got stopped in the street by federal agents checking me for 
radiation i figure theyre after your plutonium

professor brown looked over at a digital clock on the wall marty 
followed his gaze and saw that it was 90150 almost two minutes had 
passed since the experiment it had felt like twice that long

professor emmett brown
ten seconds 

the professor dashed over to the place where his beam had hit shemp 
marty ran after him stopping when his friend raised an arm

professor emmett brown
brace yourself for a sudden displacement of air

 marty watched the clock the seconds lasted forever 
901555657 5859

at that moment a strong wind gusted in the room and shemp suddenly 
appeared literally out of thin air the top of the stool came back 
with him and fell to the ground the monkey screeched as he hit the 
ground and scrambled onto some equipment nearby

marty
shemp

professor brown walked calmly over to the animal and picked him up he 
quickly looked him over the monkey squirming to get free then 
examined the watch around his neck he held it up for marty to see 
90010 marty checked the clock on the wall 90210

professor emmett brown
exactly two minutes difference triumphantly and its still 
ticking

marty
is shemp all right

professor brown set the monkey down on the ground he quickly ran off to 
the other side of the room

professor emmett brown
of course shemp is unaware that anything even happened other than his 
stool suddenly falling over we had to wait two minutes to catch up to 
him but for shemp the trip was instantaneous

marty
professor can this thing send shemp back in time

the professor thought about that for a moment

professor emmett brown
theoretically yes if i were to reverse the polarity

he pointed to a switch near the rope with a plus and minus at opposite 
ends it was currently up in the plus position

marty
jeez professor youve got a gold mine here

the professor frowned as if he didnt understand 

professor emmett brown
a gold mine

marty
sure listen  we take the racing results from todays paper

he grabbed an newspaper from earlier that day at a nearby table and 
quickly flipped through to the sports scores

marty
here they are we send em with shemp back to yesterday we get the 
information put our money on the winning horses and become 
billionaires

professor brown started to shake his head

professor emmett brown
marty that would alter history

marty
so what wed be rich

professor emmett brown
dont you understand the mere act of sending matter back in time would 
change the course of events and changing history is a responsibility 
that i do not wish to bear

marty sighed lowering the paper

marty
all i know is youre throwing away an awful lot of money

professor emmett brown
the future marty the future is everything i built this machine to 
see the future so i am going to send shemp twentyfour hours into the 
future you can assist me if you like

marty
sure he agreed quickly

the professor left the room for a moment saying something about a 
cassette recorder marty waited for a second then quickly ripped the 
racing results off the sports page and circled the date with a pen that 
had been in his pocket he went over to shemp stuffed the clipping in 
the pocket on his vest then glanced out the door the professor was 
rifling through the papers on his desk his back to the door marty 
rushed over to the polarity switch and yanked the lever to the minus 
sign a couple seconds later professor brown returned a micro
cassette recorder in hand he locked the door then handed the recorder 
to marty

professor emmett brown
take this stand at the panelpointing to a wall of switches near the 
beam and read off the radiation levels i want to have a record of 
what happens here be sure to tell me when we reach 85 rads

marty nodded and stepped over to the panel right before him was a 
meter with the rads levels he had his eyes on it as professor brown 
fixed the stool a few feet away

professor emmett brown
come on shemp this wont hurt a bit

the professor murmured as he picked up the monkey and placed him on the 
stool again after doing that he returned to the rope switch across 
the room from where marty stood and on the other side of shemp marty 
watched him carefully but he didnt seem to notice the lever at the 
minus sign

professor emmett brown
here we go

the professor warned throwing a few switches the equipment started 
humming again and professor brown slowly reached for the rope and 
started tugging on it

marty
radiation level 10 rads

marty said looking at the meter holding the microphone in the recorder 
up to his mouth as he spoke

marty
stabilization coefficient 43 16 rads coefficient 44 37 rads 46 
51 rads 46 73 rads 47

marty heard a loud noise from behind him and spun around to see the 
locked door kicked open the dust hadnt even cleared before marty 
realized it was the nrc agents reese and foley behind them he saw 
a huge throng of police and other official people the agents jumped 
into the room with 38 guns drawn

nrc agent reese
everybody freeze nrc

professor emmett brown
get back 

professor brown cried waving his left hand the other one was still 
holding onto the rope

nrc agent foley
jesus christ seeing the machine the professor was standing beside 
its a goddamn reactor

reese pointed his gun at professor brown 

nrc agent reese
you shut it down now

 marty stared at the whole scene mouth hanging open he felt strangely 
detached from it almost as if it was a play or a scene in a movie he 
was watching the microphone fell from his hand dangling on its cord 
around his feet

professor emmett brown
no  get out im in the middle of an experiment 

he moved closer to the reactor pulling the rope tighter as he did so 
foley didnt hesitate he swung his gun at the professor and squeezed 
the trigger the loud bang echoed in the room shemp screeched and 
leaped off the stool marty watched horrified as the bullet hit his 
friend right in the chest the professor staggered back hand still 
clenched around the rope he fell backwards to the floor the rope 
pulling taut as he landed

marty
professor 

marty yelled finally finding his voice he whipped his head to check 
the meter 

marty
oh my god release the rope its 4200 rads

reese stared at him shaking his head it was too noisy in the room for 
marty to be heard 

nrc agent reese
what

marty
pro release the rope 

it was so noisy he could hardly hear his own voice reese shook his 
head again marty started for the professor himself foley turned the 
gun on him

nrc agent foley
freeze 

marty stopped standing right before the stool where shemp had once 
been he raised his hands showing he didnt have anything on him the 
recorder and microphone was now in his jacket pocket he couldnt 
remember putting it there with all the excitement

martys eyes darted over to the professor as he watched the 
professors grip suddenly relaxed and the rope swung loosely in the 
air marty suddenly realized he was right in the line of the focusing 
lense a bright white light shot out from it and hit him square in the 
chest marty looked down at it for a moment a little curiously then 
looked up at the people in the room reese and foley stared at him 
startled looks on there faces suddenly the whole room turned bright 
blinding white like a million cameras flashing at once then less 
then a second later everything was plunged into a deep black silence

int dark storeroom

professor marty asked straining his eyes in the darkness trying to 
see something anything but everything was completely and utterly 
black

marty
hello listening hard for any sound

after a moment marty reached into his pocket and pulled out a 
matchbook he ripped a match free and struck it against the sandpaper 
marty held it up as it lit looking around the room it looked like he 
was in some kind of storeroom marty took a step forward almost 
running into an old broken chair he dodged it last minute and strolled 
slowly around the room trying to figure out where the hell he was 
dusty furniture and crates littered the room
the match was starting to burn martys fingers and he dropped it 
fumbling to light another he walked towards the door having the 
nagging feeling that something was strangely out of place where the 
hell am i he wondered marty reached for the doorknob and tried 
turning it locked

marty
damn

he looked around for a way out marty spotted a window and went over to 
it holding his breath as he tried to slide it open it slid and he 
carefully climbed outside on to a fire escape he scrambled down the 
unstable structure and dropped to the alley below

ext street

just as his feet scraped the pavement marty noticed a pair of 
headlights approaching him fast he stood there for a minute frozen 
in the beams then jumped back and pressed himself against the wall of 
the building the truck sped by missing him by inches

marty let out a loud sigh of relief as he watched the truck drive off 
then noticed the sign on the door that he was right next to wilsons 
cafe rear entrance it said marty tried the door expecting it to be 
locked but the knob turned freely in his hand strange for as long as 
he could remember the back door had been locked
marty stepped inside

marty
hey since when are you open at 

he started to say then stopped when he got a good look around it 
couldnt be wilsons cafe
everything in the room looked brand newbut at the same time old 
dick wasnt behind the counter a woman of maybe thirty was marty 
looked up at the menu and gasped

marty
since when were roast beef sandwiches 30 cents and an ice cream sunday 
15 cents 

he tore his eyes off the prices long enough to notice the people boy 
did he notice them all the men were in doublebreasted suits with 
hats and not baseball caps either marty noticed all the women were 
in skirts  long skirts not one was in any type of pants like jeans 
and the way people had their hair done those styles went out  ages 
ago

a chubby fiveyearold boy dressed in pajamas was playing on the 
floor with some trucks marty almost tripped over him as he walked 
slowly around his mouth open with amazement gazing at everything 
after a moment he realized the woman behind the counter was staring at 
him a suspicious look on her face you want something kid she asked 
leaning forward across the counter

marty hesitated for a moment then sat down he decided he needed to 
blend in as much as he could the silver porsche jacket alone that he 
had on was causing way too many stares 

marty
uh yeah gimme a tab

waitress
what frowning

marty
a tab

the waitress rolled her eyes

waitress
kid i cant give you the tab until you order something

marty tried to ignore the stares everyone was giving him and looked 
down at the counter he saw the man beside him had a cup of coffee

marty
uh coffee

she reached over and poured him a cup

waitress
did something happen to you kid i mean you been lost in the woods or 
something

marty looked at her blankly

marty
huh noticing a bowl of sugar cubes on the counter say have you got 
any sweet n low

the waitress stared at him

waitress
sweet and what suddenly lifting the coffee away from him maybe youd 
better pay for this first

marty
sure

marty said with a shrug he reached for his wallet and took out a 
twenty dollar bill holding it out to the waitress her eyes bugged out 
and her mouth dropped open

waitress
a twenty what do you think this is a bank i cant break a twenty 
eyes narrowing suspiciously say whats a kid your age doing with all 
this money

marty quickly stuffed the bill back in his wallet now everyone in the 
cafe was staring at him 

marty
look maybe id better talk to dick is he around

waitress
dick dick who

marty
now whos being stupid the guy who runs this place

waitress
i run this place eyes once again narrow

marty
what happened to dick wilson

waitress
dick wilson dickie wilson dickie wilson runs this place thats a 
laugh

marty felt his face redden as everyone in the room started to laugh 
with the waitress

marty
what are you trying to do freak me out or something

man with coffee
freak

the man beside him with the coffee asked 

man with coffee
are you from some circus is that what all that writing on your clothes 
means

marty
havent you ever heard of designer labels glaring at him

he heard soft footsteps from behind the counter and saw the little 
fiveyearold run up to the woman

dickie
mommy im hungry he whined

the waitress smiled

waitress
just take a candy bar then go to bed dickie

marty did a double take 

marty
dickie thats dick wilson

the waitress nodded

waitress
thats dick wilson

marty watched the kid grab a babe ruth off the candy counter and 
scamper off he was about to turn away from the sight when he noticed a 
calendar behind the cash register a calendar that had the number 1952 
in big black letters

marty
1952 voice rising this is 1952 holy shit you know what this 
means ive gone back in time thirty years thirty goddamn years i 
havent even been born yet

the waitress took one look at him and reached for a phone 

waitress
im calling the cops

marty jumped off the stool and ran out the front door stopping dead in 
the middle of the street everything had changed

ext monroe avenue

monroe avenue once full of old rotting buildings was now a bustling 
thriving business district cars from the 40s and 50s ran up and 
down the streets people were everywhere walking along the streets 
stopping in the shops marty was so shocked to see what he was seeing 
he didnt notice the strange suspicious looks the towspeople were 
flashing at him or the drivers honking at him as they swerved to avoid 
hitting him

he turned and noticed the orpheum theater it too had changed boy 
had it the marquee was lit up with the words john wayne maureen 
ohara  the quiet man in full color people streamed into it and 
from the looks of the place it was a first class movie theater

marty
dammit 

he noticed a man walking by with a newspaper in hand marty ran over to 
him and snatched the paper away ignoring the owners protest as he 
scanned the front page for the date march 11 1952

marty
1952 god dammit

marty threw the paper down on the sidewalk and ran down the street he 
stopped beside an old car and checked out the license plate besides 
the fact it looked nothing like the plates he was used to it also said 


marty
1952 dammit

marty ran off again noticing a phone booth it was empty so he 
stopped

int phone booth

marty went inside and grabbed the phone book he frantically riffled 
through the pages to the listings of browns after a minute he 
located it and ran his finger down the column to brown emmett l 788 
w spruce madison 3489 marty pulled the bic pen out from his pocket 
and circled the line then he reached into his pocket again and pulled 
out all the change he had one nickel and three pennies

marty
dammit

marty picked up the receiver anyway and dialed zero

operator
operator

marty
operator listen this is an emergency i have to make this call but i 
dont have a dime  all i got is a nickel  but you gotta connect me 


operator
sir it only costs a nickel

marty
what 

operator
local calls cost five cents what number do you want

marty looked up and saw the words local calls 5 cents written in plain 
sight on the telephone 

marty
oh  right uh madison 3489

operator
five cents please

marty placed the nickel inside the coin slot and listened as the number 
ran several times

operator
im sorry theres no answer

marty
operator whats todays date

operator
march 11th

marty
what year

operator
nineteen fifty 

marty shook his head

marty
dammit 

he slammed the receiver down and ripped the page out of the phone book 
stuffing it in his pocket then he got out of the phone booth and ran 
down the street

ext mcflybaines house

marty didnt know how long he had been running before he found himself 
on a residential street it looked vaguely familiar but he was too 
exhausted by the recent events to figure out why he leaned against a 
mailbox trying to catch his breath when he happened to look down at 
the numbers on it 777 marty spun around and stared at the house

marty
my house

it looked like his house it was but there were some weird things 
like the trees not being as tall different curtains and a old chevy 
in the driveway marty watched as the front door opened and a woman 
pushed the screen door open to let out a dog marty gasped the woman 
was his mother

marty
mom

marty raced to the front door she didnt notice him and shut the door 
marty ran up the steps and pounded on the front door

marty
mom open up its me

after a few seconds the door opened and his mom stood in the doorway 
she stared at marty without a shred of recognition

marty
mom thank god thank god youre here

his mother stared at him blankly

mom
i bed your pardon young man

marty
mom its me marty dont you know your own son

mom started to close the door her expression uneasy 

mom
i think you have the wrong house

marty shook his head frantically 

marty
no  no  its not panting its not

 a man smoking a pipe approached martys mother from behind 

mr baines
whos there stella

marty
stella no dont tell me youre stella tell me youre eileen please 
tell me youre eileen

in the background marty saw a teenage girl come down the staircase 
she heard the last part of the conversation and went over to the door 
pushing her way past the woman 

eileen
im eileen

he stared into her hazel eyes

marty
how old are you

eileen
smiles seventeen

marty stared at her for a moment more breathing hard before his eyes 
rolled back in his head and he slumped to the ground in a dead faint

int baines house

marty smelled something funny he made a face and turned his head but 
the smell followed him he slowly opened his eyes and looked up into 
the face of someone he knew it looked a lot like him only he didnt 
look as old then marty remembered  he was in 1952

marty
professor professor brown  

professor emmett brown
whispers covertly you know me

the professor removed the smelling salts from under martys nose now 
that he was awake it was only then marty realized he was stretched out 
on a couch in a living room that looked an awful lot like his own

marty
professor you time machine works it works it sent me back in time 
im from 1982

professor emmett brown
ssshhhhh 

professor brown said holding up his hand his expression was both 
thoughtful and suspicious marty heard footsteps and turned his head to 
see his grandfather grandmother and mother all looking thirty years 
younger edging closer to the couch to get a look at him

mr baines
is he all right

the professor straightened up

professor emmett brown
he will be simple inebriation is all the young man must have a 
rather low tolerance for alcohol something that runs in the family 
you see hes a second cousin of mine on my mothers side came quite a 
distance to visit me he added his names lewis

marty
marty

professor emmett brown
uh marty lewis i almost didnt recognize him  havent seen him in 
years

eileen stared at marty and he looked back at her fascinated that this 
young teenager was  would be  his mother she looked so 
different attractive even

stella
its a good thing he had your name circled in the phone book i would 
have called the police

professor brown leaned over and helped marty sit up

professor emmett brown
well mrs baines mr baines thank you for your trouble both marty 
and i apologize for the inconvenience well get him home and as good 
as new

mr baines looked sharply at marty and shook his finger at him

mr baines
son you watch yourself

marty
yes sir

eileen
oh

eileen began going over to a chair a few feet away and picking up the 
silver jacket of martys 

eileen
heres your jacket

marty
uh thanks

eileen held up the jacket and gave it a quizzical look

eileen
what kind of material is this ive never seen anything like it

he took it from her hand

marty
its polyester

eileen
polywhat

professor emmett brown
its an experimental invention of mine sort of a rubberized silver
foil i just made up a name for it come on marty weve got a lot to 
talk about

marty followed the professor he was just about to step out the door 
when eileen stopped him 

eileen
marty

he turned

marty
huh

eileen
have we ever met before 

she asked with a puzzled look on her face martys eyes met hers but 
before he could open his mouth the professor grabbed his arm and 
pulled him out the door

int car

fifteen minutes later the professors 1937 packard was pulling into 
the driveway of a huge victorian mansion on the outskirts of town

marty
and the flux capacitor is hooked into this thing that looks like a 
condenser with a lense on it 

marty was saying as professor brown stopped the car he looked at the 
house for the first time and let out a low whistle as they both got out 
of the car even in the dark marty was able to see how fancy it was

ext brown mansion

marty
jeez  this is where you used to live huh you must have been rich

professor emmett brown
must have been used to live i do live here

marty
oh yeah

they started to walk up the drive to the front door

marty
well theres a mall here now  i mean there will be

professor emmett brown
a mall

marty
yeah a shopping mall you know a shopping mall

professor brown held his hands up and shook his head 

professor emmett brown
ssshhhhh  dont tell me these things marty i dont want to know 
about the future

int brown mansion

he opened the front door and stepped inside the living room marty 
looked around as the professor switched on the lights professor brown 
held his hands up and shook his head 

professor emmett brown
do you see it here

the living room was filled with antique furniture pieces of different 
mechanical devices lying everywhere it was easy to see that the 
professors love of inventing was just beginning since everything was 
still relatively neat but there was no sign of the time machine marty 
shook his head

marty
no

professor brown walked across the room and into another one this one 
appeared to be a study bookshelves lined the walls filled with old 
volumes on the desk in the center of the room marty recognized little 
models of that one robot and flying car he had seen plans of in the 
future the professor watched marty as he glanced about the room but 
he had to shake his head again no time machine

the professor crossed the room over to a door at the far end of the 
study he pulled out a key and unlocked it pushing it open he 
switched a light on inside and gestured for marty to come over marty 
only had to glance at the room for a second before recognizing the time 
machine it looked a little less run down cleaner and shinier but it 
was the time machine nonetheless this is it

professor brown placed the key back in his pocket and looked hard at 
marty

professor emmett brown
youve convinced me that you must be who you say you are no living 
human has ever seen this machine frowns but why why even in my 
twilight years would i remotely consider sending someone back in time

marty
you didnt professor it was an accident you see what happened 

professor emmett brown
no dont tell me  i dont want to know the future my knowledge of 
future events your mere presence here could have devastating 
effects on the course of history and altering history is a 
responsibility that i do not wish to bear my immediate response is to 
send you back to your own time

marty had heard the professor say almost those exact same words when he 
had wanted to send shemp back in time with the sports scores it seemed 
like a million years ago even though technically it was thirty years 
in the future but this time he agreed with the professor he wanted to 
go home 

marty
i can dig that

professor brown gave him a strange puzzled look 

professor emmett brown
pardon me

marty
oh that expression probably hasnt been invented yet i can get 
behind  i agree with you

the phone rang in the study the professor left the room with the time 
machine to answer it marty followed him and checked out the models on 
the desk while the professor picked up the phone on the third ring he 
didnt mean to listen on the conversation but it was kind of hard not 
to

professor emmett brown
hello pause yes charles yes i looked over the offer pause its 
very generous that they want to make me a major stockholder but im 
just not interested in a position with this little xrox corporation 
if its pronounced zerox why dont they spell it with a z look 
im on the verge of a breakthrough on my power converter

marty dropped the little car he had been looking at when the professor 
said that the power converter how could he have forgotten it needed 
nuclear power and he didnt think there was any now at least none that 
they could get there hands on did that mean he was stuck here
professor brown continued to talk on the phone not noticing the sick 
expression on martys face 

professor emmett brown
well any day now and then ill need people to work for emmett 
brown industries ive got a lot of ideas that are going to create a 
lot of jobs very well good night charles

the professor shook his head as he hung up the phone 

professor emmett brown
the xrox corporation how are they going to sell a product if you 
cant even pronounce the name

he turned back to marty

professor emmett brown
now the time machine works thats obvious as ive always known 
its a question of power where did i  will i get enough power to 
send a man thirty years through time

marty opened his mouth to tell him but professor brown quickly held up 
his hands

professor emmett brown
no  wait  dont tell me

he didnt say anything for a long moment then shook his head

professor emmett brown
on second thought there may be some things youll have to tell me

marty
the power converter

professor emmett brown
of course the power converter it works of course it works 
looking to marty what chemicals do we use

marty hesitated slowly taking a deep breath before starting 

marty
well professor are you sure you want me to tell you you know 
changing the course of history and all

professor emmett brown
blast it  no i suppose youre right you do know the proper 
chemical formula

marty nodded

marty
sure and there wont be any problem getting some  getting it

he stopped he had almost blurted it out 

the professor walked over to a bar and pulled a glass bottle of brandy 
out of the cabinet 

professor emmett brown
coke 

he started to pour the alcohol in a glass

marty
stunned how did you know

professor emmett brown
just a guess i figured kids would still be drinking coke in 1982

marty let out all the breath he had been holding so he didnt know 
that was the secret formula after all

professor emmett brown
all right then its very simple tossing marty a bottle of coke as he 
spoke tomorrow weather permitting youll get the chemicals and 
well wire the power converter to the time machine point it at the 
sun and send you home

marty hesitated again he had a feeling that what he was about to say 
would not really please the 

marty
professor well not exactly professor you see we dont point it at 
the sun

professor emmett brown
we dont 

the professor lifted up his drink to his lips

marty
no

marty took a deep breath he had gone this far he might as well go all 
the way

marty
we need a nuclear reactor

professor brown choked on his drink

professor emmett brown
a nuclear reactor how much energy do we need

marty shrugged  then remembered the microcassette recorder he still 
had it with him in his pocket he took it out and rewound it then hit 
play and set it on the professors desk professor brown looked at it 
strangely but didnt ask any questions he sat down at his desk and 
the two of them listened as it played back after a couple minutes it 
got to the important part

marty on tape
release the rope its 4200 rads

the tape grew silent it had reached the end professor brown reached 
out and picked up the recorder staring at the buttons for a minute 
before pressing the one to stop it he didnt say anything for a 
moment then 

professor emmett brown
4200 rads good god

marty was trying to twist the top of the coke bottle but for some 
reason it wouldnt turn 

professor emmett brown
theres something i still dont understand 

the professor picked the recorder up again and rewound it

professor emmett brown
fascinating device he commented as it spun back

professor brown stopped it and played back the gunshot sounds

professor emmett brown
these loud bangs could those be some sort of malfunction in the time 
machine do you know what they are

marty gripped the coke bottle so hard his knuckles turned white he 
couldnt tell professor brown that those sounds were him being shot

marty
i wouldnt worry about em professor

a minute passed while the tape replayed 

professor emmett brown
4200 rads  that certainly cant be generated under controlled 
conditions in this day and age

marty
thats just great

marty still tried to get that coke bottle open it was like the cap was 
welded on there

professor emmett brown
howevertheres a lot i dont know about nuclear physics so first 
think in the morning ill go to the university and see what i can find 
out i want you  to stay in the house pointing a finger at marty 
its very important that you dont interfere in any way with the 
outside world ive got plenty of food theres the radio books 
magazines ive even got one of those new television sets theres 
plenty to do

professor brown stared at marty as he twisted and turned that cap in 
every imaginable way possible

professor emmett brown
what are you doing

marty gave up and held the bottle out

marty
how do you open these

the professor took the bottle from his hand and picked up a bottle 
opener lying nearby a second later he handed it back now without the 
top marty looked down at the coke in his hand then up at the 
professor

marty
it doesnt look good does it professor

professor brown shook his head

professor emmett brown
at the moment it looks like youre stuck here

int brown mansion  next morning

early the next morning professor brown walked down the hall to the 
room he had given marty mcfly late the night before he stopped and 
listened carefully hearing no sound from the other side after a 
minute he reached for the doorknob and turned it the professor pushed 
the door open a couple of inches sticking his head around the side of 
the door to peer inside

the shades were wide open the first rays of sunlight slanting across 
the room over to the bed marty was lying on top of the queen bed on 
his back one arm hanging over the side of the bed still fully dressed 
in his 1982 clothes his eyes were closed and he appeared to be asleep 
the professor studied him for a moment then slowly stepped inside the 
room and crept across to the table next to the bed where the cathedral 
radio rested and the small cassette recorder he had come in to get a 
closer look at the future object

professor brown carefully picked the recorder up and examined it his 
finger accidentally hit the play button and a loud burst of 
conversation came out the professor swore under his breath as he 
fumbled for the stop button his eyes flew to marty as he quickly set 
the recorder on the table again marty let out a deep sigh eyes still 
closed and rolled over

professor brown waited a moment to make sure marty wasnt going to 
awaken he listened to his slow deep breathing for a second then 
quickly crossed the room to the door the professor eased it shut and 
continued down the hall he had to get to the university and look up 
the information about nuclear physics hopefully there would be a 
answer to send marty back to the future

marty felt warm sunlight on his face he threw an arm across his still
closed eyes to block it out along with the memories pieces of the 
night before came back to him being in 1952 maybe marty thought  it 
was just a dream all i have to do is open my eyes and i will see that 
it was all part of some bizarre dream

he sighed as his eyes focused on his surroundings it wasnt a dream 
he was lying on the bed in the room that professor brown had given him 
the night before he was still in 1952

marty reached over and clicked on the old radio by the bed mostly out 
of habit he waited a few seconds expecting to hear some old song but 
nothing came on he hit it a few times wondering if it was broken 
only a minute later did sound slowly come on and it was horrible 
marty made a face as he rolled over and twisted the tuning dial 
skimming the different stations for something better  nothing that 
even remotely resembled any type of rock n roll came on marty flipped 
the radio off shaking his head in disgust

he got off the bed and left his room wandering downstairs to the 
kitchen he opened a cabinet and found a coffee pot as he was taking 
it out of the cabinet it slipped from his hands and crashed onto the 
hardwood floor separating into different pieces marty swore and knelt 
down trying to get it back together after a minute he gave up and 
set it aside

marty turned to the refrigerator and pulled it open he fished out a 
bottle of milk and took off the little piece of foil at the top taking 
a glass off the counter he set it on the kitchen table and lifted up 
the bottle to pour some milk in the glass nothing came out marty held 
it up and looked down the neck noticing a cardboard plug keeping the 
milk in he stuck a couple fingers down there trying to pull it out  
but he couldnt get ahold of it with a sigh of annoyance marty 
finally just pushed his fingers through the cardboard and poured the 
milk in the glass

after pulling the bottle back in the refrigerator marty sat down at 
the kitchen table to drink his milk he noticed some magazines and 
newspapers spread out and lifted a couple of them up for a closer look 
the issue of time had a cover story titled the republicans who will 
win in 52 photos of the men involved were splashed on the cover 
marty stared at it for a moment

marty
eisenhower

he picked up a  newsweek will we have war with russia this year the 
cover asked in big bold letters

marty
no

he took a look at the local newspaper crime rate continues to rise 
the headline screamed marty shook his head and noticed a saturday 
evening post lying nearby a picture of some high school students were 
on the cover with the words whats wrong with the younger generation 
he laughed and flipped the magazine over an ad for van heusen shirts 
had ronald regan in it
jesus marty muttered when he saw it shaking his head again the 
doorbell rang marty looked up from the periodicals uneasy he stayed 
seated remembering the professors instructions from the night before 
the bell rang again and marty got up from the table and walked slowly 
through the dining room and living room to the front door he stopped a 
few feet away from it staring hard at the wood and feeling torn

the doorbell rang for a third time what if it was someone in trouble 
what if someone was hurt and needed to use the phone would it be such 
a bad thing then if he answered the door
aw what the hell he thought marty stepped forward and opened the 
door

professor emmett brown
aha

professor brown exclaimed shoving a finger at martys chest from the 
porch

professor emmett brown
you answered the door

marty
you were ringing the doorbell 

marty took a step back as the professor walked inside

professor emmett brown
i told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time 
nobodys supposed to see you here what if i was a mailman or a 
salesman

marty
what if you lost your keys

professor emmett brown
then i would have figured out to get back in through the events in the 
natural course of history dont you understand the fabric of history 
is very delicate anything you do could have serious consequences

marty
 hey look gimme a break all i did was answer the door hows that 
gonna change history

professor emmett brown
i dont know but i dont want to take any chances now you stay here 
and dont do anything dont answer the door dont answer the phone 
dont go outside understand

marty rolled his eyes having it up to here with the lecturing

marty
hey get off my case would you i didnt want to come here and the 
only reason im here in the first place is because i was a nice guy 
helping you out so dont tell me i gotta stay cooped up in here and 
vege out because none of this is my fault

professor brown appeared unaffected by the speech 

professor emmett brown
let me put it on a level you can understand you dont belong here you 
dont know anything about this world you dont know the customs you 
dont know how to talk how to act  you dont even look like you 
belong here and if you walked out on the street you wouldnt get 100 
yards without being arrested then there would be questions and where 
would we come up with the answers

marty
sighs okay professor i get where youre coming from the way i 
look the way im dressed looking down at his silver porsche 
jacket id stick out like a sore thumb

professor brown nodded looking relieved

professor emmett brown
im glad we finally got that straightened out ill see you tonight

he left the house slamming the door behind him marty stared at the 
door for a moment with his eyes narrowed then he returned to the 
kitchen

int brown mansion  later

half an hour later marty was ready hed finished his breakfast and 
then had a shower changing into some of the professors clothes 
instead of his own from 1982 he had slicked his hair back like he had 
seen the men doing so in some of those magazines and was now ready to 
explore the town after all professor brown had said the reason he 
couldnt go out was because of the way he looked more or less and now 
that he looked like a resident of 1952 marty saw no problem in leaving 
the house

ext brown mansion

he opened a window at the front of the house and climbed outside then 
ran off in the direction of town

ext street

less then twenty minutes later marty was strolling down the sidewalk 
with the other townspeople trying to look nonchalant like he had 
always lived there he thought he was doing a pretty good job of it 
too since no one was looking at him twice

a cop that had been walking on the other side of the street glanced at 
marty and stopped pointing a finger at him hey you he shouted 
where do you think youre going

martys eyes widened and fought the urge to run how did he know he 
wondered in horror the cop walked right for him then just as marty 
was ready to accept defeat he passed him and grabbed the arm of a 
tramp several yards behind marty he relaxed letting out a sigh of 
relief and continued to walk down the street after a minute he 
started to get excited again as he looked around at the shops and 
businesses up and down the main street

there was an appliance store that advertised giant 8 inch televisions 
with a screen as big as life itself across from it was an old gas 
station with the price advertised at 189 cents a gallon a travel 
agency had a poster on how to get from la to new york in a mere 12 
hours in its window

there was a dance studio with a sign everybodys doing the mambo on 
the outside through the window marty could see a class in session a 
clothing store with a display of the latest fashions was beside the 
studio they looked a lot more like the kind of stuff in old movies a 
studebaker showroom had a sign that said it was the most modern car 
ever developed in the entire history of man marty chuckled then 
stopped when he saw the next store

it was a music store in the display window were posters showing 
americas top recording artists marty frowned as he studied them 
frank sinatra guy combardo dinah shore perry como 

marty
are they kidding

he decided to go inside and find out

int music store

on the counter was the current number one single papa loves mambo by 
perry como marty made a face as he examined it he suddenly noticed 
the clerk was standing beside him

clerk
can i help you sir

marty held up the single he had to ask

marty
this is the number one single

clerk
yes sir

marty
i dont get it how come theres no rock n roll

clerk
frowning i beg your pardon

marty
this is 1952

clerk
uh yes sir

marty
and you never heard of rock n roll

clerk
 no

marty grinned as he set the single back on the counter suddenly having 
a great idea

marty
well maybe its time you did

ext street

he quickly left the store and headed for a pawnshop he had noticed on 
the outskirts of town there was a guitar in the window for five 
dollars after studying it for a moment marty went inside and told the 
pawnbroker what he wanted the man took the guitar down and brought it 
to the cash register and marty trailed after him

thatll be five bucks he said setting the guitar on the counter 
marty reached for his wallet and pulled out the same twenty dollar bill 
he had tried using at the cafe the night before the pawnbroker started 
to ring the purchase up then took a closer look at the money

pawnbroker
hey what kinda funny money is this

marty
huh

the pawnbroker held the money out and pointed to something

marty
it says 1977 on it what do you take me for an idiot

he handed the bill back to marty marty looked at it and only then 
realized his mistake he had used money that hadnt even been printed 
yet

marty
oh  yeah

his mind was racing for a explanation to give the guy that didnt sound 
too illegal it wouldnt do for him to get arrested as a counterfeiter 

marty
i cant believe i did that thats a joke my friend had these printed 
up  see thats his name there blumenthal

the pawnbroker continued to watch him suspiciously it didnt look like 
he was buying it marty dug around in his wallet but of course he 
didnt have any thirtyyearold bills with him

marty
gee  i dont seem to have anything on me

he put his wallet away and as he did so the watch professor brown was 
lending him caught his eye 

marty
hey how about this watch holding up his left wrist its a genuine 
antique

he slipped the watch off and handed it to the pawnbroker he carefully 
examined it 

pawnbroker
antique they just came out with this watch last month but this one 
looks like its been through a war

marty
yeah ive been doing a lotta travelling

pawnbroker
okay kid you got a deal the watch for the guitar

inside the office of the midwest talent agency marty was concentrating 
hard on performing blue suede shoes the way elvis had  or would 
dancing around singing playing the instrument  he was really into 
it hardly noticing the forty fiveyearold agent that sat behind the 
desk and smoking a cigar his face expressionless as he listened to the 
music covering the walls of the small office were black and white 
pictures of some clients that the agency sponsored
marty finished the song and looked at the agent with a smile waiting 
for the praise that was sure to follow who couldnt love music like 
that the agent however must have been one of those people

talent agent
well kid setting his cigar down in an ash tray its interesting 
ill say that but its not commercial

marty
not commercial mister dont you know what youre listening to this 
is rock n roll

the agent shook his head as he heaved his body out of the chair

talent agent
call it what you want to kid but dont call it music cause it sure 
aint that

marty
but you dont understand 

talent agent
no buts kid ive been in this business my whole life and i know what 
people want the smooth sound thats what sells como crosby dinah 
shore gimme a melody and a nice slow tempo now beat it

he opened the door and shoved marty into the waiting room marty stood 
where he was trying to figure out what had happened a few seconds 
later the agent tossed his guitar case out of the room and slammed the 
door he hardly noticed the black man in a silk shirt approaching him

reginald washington
that sound i just heard coming through the door that was like nothing 
i ever heard before i mean you got something there young man

marty
at least one person had recognized rockn roll for what it was who are 
you

reginald washington
reginald washington is my name i manage some of the local bands around 
town and i think youve got something we can promote all the way to the 
top now ive got a real important cat comin in from a new york 
record company on monday the 18th and i want you to play that music 
for him i think the time has come for a sound like that

marty grinned at his words reginald took a business card from his 
pocket and jotted down the date time and place on it with a pencil

reginald washington
thats march 18th noon be at my office whats your name

marty
marty mc  marty lewis

reginald washington
marty lewis see you on the 18th

he handed him the card and shook his hand marty looked at the card 
not believing his luck 

marty
this is great right on brother

reginald gave him a strange look

reginald washington
i think youre a little mixed up there is absolutely no way that i 
could be your brother

he turned and walked away marty glanced at the card again and smiled

int brown mansion

that evening marty stood before the mirror in the bedroom professor 
brown was letting him use he had changed back into his 1982 clothes 
and was practicing the guitar making sure he looked good he had been 
doing it for close to fifteen minutes when he heard the front door open 
and slam shut

stopping in midnote marty hastily placed the guitar in a corner of 
the room he ran his fingers through his hair mussing it up and adding 
to the illusion that he had spent the whole day lying around the house 
on his way out the door he grabbed the business card off the bed that 
reginald had given him earlier that day and stuffed it in his porsche 
jacket draped over a chair

marty ran down the stairs and saw professor brown pouring himself a 
drink he looked up as marty came in the room a scowl on his face for 
a split second marty worried that he might have found out about his 
trip into town

professor emmett brown
well i found an energy source that can generate the 4200 rads that we 
need

marty looked at him expectantly waiting for the answer

professor emmett brown
an atomic bomb

marty
professor be serious would you

professor emmett brown
i am serious if we could get you the time machine and the power 
converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast we could send you back to 
the future

marty
youre talking crazy an atomic blast would melt me and the time 
machine in a matter of seconds

professor emmett brown
you forget  time travel is instantaneous the time machine would 
melt but you would have already travelled through time of course 
its a moot point regardless the only place atomic bombs are detonated 
is at the armys nevada test site and those tests are kept absolutely 
top secret

marty suddenly recalled sitting in class on the day he had left the 
lecture mr arky had given him he remembered ripping a particular page 
out of the textbook for suzy and pocketing it in his jacket he 
whirled around and pounded up the stairs to his room

marty grabbed the jacket and checked the first pocket yeah there was 
the textbook page he quickly unfolded it the business card from 
reginald falling out as he did so martys eyes flew to the caption of 
the picture last above ground atomic test 15 megatons march 18 
1952 atkins nevada

the date seemed familiar marty picked the business card off the 
floor and checked the date on it beside the page they were the same

marty looked between the two objects in his hands for a long moment 
trying to figure out what to do maybe get home  or get nuked  or 
stay in the fifties and maybe become famous  and alive at least he 
crumpled up the page and tossed it in the garbage just before professor 
brown entered the room

professor emmett brown
marty whats wrong

he slipped the card back in the jacket and shrugged trying to seem 
nonchalant

marty
oh  nothin i thought i left the water running

the professors eyes zeroed in on the guitar in the corner of the room 
he stepped over for a closer look before marty could stop him

professor emmett brown
say where did this guitar come from

marty
oh  that  i found it in the closet

professor emmett brown
 i dont recall ever seeing it before

marty
well it was there

professor emmett brown
curious very curious

int brown mansion  morning

late the next morning marty stirred and opened his eyes it was 
another bright sunny day outside he smiled slowly thinking of his 
audition a few days away and crawled out of bed the house was quiet 
with the professor at work

marty went downstairs and into the kitchen professor brown had left 
the coffee pot on and he cheerfully poured himself a cup then opened 
the refrigerator and pulled out the new bottle of milk he got the 
stopper out in a matter of seconds without breaking it too as marty 
added the milk to the black coffee he started to sing

marty
so you wanna be a rock n roll star 

the doorbell rang before he could get any further with the song marty 
rolled his eyes and set the milk down he was going to have to go 
through this again marty left the kitchen and headed for the front 
door he shook his head as he reached for the knob

professor emmett brown
look professor im not  oh

the words died in his throat marty stared at eileen standing on the 
doorstep hugging books to her chest she smiled at him and marty 
smiled back weakly

eileen
hi marty

marty
uh hi

eileen his mother jumped in marty gave another weak smile it was 
hard for him to say her name

marty
right eileen

the smile faded from eileens face 

eileen
you remember me 

marty
mumbles how could i forget to eileen oh sure i remember you

eileen
well i was on my way to school and i just wanted to stop by and see 
if you were feeling okay  you seemed like you were in pretty bad shape 
the other night

marty
oh im feeling much better now

the smile returned to eileens face

eileen
how long are you planning on staying

marty shrugged 

marty
actually it looks like im gonna be stuck here for awhile

eileens smile grew wider 

eileen
then youll be going to school here

marty
school i never thought of school if i went to school i could blend in 
with everybody else couldnt i

eileen blinked puzzled

marty
what time does school start around here

eileen
nine o clock glancing at her watch oh im late maybe ill see you 
later

marty
yeah maybe so

 eileen flashed another smile at him then turned and hurried down the 
walk marty shut the door and headed for the upstairs

ext high school

not much later marty walked up the steps of his future high school 
amazed at the change the grafitti was gone from the building as were 
the broken windows and overall rundown wornin look the place had held 
before  or would later all the tall trees on campus were much 
smaller maybe half the size they were in 1982 the bell rang as he 
reached the door a notebook in hand and students streamed into the 
hallways

marty stared openly at his classmates they all looked like people from 
an old movie with the hair and clothes the way they acted he 
walked through the hall and passed an open door the classroom looked 
familiar and he stopped looking inside

int high school

after a moment of hesitation marty walked inside yeah he had  been 
in it before but everything looked a lot different  newer and the 
chalkboards were black not green he went over to the desk that would 
be his in thirty years and ran a hand across the smooth shiny surface 
devoid of any marks or carvings

you there he heard someone yell someone familiar 

mr arky
what are you doing in this class

marty lifted his head up and found himself looking at mr arky  
thirty years younger his mouth dropped open and his eyes widened as he 
stared at the science teacher he looked so different age aside their 
was an energetic spark in his eyes that hadnt been there when marty 
would have him for a teacher

marty
mr arky 

marty asked blinking a few times to make sure he wasnt seeing things 
he wasnt

mr arky
yes thats my name who are you young man are you supposed to be 
here

marty
uh  yeah im new here and im supposed to be in this class

mr arky nodded 

mr arky
you have a name

marty
marty marty lewis

marty watched the girl in the seat next to him his eyes focused on the 
old fountain pen she was filling with ink he couldnt believe it 
where were the pens he was used to

in the background mr arky continued with the days lecture marty 
listened to him with half an ear not paying much attention

mr arky
 and it is of course due to science that we americans enjoy the 
highest standard of living in the history of the world when we think 
of the technological advances made in just the past thirty years it 
boggles the mind to imagine what the world will be like in another 
thirty years i think i can safely say that we can all look forward to 
a world of plenty a world free of disease and starvation therell be 
entire cities built under the sea cars that can go two or three 
hundred miles an hour

marty stared at mr arky in disbelief could he be serious marty 
glanced around and noticed the rest of the class looked bored as if 
they had heard the lecture before

mr arky
you girls will be able to cook an entire meal clean the entire house 
and do all of your laundry and ironing by push button the science 
teacher went on you may even have a robot to assist you in all your 
duties as a wife

student
i hope those robots wont be assisting in all my wifes duties 

the class laughed but marty was distracted by something where had he 
heard that voice before it sounded vaguely familiar but he couldnt 
quite put his finger on it

mr arky
well biff since you seem so eager to get into this discussion 
perhaps youd like to tell us what you think youll be doing in thirty 
years

marty turned around and saw biff tannen  thirty years younger of 
course  slouched in the back desk with a bored expression on his 
face surrounding him were three other guys who were obviously friends 
of his one was missing two front teeth one chewed on a wooden match 
and the other had a crewcut that made him look nearly bald marty 
stared at biff who appeared just as obnoxious as he was later in life

biff
i know what i wont  be doin he said with a smirk on his face goin 
to school

his three cronies broke out laughing

gums
hey biff good one

skinhead
ataway biff

biff suddenly noticed martys stare he scowled at him 

biff
what are you lookin at asshole

marty met biffs glare then turned away mr arky continued with his 
class the confrontation unnoticed

mr arky
anybody else have any ideas about what life might be like in thirty 
years

the teachers eyes roamed the class for volunteers no one volunteered 
as usual at least  this hasnt changed  marty thought with a chuckle

mr arky
mr cusimano miss voyles miss kaner so am i to understand that no 
one has anything at all to say about the future shifting his gaze to 
marty how about you mr mcfly

marty felt his face drain of color he had been caught 

marty
muttering oh shit

 a few kids turned their heads to stare at him shocked at his words 
including biff marty hardly had a chance to notice that when the 
student in front of him started to speak

george
well i uhwell

marty glanced at him and did a double take that person stuttering was 
none other then a younger version of george mcfly  his father marty 
couldnt believe it first his mother now this george was a mess 
shoulders slumped hair uncombed and an overall nerdy wimpy look 
about him

marty
jesus christ dad

the entire class now stared at marty mr arky ignored it as best he 
could

mr arky
continue mr mcfly

martys father stood up slowly as if he were getting called to his 
execution marty sighed and buried his face in his hands shaking his 
head

george
well i  uh  could you repeat the question 

biff
sit down mcfly you stupid moron i cant see 

a second later a spitball hit george in the back of the head his face 
red george sat down
marty whipped his head around furious and glared at biff

marty
hey lay off

biff glared back at him his eyes narrowed in slits of hatred

mr arky
did you say something mr lewis

marty didnt hear him continuing to give biff the worst look he could

mr arky
mr lewis im talking to you

marty snapped out of it remembering who he was supposed to be

marty
who me

mr arky
youre the only mr lewis in this class  if you have something to say 
say it so the whole class can hear

marty
well yeah i was thinking if cars are gonna be going two or three 
hundred miles an hour theyre gonna be using an awful lot of gas 
like what if we run out

mr arky
run out of gas 

the class started laughing marty looked around baffled was what he 
said that funny

mr arky
well class it seems we have a doomsayer in our midst i must say mr 
lewis thats a mighty pessimistic attitude for a young man like 
yourself first of all with all the studies we have indicating the 
vast supplies of petroleum in the earth plus the massive reserves that 
have yet to be discovered the likelihood of any such shortage is 
highly remote and even if the most improbable catastrophic 
circumstances were to occur and we did have a shortage of petroleum 
im sure that american technology and ingenuity would overcome the 
problem in no time at all all in all id say your time would be 
better spent worrying about the real problems that face our world 
instead of a shortage of gasoline

at the back of the class biff and his group started to make farting 
noises 

biff
hey we got plenty of gas back here 

the class erupted into laughter once again marty just shook his head

not much later the bell rang ending the science class everyone made 
a mad dash for the door including marty hed had enough humiliation 
for the day with mr arky

int high school  hall

george waited until most of the other students had left before 
gathering up his books and heading for the door marty separated 
himself from the mob in the hall and stood outside the door waiting 
for him a minute later george finally walked into the corridor marty 
waited a moment then followed him keeping his distance

when they reached a hall intersection marty noticed eileen headed for 
the two of them her friend madge with her she didnt seem to see 
marty but her eyes locked on george and she smiled at him 

eileen
hi george

marty watched as george looked over at her and became so flustered that 
he walked straight into another student in the hall eileen and her 
friend giggled and walked away georges eyes followed her until she 
was out of sight then he walked over to a drinking fountain

as he leaned over and turned the fountain on he misjudged the distance 
and the stream of water hit him right in the face marty shook his head 
from a few feet away as george wiped the water from his eyes from the 
fountain george headed over to his locker marty watched him dial the 
combination and as he opened the locker door a pile of books fell 
out nearly knocking him over marty looked away sighing

after george picked up his books he started moving in the direction of 
the cafeteria as marty got in the lunch line behind him he noticed a 
large poster tacked on the wall something about the springtime in 
paris dance on saturday march 16th not too far off

int cafeteria

marty turned his attention to his father watching the bored cafeteria 
ladies shovel out a overcooked pork chop wilted salad and green 
stewed tomatoes looks like the food isnt much better now then in 
1982 marty thought amused george didnt seem to notice leaning 
forward a little marty could hear him muttering to himself

george
eileen if youre free saturday night no eileen would you like 
to go to the dance no

something suddenly clicked and marty looked at the poster again yeah 
now he remembered that was the dance his parents fell in love at

the lunch line moved slowly but eventually both he and george got 
through it george looked around the crowded lunch room searching for 
someone marty tried to follow where his eyes were roaming and after a 
moment he realized george was staring at the table where eileen 
madge and a few other friends of theirs were sitting george took a 
deep breath then started walking over to the table marty followed 
not too far behind

as george approached the table his hands started shaking causing 
everything on his lunch tray to wobble around

george
uh eileen

eileen turned around and gave him a warm smile

eileen
hi george

marty watched his future father a bundle of nerves

george
eileen could i ask you something 

the creamed corn on his tray suddenly tipped over and spilled

george
ooops 

eileen smiled again obviously not put off by it george took another 
deep breath 

george
uh well the thing is that is what i wanted to ask you

marty decided this was too important to miss and crept closer so he 
could hear better unfortunately eileen spotted him

eileen
marty waving to him hi marty over here

george spun around before marty had a chance to do anything the sudden 
movement causing georges entire tray to slip from his hands and spill 
all over his shirt

george
oh god excuse me please

he started to run off but marty grabbed his arm

marty
wait a minute  arent you gonna ask her to the dance that was what 
was supposed to have happened wasnt it

george stared at him 

george
huh how did you know

marty pushed him towards eileen

marty
go ahead george ask her

george shoved his arms away 

george
leave me alone

the gesture shocked marty but he shook his head 

marty
youve gotta ask her to the dance

george
 not now

george muttered looking around the cafeteria people were beginning to 
stare eileen had been watching the whole ordeal with interest now she 
spoke up 

eileen
is that what you were going to ask me george to go to the dance

george
no

george shouted running away out of the cafeteria

marty
george wait get back here youre not supposed to run off it doesnt 
happen that way

george didnt look back marty threw his hands up in the air 
helplessly

marty
oh god this is all wrong

eileen stared at him with concern 

eileen
whats all wrong

marty ran a hand through his hair agitated

marty
george hes supposed to ask you to the dance

eileen

marty

by the blank expression on eileens face it was obvious that she 
didnt marty quickly explained 

marty
he comes out of the cafeteria line hes nervous he spills his corn 
and he asks you to the dance

eileen

danceyet

she gives him a flirtatious smile before picking up her empty lunch 
tray and walking away oh no she couldnt be marty sat down in a 
chair quick as his legs threatened to give out on him eileen his 
mother she  she

marty

int brown mansion

professor emmett brown

professor brown yelled as marty finished telling him what had gone on 
that morning it was later in the afternoon they were in his study 
marty had gone to the professor right away since he had no idea what 
to do and needed some advice his friend was taking the news better 
then marty had expected

marty
i didnt mean to do it  it was an accident

professor brown shook his head

professor emmett brown
do you realize what that means do you have any idea what that means

marty shrugged 

marty
look its not a big deal i can fix it all i gotta do is get em 
together and make sure my old man asks her out

professor emmett brown
you better make sure your old man asks her out because if he doesnt 
they may never have a first date and if they dont have a first date 
they wont have a second date if they dont have a second date they 
wont fall in love if they dont fall in love they wont get married 
and if they dont get married youll never be born

marty swallowed hard 

marty
well maybe everything is a little worse then i first thought he 
realized

ext malt shop

the next day marty brought george to the malt shop it was after 
classes and all the high school students were in there including 
eileen

george
i dont know if i can go through with this

george moaned as they drew closer to the building marty dodged two 
kids on homemade scooters as they sped by them on the sidewalk his 
eyes followed them for a moment the vehicles reminding him of 
skateboards

marty
george shes beautiful right shes nice shes decent shes the 
kind of girl youd like to marry right and theres nothing in the 
world youd like more than to take her to that dance right

george
well yeah

marty
okay then

suddenly george stopped turned and faced him his eyes narrowed 
suspiciously 

george
wait a minute  who are you anyway what are you doing this for

marty hesitated

marty
lets just say i have a vested interest in you and eileen going to this 
dance all right look pointing though the window of the malt shop 
there she is

eileen was sitting at a table with madge and some other girl each 
having ice cream sodas and talking
 
marty

marty nudging george in the direction of the doors but george stayed 
put

george
what do i say

marty

george shook his head quickly 

george
oh no that was for the cafeteria this is different

marty
christ its a miracle i was even born mutters under his breath 
rolling his eyes

george
huh

marty
nothing look ill write it down for you okay 

marty took the notebook george had in his hands and ripped a page out 
he pulled his pen out and started jotting down some helpful lines 
george stared at the pen as he wrote

george
what is that a pencil that writes in ink

marty
it was martys turn to be confused huh

george
lemme see that

george plucked the pen from his hand and looked it at it carefully 

george
bike fine point 

marty
bic its a bic pen

george frowned how do you fill it with ink

marty
fill it with ink you dont fill it  oh come on george 

int malt shop

he pushed him into the malt shop tired of the procrastination as soon 
as they entered marty steered him in the direction of eileens table 
and handed him the paper he had written on

marty
there she is he said in a low voice just go and ask her ill be 
sitting right here

marty takes an empty seat at the counter george looked at him and 
then over at eileen he took a deep breath and stepped forward then 
suddenly veered back to the counter

george
gimme a strawberry malted

marty shook his head wondering if he would ever get to eileen while 
he waited for the drink george examined the paper marty gave him and 
mouthed the dialog to himself apparently trying to memorize it a 
moment later the malt came and he took a swig of it the drink leaving 
an unnoticed pink moustache on his face he turned around and started 
to approach eileen finally marty thought george was still several 
feet away when eileen looked up and spotted him

eileen
hi george

he took a step back startled

george
uh hi eileen

eileen
how are you

george
oh  im all right say listen about this dance saturday night 

the door to the malt shop was suddenly thrown open 

biff
hey mcfly i thought i told you never to come in here 

biff tannen stood in the doorway with his gang behind him george took 
one look at him and shuddered marty let his head fall in his hands 
with a sigh they had been so goddamn close

biff
well its gonna cost you mcfly how much money you got on you

george pulled out his wallet and opened it

george
how much do you want biff

biff crossed the room on his way to george as he passed marty 
stretched his leg out and tripped the bully biff crashed to the floor 
taking a chair down with him people started to laugh but biff 
scowled he didnt think it was too funny he got to his feet and 
stepped over to where marty sat his back to him

biff
listen asshole he growled its about time i taught you a lesson 

biff put a hand on his arm and at his touch marty spun around on the 
stool and threw his fist into biffs face unprepared biff fell back 
onto a table marty jumped off the stool the cafe was deathly silent 
and biffs three henchmen started to approach him marty decided it was 
time for him to leave the building and he pushed his way out of the 
crowded teen hangout and onto main street

ext street

marty ran down the street hearing the pounding footsteps of biff and 
his gang behind him he cast a quick look over his shoulder and saw 
them closing the gap that separated them he was going to be dead meat 
one of the kids on the homemade scooters sailed by and marty suddenly 
had an idea he grabbed the scooter and pulled it away from the kid 
kicking the orange crate off the board with the skates on it and 
leaving a crude skateboard

marty jumped on it and sped down the street biff and his gang stopped 
in their tracks and stared at him amazed likewise with the crowd that 
had moved out of the malt shop

biff
in the car

they raced to the black convertible biff getting behind the wheel he 
gunned the engine heading straight for marty marty glanced over his 
shoulder and saw the convertible quickly gaining on him he cut a sharp 
turn in the middle of the street and crossed before biffs car then 
started to retrace his steps back to the malt shop a car passed him 
and marty grabbed onto the back of it ignoring the stunned looks of 
everyone around including biff and his gang

biff executed a quick uturn and continued his pursuit of marty as he 
passed the malt shop the spectators cheered

madge
did you see that 

eileen nodded her mouth open impressed

biffs convertible raced past the cafe hot on the trail of marty 
marty risked another look back his eyes widened in panic as he saw 
biffs convertible closing in on the distance quick was there no end 
to his maniacal determination marty turned his attention back to the 
front he saw hill street intersecting up ahead instinctively he 
released his hold on the car and leaned into the board turning it onto 
the street biff once again overshot the street and had to do another 
uturn to get on it

hill street was not named by accident  it was incredibly steep at 
the bottom of the hill was an intersection with traffic lights marty 
felt the board pick up speed behind him biff was putting the pedal to 
the metal the tires actually leaving the ground as he leapt onto hill 
street once again he quickly closed in on the distance between the 
convertible and the skateboard marty crouched down cutting the wind 
resistance down and the skateboard picked up speed he was approaching 
the intersection fast the light turned yellow

closing his eyes and mouthing a silent prayer marty flew through the 
traffic cars skidding to a stop and swerving to avoid hitting him 
miraculously he made it to the other side unscathed
 such could not be said for biff his breaks locked up as he tried to 
avoid a red car ahead and the convertibles tires skidded across the 
road marty winced in anticipation as biff headed straight for a red 
car at the last minute the car pulled away and biff slammed into a 
cop car in the next lane of traffic two big cops immediately got out 
and headed straight for biff not looking too happy

biff let out an angry sigh

biff
im gonna get that son of a bitch

 marty left the site a satisfied smile on his face biff had gotten 
what he deserved he turned onto a residential street his mind 
wandering as he leisurely skateboarded about ten minutes later he 
reached an intersection next to his future home and saw eileen 
approaching the housewith george marty skidded to a stop grabbed 
the board and ducked behind some bushes to watch

george carrying eileens books was walking her to the door they were 
talking but marty couldnt catch any of the conversation after a 
moment george gave eileen her books and they shook hands very formal
like

he mustve finally asked her to the dance marty sighed glad to have 
that mission finally accomplished and dropped his board on the ground 
skateboarding away from eileens house to the professors place to tell 
him the news he never saw george after eileen had closed the door 
throw his jacket down in the street and slump down in the gutter 
dropping his head in his hands dejected instead of exuberant

int brown mansion

that evening marty lay on his bed staring at the ceiling in deep 
thought eventually he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out 
the business card from reginald marty looked at it for a long 
timethen shredded it into tiny scraps he pushed himself off the bed 
and let the papers fall into the trash can then he pulled out the 
crumpled textbook page and went downstairs with it heading for the 
study

professor brown was seated at the desk his back to the door hunched 
over something as marty entered he made a quick movement as if he 
was trying to hide the fact he had been listening to the microcassette 
recorder again the gunshot portion marty didnt notice too caught up 
in his own problems

marty
professor you were right about everything i dont belong here i 
almost screwed up my existence again today while i was trying to put it 
back together and ive had enough i want to go back to the future

marty handed him the textbook page pointing at the caption under the 
photograph the frown on the professors face changed to a smile and 
his eyes lit up 

professor emmett brown
where did you get this

marty
i brought it with me from 1982 its from my science book

professor brown looked at it more closely 

professor emmett brown
the test is this monday 15 megatons lets see we need 4200 rads 
doing calculations on a slide rule lying on the desk youd have to 
beexactly 800 yards from ground zero you realize that what were 
going to do could be extremely dangerous

marty
believe me professor running around on a nuclear test site cant be 
any more dangerous than what ive been doing

the professor stared at him a moment then nodded 

professor emmett brown
all right heres what well do well get an army surplus truck mount 
the time machine and power converter on it and drive it to nevada if 
we leave by saturday night we can make it to the test site in plenty 
of time and just to be on the safe side id better build a leadlined 
time chamber for your added protection i dont know if i trust these 
atomic bombs

the telephone rang before professor brown could say anything else he 
reached over and picked it up 

professor emmett brown
hello uh no eileen he cant come to the phone right now 

marty stared at him his heart starting to pound with alarm

professor emmett brown
all right yes ill tell him goodbye 

he hung up and turned to marty with a grave expression marty had a 
sinking feeling that he was not going to like what he had to say he 
was right

professor emmett brown
your mother wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what 
you did this afternoon and that if you were interested in going to the 
dance saturday shes available

marty
but thats impossible george asked her out he had to i saw him walk 
her home oh god 

professor emmett brown
my guess is that she turned him down

marty
but why why would she do that shes supposed to marry the guy

professor emmett brown
apparently what has happened is that the maternal instinct has 
transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your 
mothers emotional behavior

marty
swallowing hard are you trying to tell me that my mothers got the 
hots for me

the professor thought about that for a moment

professor emmett brown
in a manner of speaking yes and because of that shes no longer 
interested in your father

marty
jesus 

marty sat down in a nearby chair

marty
what are we gonna do

int malt shop

marty stepped into the malt shop the next day his eyes on eileen and 
madge both sitting at the same table as they were the day before once 
again talking and drinking ice cream sodas he crossed the room and sat 
down with them to eileens delight

marty
how ya doing eileen

eileen smiled she and her friend exchanged a glance

eileen
hi marty

marty
listen hands under the table professor brown told me you called last 
night and gave me your message

he carefully taped the microcassette recorder to the bottom of the 
table and pressed the record button neither girl seemed to notice 
anything 

marty
and if youre still available id like to take you to the dance 
saturday night so ill pick you up around 830 okay

eileen smiled and nodded as marty stood up to leave 

eileen
okay see you later marty

marty gave her a cheerful wave as he left the malt shop he pretended 
to walk away then ducked behind a nearby building a few minutes 
later eileen and madge came out he waited until they were out of 
sight before running in the shop and prying the recorder loose

later that night in the professors garage marty played it back for 
the both of them professor brown had been welding sheet lead metal 
into a large philco refrigerator the time machine was now resting in 
the bed of an army truck the professor had also modified the top of 
the refrigerator to hold the beam focusing unit so the time beam would 
shine directly into the fridge

marty on tape
 so ill pick you up around 830 okay

eileen on tape
okay see you later marty

he heard the sounds of him walking away and leaving the shop almost as 
soon as the door shut behind him the girls started talking about him

eileen on tape
isnt he a dream letting out a giddy sigh

madge on tape
boy ive never seen you fall for anybody like that before

eileen sighed again 

eileen on tape
i know ive never felt like this about anybody before i really dont 
understand it but i just feel like  like mothering him

 marty and the professor exchanged a look

madge on tape
but what about george i thought you wanted him to ask you

eileen on tape
he did ask mebut i turned him down

madge on tape
why surprised you always thought george was cute because he was so 
shy

eileen on tape
well thats what i thought but he really isnt shy hes just 
chicken

the professor suddenly grabbed the recorder from martys hands and 
rewound the last sentence

eileen on tape
hes just chicken

eileen said again

ext george mcflys backyard  saturday morning

marty
come on george 

marty said facing off with him in his backyard 

marty
dont be such a chicken hit me in the stomach right here go ahead

he held his arms away from his body making himself an easy target 
behind him a duffel bag packed with clothes swung from a tree as a 
homemade body bag george didnt make a move

george
i dont want to hit you in the stomach

marty
youre not gonna hurt me just hit me in the stomach

george
look marty im just not a fighter

marty rolled his eyes 

marty
how many times do i have to explain it to you we know youre not a 
fighter you know it i know it but she doesnt know it thats why 
we gotta make you look like a fighter somebody wholl stand up for 
her somebody who isnt chicken and youre not gonna look like a 
fighter if you cant hit me in the stomach

george
 but ive never picked a fight in my entire life

marty
youre not picking a fight youre coming to her rescue maybe wed 
better go over the plan again where are you gonna be at 855

george
im going to be at the dance

marty
and where am i gonna be

george
in the parking lot with her

marty nodded glad to see that he had been paying attention

marty
okay so right around 900 shes gonna get very angry with me 

george

marty
why what

george
why is she gonna get angry with you

marty hesitated

marty
well because  well nice girls get angry at guys whowho try to 
take advantage of em

george looked at him in disbelief 

george
you mean youre gonna 

marty
george its not your concern dont worry about it just remember that 
at 900 youll be strolling through the parking lot and youll see us 
 struggling in the car youll run over open the door and say

marty waited for george but he didnt say anything 

marty
your line george

george
oh uh hey you get your damn hands off her  george paused you 
really think i should swear

marty
yes definitely god dammit george swear then you hit me in the 
stomach i go down for the count and you and eileen life happily ever 
after now hit me in the stomach

george took a deep breath and tentatively threw his fist into martys 
stomach marty shook his head

george
no george put a little emotion into it a little hostility a little 
anger

he tried it again this time making faces the second punch wasnt much 
better then the one before it

marty
anger george anger

george hesitated

george
maybe if i used my left

marty
no george just concentrate on the anger anger

the third punch george tried was a little bit better but still not 
what marty was looking for he sighed

marty
well i think youre starting to get the hang of it just keep 
practicing ill see you tonight remember anger george anger

he walked away leaving george alone in the yard
george stared at the body bag trying to think of something that would 
make him really angry 

george
angeranger he muttered

he hit it the punches coming harder and harder each time george 
smiled finally getting the hang of it he pulled his fist back ready 
to sock it to the bag unfortunately he misjudged the distance and his 
fist slammed into the tree trunk

george
yeeeowww god dammit

with his left fist george attacked the bag with everything he had  
and knocked it completely off the tree he stared at it for a long 
time shocked

ext brown mansion

it was the night of the dance the time machine and refrigerator  now 
successfully leadlined  was completely assembled in the back of the 
truck beside it sat the power converter and a motorcycle with sidecar 
as professor brown pulled a tap over the back marty placed his 1982 
clothes in a laundry bag with some bottles of coke

professor emmett brown
everythings ready to go securing the tarp carefully looking up 
what about the chemicals for the power converter whatever they are

marty opened the door and stashed the laundry bag at the floor of the 
passenger seat 

marty
thats all taken care of

professor emmett brown
good professor brown tested the tarp noting in satisfaction that it 
was secure ill pick you up in front of the school at midnight dont 
be late  were cutting it close as it is weve got a long drive 
ahead of us

marty nodded he twisted his tie around his fingers almost 
absentmindedly he wasnt feeling too hot about the next few hours

marty
look im a little worried about this  this whole thing with my 
mother he admitted to the professor i mean i dont know if i can do 
it  i mean hitting on my own mother thats pretty heavy

professor emmett brown
nobody said anything about hitting her youre just going to take a few 
liberties with her

marty
thats exactly what i said i mean a guy and his mother  thats 
illegal isnt it

professor emmett brown
look marty shes not your mother yet and if you dont go through 
with this she may never be i know its hard but there are some 
things we must do in life that are unpleasant some choices must be 
made that are difficult nonetheless we must make them besides this 
may be more than a simple question of your own existence he added the 
fate of the entire spacetime continuum may rest on your shoulders

marty tried to smile at him 

marty
thats just what i needed to hear

professor emmett brown
itll be fine marty patting him on the shoulder youll be fine 
good luck he stuck his hand out and marty shook it but there was 
still a question that was nagging at him

marty
professor if something does go wrong tonight if i dont get my 
parents back together when do you think id cease to exist

the professor shrugged 

professor emmett brown
theres no way of knowing

marty
perfect

professor emmett brown
it could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future 
theoretically it could happen at the moment of your birthor 
conception actually it could happen at any time its a question to 
which i hope well never learn the answer

marty nodded vigorously

marty
amen

int car  high school parking lot

not too much later marty pulled into the high school parking lot with 
eileen at his side in the professors packard he carefully parked the 
car it was hard for him to look at his mother eileen in the dress 
she was wearing it was a light pink color low cut showing off her 
cleavage he stared at the clock in the dashboard instead

marty
uh lets just sit here for a few minutes voice cracking

eileen looked at him with motherly concern

eileen
are you all right marty you seem a littlenervous

marty
oh no im finefine

he tried to smile at her it came out pretty shaky but eileen smiled 
back a moment later

eileen
im usually nervous myself on first datesbut not tonight its 
funny but somehow i feel likelike i know you

marty
uh yeah well believe me i sure feel like i know you 

he wondered how george was doing and wished hed hurry up and get his 
ass out here

int high school dance

the dance was in full swing the band lester moon and the midnighters 
were on stage playing the blue tango in the middle of the dance floor 
was a big papermache eiffel tower around which students were doing 
the tango george looked up at the clock in the gym 859 he quickly 
looked at his watch it read 855 which one was right

he ran over to a student nearby 

george
what time do you have

nearby student
looking at his watch five after nine

george let out a moan and ran as fast as he could from the gym
    

int car  high school parking lot

marty shifted uncomfortably in the seat and glanced at the clock again

eileen
why are you so nervous 

eileen asked with a frown watching him carefully marty took a deep 
breath trying to steady himself he had to get a grip

marty
well eileenjeez thats hard for me to say have you ever been in a 
situation where  well  you know you have to act a certain way but 
when you get there you dont know if you can go through with it

eileen
you mean like how youre supposed to act with someone on a first date

marty titled his head to the side 

marty
well sort of

eileen nodded interrupting him

eileen
i think i know exactly what you mean

marty
you do

eileen nodded again slower

eileen
and you know what i do in those situations

marty finally looked at her waiting for the answer

eileen
i dont worry about it

the words had barely left her lips when she lunged at marty nearly 
knocking him over starting to kiss him passionately eileen climbed 
all over him her skirt everywhere she reached out and took martys 
hand lying limp at his side and placed it on the top of her bare 
breasts marty couldnt move paralysed in shock that this promiscuous 
teenager was his mother
    

int high school   pay phone

george stood at a pay phone quickly dialing the number for the time 
the phone rang two long times before a woman answered

woman on phone
at the tone the time will be 900 exactly

before the tone could go off george dropped the phone and raced down 
the hall he had to get to the parking lot
    

int car  high school parking lot

eileen had been attacking marty for about a minute  a very long 
minute in martys opinion  before she suddenly stopped and pushed him 
away the buttons at the top of her dress were undone and her bra was 
exposed

eileen
this isnt right
    

int high school

george reached the front of the school doors and threw them open 
suddenly he was jerked to a stop he looked behind him and saw his 
jacket had caught on the door jamb he tried frantically to get it 
loose all the while aware of the seconds ticking by
    

int car  high school parking lot

eileen
i dont know what it is butwhen i kiss yousomethings wrong it 
almost feels likelike i was kissing my brotheror my father i 
dont understand it but i just know its wrong looking at marty 
eyes wide i guess that doesnt make any sense does it

marty stared at her finally finding his voice 

marty
believe me it makes perfect sense

sudden footsteps crunched on gravel approaching the car eileen 
glanced outside 

eileen
sounds like somebodys coming

the steps grew closer marty looked at the clock nine on the dot

marty
murmurs not now george not now

the drivers door was suddenly thrown open marty had hardly turned 
toward it when he was yanked out of the car roughly instead of george 
he saw someone he had not expected in the least it was biff

biff
i been lookin for you asshole the bully growled in a low voice 

he shoved marty over to skinhead standing nearby marty fought to get 
free but he was no match for biffs gang three against one was never 
good odds

eileen
let go of him

eileen demanded watching the spectacle from inside the car

eileen
leave him alone

 a smile spread across biffs face when he noticed eileen

biff
look at what we have here 

his eyes traveled across her body and he saw her bra half exposed 

biff
eileen  i didnt know you were that kinda girl

eileen
im not 

eileen started to climb out of the car

biff
oh no you dont

before she could get anywhere biff grabbed her and pushed her back 
inside then climbed in after her he looked at his gang as he pulled a 
struggling eileen towards him

biff
take him around back ill join you in a minute

his gang made no move to leave

biff
go on this aint no peepshow

marty tried to get free and help his mom  do  something  but he was 
helpless as he was dragged away he saw biff slam the door and lunge 
toward eileen to kiss her she fought and a moment later all marty saw 
were her skirts and flailing arms and legs eileen was trying to 
scream but biff  in some way or another  kept cutting her off

ext high school  side entrance

marty was dragged around a corner the car vanishing from his view a 
man stood at the side door smoking something marty twisted his head 
around and saw him about the same time the black man saw them it was 
reginald washington the same guy who had liked his music

reginald washington
hey whats going on there

marty tried to answer but one of the bullies conveniently had their 
hand over his mouth 

gums
beat it black boy

reginald took a step forward 

reginald washington
hey now youd better 

skinhead
listen spook you lookin for trouble 

reginald washington
no sir i dont want no trouble 

reginald backed away and went back into the school marty was left 
alone at the mercy of biffs gang
    

ext high school

george finally managed to get his jacket free and ran down the front 
steps across to the parking lot

ext high school parking lot

he hurried through the lot his eyes skimming the rows of car for the 
cream colored packard finally he zeroed in on it his eyes widened as 
he saw that eileen and marty were struggling inside eileen screaming 
george steadied himself hiked up his pants and rushed to the side of 
the car he opened the drivers side door

george
hey you he said forcefully get your damn hands  uh oh

it wasnt marty inside with eileen when the guy inside turned around 
he saw with horror that it was biff tannen instead an icy stab of fear 
hit george in the chest

biff
deadly serious i think you got the wrong car mcfly

eileen
struggling to sit up george help me

george looked at her feeling strangely detached from the situation he 
didnt know what to do a part of him wanted to run as fast and far 
away as possible but at the same time he knew he couldnt leave eileen 
alone with biff 

biff
same deadly serious voice just close the door mcfly and walk away

eileen
george please help me

george stood rooted to where he was unable to make up his mind his 
eyes darted between biffs mask of anger and eileens tear streaked 
face what should he do

ext high school  side entrance
    
marty was shoved back against the school wall his head slammed against 
the concrete wall and he winced gums and match kept a firm hold on 
him so he couldnt get away across from him skinhead pulled his fist 
back ready to slam marty in the face marty closed his eyes tensing 
up waiting for the blow

but it never came instead he heard footsteps and cries of surprise 
from biffs gang he opened his eyes and saw that reginald had brought 
some friends it was the band that was playing at the dance

band member
who you callin spook peckerwood

skinhead tried to throw a punch at him  but the guy got him instead 
then the rest of the men went after gums and match  who saw them 
approaching and tried to make a run for it releasing marty marty 
darted away to the parking lot not letting the chance to escape pass 
by he had to get back to eileen
    

ext high school parking lot

george stared at biff who stared back angrily

biff
all right mcfly i asked you politely to leave now im gonna have to 
teach you a lesson

biff stepped out of the car and before george could move he grabbed 
his right arm and twisted it back george let out a moan of pain biff 
started laughing as if it was some kind of great joke the laugh 
taunted george made him angrier and angrier

without thinking about it his left hand clenched into a fist and he 
spun around his fist connected solidly with biffs face and the smile 
dropped from the bullys face a second before he dropped to the ground 
out cold

george looked at his hand stunned as if he couldnt believe that it 
had done such a thing marty reached the site just then skidding to a 
stop eileen climbed out of the car and gave george a hug he hugged 
her back tentatively marty ducked back into the shadows not wanting 
to be spotted by either one of them and ruin the moment a few other 
kids from the dance were migrating toward the site now 

girl
did you see that 

guy
kids got the greatest left hook since jo louis laid im out cold with 
one punch

onlooker
somebody better call an ambulance

marty shook his head amazed that they were talking about his father 
he watched george and eileen walk slowly toward the school arm in arm 
right before they entered eileen turned around and caught sight of 
marty staring at them she gave him a shy smile and he grinned at her 
in return once they entered the building he turned and ran back to 
the side of the school where he had left biffs gang

ext high school  side entrance

the band members were running off biffs gang as marty approached 
them one of them got one last kick at skinhead in the ass before they 
spilt 

marty

the three hoods scatterred into the night

band member

marty

band member 2

 marty looked at them stunned

marty

marty glanced at lester who was wrapping a handkerchief around his 
bruised and bleeding hand

marty

turn back the hands of time my parents gotta  george eileen gotta 
dance the last dance and kiss

band member

 marty turned to look at reginald

int high school dance  stage

marty stood on stage with the band playing turn back the hands of time 
with them he could see his parents dancing cheek to cheek in the 
middle of the dance floor marty watched them carefully as the song 
ended holding his breath they leaned forward slowly 
hesitantlythen their lips met in a kiss he smiled in relief then 
checked the time a few minutes before midnight

marty stepped forward to the microphone set up

marty
well folks that about wraps it up for this evening

the students moaned in disappointment

students
aww one more    just one more

marty
you want one more huh

marty looked at the clock again then turned to the band none of them 
appeared to have any objections he looked at the crowd considering 
then finally decided to go for it 

marty
well i probably shouldnt do this but what the hell youre gonna be 
hearing a lot of this in the future anyway turning around follow 
me fellas he told the band members

marty walked over to his amp and twisted the volume to the maximum 
amount it would go he placed his guitar against it and shattered the 
expectant silence of the gym with a loud riff from the instrument the 
audience looked both shocked and horrified and the band exchanged 
looks of confusion marty started in on a chuck berry song johnny b 
goode expressions in the gym changing to astonishment it took a 
moment but the band finally figured out what was going on and joined 
in marty grinned as the first  very first  sound of rock n roll 
was heard

kids started dancing only a few at first then more joined in marty 
started moving on stage like the rockers did at heavy metal concerts 
the crowd roared total pandemonium breaking out on the dance floor no 
one had ever heard this kind of music before the band got more and 
more enthusiastic as the chaperones clasped their hands tightly to 
their ears horrified expressions on their faces

marty shifted the music to rock around the clock noting in 
satisfaction that the entire gym was dancing to the music he loosened 
the tie around his neck sweating from those hot stage lights then 
decided to just take his jacket off he yanked it off his body and 
tossed it into the crowd
 meanwhile out in the hall an old teacher who had been chaperoning 
the dance was on the phone 

old teacher
thats right officer over the music theres a riot in the school 
gym

in the gym on the stage the man with the sax stepped forward and 
improvised an impressive solo then it was martys turn he reached up 
and tore open his shirt making all the girls shriek finally with a 
nervous look at the clock he wrapped the music up with a final riff 
the walls of the gym shook with the applause marty took a bow and 
smiled at the crowd behind him the midnighters were breathless with 
all the excitement

marty
good night everybody

marty shouted into the mike he stepped back heading for the door but 
the band members crowded around him

reginald washington
man that stuff cooks thats the hottest sound i ever heard you gotta 
play that monday for that record company cat from new york

marty lost the smile on his face suddenly serious

marty
i wont be there monday

the band members looked stunned marty continued to talk before they 
could ask any questions

marty
and dont you guys play it either he cautioned its time hasnt come 
yet if you play it you might screw things up itll happen on its 
own

lester
what are you talking about

marty
rockn roll

he turned and ran off stage darting though the halls to the front of 
the building outside he could see professor browns truck in front of 
the school engine idling waiting to go
marty burst out of the school and jumped into the cab slamming the 
door behind him 

int truck

he noticed that the professor was in an army uniform 

marty
everythings cool breathless they danced they kissed theyre in 
love lets go

professor brown put his foot on the gas and they tore out of the 
parking lot
    

int truck  hours later

several hours later marty was still talking about the evenings events 
to the professor 

marty
i sure wish i could have seen the punch

it was almost three in the morning

marty
i mean he decked him  laid him out cold  one punch it must have 
been beautiful i didnt know he had it in him

professor brown took his eyes off the road a moment to look at marty 
something about what he was saying making him uneasy 

professor emmett brown
you didnt

marty
nope my fathers never clenched a fist in his entire life

professor emmett brown
curious sudden concern very curious

marty shook his head unaware of the professors worries

marty
i just wish i could have seen it

he let his voice trail off staring out the dark window at the highway 
unwinding before them professor brown turned his attention back to 
driving for the first time all evening marty lapsed into silence 
when the professor next looked at him ten minutes later he was 
slumped back in his seat his forehead resting against the window eyes 
closed and snoring softly professor brown didnt disturb him marty 
had a long and busy night and deserved some rest especially 
considering how much work had to be done in the next day

the light of dawn had hardly begun to shine in the east when they 
crossed the state line into nevada the professor pulled into a gas 
station and stopped the car the tank was running low and they still 
had a ways to go not to mention that according to a sign next to the 
station there would be no more chances to fill up for 150 miles

ext gas station

professor brown turned to marty and shook him awake then handed him 
his bag and told him to go change as marty headed for the bathroom 
the professor got out of the truck and headed for the small building 
where the grizzled gas attendant was waiting    

int gas station  bathroom

inside the bathroom marty quickly changed out of the suit he had worn 
to the dance and into his 1982 clothes pulling some army fatigues and 
a jacket over them the army clothes were a little loose but it didnt 
matter once he had the clothes on marty took the bottles of coke he 
had brought with him in his bag and stuffed them deep into the jackets 
pockets he looked in the dusty mirror checking his appearance to make 
sure he looked okay and the coke bottles werent visible they werent 
marty quickly gathered up his things and left the stuffy restroom 
joining up with the professor just as the gas had finished

ext gas station

gas attendant
twenty six gallons checking the readouts thatll be 375

marty almost choked since when was gas so cheap before he had much 
time to reflect on that professor brown paid the man and climbed into 
the truck marty had no choice but to follow and they continued towards 
the test site

int truck  military instalation

hours later professor brown was driving the truck down a dirt road at 
the end of it was a huge barbed wire fence padlocked with a huge 
sign us army restricted area authorized personal only their goal 
the test site

the professor nudged a dozing marty as they approached the gate and 
pulled to a stop he had previously told marty to leave the talking to 
him and marty had no problem with that he certainly did not want to 
get them arrested almost as soon as they had stopped an mp stepped 
up to the truck a rifle in hand

mp
where do you jokers think youre going he asked peering into the cab

the professor picked up some papers  their orders  off the 
dashboard and handed them to the guy

professor emmett brown
were here to deliver that refrigerator

he pointed to the back the mp glanced at it and shook his head 

mp
do you know where you are

professor emmett brown
this is where theyre gonna drop the bomb right well philco wants to 
find out what it does to their refrigerator

the mp strolled over to the back and used his gun to lift up a corner 
of the tarp and look under it

mp
whats with the motorcycle

marty watched the professor carefully wondering how he would answer 
this one as before he had a logical answer

professor emmett brown
general motors wants to find out what it does to their truck the 
motorcycle is because we dont want to find out what it does to us

the man glanced at the papers

mp
well you better shake a leg that bomb goes off in fiftyfive minutes

professor brown and marty glanced at each other relieved then drove 
through the nowopen gate they had passed the first obstacle
    

int military bunker

colonel nordell peered through binoculars at the barren desert from the 
artillery bunker the bunker had a full communicational base in it 
with 105mm howitzers ready for any last minute attacks the desert 
appeared to be peaceful and desertedthen the colonel saw the army 
truck speeding toward the test sight he turned toward lieutenant 
glass standing beside him

colonell nordell
lieutenant whats that vehicle doing down there

the lieutenant glanced up looking unconcerned two guys delivering a 
refrigerator from philco sir

colonell nordell
from philco shaking his head jesus h christ how many refrigerators 
do we have to blow up in this test
    

ext nevada desert  15 miles from test site

marty and the professor reached the tract houses a few minutes after 
being allowed inside this suburbian site was 15 miles from the blast 
site according to a large sign nearby

professor brown backed the truck into a driveway of a house where two 
mannequins were positioned on the front lawn the man was set up with a 
lawn mower and the woman was in a chaise lounge marty looked at the 
bizzare spectacle for a moment then jumped out of the truck to open 
the garage door for the professor he finished backing the truck inside 
and switched off the ignition

it was hot outside already so marty took off his jacket and tossed it 
inside the cab of the truck he helped the professor take the tarp off 
the back and start to hook the time machine up

the clock read 1130am inside the detonation control room the room 
bustled with activity as the time drew near for the blast

ext nevada desert  15 miles from test site

professor emmett brown
there it is  ground zero and your target is 800 yards

professor brown and marty peered through binoculars at the side of the 
house behind them the time machine was ready for action the power 
converter set up on the roof of the truck with the solar cell panel 
pointed toward the front of the vehicle

marty
it was sure nice of uncle sam to put those yardage markers up for us 
noticing the markers at every 200 yards from the tower

professor emmett brown
were at one and a half miles so youre just a little over a mile from 
where you want to be lowering his binoculars wait until minus 3 
minutes before you go  that should give you plenty of time and it 
should be close enough to zero hour that they cant do anything to stop 
you park the truck at 800 and get in the refri the time chamber 
just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bombthe power 
converter will do the rest

professor brown headed into the garage again and marty followed the 
motorcycle was on the ground with the mannequin who had been mowing 
the lawn in the side car passenger seat 

professor emmett brown
heres a walkietalkie handing marty the object from inside the truck 
and pointing to the channel selector knob ill be on this frequency 
moving it up a few numbers this ones the army

a voice from the control room came on mixed with static

voice
t minus 28 minutes and counting

the professor checked the time

professor emmett brown
id better go holding his hand out towards the teenager good luck 
marty

marty shook his hand 

marty
thanks for everything pro

professor emmett brown
professor brown grinned i guess ill see you in about 30 years

marty swallowed hard remembering the professor being gunned down in 
the future this was the last time he would see him alive 

marty
uh yeah i hope so

the professor gave him an intense look 

professor emmett brown
is something wrong

marty shook his head biting his lower lip as he tried to fight back 
the threat of tears 

marty
its just always so hard for me to say goodbye

marty turned suddenly and stepped outside unable to stand looking at 
the professor any longer after a moment professor brown spoke

professor emmett brown
 marty sounding hesitant i know ive repeatedly asked you not to 
tell me anything about the future butwell those loud bangs on the 
tape recorderare they

marty
professor  there are some doors that shouldnt be opened marty said 
softly without turning around

the professor nodded slowly in the background the walkietalkie 
spoke 

voice
t minus 27 minutes

marty raised his binoculars again and looked at ground zero the 
professor watched him for a moment then went over to the motorcycle 
he stared at the mannequin realizing that something was amiss 
professor brown reached into the truck cab and pulled out martys army 
jacket and placed it on the mannequin then he got on started the 
engine and drove away

marty continued to look through the binoculars hardly aware of the 
professors departure
    

int military bunker

lieutenant glass watched the desert from the artillery bunker through 
his own set of binoculars he saw the motorcycle from the truck with 
the refrigerator speed away with the two men who had come with it 
inside the lieutenant turned to colonel nordell beside him

lieutenant glass
there go those two lovers who brought the refrigerator

colonel nordell nodded all right he picked up a phone nearby 
evacuation is complete this area is secure he said into it
    

ext nevada desert  15 miles from test site

when the professor vanished from view as he sped away marty lowered 
his binoculars and checked the time he had about 25 minutes left 
before the bomb would detonate and over 20 minutes to go before he had 
to start driving towards the site

marty decided now would be a good time to look around he walked around 
to the front of the house taking a moment to check out the yard and 
homes exterior except for the mannequins in the front it looked 
pretty typical for a 1950s home marty walked across the grass and 
tried the door it was unlocked he stepped inside

marty was expecting the place to be empty to his amazement the inside 
was completely furnished it looked like a model home awaiting 
display current issues of popular  in the 1950s anyway  
magazines were on the tables there was a radio even a tv in the room 
marty looked in the dining room and saw another group of mannequins 
seated at the table with place settings arranged before them marty 
shook his head chuckling at the lengths that the government went with 
these experiments

he went into the kitchen and looked around this room it was completely 
furnished like the other rooms down to the last detail in one corner 
a frigidaire refrigerator sat marty walked over to it and opened it 
up it was well stocked with food he saw meat cheese milk eggs 
coke fruit and vegetables marty plucked an apple from inside took a 
bite from it then set it back inside he shut the fridge and retraced 
his steps back to the living room to check out the tv

the tv was full of static and snow when he first switched it on marty 
twisted the channel knob finally tuning into a somewhat muddy image of 
the howdy doody show since it was the only thing he could get a 
reception on marty watched clarabell dancing around and slowly shook 
his head

marty

he was grateful that he wouldnt be stuck in that decade forever

professor brown headed towards the gate on his motorcycle as the mp 
listened to the countdown on their radios

voice
tminus 7 minutes 7 minutes until final detonation

as the professor got closer to the gate one of the mps opened it 
and waved him through professor brown waved back over his shoulder 
not slowing the vehicle down in the least
    

ext nevada desert  15 miles from test site

marty started to take off his army fatigues as he watched the tv under 
the clothes was the outfit he had come with from 1982 as soon as he 
had shed the clothes from the army he switched the walkietalkie on to 
check the time before the bomb would go off

voice
tminus 6 minutes and counting
    

ext nevada desert

professor brown continued the high speed on his motorcycle down a dirt 
road then up a hill and into the mountains finally when the ground 
leveled off he cut the engine and stopped the motorcycle the 
professor reached for the binoculars around his neck as he got off the 
bike and walked to the edge of a cliff he peered at the test sight 
with its tract homes and the tower where the nuclear bomb sat

professor brown grabbed his walkietalkie and listened to the control 
voice 

voice
5 minutes and counting

he switched channels to the one marty was on 

professor emmett brown

professor emmett brown

marty

marty brought the walkietalkie with him as he went into the garage and 
opened the door into the cab to get his jacket with the bottles of coke 
in it but it wasnt there
marty blinked shocked and checked the floor and behind the seats 
nothing he started to panic marty climbed into the back of the truck 
and checked there even though the chances were very slim that it could 
have gotten there it wasnt
 marty snatched the walkietalkie off the front seat where he had set 
it

marty
professor panicing and fearful i cant find the formula i left it 
in my jacket and my jackets gone

professor brown heard martys news and turned to look at the motorcycle 
behind him there was martys jacket still on the mannequin where he 
had inadvertently set it earlier

professor brown stared at the walkietalkie wondering what was going 
on

ext nevada desert  15 miles from test site    

marty ran into the house and straight to the kitchen he yanked open 
the refrigerator and his eyes fell on those bottles of coke he had seen 
earlier marty let out a deep sigh of relief though he knew the ordeal 
was far from over hed had serious visions of his tombstone there for 
a few minutes

marty
dont worry about a thing into the walkietalkie theres plenty of 
formula in the refrigerator

from the refrigerator without thinking marty tried to twist the cap 
off the bottle but it wouldnt budge he didnt have a bottle opener 
with him either

colonel nordell watched the bomb site with his binoculars from the 
artillery bunker it was deserted as it should be he was about to turn 
away when a flash of movement caught his eye he couldnt believe it 
when he saw the truck racing towards the site of the bomb

colonel nordell

captain teague and lieutenant glass turned to look through their 
binoculars 

captain teague
hes heading straight for the bomb

lieutenant glass

the military men made a dash for the 105mm howitzer

int truck  en route to ground zero

marty drove the truck past mile marker 13 unaware of the eminent 
danger gun breeches were opened with 105mm shells being loaded inside 
the artillery bunker the weapons were slammed shut and cranked around 
towards the outside and the truck

idea where to fire

another weapon was adjusted to the position and fired

marty had managed to calm himself down after the first explosion hed 
hardly began to breathe normally again when something else exploded 
this one a lot closer in front of the truck but still off to the side 
marty twisted the wheel to the side terrified of being blow up hardly 
noticing the 1400 yards marker as he drove by it

heard professor brown was yelling at him over the airwaves

a second later a huge explosion wiped out the 800 yard marker where he 
had been parked the truck trembled from the shock wave marty stopped 
the truck several hundred feet away and watched the smoke clear a huge 
crater in the ground was all that remained of yard marker 800 where he 
had been seconds before he swallowed hard

forgotten

jumping to the ground the truck picked up speed as marty ran to the 
back grabbing hold of the sides of the vehicle and pulling himself 
inside he threw the switches on the time machine turning it on and 
preparing it for the trip back he hoped

it could have been his imagination but marty swore he could still hear 
the timekeeper over the roar of everything

the truck pitched forward into the gaping hole left from the howitzer 
shell marty lost his balance unprepared for the jolt and fell into 
the bed of the truck his head struck the metal floor which left him 
slightly dazed for a second he realized that the truck had gotten 
slightly off center with where the solar cell that was positioned just 
so as it had fallen and quickly climbed to his feet to jerk the cells 
back where they belonged

light for a moment before dimming to a glow of softer yellow
    

ext time machinerefridgerator

the bright white light hit the power converter marty glanced up inside 
his cramped quarters to see a thin beam of the same color hit him from 
the focusing lense suspended above his head he closed his eyes as a 
strange feeling swept over his body    

the yellow glow from the bomb lasted a few moments turning everything 
yellow the tower which housed the bomb was vaporized and the truck of 
marty and the professors began to melt from the intense heat inside 
the command bunker the army officers with their men and the chosen 
civilians gaped at the site before them as the mushroom cloud formed 
its radioactive smoke reaching thousands of feet into the atmosphere

ext nevada desert  hill

safely on the hill professor brown turned his back on the site and 
over to the mannequin in the sidecar a medium sized bulge rested in 
one of the pockets of the army jacket the professor looked at it a 
long moment long after the light of the bomb faded and the shock wave 
had passed he remembered martys words from earlier and wondered 
should i look

int time machine

marty saw completely and utter darkness around him the air around him 
had grow hot and stuffy he resisted the urge to cough and felt for the 
handle of the refrigerator door his hand came into contact with it 
after a moments search and he pushed forward

ext nevada desert  1982

a crack of sunlight split the darkness marty pushed the door harder 
and a shower of sand rained on him he climbed to the outside world 
the sun was shining brightly in a clear blue sky marty looked down at 
the refrigerator and saw that it was half rotted and worn away with 
age next to it he recognized the remains of the army truck twisted 
and almost unrecognizable half buried in the sand

marty took a step away from the refrigerator and looked around him it 
was barren out here he saw nothing but an ocean of hot sand all 
around marty glanced at his watch it was noon exactly he squinted up 
at the merciless glare of the sun

marty
shit

marty decided the best thing for him to do would be to start walking 
he set off in the direction of the sun not sure which way to head a 
few minutes after he started the hike marty started to hear a low hum 
off in the distance it sounded like a helicopter

the sound grew closer and he looked up at the sky his eyes searching 
for the source he saw something in the sky but it looked strange the 
craft started to lower itself toward the ground grains of sand flying 
everywhere marty squinted his eyes and put a hand over them turning 
his head away between the glare of the sun on the thing and all the 
flying sand it was almost impossible to tell anything about it

after a moment the noise faded away and marty turned around right in 
front of him was a strange sight it looked like a car from the 
1950sbut it had three whitewalls propellers and funny fins on 
the side at the back of the car was something that resembled the 
professors power converter as marty stared at the contraption he 
noticed professor brown in the drivers seat

marty opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out the 
professor opened the door and jumped out heading towards marty he 
looked older then he had in 1952 but not as much as he had in 1982 
professor brown seemed different to marty his posture straighter with 
more of a spark in his eyes

professor emmett brown
marty youre here right on time how are you feeling okay

marty tried to speak again

marty
hesitantly what year is this 

professor emmett brown
beaming 1982 march 18 just like we planned my calculations were 
absolutely correct thirty years god i cannot believe its been 
thirty years sure it was a long time ago  longest ive ever had to 
wait for the results of an experiment

marty was confused 

marty
and youre alive professor remembering what happened right before he 
left 1982 you werent shot

professor brown looked at him blankly

professor emmett brown
shot whod want to shoot me ive never felt better in my life

marty didnt know what to say about that he continued to stare at the 
flying vehicle and at the professor 

professor emmett brown
hop in marty turning and heading for the vehicle weve got a long 
drive ahead of us

marty
what do you call this as he cautiously started towards the 
contraption

professor emmett brown
a car

marty watched as professor brown opened the door and got inside he 
slowly followed suit

int car

inside the car marty noticed the controls and the dashboard were 
streamlined in a kind of oldfashioned futuristic style he was 
distracted from his examination of the cars interior by the professor 
leaning over and pulling out a 16 ounce bottle of coke he grabbed a 
bottle opener that was on the dashboard and opened it up then pulled 
open the dashboard in front of marty and hooked the bottle to a funnel 
labeled fuel inside marty remembered leaving the formula in his 
jacket somehow professor brown must have found it

marty
professor you peaked didnt you

professor brown shrugged looking a little sheepish

professor emmett brown
yeah i figured what the hell

a moment later he lifted the car up from the sand and flew them away 
from the old nuclear test site
    
professor brown waited a few minutes before starting to answer some of 
the questions marty had begun to throw at him marty wanted to know 
everything that had happened over the past thirty years to the 
professor things seemed so different from when he had left

professor emmett brown
you see i never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 
1952 i decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing 
history was too risky anyway experiments in time travel were banned 
in all 87 states after the governor of cuba caught dr felstien fooling 
around in the bermuda triangle  that was back in 64

marty
87 states time travel bans what the hell

marty didnt understand anything he tried not to think about that part 
of the conversation there were some other more important things to 
wonder about

marty
but if you didnt rebuild the time machine how did i go back in time 
in the first place

professor emmett brown
according to your girlfriend suzy parker you and she were at the 
movies you went to the restroom and you never came out obviously you 
stepped through an interdimensional time warp created by the original 
operation of the time machine

most of this was still going over martys head 

marty
obviously  trying to appear that he understood

professor emmett brown
but i told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation 
experiment you were helping me with so dont mention anything about 
time travel to anyone

marty
nodding what theater was i at

professor emmett brown
the orpheum

marty smiled some of this finally clicking into place he looked out 
the window and saw far below a clean and more of that oldfashioned 
modern look on a city it had streamlined skyscrapers and even some 
flying cars marty couldnt believe it

marty
wow look at that city

professor brown glanced out the window 

professor emmett brown
pretty isnt it

marty
its the most beautiful city ive ever seen what is it

the professor smiled at him 

professor emmett brown
cleveland

ext mcfly house    

it was night when they reached martys house it was the same one he 
had left but it looked different on closer inspection marty noticed 
the corners were more rounded almost streamlined and a large power 
converter sat on the roof next to the chimney the professor landed his 
car next to another one in the driveway that had all the elaborate 
propellers and stuff on it too marty guessed that this was considered 
the norm here

professor emmett brown
 go on in noticing martys hesitation ill be with you as soon as i 
adjust this blasted flow capacitor

as marty got out of the car he noticed more flying cars busses even 
trucks in the air above his home he shook his head and turned his 
attention back to his house he stared at it a long moment and took a 
deep breath before walking to the front door marty rang the doorbell 
unsure if he should just barge in with all the changes he had seen so 
far he wasnt sure if it would be a good idea

the door was answered a minute later but not by who he had expected a 
robot looking vaguely like the one marty had seen on professor browns 
blueprints that one night pulled the door open it was only about 
three or four feet high with a little bow tie on

robot
greetings master martin let me take your coat

marty stared at the thing for a moment 

marty
right 

he slowly took off his silver porsche jacket and handed it to the 
robot finally he stepped into his house

int mcfly house

marty was surprised things actually didnt look that different from 
when he had left his mother sitting in the living room jumped to her 
feet and rushed towards him

eileen
marty youre back im so glad to see you

eileen mcfly gave her son a hug then seemed to notice his clothes she 
looked at marty a faint smile on her face

eileen
where did you get these silly clothes

without waiting for an answer she turned to the robot 

eileen
sparky get marty some clean clothes

robot
yes madam

marty watched him turning and heading out of the room as his mother 
spoke again

eileen
your fathers in the study say hello to him

he nodded and walked down the hall marty stopped halfway to the study 
suddenly noticing several display cases hanging on the hallway wall in 
one there was a pair of boxing gloves with a plaque mcflyliston 
fight madison square garden 1966 in the case next to that was a 
silver boxing champions belt with george m mcfly world middleweight 
champion 1963 in the last one was a framed magazine ad with a picture 
of george mcfly holding a weird device with the words the champ gives 
tooth decay the onetwo punch with sonodent ultra sonic tooth care 
system by e brown enterprises under the photo

marty was surprised and a little shocked on all that had happened since 
he had left 

george mcfly looked up from his desk as marty entered his study 

george
welcome home son 

his voice sounded a little different to martys ears more confident 
and forceful not nearly as meek like it had been before 

george
the professor told us what happened with the experiment  that there 
might be some side effects lapses of memory

marty edged closer to the desk to get a better look at this new george 
mcfly he like the professor seemed different  for the better but 
still different dad didnt seem to notice his scrutiny he continued 
talking

george
your moms got one heckuva dinner planned tonight shes been pushing 
buttons all day

marty nodded as if he understood and as he did so he noticed a 
familiar looking figure outside the window his eyes narrowed and marty 
realized it was biff wearing a security guard uniform and in a chaise 
lounge appearing to be asleep martys father followed his gaze and 
opened the window

george
hey biff what are you doing sleeping on the job a security guards 
supposed to be alert

biff smiled and sat up 

biff
yes sir mr mcfly

george
what am i paying you fifty cents an hour for 

biff
im sorry champ getting to his feet it wont happen again sir

he began to walk around the yard

george closed the window and sat back down at his desk marty watched 
as he attached a suction cup that was connected by wire to something 
that looked like a pen on his forehead he waved the pen over a blank 
check and with a few electronic beeps handwriting appeared on the 
paper spelling out pay to the order of the coca cola company

marty
what are you doing dad 

marty watched eyes wide in amazement

his father glanced up puzzled 

george
whats it look like im doing son im paying the fuel bill its over 
200 this month  we really oughta try to cut down

marty continued to watch his father george looked a little concerned

george
whats wrong son you act like youve never seen a writeomatic 
before

marty pulled out his bic pen from his pocket and looked at it shaking 
his head

george
say what have you got there noticing the pen for the first time an 
antique pen let me see that he took it from marty and examined it 
carefully i havent seen one of these inwell this is strange how 
do you fill it with ink

martys father flashed him a strange look which made marty feel 
slightly uneasy he looked like he wanted to say something but before 
he did someone knocked on the door a second later eileen came into 
the room

eileen
marty theres someone here to see you

suzy parker came into the room she was wearing some strange clothes 
with her hair styled in a different unusual way but marty didnt 
care 

marty
suzy

suzy
hi marty

marty
what did you do to your hair

suzy
what did you do to yours

marty and suzy both laughed as professor brown slipped into the room 

george
hey hows my favorite girl

she smiled

suzy
fine mr mcfly

george
why dont you two get out of here  im sure you can find something 
better to do than watch me pay bills 

suzy looked at her boyfriend critically

suzy
marty youd better change your clothes you cant go to mambo class 
looking like that

marty stared at her blankly

marty
mambo class you mean people still do the mambo

suzy shrugged 

suzy
sure everybody does the mambo

marty thought about that for a moment wondering something important 

marty
dont tell me youve never heard of rockn roll

suzy now directed a blank look at him

suzy
rock and what

professor emmett brown
ive never heard of it either

marty gave a big grin

marty
well maybe its time you did

he took suzys hand and the two of them left the room eileen and 
professor brown following    

george mcfly was left alone in his study sitting at his desk 
something about the conversation earlier with his son was gnawing at 
him he opened his desk drawer and pulled out his hydraulic scrapbook 
after he plugged it in the pneumatic cylinders began to turn the pages 
automatically it stopped at a certain page and george looked at the 
newspaper clipping he had saved in there way back thirty years ago

police quell near riot at school dance the headlined said it was that 
old springtime in paris dance the article was talking about beneath 
the headline was a somewhat grainy photograph of the young man on stage 
who had played that strange music as george looked closer he saw that 
the young man in the picture bore a striking resemblance to his son
george shook his head slowly

george
nah couldnt be

fade to black
