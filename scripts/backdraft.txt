               darkness then the glint of a flashlight its beam rocks 
               crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room 
               as we hear two children arguing

                                     older kid

               its hard but we get a sense of the room in the whipping 
               beam of light huge dark coats lined up like sides of beef 
               on steel batons bent stained helmets hung like african 
               masks

               beneath them brian 7 and stephen 12 are trying to struggle

               instant before the corner makes eye contact with his older 
               brother

               they stick their tongues out

               ext chicago street  day  20 yrs earlier

               the engine howls its way through the city brian sandwiched 
               between his father and adcox looks out in wonderment at 
               intersections zipping past like picket fences at people on 
               sidewalks holding hands over their ears at the red emergency 
               lights bouncing crazily off shop windows

               ext building  day  20 yrs earlier

               lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block 
               medium deal the engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping 
               off like ship rats dennis opens his door hops down and 
               pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his 
               son

                                     dennis

               brian nods vigorously taking the command seriously dennis 
               smiles and is off dragging a hoseline with his crew toward 
               a doorway they disappear into brian climbs down from the 
               cab

                                     engineer
                         dont stray too far little man

               brian smiles to the pumper operator he just wants a better 
               look and he gets it smoke turned evil and dark now taking 
               on purpose

               ext building  day  20 yrs earlier

               theres a level of apartments above the storefronts as brian 
               watches a window opens and out steps his father and adcox 
               onto a small fire escape their attentions on the next window 
               over out of reach wrapped in leaky smoke

               suddenly dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing armed 
               with only an axe and jumps across to the next metal balcony 
               a ballsy dangerous move he kicks in the window breaks out 
               the frame with his axe and dives in

               a beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified 
               smudged little girl he hands the little girl over the railing 
               to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way  a 
               ladder

               denniss face lifts and grins at brian dirty bigger than 
               life invincible he winks a wink only possible between 
               fathers and sons and hes gone again back into the swirling 
               darkness as brian stands there full of love full of pride 
               he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack releasing 
               a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof 
               the flame seems to pause to stare at brian a beat shhh 
               dont tell anyone brian is transfixed his little head 
               staring up in astonishment

               nobody else has noticed it

               brian can see his father and adcox through the window 
               probing looking for the flame lurking just above brian 
               starts to call out in a small hesitant voice

                                     brian
                         dad

               he tries to call louder but suddenly everything is 
               happening very fast in slow motion

                brian can see adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole 
               as brian steps forward under the power of a flame that 
               beckons him as  

               dennis suddenly throws his body against adcox knocking him 
               clear just as a flame explodes downward from the ceiling 
               fully against him as  all the buildings windows blow out 
               and its like the skys erupted for brian a burning hailstorm 
               that falls and pelts the ground around him plaster wood 
               and something metal that cracks against the pavement and 
               spins slowly

               a fire helmet

               and adcox is coming out the door now blackened and torn 
               hopeless tears streaming down his face

                                     axe
                         get us some backup we need some 
                         goddamn backup

               and spotting brian he runs towards him and the helmet 
               spins and spins and adcox keeps running and the sky is 
               raining fire and the flame on the roof has risen up now to 
               its full horrifying size and its laughing now laughing at 
               the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning and we 
               read the printing on the neck guard

               mccaffrey

               and adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy 
               protecting him from the fire the world but its like brian 
               doesnt see him he pulls away from adcox walks up to his 
               fathers helmet and puts it on

               the scene explodes with a flash as a photographer captures 
               the instant

               brian sees jennifer across the room she looks great refined 
               as she expertly works the room schmoozing and hugging and 
               calling various politicos by their first name

               as she speaks to one a waiter offers a drink as she accepts 
               a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red 
               syrup

                                     brian
                              holding bottle

               jennifer leads brian aside and speaks low but angrily at 
               him

                                     jennifer

                         are getting firemen hurt

                                     jennifer

                         if i didnt believe in it

               jennifer instantly cuts off as a welldressed couple passes 
               and switches stunningly into schmmozemode

                                     jennifer

               they move away jennifer turns to brian and switches just as 
               fast back to their argument

                                     jennifer
                          the thing that really makes me 
                         angry is the way your union has 

               brian cant help it he cracks up

                                     brian

               a date sally a hot little number that has a habit of

                         being chased around a desk

               theres a commotion at the other end of the bar a group of 
               firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine

                                     grindle

               daring fire rescue

               building with seemingly a woman in his arms the second photo 
               shows the backs of adcox and tims helmets as they

                         probationary fireman brian mccaffrey 
                         on his very first fire showed the 
                         kind of bravery and courage of a 
                         veteran firefighter when he risked 
                         life and limb to doublecheck a 
                         burning floor alone emerging

               a lab tech ricco leads brian and rimgale through the autopsy 
               area till they come on two corpses lying side by side covered 
               in plastic

               confronted by two hideously charred bodies

                                     ricco

               brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze whistling quietly to 
               himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf

                         its a combination of plumbers putty 
                         and rayophene gum burns almost 
                         completely away when you light it

                         theres something else kinda 
                         interesting

               ricco lifts bentons charred shoulder underneath we see 
               some of his clothes that have melted and comingled with his 
               flesh

                                     ricco
                         see this

               a credit card has been fried right into cosgroves skin about 
               where his back pocket should have been

                                     ricco
                         guess he didnt leave home without 
                         it

               ricco erupts in a honking laugh then switches instantly 
               back to a business tone

                                     ricco

                         see that patch of shirt we wondered 
                         about the discoloration so he ran a 
                         spectro on a lucky shot we picked 
                         up some traces of trychticholorate

               through now hitting the door with his shoulder as 

               the door explodes outward hurling tim against the opposite 
               wall and for an instant hes okay but he freezes in terror 
               as a shrieking tongue of flame shoots out the doorway and 
               grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames 
               wrap tim like a jealous lover as adcox hears it and screams

               the flames and puts his arms around tim as grindle douses 
               them both killing the flames

               freezes up inside stephen catches the look and theres 
               horrible silence between them

                                     brian

               starts shaving in a mirror he doesnt notice brian adcox 
               turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little 
               and brians universe caves in

               an icy claw tears out his stomach gulping breaths he forces 
               himself to look at adcoxs back

               on it is a small rectangular burn its fresh and its the 
               size of a wall socket at that moment adcox turns the two 
               of them stare at one another just a beat then adcox walks 
               past him just then the alarm bells ring brian hesitates a 
               beat confused then turns and runs down to

               brians eyes go to a window just above it there watching 
               him watching the whole exchange between brothers is adcox

               adcox stares at brian a beat then finally disappears as 
               brian hears the cough of diesel engines

                                     brian
                         oh christ stephen

               he starts running for the station

               intext fire station 17  night

                its too late adcox climbs aboard just as the engine 
               company pulls out and whistles down the street

               the ladder company is just easing onto the drive brian 
               hesitates only an instant then runs to the equipment racks 
               pulls off the hooks his helmet coat boots  and jumps 
               onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit

               intext engine company 17  night

               as it howls down the avenue stephen turns around and stares 
               at adcox sitting behind the glimmer of an understanding

               intext truck company 46  night

               the laddermen look confused seeing brian sitting among them

               a car suddenly cuts the truck company off the driver slams 
               the brakes pushing the truck company into a horrible skid 
               the back fishtails the wheels jump the curb bash a mailbox 
               and then the whole rig rolls onto its side and drags to a 
               stop

               its tangled confusion in the rear cab firemen unhurt 
               piled atop one another brian slides his way out from under 
               them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise 
               six blocks away

               he starts running

               ext warehouse fire  night

               flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along 
               the river as brian panting runs up he searches frantically 
               through the maze of arriving engine companies looking for 
               number 17 there it is but nobodys home brian stops a 
               passing captain

                                     brian
                         where are they wheres 17

                         on the roof

               brian looks up at the smoke and whirling firestorm four 
               stories above him feels the bile of fear in his throat the 
               desperation  and begins strapping on an air tank

               ext warehouse  night

               brian now fully suited up climbs the endless rungs of an 
               extended aerial ladder

               ext warehouse roof  night

               tongues of flame rocket skyward through ragged holes black 
               clouds drift murderously roofing tars bubble and hiss as 
               the roof itself groans like a comatose dinosaur reminding 
               you the whole thing could go any minute  and you with it

               trudging alone across this alien spongy surface brian looks 
               for his company its almost impossible to tell anyone apart 
               faces hidden behind helmets and masks

               suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and theres two firemen 
               near the edge 17 on their helmets

                                     brian
                         stephen 

               the helmets look up stephen and adcox facing each other 
               adcox cradles an axe

                         brian

               brian starts to move beside stephen but adcox turns tightens 
               his grip on the axe and now all the cards are on the table 
               a hissing black cloud drifts through theyre the only three 
               people on earth

               adcoxs eyes are clouded with tears

               ext warehouse  across the roof  night

               the rest of the crews are totally oblivious to whats 
               happening through the smoke on the other side grindle and 
               santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them

                                     grindle
                         shit its going clear the roof 
                         now

               everybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as

               ext warehouse roof  brian et al  night

               brian stephen and adcox react as the roof howls and groans 
               and huge splits begin racing along it and then it goes

               the center section drops and in rolling waves of screeching 
               steel the hole spreads outward devouring

               adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole 
               races for them swallowing roof

                                     stephen
                         jesus christ brian run run goddamn 
                         it

               and brian ballsout dashes for the edge stephens made one 
               corner brian desperately heads for another at the last 
               instant  as the howling flame bellows up to his ankles  
               brian leaps off the roof 

               ext warehouse  fire escape  night

                and falls half a story before crashing onto an exterior 
               fire escape flames have cut off the fire escape two floors 
               below so brian climbs down as far as possible crawls onto 
               a ledge kicks out a window steps through

               and falls

               int warehouse  elevator shaft  night

               blackness and emptiness two stories of it before he crashes 
               into a pool of water at the bottom hes in a freight elevator 
               shaft thrashing madly drowning great sheets of water are 
               pouring through an upper doorway and cascading down like 
               monsoon rain

               ext warehouse  fireboat

               we see its coming from the fireboats rushing stream

               int warehouse  elevator shaft

               the weight of his equipment is pulling brian underwater 
               struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water 
               still pouring down brian unhooks his air tank he leans 
               back tries to float on the rising column of water  his 
               coat catches on something  yanks him underwater he 
               struggles feverishly  finally tears the coat off

               the building groans in earnest flaming chunks of plaster 
               crash down around brian forcing him to duck underwater the 
               place is coming apart

               ten feet above one of the falling chunks smacks a gas main 
               splitting then igniting it a whitehot jet of flame shoots 
               from one side of the shaft to the other

               brians floating okay hes floating right up into the flames

               brian tries to flatten himself out to keep everything but 
               his nose below water but hes still moving up  the heat 
               becoming so intense his face flares and hes ducking under 
               water now trying to stay alive trying to decide whether to 
               drown or burn 

                when theres a crash and suddenly another door on the 
               shaft is tearing open theres a glint of an axe a 
               flashlight

               its stephen

               brian has about two seconds left in that time stephen sees 
               the shutoff for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite 
               its unreachable a good twelve feet across a horizontal 
               curtain of flame before we can even assimilate that 
               stephens already jumped a crazy leap over the fire he 
               smacks the opposite wall hits the shutoff and falls 
               crashing into the pool beside brian

                                     stephen
                         you crazy son of a bitch why couldnt 
                         you stay behind a desk where you 
                         belong

                                     brian
                         you never know till the fire stares 
                         you down if youre gonna be 

                                     stephen
                         oh shut up huh
                              grimaces
                         i think i broke my goddamn arm

               brian helps him stay above water the level continues to 
               rise bringing them finally even with an open doorway they 
               scramble through

               int warehouse  stairway  night

               it leads to a stairwell thats become a raging torrent of 
               water spilling down it no way they push through to the 
               next doorway and out onto

               int warehouse  night

               the place is full of hundreds of chemical drums the fire 
               has cracked its way into the room as wump  drums begin 
               exploding shooting upward roman candle fountains of 
               glittering flame brian helps stephen as they snake their 
               way past sweating drums  pressure valves hissing madly 
               with desperation they duck low round a corner

               int warehouse  catwalk  night

                and walk right into an axe handle that smacks brians 
               throat knocking him gasping flat on his back its adcox

               stephen jumps adcox and tackles him on the edge of a metal 
               platform that extends out from the raised flooring

                                     stephen
                         you stupid son of a bitch what the 
                         fuck are you doing

                                     axe
                         stevie i

               adcox struggles against him heaving and sobbing

                                     stephen
                         let it go goddamn it let it go

               and adcox releases the axe

                                     axe
                         im sorry im so sorry

               brians on his feet now coming toward them when a chemical 
               drum below explodes the shock wave buckling the platform 
               and dropping it several feet before it holds brian cut
               off is hit with a wall of debris

               adcox and stephen are flung across the platform and through 
               the shattered railing stephen grabs a piece of broken 
               dangling strut and hangs on with one hand

               in his other hand is adcox hanging below him his grip 
               loosening

                                     brian
                         stephen

               brians struggling to get out from under the debris the 
               railing stephens hanging onto is slick his hand slipping 
               along it but he wont let go of adcox his eyes bore into 
               his best friends with absolute conviction

                                     stephen
                         you go we go

               the towering shots of flame from below have begun to ignite 
               adcoxs pant leg hes starting to burn but stephen wont 
               let go wont let go even as the flames crawl up adcoxs 
               back and stephens hand is slipping and slipping and then 
               it isnt slipping anymore because its come off

                                     brian
                         no

               adcox and stephen fall theres a narrow catwalk halfway 
               down stephen hits with a sickening crunch

               adcox falls past it down into the flames

               theres an exposed ibeam running from the ruined platform 
               out over the catwalk brian climbs up onto it balances across 
               over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his 
               brother lies battered but still alive

                                     brian
                         youre gonna be all right man

               int warehouse  floor  night

               brian looks down and across the factory floor there coming 
               through the doorway is pengelly and nightengale with a 
               hoseline

               int warehouse  night

                                     brian
                         hey over here

               they start for him when another drum explodes flattening 
               them and launching their hoseline into a crazy thrashing 
               arc the flame has cut them off from the hose stephen sees 
               what brians thinking

                                     stephen
                         wait for another hose team

               but brians already moving for the catwalk ladder

                                     stephen
                         wait for the goddamn hose team

               brian puts his feet on the outside rungs of the ladder and 
               slides down to the factory floor hes heading for the 
               hoseline when wham  the fire cuts him off not just any 
               fire that same one from so many years ago

               dont fuck with me kid im not in the mood

               nightengales lost his helmet and its lying near the flames 
               spinning slowly upside down  just like his fathers brian 
               stands there paralyzed as the fire laughs at him same old 
               little kid with his finger up his ass then something 
               different comes into brians eyes

                                     brian
                         no no more

               theres a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the 
               pole brian lifts it approaches the fire you can practically 
               hear the flames laugh at him brian suddenly turns and slams 
               the neck of the extinguisher against the pole breaking it 
               off before heaving the cannister hissing into the flames 
               where it explodes  a cloud of extinguisher powder that 
               stuns the flames just long enough for brian to dash through 
               and tackle the hose

               the fire shakes off the powder rises up to kill  just as 
               brian spins and hits it with the stream

                and its like a howling train wreck as the two grapple 
               with each other  pengelly and nightengale have an opening 
               and theyre dashing for the catwalk ladder up to stephen 
               because the fire doesnt care  it only has eyes for brian 
               now 

                and stephen sees brian tackle the monster and his eyes 
               fill with tears 

                and the fires pushing brian  pushing him with the fury 
               of a frightened street bully  but brian wont give  and 
               now the fires backs broken  its whimpering dying

               and pengelly and nightengale have climbed up to stephen now 
               pulling him away

                                     stephen
                         thats my brother thats my brother 
                         goddamn it

               and the fires just a little gremlin now sighing sadly as 
               brian steps up with the hoseline

                                     brian
                         another time friend

               and whoosh its gone

               ambulance
