               this story takes place during a world series between the 
               mets and the as canseco plays for oakland and strawberry 
               is still with new york

                                         day one

                                   game three lt wins

               ext early morning  lts home  queens

               this typical queens house is sandwiched between other 
               neighboring nearly identical houses

               the morning sounds of family bickering lawn mowers and 
               shouted goodbyes are heard coming from many houses on this 
               closeknit block a new baby can be heard bawling inside 
               lts house

               lt hurried and harried stumbles out his front door he 
               heads for his car parked askew in the driveway

               lt is some 40 years old his natural swagger makes up for 
               his lack of conventional good looks he is obviously hung
               over

               lt squints pained by the sun he fumbles with his shades 
               puts them on

               lts twin eight yearold sons trundle out the front door of 
               the house bickering as they run to catch up with their daddy 
               the hefty twins wear illfitting parochial school uniforms 
               their oversize parochial school briefcases threaten to trip 
               them up

               lts wife babe in arms comes out to watch lts lovely seven 
               yearold daughter head off toward her school on foot many 
               other members of lts extended family hang out on the stoop 
               and the lawn

               as the twins cross the lawn the bickering turns physical 
               they start whacking each other with the briefcases the twins 
               pile into lts car

                                                                    cut to

               interior

               an impressive handgun is visible between the seats

               an old icon of mother mary rides on the dashboard

               as the twins get in lt tries to hide the gun and the illicit 
               detritus

               to little avail the twins pay no mind to his machinations 
               they have evidently seen it all before

               as lt drives the twins to school the three play wild rough
               house

               the car swerves crazily

                                     lt

               lt and the twins banter back and forth poke each other and 
               box around the apparent hostility of their words is balanced 
               by the laughter and gungho play of the roughhousing the 
               twins yell catcalls as they drive past a blonde pedestrian 
               lt joins in

               angle  through the windshield the parochial school comes 
               into view a crowd of uniformed kids is gathered outside

               coke snorts it he takes his gun out of hiding

               lt steers with his knees as he drives off toward the city

               english the owner is agitated and out of breath he argues 
               fiercely with two young black kids

                         the block when i caught up with them

               the korean owner is still agitated he tries to give his 
               side of the story mixing english and korean at the same 
               time 

               the two black kids plead their case they try to drown out 
               the owner it all gets rather noisy

                                     young black kid

               and the right ear of the other

               the two young black kids are stunned speechless

               the young uniformed cop rushes out of the market gun raised 
               in one hand beer can in the other hes relieved that a cop 
               wasnt shot but the whole situation makes him uneasy

                         i need to talk to him

               the owner protests wildly in korean as the flustered cop 
               ushers him into a waiting squad car they drive off

               now lt is alone with the two young black kids

               same time he whips out his badge and thrusts it into the 
               other kids face

               while he holds the toilet paper at bay a thirteen yearold 
               korean kid rises up from behind it his hands up terrified

               lt comes through the door with the sixpack of diet cokes 
               and the sixpack of budweiser

               preparing the implements for chasing the dragon

               bowtay rolls over sprawls on the floor in an even sexier 
               position

               on her face an expression of utter bliss

               ariane helps lt with the thin tin foil pipe she burns the 
               smack on the tin foil sheet for him so that he can manage to 
               inhale the plume of smoke in time

               he gets a nice deep hit

               ariane gracefully takes a hit of her own

               they are both very high already beginning to nod out

               ariane goes back to the implements and prepares another hit

               this time she catches the smoke in a sherry goblet and lt 
               drinks it

               lt is very high now a meditative hallucinatory state

               ariane takes a diet coke and lies down on the bed

               she slowly sips soda through a straw her eyes are closed

               lt sits in an easy chair by the window

               some of the dealers and street characters on the sidelines

               he heads straight for them

               lt greets an impressively beautiful six foot tall 
               transvestite he takes her aside

                                     lt

               front seat lt is obviously berserk to get the ki but he 
               cant show it lt susses out the situation

               around him police techniciantypes are busy lifting 
               fingerprints and analyzing the car and willie  to no 
               apparent avail

               lt uses his lieutenants privilege to enter the murder car 
               and begin his own investigation

               tire tracks are discovered nearby the other cops are 
               distracted

               lt takes his shot he reaches for and finds the ki of cocaine 
               under the back seat lt slips it under his coat and emerges 
               from the murder car

               outside the murder car lt makes to stand up in the act he  
               drops the bag of coke

               lt is stunned he cant believe the ki is actually in the 
               shitty gutter water in plain view of the other cops

               the cops spot the kilo of coke even those cops that were 
               far away somehow know what has happened they quickly gather 
               round the murder car lt and the ki

               the plastic bag filled with white powder floats on the deep 
               puddle

               lt is silent wrath incarnate

                         what dya know a kilo of caine

               among the gathered cops only a sergeant is not quite 
               convinced

                         where the fuck did that come from

               the other cops ignore the query

               lt walks away

               lt has successfully covered himself but he walks off cursing 
               and mumbling

               veronica is laughing demonstratively in the background

                                     lt

               signs one too many perhaps lt senses the nun is inside

               he has to open the door but hopes he wont get a blast of 
               disease in his face he crosses himself  wearing a smirk 
               but nonetheless going on instinct lt opens the door a crack

               hes right its the nun he positions himself outside the 
               door keeping it open a few inches he peeks inside without 
               being seen

                                                                    cut to

               int late night  the nuns hospital examining room

               from just outside the door lt peeptoms on the nun while 
               she is being examined he sees her stark naked laid out on 
               a table her legs spread wide apart

               the doctors nurses counselors work on the nun as if they 
               are automatons they dont grasp either the humanity or the 
               trotitism of the scene lt does the image of the alabaster 
               nun turns him on no end yet there is also a deeper pathos 
               to the scene

               and the nun is spectacularly beautiful she doesnt speak 
               looks like a pieta

               a doctor in a whitecoat reads the medical report to a female 
               cop the female cop writes down the details on a hardbacked 
               pad as if its a parking ticket

               the moving contrast between the words and the image seems to 
               be apparent to lt  and the nun  alone

                                     doctor
                              to female cop
                         they inserted a crucifix eleven 
                         centimeters into her vaginal aperture 
                         breaking the hymen membrane then 
                         they pursued the same course with 
                         their natural organs of sexual 
                         penetration they used a sharp object 
                         probably a hunting knife with a curved 
                         blade to carve a cross between her 
                         shoulder blades entering the flesh 
                         an average of nearly one centimeter 
                         throughout the area of the wound 
                         they 

               finally as if she knew he was there all along the nun looks 
               up at where lt is hiding and boldly meets his eyes

                                                                    cut to

               int very late night  arianes apartment

               lt has been there for some time they are alone theyve 
               both been drinking and coking

               lt is carrying on about the nun as he speaks about various 
               subjects his tone changes radically from contempt and 
               cynicism to profound reverence from decadence  to awe 
               ariane too manages to switch from one attitude to the other

                                     lt

               lt stubs out his cigarette on the back of his hand he does 
               the move with intensity and bravado

               ariane responds by calmly doing the same but she does it 
               entirely impassively and rubs the cigarette into her flesh 
               longer than lt did

               ariane comes over to lt and starts kissing and licking his 
               chest

                                     ariane
                         do you believe in god do you believe 
                         that jesus christ is the son of god

               lt hesitates

               ariane kneels down in front of lt as if in prayer

               she starts giving him head

               before he can answer the question he is saved by the bell 
               the phone rings lt picks up immediately its lite

               as lt speaks to lite ariane continues to give him head

               speaks she pulls away and it frustrates him this dialectic 
               continues throughout the scene

                                     ariane
                         do you believe in god

                         and he came to die for your sins

               ariane does something oc that causes lt sudden pain

               lt cries out snaps to attention looks at ariane

                                                                    cut to

               ext int dawn  the churchconvent

               lt drives up erratically and parks his car in front of the 
               churchconvent

               lt stumbles into the church alone now he notes various 
               aspects of the desecration but cant see much because hes 
               blind drunk

               the enormous graphically bloody crucifix confronts him

               he collapses immediately into a pew sleeps

               time passes

                                                                    cut to

               int morning  churchconvent

               lt wakes up ruckus all around him the cops are there in 
               force  including some of the guys from the bar the uptown 
               murder and the hospital parking lot they are privately 
               checking out the scene of the crime looking for leads that 
               will give them an advantage everyone wants the two nuns to 
               talk the nuns are in a circle of interrogators at first 
               lt cant even see them

               the elderly nun was attacked but not raped they carved 
               crosses on her

               in the background the questioning has already begun the 
               interrogators become increasingly frustrated it can be heard 
               in their voices they want the reward and  despite a 
               certain constipated respect in their attitude  the cops 
               are willing to browbeat the nuns to get it

               lt silently bums a coffee off a cop and staggers into the 
               ring

               lt hangs back in the crowd staring at the young nun as the 
               cops interrogate both nuns

                                     cop 1
                         cant you tell us anything sisters 
                         anything at all

               the elderly nun speaks up

                                     elderly nun
                         they broke my glasses i didnt see 
                         anything but i did hear them they 
                         were young and there were two of 
                         them they spoke spanish one of 
                         them was named julio

               lt on the sidelines turns to an older cop lt mutters his 
               commentary

                                     lt
                              to older cop
                         julio great there are 20000 spics 
                         named julio

               the elderly nun lowers her head shamed

                                     elderly nun
                         i would tell you more if i could i 
                         am so sorry officers

               now the cops are magnetized by the young nun she does not 
               appear to need glasses evidently she could give the cops 
               what they want

                                     cop 2
                         what about you sister wont you 
                         tell us anything

               lt watches the young nun as 

               pov lt  the young nun smiles a quiet intractable smile

               cop 2 is screaming mad but tries to hide it

               lt has observed their interaction though he would have loved 
               to have heard some information from the young nun her 
               defiance gives him even more pleasure

               the monsignor comes forward to translate the nuns stubborn 
               silence he is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition  
               this is his big chance he would like to be cardinal some 
               day but never will be he enjoys the spotlight as he 
               pontificates

                                     monsignor
                         listen one nun is nearly 80 years 
                         old im not from this church of 
                         course but i assume theyll be 
                         getting her a new pair of glasses 
                         apparently shes legally blind without 
                         them the sister who suffered a rape 
                         is just 17 she arrived from ireland 
                         only a couple of months ago this  
                         event  is just too much for them 
                         to take

               the monsignor clears his throat demonstratively takes a 
               dicitous tone

                                     monsignor
                         listen the church would like to 
                         know who did it just as much as the 
                         nypd these arrant criminals broke 
                         the laws of man and the laws of 
                         god the church wants nothing more 
                         than to see them behind bars thats 
                         why were offering the 50000 reward 
                         to whomever brings them in im sure 
                         our hero will be one of new yorks 
                         finest

               the young nun shoots the monsignor an offended look

               it appears for a moment as if the young nun makes eye contact 
               with lt but he cant be sure

               lt leaves the crowd disappears out the door

                                                                    cut to

               from the pristine interior of the white church we 

                                                               hard cut to

               int afternoon — the churchconvent

               the interior of the churchconvent is still desecrated in 
               stark contrast to the white church above scene 22

               police ropes have cordoned off certain desecrated areas of 
               the church in other places mops and sloppy buckets of shit 
               water wait for someone to finish cleaning up

               lt appears to be entirely alone in the church he is desperate 
               for clues he searches for leads and perhaps for something 
               else

               cu  he lights a candle gives a quarter 

               then lt lights his crackpipe ever the flame

               suddenly the nun appears

               lt hides watches as the nun enters the confessional once 
               she is ensconced inside lt stealthly approaches the 
               confessional and from right outside  a tantalizing proximity  
               he listens as she confesses to the priest this is an elderly 
               priest with a striking unusual voice not the monsignor 
               from the cops interrogation of the nuns scene 20

                                     nun
                         forgive me father for i have sinned 
                         it has been two days since my last 
                         confession father my sin is a 
                         terrible sin a sin of omission 
                         there was another sin that happened 
                         at the same time and in the same 
                         place but my sin i think was graver 
                         stil

                                     priest
                         sister we all know what happened to 
                         you yesterday morning i expected 
                         that you would want to speak to me 
                         about it but you could have come to 
                         my office your being here in the 
                         confessional implies that you 
                         sister have done something wrong 
                         you havent i assure you i feared 
                         you might have misplaced feelings of 
                         guilt if you condemn yourself because 
                         you experienced feelings of 
                         curiosity or even pleasure you 
                         mustnt 

               the nun laughs at first it sounds like crying but it is a 
               strange low laughter

                                     nun
                         father if it was so trivial so 
                         natural so  no i have sinned 
                         and you must listen if you are to 
                         prescribe an appropriate act of 
                         contrition and to absolve me father 
                         what would you do if you had but one 
                         day in which to use your arms to 
                         serve god

                                     priest
                         its funny you knew but the first 
                         thing i think of is kneading the 
                         bread that i help bake for the soup 
                         kitchen maybe thats because my the 
                         muscles in my arms still hurt

                                     nun
                         i also thought of that bread father 
                         and of that night six days ago when 
                         the mother superior died and i kept 
                         the cool damp cloth on her forehead 
                         freshly moist father what would 
                         you do if you had but one day in 
                         which to use your legs to serve god

                                     priest
                         i think of running for help and 
                         falling to my knees in prayer

                                     nun
                         as i have prayed day and night since 
                         the desecration of this church 
                         yesterday morning  and my sin you 
                         see father 

                                     priest
                         yes sister

                                     nun
                         yesterday morning god gave me but 
                         one chance to use something else to 
                         serve him not my arms or my legs 
                         but something i used for the first 
                         time for the last time and will 
                         never use again my vagina

               outside the confessional lt reacts to the explicit word 
               shock titillation and fascination

                                     nun
                         those boys those sad raging boys 
                         they came to me as the needy do and 
                         like many of the needy they were 
                         rude like all the needy they took 
                         and like all the needy they needed

                         schoolyard and they are good boys

                                     priest
                         you knew them

               outside the confessional lt stiffens this could be the

                         i could tell you their names now

                         vow to keep my secret but i cannot 
                         tell you their names for i too am 
                         bound as i am bound now to confess 
                         my sins so listen father listen
                              beat
                         i am a nun what did i give those 
                         boys that they could not have found 
                         elsewhere nothing nothing at all 
                         there were always two of us in the 
                         act the act was half my own it 
                         does not seem to me the act was half 
                         the act of a once of christ
                              beat
                         it is the lost chance that will remain 
                         on the ledger of my sins not the 
                         loss of my virginity the rape forced 
                         upon me a choice as a vessel of the 
                         spirit i could have imbued my vagina 
                         with god or i could have turned 
                         away from god and voided my body of 
                         spirit so that all that was left 
                         for those boys was a lump of flesh 
                         i chose the second path the easier 
                         path the path of the material world 
                         the path no nun has the right to 
                         take and so i sinned
                              beat
                         my vagina spread but spread no word 
                         it opened on nothingness it gave 
                         nothing at all and left nothing 
                         behind no trace of my act yes my 
                         act for i was there too remains 
                         in the landscape of god

               the nuns description of the rape is both a turn on for lt 
               and a matter of profound curiosity something divine his 
               silent reactions embody both decadence and awe this apparent 
               paradox can find unified expression in his character though 
               at other moments it threatens to tear him apart the tension 
               between the two polarities will propel him toward his destiny

                         sperm  hatred to love and maybe 
                         to have saved their souls they did

                         him i ought to have surprised those 
                         boys instead they surprised me 
                         and got no surprise at all no they 
                         did not rape a nun but a nun has 
                         been raped and the nun must now 
                         atone for her sin for a godgiven 
                         part of her was wasted a part which 
                         other women use for procreation for 
                         conjugal fulfillment for expressions 
                         of love i had but one chance and i 
                         did nothing but react in pain

                         when those boys placed their hands 
                         upon my breasts they had nothing 
                         but an assortment of skin cells in 
                         their grasp they ought to have felt 
                         through me the bosom of their 
                         redeemer when they lay on top of me 
                         and looked down into my eyes they 
                         saw fear they should have met the 
                         eyes of a lover and felt the presence 
                         of the prince of peace

                         two boys whose prayer was more 
                         legible more poignant more 
                         anguished two young men who threw 
                         themselves upon the altar and took 
                         me with them and i did nothing for 
                         them i can only hope that someone 
                         will

               lt cant help but start up as if telepathically the nun 
               knew he was there and cried out to him asked him to complete 
               her mission

               lt senses the confession is over as the priest begins to

               out of the vip room

               appears out of the kitchen

               bowtay sits down near by awaiting her dose

               ariane starts preparing the dose shes got all the 
               paraphernalia spoon cotton a candle flame etc

                                     ariane

               lets ariane shoot him up with the potent mixture of cocaine 
               and heroin

               ariane shoots up bowtay next

               they do it on the bed exploiting all possible erotic 
               connotations

               sneaks to the window hears noises that arent there

               then he flips and becomes crazybold opens the drapes 
               sticks his head out the window waves his gun at specters

               then he becomes shitscared again his behavior is lunatic

               random getting really desperate he shows people the chalice 
               asks them if theyve seen it before no one has

               lt plays both addict and cop as it suits his needs by now 
               he looks more like a homeless man than anything else but 
               none of his playacting or lethal threats get him anywhere

               the game is everywhere and the mets are still losing

               finally lt approaches a hustling street dealer he cops 
               the street dealer is wearing a walkman so the deal goes 
               down in mime

               now lt speaks and wants to be heard

                         around

               the street dealer uses his walkman and the resulting 
               deafness to excuse his total lack of response

               lt starts mouthing words silently at the street dealer no 
               response then he  silently  begins to shout

               the street dealers alarmed that he seemingly cant hear at 
               all above the walkman music he moves the walkman away from 
               his ears but doesnt take it off

                                     street dealer

                         looked just like yours and you look 
                         something like my uncle but one day 
                         he was standing in a puddle  the 
                         puddle locked just like that one 

               lt points to a puddle in which the street dealer is now

                         and he got electrocuted

               the street dealer tries to consider what this crazy guy has 
               just told him but before the street dealer can even react 
               lt leans in on him shows his gun and then his badge

               the street dealer answers with absolute ease that was all
