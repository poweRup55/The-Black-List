                         we planned a huge network of tunnels

                         order of business every morning was 
                         to decide on a new password for the

                         of the logs i thought at once of

               kit is fishing with his crude net he stops briefly to watch 
               a truck passing down the highway in the distance then goes 
               back to work

               this stretch of river seems dangerously close to civilization

                         for days afterward i lived in dread 
                         at times i wished i could fall asleep 
                         and be taken off to some magical 
                         land but this never happened

               kit frustrated draws his pistol from his back pocket and 
               looks around for the fish that has been eluding him he does 
               not see as we do a man watching him from across the river 
               he fires at the fish misses it and fires again the man 
               across the river hesitates then moves back into the 
               undergrowth

                                                               dissolve to

               holly is off somewhere in the forest putting on lipstick 
               kit sits on watch in the crows nest a pair of binoculars 
               close at hand on sound over the music we hear voices 
               whispering to them kit sees a movement in the brush a moment 
               later a figure appears a hunter carrying a gun kit shouts 
               a code word to holly she takes off running as kit clambers 
               down the planks of the treehouse and collects his shotgun 
               he tells her to hide runs through the woods and dives in a 
               hole under a cover of leaves she jumps behind a log

               several shots of the still forest follow then the hunters 
               appear a shoulder here pant leg there the music ends as 
               one of them cocks his gun they pass right over the hole 
               where kit is hiding kit rises up slowly gives them a 
               gentlemanly word of warning then shoots all three in the 
               back he checks to see if anybody else is with them then 
               calls weakly out to holly

               he climbs a ladder looks in the cabin of the treehouse to 
               see if theyve left anything behind then jumps down he 
               flips over the wicker hemisphere that covers their rooster 
               the rooster walks off free he surveys the woods then looks 
               back at holly who returns his look and gets in the car

                         come in like that and they wouldve 
                         played it as down and dirty as they 
                         could and besides hed overheard

                         only interested in the reward money

               two shots down through a seam into the cellar he retreats 
               to hollys side a little surprised at what he did

                                     kit

               storm is gathering on the horizon kit offers holly his hand 
               as they run but holly does not see this

               int catos bedroom

               cato lies motionless on his bed holly steps forward and 
               touches him with a yardstick like a child touching a snake

               with cato over his shoulder he steers for a nearby box car 
               that evidently served cato as a shed

                                     holly vo
                         kit was the most trigger happy person 
                         id ever met he claimed that as 
                         long as youre playing for keeps and 
                         the law is coming at you its 
                         considered okay to shoot all 
                         witnesses you had to take the 
                         consequences though and not whine 
                         about it later

               kit opens the doors of the box car and dumps cato inside 
               before closing the doors he checks catos shoes to see if 
               they are the ones he gave him holly looks on from the side 
               of the house twenty yards away

                              shrugging
                         just to keep him out of the sun

               kit heads out of sight around the rear of the box car holly 
               goes back inside kit walks up and down the length of the 
               box car talking under his breath and throwing his rifle 
               from hand to hand in a state

                                                               dissolve to

               onto the corner of a piano she thinks better of this and 
               restores the bust to its original position

               kit sniffs at a glass of sherry then takes a picture off 
               the mantel and studies it

               holly at the other end of the room tests the comforts of a 
               chair

               this done she moves to another chair and tests it too she 
               makes her hand limp she watches it swing back and forth

               kit sits in the chair which the rich man occupied earlier 
               he has a thoughtful look on his face there is a dictaphone 
               on the table beside him

               int hallway

               holly takes a cane out of the umbrella rack looks around 
               furtively then steps out a side door of the house

                         day was quiet and serene but i didnt 
                         notice for i was deep in thought 
                         and not even thinking about how to 
                         slip off

               across the way she can see a long driveway with a border of 
               lush greenery and a sleepy cat standing in the sun

                                     holly vo

                         thought what a fine place it was 
                         full of things for people to look

                         understand the viewpoint of others 
                         consider the minority opinion but 
                         try to get along with the majority 
                         opinion once its accepted

               suggesting that for some purpose known only to the family

               have a hard time just keeping track of him he checks his 
               own appearance and general demeanor in the rear view mirror 
               then swerves off the road onto the prairie the police manage 
               to keep up together they roar through a herd of cows and 
               barb wire fence the police car slams into kit trying to 
               slow him down kit slams back into the police car they return 
               to the road kit makes a ninetydegree turn but the police 
               car loses traction and rolls onto its side then back onto 
               four wheels again stalled kit sees that he has lost them 
               he checks himself out in the mirror again puts on the rich 
               mans hat and skids to a stop the police car gets back 
               underway during these last few moments holly is heard on

                         through kits head before they got 
                         him and why he didnt make a run for 
                         it while he still had the chance 
                         did he figure theyld just catch up 
                         with him the next day was it despair 
                         he claimed to having a flat tire 
                         but the way he carried on about it 
                         i suspect this is false

               collecting rocks from the shoulder as the police approach 
               from the distance he makes a stack of the rocks to mark the 
               site of his capture for posterity finishing just as the 
               police car skids to a stop kit throws up his hands and walks
