	departed saint

ext  street  day

mother and son walking together

			roderick vo
	my mother was the most beautiful
	women of her day  but if she was

	handsomest fellow in the world

ext  church  day

mother and son entering church

	the good souls pleasure was to
	dress me and on sundays and

	coat with a silverhilted sword by

	knee as fine as any lord in the
	land  as we walked to church on
	sundays even the most envious souls
	would allow that there was not a
	prettier pair in the kingdom

ext  field  day

a sprawling rundown irish manor house with large garden
stables barn and farm

idealized images of dorothy

			roderick vo
	ah  that first affair how well one
	remembers it  what a noble
	discovery it is that the boy makes
	when he finds himself actually and
	truly in love with some one  a lady
	who is skilled in dancing or singing
	never can perfect herself without a
	deal of study in private  so it is
	with the dear creatures who are
	skilled in coquetting  dorothy for
	instance was always practicing and
	she would take poor me to rehearse
	her accomplishments upon

dorothy talking with the exciseman

			roderick vo
	 or the exciseman when he came
	his rounds

dorothy talking to the steward

	 or the young apothecarys lad
	from dugans town whom i recollect
	beating once for that very reason

roderick fighting with apothecarys lad

			roderick vo
	the torments of jealousy she made me
	endure were horrible

ext  field  day

dorothy like a greyhound released from days of
confinement and given the freedom of the fields at last
runs at topspeed left and right back and forth
returning every moment to roderick

she runs and runs until she is out of breath and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps roderick motionless
and staring at her

after catching her breath and wiping her forehead she
challenges roderick to a race

			roderick
	i accept but i insist on a wager
	the loser must do whatever the
	winner pleases

			dorothy
	agreed

			roderick
	do you see the gate at the end of
	the field  the first to touch it
	will be the winner

they line up together and start on a count of three
dorothy uses all her strength but roderick holds back
and dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him

			roderick vo
	i was certain to win but i meant to
	lose to see what she would order me
	to do

dorothy catches her breath thinking of the penalty  then
she goes behind the trees and a few second later comes
out and says

			dorothy
	your penalty is to find a cherry
	colored ribbon which i have hidden
	somewhere on my person  you are
	free to look for it anywhere you
	will and i will think very little
	of you if you do not find it

they sit down on the grass  roderick searches her
pockets the fold of her short bodice and her skirt then
her shoes then he turns up her skirt slowly and
circumspectly as high as her garters which she wears
upon the knee  he unfastens them and finds nothing he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits  the
tickling makes her laugh

			roderick
	i feel the ribbon

			dorothy
	then you must get it

roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts over which his hand must pass to reach it

			dorothy
	why are you shaking

			roderick
	with pleasure at finding the ribbon

ext  field  day

military review  one hundred english troops a few
mounted officers a small military band fifty local
people

the dugan family roderick and his mother captains best
and grogan

roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms

			roderick vo
	about this time the united kingdom
	was in a state of great excitement
	from the threat generally credited
	of a french invasion  the noblemen
	and people of condition in that and
	all other parts of the kingdom
	showed their loyalty by raising
	regiments of horse and foot to
	resist the invaders  how i envied
	them  the whole country was alive
	with wars alarums the three
	kingdoms ringing with military
	music while poor i was obliged to
	stay at home in my fustian jacket
	and sigh for fame in secret

int  ballroom at fencibles  night

dorothy and roderick entering

			roderick vo
	once the officers of the kilwangen
	regiment gave a grand ball to which
	dorothy persuaded my to take her

several cuts depicting the evening

dorothy ignores roderick dances chats laughs drinks
punch and finally strolls outside with captain best

roderick makes a halfhearted try at dancing with miss
clancy

			roderick vo
	i have endured torments in my life
	but none like that  some of the
	prettiest girls there offered to
	console me for i was the best
	dancer in the room but i was too
	wretched and so remained alone all
	night in a state of agony  i did
	not care for drink or know the
	dreadful comfort of it in those
	days but i thought of killing
	myself and dorothy and most
	certainly of making away with
	captain best

ext  fencibles ballroom  dawn

the guests leaving and saying their goodbyes

			roderick vo
	at last and at morning the ball
	was over

ext  road  dawn

dorothy and roderick on horseback together

			dorothy
	sure its a bitter night roderick
	dear and youll catch cold without
	a handkerchief to your neck

to this sympathetic remark from the pillion the saddle
made no reply

			dorothy
	did you and miss clancy have a
	pleasant evening roderick  you
	were together i saw all night

to this the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth
and giving a lash to daisy

			dorothy
	oh  mercy you make daisy rear and
	throw me you careless creature
	you

the pillion had by this got her arm around the saddles
waist and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world

			roderick
	i hate miss clancy you know i do
	and i only danced with her because
	 because  the person with whom i
	intended to dance chose to be
	engaged the whole night

			dorothy
	i had not been in the room five
	minutes before i was engaged for
	every single set

			roderick
	were you obliged to dance five times
	with captain best and then stroll
	out with him into the garden

			dorothy
	i dont care a fig for captain best
	he dances prettily to be sure and
	is a pleasant rattle of a man  he
	looks well in his regimentals too
	and if he chose to ask me to dance
	how could i refuse him

			roderick
	but you refused me dorothy

			dorothy
	oh  i can dance with you any day
	and to dance with your own cousin at
	a ball as if you could find no other
	partner  besides roderick captain
	bests a man and you are only a
	boy and you havent a guinea in the
	world

			roderick
	if ever i meet him again you shall
	see which is the best man of the
	two  ill fight him with sword or
	with pistol captain as he is

			dorothy
	but captain best is already known as
	a valiant soldier and is famous as
	a man of fashion in london  it is
	mighty well of you to fight farmers
	boys but to fight an englishman is
	a very different matter

roderick falls silent

ext  small bridge over a stream  dawn

they come to an old high bridge over a stream
sufficiently deep and rocky

			dorothy
	suppose now roderick you who are
	such a hero was passing over the
	bridge and the enemy on the other
	side

			roderick
	id draw my sword and cut my way
	through them

			dorothy
	what with me on the pillion  would
	you kill poor me

			roderick
	well then ill tell you what id
	do  id jump daisy into the river
	and swim you both across where no
	enemy could follow us

			dorothy
	jump twenty feet  you wouldnt dare
	to do any such thing on daisy
	theres the captains horse black
	george ive heard say that captain
	bes 

she never finished the word for maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable roderick shouts

			roderick
	hold tight to my waist

and giving daisy the spur springs with dorothy over the
parapet into the deeper water below

the horses head sinks under the girl screams as she
sinks and screams as she rises

roderick lands her halffainting on the shore

int  mothers house  bedroom  day

various cuts showing illness and convalescence

roderick feverish  the doctor taking his pulse

mother brings a tray of food

			roderick vo
	i went home and was ill speedily of
	a fever which kept me to my bed for
	a week

dorothy visiting him

			roderick vo
	dorothy visited me only once but i
	quitted my couch still more
	violently in love than i had been
	ever before

ext  dugan manor house  day

the air is fresh and bright and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees  roderick is elated and springs
down the road as brisk as a young fawn

he encounters an orderly whistling roast beef of old
england as he cleans down a cavalry horse

			roderick
	whose horse fellow is that

			orderly
	feller indeed  the horse belongs
	to my captain and hes a better
	fellow nor you any day

			roderick vo
	i did not stop to break his bones
	as i would on another occasion for
	a horrible suspicion had come across
	me and i made for the garden as
	quickly as i could

roderick see captain best and dorothy pacing the path
together  her arm is under his and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm

some distance beyond them is captain grogan who is paying
court to dorothys sister mysie

			roderick vo
	the fact is that during the week of
	my illness no other than captain
	best was staying at castle dugan
	and making love to miss dorothy in
	form

			captain best
	no dorothy except for you and four
	others i vow before all the gods
	my heart had never felt the soft
	flame

			dorothy
	ah you men you men john your
	passion is not equal to ours  we
	are like  like some plant ive
	read of  we bear but one flower
	and then we die

			captain best
	do you mean you never felt an
	inclination for another

			dorothy
	never my john but for thee  how
	can you ask me such a question

raising her hand to his lips

			captain best
	darling dorothea

roderick rushes into view drawing his little sword

			roderick vo
	i pulled out a knot of cherry
	colored ribbons which she had given
	me out of her breast and which
	somehow i always wore upon me and
	flung them in captain bests face
	and rushed out with my little sword
	drawn

			roderick
	shes a liar  shes a liar
	captain best  draw sir and defend
	yourself if you are a man

roderick leaps at captain best and collars him while
dorothy makes the air echo with her screams

captain grogan and mysie hasten up

though roderick is a full growth of six feet he is small
by the side of the enormous english captain

best turns very red at the attack upon him and slips back
clutching at his sword

dorothy in an agony of terror flings herself round him
screaming

			dorothy
	captain best for heavens sake
	spare the child  he is but an
	infant

			captain best
	and ought to be whipped for his
	impudence but never fear miss
	dugan i shall not touch him your
	favorite is safe from me

so saying he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons which roderick had flung at dorothys feet and
handing it to her says in a sarcastic tone

			captain best
	when ladies make presents to
	gentlemen it is time for other
	gentlemen to retire

			dorothy
	good heavens best  he is but a boy
	and dont signify any more than my
	parrot or lapdog  maynt i give a
	bit of ribbon to my own cousin

			roderick
		   roaring
	im a man and will prove it

			captain best
	you are perfectly welcome miss as
	many yards as you like

			dorothy
	monster  your father was a tailor
	and you are always thinking of the
	shop  but ill have my revenge i
	will  roddy will you see me
	insulted

			roderick
	indeed miss dorothy i intend to
	have his blood as sure as my names
	roderick

			captain best
	ill send for the usher to cane you
	little boy but as for you miss i
	have the honor to wish you a good
	day

best takes off his hat with much ceremony and makes a low
bow and is just walking off when michael rodericks
cousin comes up whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream

			michael
	hoitytoity  john best whats the
	matter here

			captain best
	ill tell you what it is mr dugan
	i have had enough of miss dugan here
	and your irish ways  i aint used
	to em sir

			michael
		   goodhumoredly
	well well  what is it  well make
	you used to our ways or adopt
	english ones

			captain best
	its not the english way for ladies
	to have two lovers and so mr
	dugan ill thank you to pay me the
	sum you owe me and i resign all
	claims to this young lady  if she
	has a fancy for schoolboys let her
	take em sir

			michael
	pooh  pooh  best you are joking

			captain best
	i never was more in earnest

best exits

			michael
		   in a towering rage
	you  you  hang you for a meddling
	brat your hand is in everybodys
	pie  what business had you to come
	brawling and quarreling here with
	a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
	ayear

michael runs after best

			dorothy
		   gasps
	oh i shall die i know i shall  i
	shall never leave this spot

			captain grogan
		   whisper to dorothy
	the captain is gone

dorothy giving him an indignant look jumps up and walks
towards the house

			captain grogan
		   in a soothing tone
		    to roderick
	this is a pretty way to recommend
	yourself to the family

			roderick
		   shouts after
		    michael
	the man that marries dorothy dugan
	must first kill me  do you mind
	that

			michael
		   shouting back from
		    a distance
	pooh sir  kill you  flog you
	you mean  ill send for nick the
	huntsman to do it

			captain grogan
	you are a gallant lad and i like
	your spirit  but what dugan says is
	true  its a hard thing to give a
	lad counsel who is in such a far
	gone state as you but believe me
	i know the world and if you will
	but follow my advice you wont
	regret having taken it  dorothy
	dugan has not a penny you are not a
	whit richer  and my poor boy
	dont you see  though its a hard
	matter to see  that shes a flirt
	and does not care a pin for you or
	best either

			roderick
	dorothy might love me or not as she
	likes but best will have to fight
	me before he marries her

			captain grogan
	faith i think you are a lad thats
	likely to keep your word

he looks hard at roderick for a second to two then he
walks away humming a tune looking back at roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden

when grogan is gone roderick is quite alone and he
flings himself down on the bench where dorothy had made
believe to faint and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and taking them up hides his face in them and
bursts into a passion of tears

			roderick vo
	i must have sat for some hours
	bemoaning myself on the gardenbench
	for the dinnerbell clanged as usual
	at three oclock which wakened me
	from my reverie

ext  dugan manor house  day

as roderick passes the courtyard he sees the captains
saddle still hanging up at the stabledoor and his odious
redcoated brute of a servant swaggering with the
sculliongirls and kitchen people

			maid
	the englishmans still there master
	roderick  hes there in the parlor
	go in and dont let im browbeat
	you master roderick

int  dugan manor house  dining room  day

roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table the butler speedily brings him a cover

			uncle
	hello roddy my boy  up and well
	thats right

			aunt
	hed better be home with his mother

			uncle
	dont mind her  its the cold goose
	she ate for breakfast  didnt
	agree with her  take a glass of
	spirits mrs dugan to rodericks
	health

it is evident that his uncle doesnt know of what
happened but michael who is at dinner too and harry
and almost all the girls look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish and miss dorothy who is again by his
side ready to cry  captain grogan sits smiling and
roderick looks on as cold as stone

his uncle is in high goodhumor

			uncle
	dorothy divide that merry thought
	with the captain  see wholl be
	married first  jack best my dear
	boy never mind a clean glass for
	the claret were short of crystal
	at castle dugan take dorothys and

	face this morning captain john
	best hes already been called a
	coward captain john best and this
	is the way ill drink his health
	heres your health captain john
	best

roderick flings a glass of claret into his face  the next
moment he is under the table tripped up by harry who
hits him a violent cuff on the head as he goes down he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him being so fully
occupied with kicks and thumps and curses with which
harry is belaboring him

			harry
	you fool  you great blundering
	marplot  you silly beggarly
	brat 
		   a thump at each
	hold your tongue

when roderick gets up from under the table the ladies are
all gone but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captains nose is bleeding as his is  best is cut
across the bridge and his beauty spoiled forever

			uncle
	in heavens name what does all the
	row mean  is the boy in fever
	again

			harry
		   turning to his
		    father
	the fact is sir that the young
	monkey has fallen in love with
	dorothy and finding her and the
	captain mighty sweet in the garden
	today he was for murdering jack
	best

			captain best
		   bristling up

	of property and i  i 

			harry
	if youre insulted and not
	satisfied remember theres two of

on which the captain falls to washing his nose in water
and answering never a word

			roderick
		   in dignified tone
	mr best may also have satisfaction
	any time he pleases by calling on
	roderick james esquire of
	jamesville

his uncle bursts out laughing and in this laugh captain
grogan joins

			roderick
	captain grogan i beg you to
	understand that for my cousin
	harry who has been my best friend
	through life i could put up with
	rough treatment from him yet even
	that sort of treatment i will bear

	that fact very well and if hes
	man hell know where to find me

			uncle

	thereby a kind friend  but we dont
	know what is in store for us and
	thats a blessing

ext  house  late day

mother greeting roderick and captain grogan

			roderick vo
	in spite of my precautions to
	secrecy i halfsuspected that my
	mother knew all from the manner in
	which she embraced me on my arrival
	and received our guest captain
	grogan

his mother looks a little anxious and flushed and every
now and then gazes very hard into the captains face

			roderick vo
	but she would not say a word about
	the quarrel for she had a noble
	spirit and would as lief have seen
	any one of her kindred hanged as
	shirking from the field of honor

int  mothers house  rodericks bedroom  day

roderick waking up

			roderick vo
	i never slept sounder in my life
	though i woke a little earlier than
	usual and you may be sure my first
	thought was of the event of the day
	for which i was fully prepared

roderick at table with paper and ink

			roderick vo
	and now i sat down and wrote a
	couple of letters they might be the
	last thought i that i should ever
	write in my life

see him write  dearest mother

int  mothers house  kitchen  day

			roderick vo
	then i went down to breakfast where
	my mother was waiting for me you
	may be sure  we did not say a
	single word about what was taking
	place

roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite but in
helping himself to salt spills it on which his mother
starts up with a scream

			mother
	thank god its fallen towards me

and then her heart being too full she leaves the room

			roderick vo
	ah  they have their faults those
	mothers but are there any other
	women like them

there is an elegant silvermounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of rodericks late
father

a pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture

roderick takes down the sword and pistols which are
bright and welloiled and collects flints balls and
gunpowder

ext  mothers house  day

captain grogan and orderly arrive

			roderick
	have you taken my message to him

			captain grogan
	the meeting is arranged  captain
	best is waiting for you now

			roderick
	my mare is saddled and ready whos
	the captains second

			captain grogan
	your cousins go out with him

roderick and grogan and the orderly ride off

			roderick vo
	i didnt take leave of mrs james
	the curtains of her bedroomwindows
	were down and they didnt move as
	we mounted and trotted off

ext  country road  day

they ride their horses at a leisurely pace

			captain grogan
	thats a very handsome sword you
	have there

			roderick
	it was with this sword that my late
	father harry james god rest his
	soul met sir huddelstone
	fuddelstone the hampshire baronet
	and was fatally run through the
	neck  he was quite in the wrong
	having insulted lady fuddelstone
	when in liquor at the brentford

other gentlemen

			captain grogan
	i have just explained to mister
	james that captain best is lame and
	that swords are impossible

			harry

captain best takes off his hat and turns extremely red

			harry
	they are all right never fear

	round

			captain grogan
	roderick fire at his neck  hit
	him there under the gorget see how
	the fool shows himself open

michael who has not spoken a word harry and the captain
retire to one side and harry gives the signal

it is slowly given and roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well

captain best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given

at three both pistols go off  best gives a most
horrible groan staggers backwards and falls

			the seconds
		   crying out
	hes down  hes down

running towards him harry lifts him up  michael takes
his head

			michael
	hes hit here in the neck

laying open his coat blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget

			harry
	how is it with you

the unfortunate man does not answer but when the support
of harrys arm is withdrawn from his back groans once
more and falls backwards

			michael
		   with a scowl
	the young fellow has begun well
	you had better ride off young sir
	before the police are up  they had
	wind of the business before we left
	kilwangan

			roderick
	is he quite dead

			michael
	quite dead

			captain grogan
	then the worlds rid of a coward
	its all over with him roddy  he
	doesnt stir

he gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot

			harry
	we are not cowards grogan whatever
	he was  lets get the boy off as
	quick as we may  your man shall go
	for a cart and take away the body
	of this unhappy gentleman  this has
	been a sad days work for our

	robbed us of fifteenhundred ayear

			roderick
	it was dorothy did it

roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat and the letter and flings them down on the
body of captain best

			roderick

			michael
	and now in heavens name get the
	youngster out of the way

they mount up and gallop off

ext  mothers house  day

upon seeing roderick and harry ride up his mother who
has been waiting outside rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy  he dismounts and she kisses and embraces
him

			roderick vo
	i need not tell you how great was my
	mothers pride and exultation when
	she heard from harrys lips the
	account of my behavior at the duel

int  mothers house  parlor  day

still much excitement and hustle and bustle

			harry
	the boy must go into hiding for a
	short time anyway  dublin is the
	best place for him to go and there
	wait until matters are blown over

			mother
	dublin  but the poor lad has never
	been away from home  he will be as
	safe here as in dublin

			harry
	i wish that were true auntie dear
	but im afraid the bailiffs may
	already be on their way from
	kilwangan

int  rodericks bedroom  day

his mother is rushing about and packing a valise  harry
sits on the bed

			roderick vo
	harry persisted in the necessity of
	instant departure in which
	argument as i was anxious to see
	the world i must confess i sided
	with him and my mother was brought
	to see that in our small house in
	the midst of a village escape would
	be impossible and capture would be
	impossible to avoid

int  mothers bedroom  day

his mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire and
gives roderick twenty golden guineas

			mother
		   gravely
	roderick my darling my wild boy i
	have forebodings that our separation
	is to be a long one  i spent most
	of all night consulting the cards
	regarding your fate in the duel and
	all signs betoke a separation  here
	is twenty guineas  all that i have
	in the world  and i want you to
	keep your fathers sword and
	pistols which you have known to use
	so like a man

ext  mothers house  day

rodericks departure

			roderick vo
	she hurried my departure now though
	her heart i know was full and
	almost in halfanhour from my
	arrival at home i was once more on
	the road again with the wide world
	as it were before me

roderick waves  his mother cries

ext  high road to dublin  day

			roderick vo
	no lad of seventeen is very sad who
	has liberty for the first time and
	twenty guineas in his pocket and i
	rode away thinking i confess not
	so much of the kind of mother left
	alone and of the home behind me as
	of tomorrow and all the wonders it
	would bring

roderick happily riding down the road

			roderick vo
	i had no doubts of the future
	thinking that a man of my person
	parts and courage could make his
	way anywhere  so i rode on singing
	to myself or chatting with the
	passersby and all the girls along
	the road said god save me for a
	clever gentleman

farm girls in the fields flirting with him

			roderick vo
	as for thoughts of dorothy dugan
	there seemed to be a gap of a half
	ascore of years

ext  road to dublin  day

a wellarmed gentleman dressed in green and a gold cord
with a patch on his eye and riding a powerful mare puts
his horse alongside

			armed gentleman
	good day to you young sir

			roderick
	good morning

			armed gentleman
	where are you bound for

			roderick
		   after a long look at
		    his companion
	that is none of your business

			armed gentleman
	is your mother not afraid on account
	of the highwayman to let one so
	young as you travel

			roderick
		   pulling out a
		    pistol
	not at all sir  i have a pair of
	good pistols that have already done
	execution and are ready to do it
	again

at this a pockmarked man coming up the wellarmed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare and leaves roderick

ext  road to dublin  day

			roderick vo
	a little later on as i rode towards
	kilcullen i saw a crowd of peasant
	people assembled round a onehorse
	chair and my friend in green as i
	thought making off halfamile up
	the hill

a footman howls at the top of his voice

			footman
	stop thief

but the country fellows only laugh at his distress and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen

			country fellow 1
	sure you might have kept him off
	with your blunderbush

			country fellow 2
	o the coward  to let the captain
	bate you and he only one eye

			country fellow 3
	the next time my lady travels shed
	better leave you at home

			roderick
	what is this noise fellows

roderick rides up amongst them and seeing the lady in the
carriage very pale and frightened gives a slash of his
whip and bids the redshanked ruffians keep off

pulling off his hat and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chairwindow

			roderick
	what has happened madam to annoy
	your ladyship

			mrs oreilly
	oh i am grateful to you sir  i am
	the wife of captain oreilly
	hastening to join him at dublin  my
	chair was stopped by a highwayman
	this great oaf of a servantman fell
	down on his knees armed as he was
	and though there were thirty people
	in the next field working when the
	ruffian attacked not one of them
	would help but on the contrary
	wished him good luck

			country fellow 1
	sure hes the friend of the poor
	and good luck to him

			country fellow 2
	was it any business of ours

			roderick
		   shouting
	be off to your work you pack of
	rascals or you will have a good
	taste of my thong
		   to mrs oreilly
	have you lost much

			mrs oreilly
	everything  my purse containing
	upwards of a hundred guineas my
	jewels my snuffboxes watches
	and all because this blundering
	coward fell to his knees

			footman
	be fair maam them wasnt so much
	didnt he return you the thirteen
	pence in copper and the watch
	saying it was only pinchbeck

			mrs oreilly
	dont be insolent or ill report
	you to the captain

			footman
	sorry maam

he shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the captain has vanished

			mrs oreilly
	that fool didnt know what was the
	meaning of a hundredpound bill
	which was in the pocketbook that
	the fellow took from me

			roderick
	i am riding to dublin myself and if
	your ladyship will allow me the
	honor of riding with you i shall do
	my best to protect you from further
	mishap

			mrs oreilly
	but i shouldnt like to put you to
	such trouble mister

			roderick
	ohiggins mohawk ohiggins

ext  roadside inn  day

they stop at the inn

			roderick
		   very gallantly
	as you have been robbed of your
	purse may i have permission to lend
	your ladyship a couple of pieces to
	pay any expenses which you might
	incur before reaching your home

			mrs oreilly
		   smiling
	thats very kind of you mr
	ohiggins

he gives her two gold pieces

int  inn  day

roderick and mrs oreilly finishing their meal

we will hear dialogue underneath rodericks voice over

			roderick vo
	how different was her lively rattle
	to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan
	assemblies  in every sentence she
	mentioned a lord or a person of
	quality  to the ladys question
	about my birth and parentage i
	replied that i was a young gentleman
	of large fortune that i was going
	to dublin for my studies and that
	my mother allowed me five hundred
	per annum

			mrs oreilly
	you must be very cautious with
	regard to the company you should
	meet in dublin where rogues and
	adventurers of all countries abound
	i hope you will do me the honor of
	accepting lodgings in my own house
	where captain oreilly will welcome
	with delight my gallant young
	preserver

paying the bill

			roderick vo
	perhaps had i been a little older in
	the worlds experience i should
	have begun to see that madame
	oreilly was not the person of
	fashion she pretended to be but as
	it was i took all her stories for
	truth and when the landlord
	brought the bill for dinner paid it
	with the air of a lord  indeed she
	made no motion to produce the two
	pieces i had lent her

ext  dublin  street  night

they ride by

			roderick vo
	and so we rode on slowly towards
	dublin into which city we made our
	entrance at nightfall  the rattle
	and splendor of the coaches the
	flare of the linkboys the number
	and magnificence of the houses
	struck me with the greatest wonder
	though i was careful to disguise
	this feeling

ext  oreilly house  dublin  night

			roderick vo
	we stopped at length at a house of
	rather mean appearance and were let
	into a passage which had a great
	smell of supper and punch

int  oreilly house  dining room  night

captain oreilly a stout redfaced man without a
periwig and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap
roderick and mrs oreilly

			captain oreilly
	mr ohiggins i cannot say how
	grateful i am for your timely
	assistance to my wife

			roderick
	i am only sorry that i was unable to
	prevent the villain from carrying
	off all her ladyships money and
	pearls

			captain oreilly
	mr ohiggins we are in your debt
	and rest assured sir you have
	friends in this house whenever you
	are in dublin
		   pours a glass
	mister ohiggins i wonder if i know
	your good father

			roderick
	which ohiggins do you know  for i
	have never heard your name mentioned
	in my family

			captain oreilly
	oh i am thinking of the ohiggins
	of redmondstown  general ohiggins
	was a close friend of my wifes dear
	father colonel granby somerset

			roderick
	ah  i see  no im afraid mine
	are the ohiggins of watertown

			captain oreilly
	i have heard of them

there are relics of some muttonchops and onions on a
cracked dish before them

			captain oreilly
	my love i wish i had known of your
	coming for bob moriaty and i just
	finished the most delicious venison
	pasty which his grace the lord
	lieutenant sent us with a flash of
	sillery from his own cellar  you
	know the wine my dear  but as
	bygones are bygones and no help for
	them what say ye to a fine lobster
	and a bottle of as good claret as
	any in ireland  betty clear these
	things from the table and make the
	mistress and our young friend
	welcome to our home

captain oreilly searches his pockets for some money to
give to betty

			captain oreilly
	im sorry mr ohiggins but i
	dont seem to have any small change
	may i borrow a tenpenny piece to
	give to the girl

			mrs oreilly
	i have some money my dear  here
	betty go to the fishmonger and
	bring back our supper and mind you
	get the right change

she takes out one of the golden guineas roderick gave to
her

int  dinning room  later

they are eating

			roderick vo
	our supper was seasoned if not by
	any great elegance at least by a
	plentiful store of anecdotes
	concerning the highest personages of
	the city with whom according to
	himself the captain lived on terms
	of the utmost intimacy  not to be
	behind hand with him i spoke of my
	own estates and property as if i was
	as rich as a duke

int  oreilly house  bedroom  night

the couple wishing roderick goodnight

			roderick vo
	had i been an english lad the
	appearance of the chamber i occupied
	might indeed have aroused
	instantly my suspicion and distrust
	but we are not particular in ireland
	on the score of neatness hence the
	disorder of my bedchamber did not
	strike me so much

broken door

			roderick vo
	was there a lock to the door or a
	hasp to fasten it to

dress lying over bed

			roderick vo
	though my counterpane was evidently
	a greased brocade dress of mrs
	oreilly

cracked mirror

			roderick vo
	and my cracked toiletglass not much
	bigger than a halfcrown yet i was
	used to these sort of ways in irish
	houses and still thought myself to
	be in that of a man of fashion

drawers full of junk

			roderick vo
	there was no lock to the drawers
	which when they did open were full
	of my hostess rougepots shoes
	stays and rags

int  bedroom  oreilly house  night

in the middle of the night mrs oreilly comes to
rodericks room on a flimsy pretext and in the course of
events he has his first woman

int  coach  day

roderick captain and mrs oreilly

			captain oreilly
	i neednt ask whether you had a
	comfortable bed  young fred
	pimpleton slept in it for seven
	months during which he did me the
	honor to stay with me and if he was
	satisfied i dont know who else
	wouldnt be

ext  promenade  phoenix park  day

roderick captain and mrs oreilly their friends
various cuts

			roderick vo
	after breakfast we drove out to
	phoenix park where numbers of the
	young gentry were known to mrs
	oreilly to all of whom she
	presented me in such a complimentary
	way that before half an hour i had
	got to be considered as a gentleman
	of great expectations and large
	property

int  oreilly house  night

			roderick vo
	i had little notion then that i had
	got amongst a set of impostors 
	that captain oreilly was only an
	adventurer and his lady a person of
	no credit  the fact was a young
	man could hardly have fallen into
	worse hands than those in which i
	now found myself

an evening of gambling

			roderick vo
	their friends were always welcome on
	payment of a certain moderate sum
	for their dinner after which you
	may be sure that cards were not
	wanting and that the company who
	played did not play for love merely

various cuts of the characters present

			roderick vo
	what could happen to a man but
	misfortune from associating with
	such company  and in a very very
	short time i became their prey

roderick loses two hundred guineas to captain oreilly in
a single hand

we see captain oreilly cheat but roderick does not

he pays him the 18 gold guineas remaining from the sum
his mother gave him

			roderick
	i shall have to write out a note for
	the rest of it captain oreilly

ext  street  outside oreilly house  dawn

roderick exits to the street  the sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street  he is soon joined by
councillor mulligan

			councillor mulligan
	master roderick you appear a young
	fellow of birth and fortune let me
	whisper in your ear that you have
	fallen into very bad hands  its a
	regular gang of swindlers and a
	gentleman of your rank and quality
	should never be seen in such
	company  the captain has been a
	gentlemans gentleman and his lady
	of no higher rank  go home pack
	your valise pay the little trifle
	you owe me mount your mare and
	ride back again to your parents 
	its the very best thing you can do

roderick does not reply and walks slowly away from him
down the street

int  oreilly house  rodericks bedroom  early morning

roderick enters

			roderick vo
	into a pretty nest of villains
	indeed was i plunged  when i
	returned to my bedchamber a few
	hours later it seemed as if all my
	misfortunes were to break on me at
	once

valise open wardrobe lying on the ground and rodericks
keys in the possession of oreilly and his wife

			captain oreilly
	whom have i been harboring in my
	house  who are you sirrah

			roderick
	sirrah  sirrah i am as good a
	gentleman as any in ireland

			captain oreilly
	youre an impostor young man a
	schemer a deceiver

			roderick
	repeat the words again and i run
	you through the body

			captain oreilly
	tut tut  i can play at fencing as
	well as you mr roderick james
	ah  you change color do you  your
	secret is known is it  you come
	like a viper into the bosom of
	innocent families you represent
	yourself as the heir to my friends
	the ohiggins of castle ohiggins i
	introduce you to the nobility and
	gentry of this methropolis i take
	you to my tradesmen who give you
	credit  i accept your note for near
	two hundred pounds and what do i
	find  a fraud

he holds up the name roderick james printed on the
linen

			captain oreilly
	not master ohiggins of watertown
	but roderick james of the devil only
	knows where

captain oreilly gathers up the linen clothes silver
toilet articles and the rest of rodericks gear

			roderick
	hark ye mr oreilly i will tell
	you why i was obliged to alter my
	name which is james and the best
	name in ireland  i changed it sir
	because on the day before i came to
	dublin i killed a man in deadly
	combat  an englishman sir and a
	captain in his majestys service
	and if you offer to let or hinder me
	in the slightest way the same arm
	which destroyed him is ready to
	punish you

so saying roderick draws his sword like lightning and
giving a ha ha and a stamp with his foot lunges it
within an inch of oreillys heart who starts back and
turns deadly pale while his wife with a scream flings
herself between them

			mrs oreilly
	dearest roderick  be pacified
	oreilly you dont want the poor
	childs blood  let him escape  in
	heavens name let him go

			captain oreilly
		   sulkily
	he may go hang for me and hes
	better be off quickly for i shall
	go to the magistrate if i see him
	again

oreilly exits  his wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry

ext  dublin street  day

roderick riding down the street with his valise

			roderick vo
	where was now a home for the
	descendant of the james  i was
	expelled from dublin by a
	persecution occasioned i must
	confess by my own imprudence  i
	had no time to wait and choose  no
	place of refuge to fly to

int  ale house  day

			roderick vo
	there was a score of recruiting
	parties in the town beating up for
	men to join our gallant armies in
	america and germany

roderick approaches a captain and a sergeant who quickly
make him welcome

			roderick
	i will tell you frankly sir  i am
	a young gentleman in difficulties i
	have killed an officer in a duel
	and i am anxious to get out of the
	country

			roderick vo
	but i neednt have troubled myself
	with any explanations king george
	was in too much want of men to heed
	from whence they came  and a
	fellow of my inches was always
	welcome  indeed i could not have
	chosen my time better  a transport
	was lying at dunleary waiting for a
	wind

ext  british warship at sea  day

			roderick vo
	i never had a taste for any thing
	but genteel company and hate all
	descriptions of low life  hence my
	account of the society in which i at
	present found myself must of
	necessity be short  the
	reminiscences of the horrid black
	hole of a place in which we soldiers
	were confined of the wretched
	creatures with whom i was now forced
	to keep company of the plowmen
	poachers pickpockets who had taken
	refuge from poverty or the law as
	in truth i had done myself is
	enough to make me ashamed even now

roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit which is served to him at mess
when it comes to his turn to be helped to drink he is
served like the rest with dirty tin noggin containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water  the
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying

			roderick
	fellow get me a glass

at which all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter the very loudest among them being mr toole a
redhaired monster of a man

			mr toole
	get the gentleman a towel for his
	hands and serve him a basin of
	turtlesoup

roars the monster who is sitting or rather squatting on
the deck opposite him and as he speaks he suddenly
seizes rodericks beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause

			linkboy
		   whispers
	if you want to vex him ask him
	about his wife the washerwoman who
	bates him

			roderick
	is it a towel of your wifes
	washing mr toole  im told she
	wiped your face often with one

			linkboy
		   whispers
	ask him why he wouldnt see her
	yesterday when she came to the
	ship

			roderick vo
	and so i put to him some other
	foolish jokes about soapsuds hen
	pecking and flatirons which set
	the man into a fury and succeeded
	in raising a quarrel between us

roderick and toole fight with cudgels  roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor

			roderick vo
	this victory over the cock of the
	vile dunghill obtained me respect
	among the wretches among whom i
	formed part

ext  military drill field  cuxhaven  day

			roderick vo
	our passage was very favorable and
	in two days we landed at cuxhaven
	and before i had been a month in the
	electorate i was transported into a
	tall and proper young soldier and
	having a natural aptitude for
	military exercise was soon as
	accomplished at the drill as the
	oldest sergeant in the regiment

various cuts

old friend captain grogan who gives him a wink

			roderick vo
	six weeks after we arrived in

	and i promise you the sight of
	grogans face was most welcome to
	me for it assured me that a friend
	was near me

int  grogans quarters  day

roderick and grogan

			roderick vo
	grogan gave me a wink of
	recognition but offered no public
	token of acquaintance and it was not
	until two days afterwards that he
	called me into his quarters and
	then shaking hands with me
	cordially gave me news which i
	wanted of my family

			captain grogan
	i had news of you in dublin  faith
	youve begun early like your
	fathers son but i think you could
	not do better than as you have done
	but why did you not write home to
	your poor mother  she has sent
	halfadozen letters to you in
	dublin

			roderick
	i suppose she addressed them to me
	in my real name by which i never
	thought to ask for them at the post
	office

			captain grogan
	we must write to her today and you
	can tell her that you are safe and
	married to brown bess

roderick sighs when grogan says the word married on
which grogan says with a laugh

			captain grogan
	i see you are thinking of a certain
	young lady at duganstown

			roderick
	is miss dugan well

			captain grogan
	theres only six miss dugans now
	poor dorothy

			roderick
	good heavens  whatever  has she
	died of grief

			captain grogan
	she took on so at your going away
	that she was obliged to console
	herself with a husband  she is now
	mrs john best

			roderick
	mrs john best  was there another
	mr john best

			captain grogan
	no the very same one my boy  he
	recovered from his wound  the ball
	you hit him with was not likely to
	hurt him  it was only made of tow
	do you think the dugans would let
	you kill fifteen hundred ayear out
	of the family  the plan of the duel
	was all arranged in order to get you
	out of the way for the cowardly
	englishman could never be brought to
	marry from fear of you  but hit him
	you certainly did roderick and
	with a fine thick plugget of tow
	and the fellow was so frightened
	that he was an hour in coming to
	we told your mother the story
	afterwards and a pretty scene she
	made

			roderick
	the coward

			captain grogan
	he has paid off your uncles
	mortgage  he gave dorothy a coach
	andsix  that coward of a fellow
	has been making of your uncles
	family  faith the business was
	well done  your cousins michael
	and harry never let him out of
	their sight though he was for
	deserting to england until the
	marriage was completed and the
	happy couple off on their road to

			roderick vo
	our regiment which was quartered
	about stade and luneberg speedily
	had got orders to march southwards
	towards the rhine where we would
	fight the famous battle of minden
	it would require a greater
	philosopher and historian than i am
	to explain the causes of the famous
	seven years war in which europe was
	engaged and indeed its origin has
	always appeared to me to be so
	complicated and the books written

	understand that i have seldom been
	much wiser at the end of a chapter
	than at the beginning and so shall
	not trouble you with any personal

in order to get into the house roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door a very pretty and blackeyed young woman and her
old halfblinded father

they are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest but

convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor

at on end of which is the building a dingy ruinous place

a couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard their
horses are littered under a shed hard by

lounging about the place are some men and a pair of

shut the great yardgates as soon as they enter

			captain galgenstein
	good morning private james  please

			roderick
	how do you do sir

the minister nods

			roderick vo
	the captain was the nephew and heir
	of the minister of police herr

	no doubt aided in the younger
	gentlemens promotion

			captain galgenstein
	your loyalty to me and your service
	to the regiment has pleased me very
	well  and now there is another
	occasion on which you may make
	yourself useful to us if you
	succeed depend on it your reward
	will be your discharge from the
	army and a bounty of 100 guineas

			roderick
	what is the service sir

			captain galgenstein
	there is lately come to berlin a
	gentleman in the service of the
	empress queen who calls himself the
	chevalier de belle fast and wears
	the red riband and star of the
	popes order of the spur  he is
	made for good society polished
	obliging a libertine without
	prejudices fond of women of good
	food of high play prudent and
	discreet

the captain smiles at roderick

			captain galgenstein
	he speaks italian and french
	indifferently but we have some
	reason to fancy this monsieur de
	belle fast is a native of your
	country of ireland and that he has
	come here as a spy

the captain rises and begins to pace back and forth

			captain galgenstein
	naturally your knowledge of english
	makes you an ideal choice to go into
	his service  of course you will
	not know a word of english and if
	the chevalier asks as to the
	particularity of your accent say
	you are hungarian  the servant who
	came with him will be turned away
	today and the person to whom he has
	applied for a faithful fellow will
	recommend you

roderick nods

			captain galgenstein
	you are a hungarian you served in
	the army and left on account of
	weakness in the loins  he gambles a
	great deal and wins  do you know
	the cards well

			roderick
	only a very little as soldiers do

			captain galgenstein
	i had thought you more expert  you
	must find out if the chevalier
	cheats  he sees the english and
	austrian envoys continually and the
	young men of either ministry sup
	repeatedly at his house  find out
	what they talk of for how much each
	plays especially if any of them
	play on parole  if you are able to
	read his private letters though
	about those which go to the post
	you need not trouble yourself  we
	look at them there  but never see
	him write a note without finding out
	to whom it goes and by what channel
	or messenger  he sleeps with the
	keys of his dispatchbox with a
	string around his neck  twenty
	frederics if you get an impression
	of the keys

			minister galgenstein
	does this assignment interest you

			roderick
	yes minister i am interested in
	any work in which i can be of

beautiful carriage waiting at the door  then he enters

int  chevalier de belle fasts apartment  day

			chevalier

	seebach recommended

			roderick
	yes sir  here is my letter

roderick bows and hands him a letter from that gentleman
with which the captain had taken care to provide him

as the chevalier reads the letter roderick has the
leisure to examine him

he is a man of sixty years of age dressed superbly
wearing rings diamonds and laces

one of his eyes is closed with a black patch and he wears
a little white and red paint and a pair of moustachios
which fall over his lip

the chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter

			chevalier
	your name is lazlo zilagyi

			roderick
	yes sir

			chevalier
	you come highly recommended by herr
	seebach

			roderick

	employer

			chevalier
	for whom else have you worked

			roderick
	no one sir  before that i served
	in the army but had to leave due to
	weakness of the loins

			chevalier
	who else can give me information
	about you

			roderick

a few seconds and then smiles

			chevalier

	a day  i do not provide your
	clothing you will sleep at home
	and you will be at my orders every
	morning at seven oclock

			chevalier
	is there something wrong

he goes up to roderick

			roderick vo
	it was very imprudent of me but
	when i saw the splendor of his
	appearance the nobleness of his
	manner i felt it impossible to keep
	disguise with him  you who have
	never been out of your country know
	little what it is to hear a friendly
	voice in captivity and theres a
	many a man that will understand the
	cause of the burst of feeling which
	was about to take place

the chevalier takes roderick by the shoulder

			roderick
		   as he speaks
		    bursting into tears
	sir i have a confession to make  i
	am an irishman and my name is
	roderick james  i was abducted into

	a watch upon your actions of which
	i am to give information to the same
	quarter  for this odious service i
	have been promised my discharge and
	a hundred guineas

sobbing roderick falls into his arms

			chevalier
	the rascals  they think to catch
	me do they  why young man my
	chief conspiracy is a farobank
	but the king is so jealous that he
	will see a spy in every person who
	comes to his miserable capital in
	the great sandy desert here

	and i think he was as much affected
	as i was at thus finding one of his
	kindred for he too was an exile
	from home and a friendly voice a
	look brought the old country back
	to his memory again and the old
	days of his boyhood

ext  garden house  berlin  day

roderick minister galgenstein and captain galgenstein

			roderick vo
	i carried my little reports to
	captain galgenstein at the garden
	house outside the town where he gave
	me rendezvous  these reports of
	course were arranged between me and
	the chevalier beforehand  i was
	instructed and it is always the
	best way to tell as much truth as
	my story would possible bear

dialogue comes up from under voice over

			roderick
	he goes to church regularly  he is
	very religious and after hearing
	mass comes home to breakfast  then
	he takes an airing in his chariot
	till dinner which is served at
	noon  after dinner he writes his
	letters if he has any letters to
	write but he has very little to do
	in this way  his letters are to the
	austrian envoy with whom he
	corresponds but who does not
	acknowledge him and being written
	in english or course i look over
	his shoulder  he generally writes
	for money  he makes his party with
	calsabigi the lottery contractor
	the russian attaches two from the
	english embassy my lords deuceace
	and punter who play a jeu denfer
	and a few more  he wins often but
	not always  lord deuceace is a very
	fine player  the chevalier elliott
	the english minister sometimes
	comes on which occasion the
	secretaries do not play

int  chevaliers apartments  night

the chevalier is at play against several gentlemen
including the prince of turbingen while roderick signals
the cards

			roderick vo
	it was agreed that i should keep my
	character of valet that in the
	presence of strangers i should not
	know a word of english that i
	should keep good lookout on the
	trumps when i was serving the
	champagne and punch about and
	having a remarkably fine eyesight
	and a great natural aptitude i was
	speedily able to give my dear
	benefactor much assistance against
	his opponents at the green table

several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over

			roderick vo
	simplicity was our secret
	everything successful is simple
	if for instance i wiped the dust
	off a chair with my napkin it was
	to show that the enemy was strong in
	diamonds if i pushed it he had an
	ace king if i said punch or
	wine my lord hearts was meant
	if wine or punch clubs  if i
	blew my nose it was to indicate
	that there was another confederate
	employed by the adversary and then
	i warrant you some pretty trials of
	skill would take place  the prince
	of turbingen although so young had
	a very great skill and cleverness
	with the cards in every way and it
	was only from hearing ritter von
	brandenburg who came with him yawn
	three times when the chevalier had
	the ace of trumps that i knew we
	were greek to greek as it were

the prince loses a big hand and in a fury throws down
his cards  he stares at the table then at the chevalier

			prince
	chevalier though i cannot say how
	i believe you have cheated me

			chevalier
	i deny your graces accusations and
	beg you to say how you have been
	cheated

			prince
		   glaring at roderick
	i dont know

			chevalier
	your grace owes me seventy thousand
	frederics which i have honorably
	won

			prince
	chevalier if you will have your
	money now you must fight for it
	if you will be patient maybe i will
	pay you something another time

			chevalier
	your grace if i am so tame as to
	take this then i must give up an
	honorable and lucrative occupation

			prince
	i have said all there is to be said
	i am at your disposal for whatever
	purposes you wish  good night

he exits

ext  garden house  day

roderick captain galgenstein and minister galgenstein

			minister galgenstein
	was he cheated

			roderick
	in so far as i can tell these things
	 no  i believe the chevalier won
	the money fairly

			minister galgenstein
	hmmmmmm

			captain galgenstein
	what are the chevaliers intentions

			roderick
	i am not sure  the prince told him
	quite clearly that if he wished to
	have the money he would have to
	fight for it

			minister galgenstein
	a meeting with the prince of
	turbingen is impossible

			roderick
	the prince left him only that
	choice

the captain and the minister walk a few steps away and
speak in whispers

then they return to roderick

			minister galgenstein
	will you be able to return here
	tomorrow without arousing suspicion

int  chevaliers apartments  day

			chevalier
	tell them i intend to demand
	satisfaction from the prince

			roderick
	but they will prevent a meeting at
	whatever the cost

			chevalier
	have no fear  it will come out well
	for me

			roderick
	i believe they will deport you

			chevalier
	i have faced that problem before

			roderick
	but if they send you away then
	what is to become of me

			chevalier
		   with a smile
	make your mind easy you shall not
	be left behind i warrant you  do
	take a last look at your barracks
	make your mind easy say a farewell
	to your friends in berlin  the dear

officer lieutenant dascher

			roderick vo
	it was my unrivaled skill with
	sword and pistol and readiness to
	use them that maintained the
	reputation of the firm

towards the end of the game dascher seeing that he is
losing makes an unfair stroke so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face

lieutenant dascher for whom the stroke wins the game
takes the money which is in the stake bag and puts it in
his pocket paying no attention to the markers
adjurations or to rodericks

roderick who is without his sword reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at daschers face

he wards off the blow with his arm drawing his sword and
runs at roderick who is unarmed

the marker a sturdy young man catches dascher around the
waist and prevents murder

			dascher
	i see that you are without your
	sword but i believe you are a man
	of mettle  will you give me
	satisfaction

			roderick
	i shall be delighted but you have
	lost and you must pay me the money
	before we meet for after all you
	cannot pay me when you are dead

	i will undertake to pay you the 20
	louis but only tomorrow morning at
	the meeting

ext  field  day

on the field there are six people waiting with dascher
and his seconds  dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to roderick saying

			dascher
	i may have been mistaken but i mean
	to make you pay deadly for your
	brutality

roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm making no reply to the others boasting

			roderick
		   privately
	it is distasteful to kill a
	scoundrel  that should be work for
	a hangman

			chevalier
	to risk ones life against such
	people is an imposition

			roderick
		   laughs
	i risk nothing for i am certain to
	kill him

			chevalier
	certain

			roderick
	perfectly certain because i shall
	make him tremble

he takes his station between two trees about four paces
apart and draws a pair of dueling pistols

			roderick
	you have only to pace yourself at
	ten paces difference and fire
	first  the space between these two
	trees is the place where i choose to
	walk back and forth  you may walk
	too if you wish when it is my turn
	to fire

no one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly

			dascher
	but we must decide who is to have
	the first shot

			roderick
	there is no need of that  i never
	fire first and in any case you
	have that right

dascher places himself at the specified distance

roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him

dascher takes aim and fires missing

			roderick
		   with the greatest
		    composure
	you missed me sir  i was sure you
	would  try again

the others think he is mad and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties but not a bit of it

dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot again
missing roderick

without a word but in a firm and confident manner
roderick fires his first shot into the air

dascher looks amazed  then aiming at dascher with his
second pistol he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground

ext  road  day

roderick and chevalier traveling in their coach

			roderick vo
	thus is will be seen that our life
	for all its splendor was one of
	extreme difficulty and danger
	requiring high talents and courage
	for success and sudden and
	unexpected departures

they meet a fourwheel carriage drawn by two horses
carrying a master and a servant

the driver of the fourwheel carriage wants rodericks
driver to make way for him

rodericks driver protests that if he does he will upset
his master in the ditch but the other insists

roderick addresses the master a handsome young man and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him

			roderick
	i am posting monsieur and
	furthermore i am a foreigner

			stranger
	monsieur here in saxony the post
	has no special right and if you are
	a foreigner you must admit that you
	have no greater claim than mine
	since i am in my own country

at that roderick gets out and holding his drawnsword
tells the stranger to get out or to make way for him

the stranger replies with a smile that he has no sword
and that in any case he will not fight for such a silly
reason

he tells roderick to get back in his chaise and he makes
way for him

int  gaming room  night

roderick and the chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss

			roderick vo
	the ladies were passionately fond of
	play and hence would often arise no
	small trouble to us for the truth
	most be told that the ladies loved
	to play but not to pay  the point
	of honor is not understood by the
	charming sex and it was with the
	greatest difficulty that we could
	keep them from the table could get
	their money if they lost or if they
	paid prevent them from using the
	most furious and extraordinary means
	of revenge

ext  road  dawn

			roderick vo
	on this evening the lady of high
	rank after i had won a considerable
	sum in diamonds and pearls from her
	sent her lover with a band of cut
	throats to waylay me

roderick and the chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road

the chevalier is underneath and screams from the pain in
his right arm which he thinks is broken

their servant forces the door open to help them out
telling them that the two postilions have fled

roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door
which is above him but the chevalier unable to move
because of his disabled arm has to be pulled out

his piercing shrieks make roderick laugh because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers

from the carriage roderick takes his dueling pistols
and sword

roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity money in hand he leaves

the chevalier has lain down on the hard ground groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers

roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price

his carriage is close to the ditch and he unhitches the
horses tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle and stations himself behind them with weapons

in this predicament roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor chevalier who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore and uttering the most pitiful execrations when
a mare whose back was turned to him take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him  there is nothing
to be done he has to put up with the whole stinking rain
and to forgive rodericks laughter which he has not the
strength to hold in

the chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack which is halfhearted and uncertain by the ladys
lover and his hesitant band of six cutthroats

some falter and run away as soon as roderick fires his
pistol

the leader and two heartier followers engage roderick
during the fight they mortally wound the helpless
chevalier and two of them are killed

after they flee roderick kneels by the chevalier who
utters some appropriate last words then dies

his servant finally arrives at full gallop shouting at
the top of his voice and followed by a band of peasants
each with his lantern come to his rescue  there are ten
or twelve of them all armed with muskets and all ready
to obey his orders

	sacrifices for her

	myriad of diseases a cripple
	wheeled about in a chair and
	suffering pangs of agony yet you

	and i think my black footman has
	been better educated than you but
	you are a young fellow of

	i am obliged to observe sir william

	for the next world much sooner than
	i am i will depend on you to get
	comfortable quarters arranged for
	me

laughter

			sir william
	indeed you are right sir  look at
	me  marriage has added forty years
	to my life  i am dying a wornout
	cripple at the age of fifty  when
	i took off lady cosgrove there was
	no man of my years who looked so
	young as myself  fool that i was
	i had enough with my pensions
	perfect freedom the best society in
	europe  and i gave up all these
	and married and was miserable  take
	a warning from me mr roderick and
	stick to the trumps  do anything
	but marry

			roderick
	would you have me spend my life all
	alone

			sir william
	in truth sir yes but if you must
	marry then marry a virtuous drudge

		   laughing

			sir william
	well why not a milkmaids daughter
	no man of sense need restrict
	himself or deny himself a single
	amusement for his wifes sake on
	the contrary if he selects the
	animal properly he will choose such
	a one as shall be no bar to his
	pleasure but a comfort in his hours
	of annoyance  for instance i have
	got the gout who tends me  a hired
	valet who robs me whenever he has
	the power  my wife never comes near
	me  what friend have i  none in
	the wide world  men of the world
	as you and i are dont make
	friends and we are fools for our
	pains

polite laughter at the table

			sir william
	my lady is a weak woman but she is
	my mistress  she is a fool but she
	has got the better of one of the
	best heads in christendom  she is
	enormously rich but somehow i have
	never been so poor as since i
	married her  i thought to better
	myself and she has made me
	miserable and killed me and she
	will do as much for my successor
	when im gone

there is a reflective silence at the table

			roderick
	has her ladyship a very large
	income

this question causes sir william to burst out into a
yelling laugh joined by the rest of the table and makes
roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie

			roderick vo
	despite my friends strong warning
	i resolves to become acquainted with
	his lady  sir william cosgrove was
	dying  his widow would be a rich
	prize  why should i not win her
	and with her the means of making
	in the world that figure which my
	genius and inclination desired
	when i determine i look upon the
	thing as done

			roderick
	charming lady tell me the truth and
	earn my gratitude  have you a
	lover

the countess laughs

			countess
	no

			roderick
	have you had one

			countess
	never

			roderick
	but for a time a passing fancy

			countess
	not even that

			roderick
	how can i believe that there is not
	a man who has inspired desires in
	you

			countess
	not one

			roderick
	have you not a man whom you value

			countess
	that man has perhaps not yet been
	born

			roderick
	what  you have not met a man worthy
	of your attention

			countess
	many worthy of attention but
	valuing is something more  i could
	value only someone whom i loved

			roderick
	then you have never loved  your
	heart is empty

			countess
	your word empty makes me laugh
	is it fortunate or unfortunate  if
	it is fortunate i congratulate
	myself  if it is unfortunate i do
	not care for i am not aware of it

			roderick
	it is nonetheless a misfortune and
	you will know it when you love

			countess
	but if when i love i am unhappy i
	will know that my empty heart was my
	good fortune

			roderick
	that is true but it seems to me
	impossible that you should be
	unhappy in love

			countess
	it is only too possible  love
	requires a mutual harmony which is
	difficult and it is even more
	difficult to make it last

			roderick
	i agree but god put us on earth to
	take that risk

			countess
	a man may need to do that and find
	it amusing but a girl is bound by
	other laws

			roderick
	i believe you and i see i must
	hasten to leave for otherwise i
	shall become the unhappiest of men

			countess
	how so

			roderick
	by loving you with no hope of
	possessing you

she laughs

			countess
	you want my heart

			roderick
	it is my only object

			countess
	to make me wretched in two weeks

			roderick
	to love you until death  to
	subscribe to all your commands

			countess
	the amusing thing is that you
	deceive me without knowing if it is
	true that you love me

			roderick
	deceiving someone without knowing it
	is something new for me  if i do
	not know it i am innocent

			countess
	but you deceive me nonetheless if i
	believe you for it will not be in
	your power to love me when you love
	me no longer

roderick laughs and kisses her

			countess
	be so good as to tell me with whom
	you think you are

			roderick
	with a woman who is completely
	charming be she a princess or a
	woman of the lowest condition and
	who regardless of her rank will
	show me some kindness tonight

she laughs

			countess
	and if she does not choose to show
	you some kindness

			roderick
	then i will respectfully take leave
	of her

			countess
	you will do as you please  it seems
	to me that such a matter can hardly
	be discussed until after people know
	each other  do you not agree

			roderick
	yes  but i am afraid of being
	deceived

			countess
	poor man  and for that reason you
	want to begin where people end

			roderick
	i ask only a payment on account
	today  after that you will find
	me undemanding obedient and
	discreet

			roderick
	will we always leave it at this

			countess
	always my dear one never any
	further  love is a child to be
	pacified with trifles  a full diet
	can only kill it

			roderick
	i know better than you do  love
	wants a more substantial fare and
	if it is stubbornly withheld it
	withers away

			countess
	our abstinence makes our love
	immortal  if i loved you a quarter
	of an hour ago now i should love
	you even more  but i should love
	you less if you exhausted my joy by
	satisfying all my desires

			roderick
	let us give each other complete
	happiness and let us be sure that
	as many times as we satisfy our
	desires they will each time be born
	anew

			countess
	my husband has convinced me of the
	contrary

			roderick
	sir william cosgrove is a man who is
	dying and yet i envy him more than
	any man in christendom  he enjoys a
	privilege of which i am deprived
	he may take you in his arms whenever
	he pleases and no veil keeps his
	senses his eyes his soul from
	enjoying your beauty

she silences him with her fingertips

			countess
	shall i tell you something  i
	believed what was called love came
	after the union  and i was
	surprised when my husband making me
	a woman made me know it only by
	pain unaccompanied by any pleasure
	i saw that my imaginings had stood
	me in better stead  and so we
	became only friends seldom sleeping
	together and arousing no curiosity
	in each other yet on good terms for
	a while as whenever he wanted me i
	was at his service but since the
	offering was not seasoned with love
	he found it tasteless and seldom
	demanded it

			roderick
	o my dearest love  enough  i beg
	you  stop believing in your
	experience  you have never known
	love  my very soul is leaving me
	catch it on your lips and give me
	yours

they kiss ardently

			roderick vo
	to make a long story short her
	ladyship and i were in love six

	got into her ladyships good graces
	i found innumerable occasions to
	improve my intimacy and was
	scarcely ever out of her company

ext  countess house  spa  dusk

	i shall never forget the
	astonishment of sir william cosgrove
	when on one summer evening as he
	was issuing out to the playtable
	in his sedanchair her ladyships
	barouche and four came driving into
	the courtyard of the house which
	they inhabited and in that
	carriage by her ladyships side
	sat no other than the vulgar irish
	adventurer as she was pleased to
	call me

sir william makes the most courtly of bows and grins and
waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity
of illness permits and her ladyship and roderick reply to
the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on
their part

	without you my dearest i might
	have died without ever knowing love
	inexpressible love  god of nature
	bitterness than which nothing is
	sweeter sweetness than which
	nothing is more bitter  divine
	monster which can only be defined by
	paradoxes

			roderick
	let me give a thousand kisses to
	that heavenly mouth which has told
	me that i am happy

			countess
	as soon as i saw you loved me i was
	pleased and i gave you every
	opportunity to fall more in love
	with me being certain that for my
	part i would never love you  but
	after our first kiss i found that i
	had no power over myself  i did not
	know that one kiss could matter so
	much

			roderick vo
	we then spent an hour in the most
	eloquent silence except that from
	time to time her ladyship cried
	out  oh my god  is it true  i
	am not dreaming

int  gaming room  night

roderick enters and approaches a table at which sir
william cosgrove who is drunk is at play with several
other jovial fellows

			roderick vo
	sir william cosgrove with his
	complication of ills was dying
	before us by inches  he was
	continually tinkered up by doctors
	and what with my usual luck he
	might be restored to health and live
	i dont know how many years  if
	cosgrove would not die where was
	the use of my pursing his lady  but
	my fears were to prove groundless
	for on that very night patient
	nature would claim her account

			sir william
	good evening mr james have you
	done with my lady

			roderick
	i beg your pardon

			sir william
	come come sir  i am a man who
	would rather be known as a cuckold
	than a fool

			roderick
	i think sir william cosgrove you
	have had too much drink  your
	chaplin mr hunt has introduced me
	into the company of your lady to
	advise me on a religious matter of
	which she is a considerable expert

sir william cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter  his laugh is not jovial or agreeable but
rather painful and sardonic and ends in a violent fit of
coughing

			sir william
	gentlemen see this amiable youth
	he has been troubled by religious
	scruples and has flown for refuge
	to my chaplin mr hunt who has
	asked for advise from my wife lady
	cosgrove and between them both
	they are confirming my ingenious
	young friend in his faith  did you
	ever hear of such doctors and such a
	disciple

			roderick
	faith sir if i want to learn good
	principles its surely better i
	should apply for them to your lady
	and your chaplin than to you

			sir william
		   laughing but pretty
		    red
	he wants to step into my shoes  he
	wants to step into my shoes

roderick stares at him coldly

			roderick
	well if my intentions are what you
	think they are  if i do wish to
	step into your shoes what then  i
	have no other intentions than you
	had yourself  lady cosgroves
	wealth may be great but am i not of
	a generous nature enough to use it
	worthily  her rank is lofty but
	not so lofty as my ambition  i will
	be sworn to muster just as much
	regard for my lady cosgrove as you
	ever showed her and if i win her
	and wear her when you are dead and
	gone corbleu knight do you think
	that it will be the fear of your
	ghost will deter me

			sir william
	is it not a pleasure gentlemen for
	me as i am drawing near the goal
	to find my home such a happy one my
	wife so fond of me that she is even
	now thinking of appointing a
	successor  isnt it a comfort to
	see her like a prudent housewife
	getting everything ready for her
	husbands departure

			roderick
	i hope that you are not thinking of
	leaving us soon knight

			sir william
	not so soon my dear as you may
	fancy perhaps  why man i have
	been given over many times these
	four years and there was always a
	candidate or two waiting to apply
	for the situation  who knows how
	long i may keep you waiting

			roderick
	sir let those laugh that win

			sir william
	i am sorry for you mr james  im
	grieved to keep you or any gentleman
	waiting  had you not better to
	arrange with my doctor or get the
	cook to flavor my omelette with
	arsenic  what are the odds

several cuts of the countess caring for the infant
patrick

	great comfort in the dressing
	educating and dandling of our
	little patrick for whose sake it was
	fit that she should give up the

	an accomplished performer she
	would as often as not begin to

	and in these fits of love she was
	the most easy creature in the world
	to be persuaded and would have
	signed away her whole property had
	it been possible  and i must
	confess it was with very little
	attention on my part that i could
	bring her into good humor and up
	to the very last day of our being
	together would be reconciled to me

sign some papers  live dialogue under voice over

			roderick vo
	she was luckily very fond of her

	it was a pleasure to treat him with
	kindness and distinction the little
	fellow was the pink of fashion

brookside and roderick

			roderick vo
	whereas young brookside had grown
	to be a very nasty and disrespectful
	fellow indeed  in my company he
	preserved the most rigid silence
	and a haughty scornful demeanor
	which was so much the more
	disagreeable because there was
	nothing in his behavior i could

brookside is stunned by his mothers words

			brookside
	madam i have borne as long as
	mortal could endure the ill
	treatment of the insolent irish
	upstart whom you have taken into
	your bed  it is not only the
	lowness of his birth and the
	general brutality of his manners

	nature of his conduct towards your
	ladyship his brutal and
	ungentlemanlike behavior his open
	infidelity his habits of
	extravagance intoxication his
	shameless robberies and swindling of
	my property and yours  it is these

	stood by your ladyship as i
	promised but you seem to have taken
	latterly your husbands part and
	as i cannot personally chastise this
	lowbred ruffian who to our shame
	be it spoken is the husband of my

	witness his treatment of you and

	presence of mind

			roderick
	sire my lord brookside has set sail
	to fight the rebels against your
	majestys crown in america  does
	your majesty desire that i should
	send another company to aid him

the king stares at roderick turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presencechamber

roderick is approached by the duke of rutland who takes
him aside into an alcove

			duke of rutland
		   speaking very
		    quietly
	let me tell you sir that your
	conduct has been very odiously
	represented to the king and has
	formed the subject of royal comment
	the king has said influenced by
	these representations that you are
	the most disreputable man in the
	three kingdoms and a dishonor to
	your name and country

roderick begins to sputter

			duke of rutland
	hear me out please  it has been
	intimated to his majesty that you
	had raised the american company for
	the sole purpose of getting the
	young viscount to command it and so
	get rid of him  and further that
	you had paid the very man in the
	company who was ordered to dispatch
	him in the first general action

			roderick
	thus it is that my loyalty is
	rewarded and my sacrifices in favor
	of my country viewed

			duke of rutland
	as for your ambitious hopes
	regarding the irish peerages his
	majesty has also let it be known
	that you have been led astray by
	that lord crabs who likes to take
	money but who has no more influence
	to get a coronet than to procure a
	popes tiara  and if you have it
	in mind to call upon lord crabs you
	will be disappointed  he left for
	the continent on tuesday and may be
	away for several months

int  lord wests office  day

roderick and lord west

			roderick
	i insist upon being allowed to
	appear before his majesty and clear
	myself of the imputations against
	me to point out my services to the
	government and to ask when the
	reward that had been promised me
	the title held by my ancestors is
	again to be revived in my person

there is a sleepy coolness in the fat lord west  he hears
roderick with halfshut eyes  when he finishes his
violent speech which he has made striding about the room
lord west opens one eye smiles and says   

			lord west
		   gently
	have you done mr cosgrove

			roderick
	yes

			lord west
	well mr cosgrove ill answer you
	point by point  the king is
	exceedingly averse to make peers as
	you know  your claim as you call
	them have been laid before him and
	his majestys gracious reply was
	that you were the most impudent man
	in his dominions and merited a
	halter rather than a coronet  as
	for withdrawing your support from
	us you are perfectly welcome to
	carry yourself whithersoever you
	please  and now as i have a great
	deal of occupation perhaps you will
	do me the favor to retire or tell
	me if there is anything else in the
	world in which i can oblige you

and bows roderick out

	making a loan  after several months
	without success it was with some
	considerable interest that i
	received his visit

int  rodericks study  day

roderick and the moneybroker mr newcombe

			newcombe
	i have good news for you mr
	cosgrove  the firm of bracegirdle
	and chatwick in the city of london
	are prepared to lend you 20000
	pounds pledged against your
	interest in the edric mines  they
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property which amount to some
	10000 pounds and take a twenty
	year working lease on the mines
	they will lend you the 20000 pounds
	against the lease income
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in and they will make a
	charge of 18 per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance

			roderick
	mr newcombe i have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years at very onerous terms but
	18 a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed

			newcombe
	considering your financial
	circumstances mr cosgrove it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you  i think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity
	but obviously if you would reject
	this offer i shall keep trying to
	find a better one

			roderick
		   after a pause
	i am prepared to accept the terms
	mr newcombe

			newcombe
	there are a few other points we
	should discuss  the loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyships signature and provided
	that bracegirdle and chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyships freewill
	in giving her signature

			roderick
	provided that they can be assured of
	her ladyships freewill  are you
	serious

			newcombe
	may i be quite frank with you

			roderick
	yes of course

			newcombe
	mister bracegirdle said to me that
	he had heard her ladyship lives in
	some fear of her life and meditated
	a separation in which case she
	might later repudiate any documents
	signed by herself while in durance
	and subject them at any rate to a
	doubtful and expensive litigation
	they were quite insistent on this
	point and said they must have
	absolute assurance of her ladyships
	perfect freewill in the transaction
	before they would advance a shilling
	of their capital

			roderick
	i see

			newcombe
	when i asked them in what form they
	would accept her ladyships
	assurances they said that they were
	only prepared to accept them if her
	ladyship confirms her written
	consent by word of mouth in their
	presence at their countinghouse in
	birchin lane london  i requested
	they come here and save her
	ladyship and yourself the
	inconvenience of the trip to london
	but they declined saying that they
	did not wish to incur the risk of a
	visit to castle hackton to
	negotiate as they were aware of how
	other respectable parties such as
	messrs sharp and salomon had been
	treated here

when they get to the door she stops in front of it

the countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes rodericks hand

he pushes her away to one side

she jumps at the bell which is quickly answered by a
moldylooking gentleman in an unpowered wig

she stalks down the passage muttering  old fool

int  mr tapewells office  day

tapewell is in his musty room surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes

he advances and bows begs her ladyship to be seated and
points towards a chair for roderick which he takes
rather wondering at the lawyers insolence

the lawyer retreats to a sidedoor saying he will be back
in a moment

in the next moment he reenters bringing with him another
layer six constables in red waistcoats with bludgeons
and pistols and lord brookside

lady cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior her
preserver her gallant knight

then turning to roderick she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him

			countess
	oh fool as i am i have outwitted
	the most crafty and treacherous
	monster under the sun  yes i was a
	fool when i married you and gave up
	other and nobler hearts for your
	sake  yes i was a fool when i
	forgot my name and lineage to unite
	myself with a baseborn adventurer
	 a fool to bear without repining
	the most monstrous tyranny that ever
	woman suffered to allow my property
	to be squandered to see women as
	base and lowborn as yourself

			tapewell
	for heavens sake be calm

tapewell bounds back behind the constables seeing a
threatening look in rodericks eye

the countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury
screaming against roderick and against his mother and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
fool

			roderick
	you didnt tell all my lady  i
	said old fool

	i have no doubt that you said and
	did sir everything that a

	blood of such a ruffian  if the
	scoundrel remains in london another
	day he will be seized as a common
	swindler

			roderick
	wheres the man who will seize me

he draws his sword placing his back to the door

			roderick

	cowardly braggart come first if

	dear sir we dont wish to seize
	you we will give you a handsome sum
	to leave the country only leave her
	ladyship in peace

			brookside
	and the country will be rid of such
	a villain

as brookside says this he backs into the next room

the lawyer follows him leaving roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth

	utterly baffled and beaten by that
	woman  was she relenting at the
	door when she paused and begged me
	to turn back  had she not a
	lingering love for me still  her
	conduct showed it as i came to
	reflect on it  it was my only
	chance now left in the world so i
	put down my sword upon the lawyers
	desk

roderick puts his sword down on the lawyers desk

			roderick
	gentlemen i shall have no violence
	you may tell mr tapewell i am quite
	ready to speak with him when he is
	at leisure

roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably

int  rodericks room in coffee house  day

			roderick vo
	i was instructed to take a lodging
	for the night in a coffee house near
	grays inn and anxiously expected a
	visit from mr tapewell

tapewell talking to roderick

			tapewell
	i have been authorized by lady
	cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
	an annuity of 300 pounds a year
	specifically on the condition of you
	remaining abroad out of the three
	kingdoms and to be stopped on the
	instant of your return  i advise
	you to accept it without delay for
	you know as well as i do that your
	stay in london will infallibly
	plunge you in gaol as there are
	innumerable writs taken out against
	you here and in the west of england
	and that your credit is so blown
	upon that you could not hope to
	raise a shilling  i will leave you
	the night to consider this proposal
	but if you refuse the family will
	proceed against you in london and
	have you arrested  if you accede a
	quarter salary will be paid to you
	at any foreign port you should
	prefer

			roderick
	mr tapewell i do not require a
	night to consider this proposal
	what other choice has a poor lonely
	and brokenhearted man  i shall
	take the annuity and leave the
	country

			mr tapewell
	i am very glad to hear that you have
	come to this decision mr cosgrove
	i think you are very wise

there is a knock at the door and roderick opens it
brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols

the dialogue for this scene has to be written

brookside has gone against the bargain and has decided to
have roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt

mr tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
brookside is acting in bad faith

brookside brushes aside his objections

roderick is defeated and meekly sits down in a chair

and led out of the room
