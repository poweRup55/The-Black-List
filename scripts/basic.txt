               carrying the wounded smaller man over his shoulder both in

               unshoulders his m16 face panicked

               huddled together as bullet hits kick up dust around them

               rifle and theres only silence no return fire

               and then styles sees why a third man lying by the treeline 
               chest torn open by gunfire obviously dead his clothes  
               the same fatigues the first two men are wearing

               as the helicopter comes in for a landing the bigger man 
               kneels next to the smaller man who bleeds from a bullet 
               wound to the arm his face pale sweating the bigger man 
               wipes the smaller mans brow and speaks softly and seriously

                         my proclivities and i have done my

                         id just been told tonight was the 
                         night id die

               the chopper touches down on the edge of the bayou the door 
               rumbles open as west points out different team directions in 
               the blackness

                                     west
                         first team second team third team 
                         go go go

               the click of rifles being unsafetied as the cadets pour out 
               of the helicopter

               ext louisiana bayou  last night

               we track with kendall and childs as they head away from the 
               landing zone rifles up heads down side by side moving 
               the brush quickly and quietly eyes scanning for targets

                                     kendall vo
                         i knew childs a little we worked at 
                         the px together

               flap loudly against the elements

                                     kendall vo
                         i started getting it in my head that 
                         maybe west had paid him maybe he 
                         was the one who was supposed to give 
                         me a training accident 

               the roar of gunfire kendall turns towards it screaming for 
               a moment until he sees childs lower his smoking rifle a 
               shredded target on a tree in front of them he looks down 
               noticing has his own weapon trained on childs

               childs steps forward knocking kendalls rifle away

                                     childs
                         dont you ever point a gun at me

                         im  im sorry

               kendall terrified shaking a beat childs picks up the 
               rifle from the ground and hands it back to him

                                     childs

                         there somewhere in the dark maybe 
                         watching the others maybe watching 
                         me and waiting to make his move

               childs speaks and kendall almost jumps out of his skin

                                     childs
                         christ am i alone in this world

               a sound from the left kendall panics pivots and fires

               into darkness no target no west no nothing kendall really 
               freaked out now

                         go into a fit and bite off my own

                         me okay ill take care of this

               kendall nods and lets childs walk ahead staring at childs 
               back as they move on on kendalls face thinking

                                     kendall vo

                         when theyd get me when i felt 
                         safest

               close on kendalls finger  clicking off the safety again

               moving towards the trigger

                                     kendall vo
                         but if i struck first and took out 
                         childs then maybe i could make it 
                         out alive

               kendall raises the rifle sights childs back a moment of 
               utter silence and then

               int kendalls hospital room  present day

                                     kendall

               ext louisiana bayou  last night

               as kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it the sound of 
               a tremendous explosion comes from their right kendall and 
               childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily lights 
               up with the blast as a man screams

                                     childs
                         over there

               childs points to the right where the dim shine of phosphorous 
               can be seen through the trees he drags kendall to his feet 
               and the two take off running towards it

               kendall panting and scared ducking branches and leaping 
               ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow

                                     childs

               they hit the deck face down in mud it takes them a second 
               to realize the shots are not directed at them

                                     childs

                         killed west will be missing one

               mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades

                                     mueller
                         see three now can we please 

               he stops hearing a sound outside through the wind and rain 
               footsteps on the porch

               they all turn to the door waiting

               the door swings open pike covered in blood

                                     pike
                         hey guys

               they stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks 
               over to the empty fireplace finally

                                     dunbar

                         he admitted it

                                     kendall
                         right in front of us mueller went 
                         after him but we held him back

               pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied up so we roped 
               him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm

                                     osborne
                         why would he just surrender

               kendall turns to her and smiles

                                     kendall
                         because he had a plan

               int cabin  living room  last night

               pike tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look 
               for food in the kitchen alone kendall walks past pike

                                     pike

               kendall says nothing pike looks around makes sure no one 
               is listening and then whispers

                                     pike

               dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes

               standing there in a tshirt a fire burning in the hearth

                         to get rid of him first

                                     dunbar

               int transport helicopter flying  earlier last night

               the sectioners sit stonefaced staring out the window

               close on  muellers hand as it snakes into pikes pack and 
               extracts a phosphorous grenade

               ext louisiana bayou  earlier last night

               mueller and pike twenty feet apart scouring the brush for 
               targets mueller looks to pike and then slips away

                                     pike vo
                         then mueller ditches me during the 
                         exercise and heads for the creek

               ext louisiana bayou  creek bed  earlier last night

               mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin tossing 
               it down the embankment

                                     pike vo
                         he blows the grenade to frame me and 
                         gets west to come running

               the grenade blows setting the entire area aglow

               ext louisiana bayou  earlier last night

               kendall and childs turning towards the sound

               note each shot of kendall and childs in this sequence should 
               correspond exactly to kendalls flashback

               ext louisiana bayou  creek bed  night

               west emerges from the bush at a sprint

                                     west
                         what the fuck is going on

               mueller runs down the embankment toward him

                                     mueller
                         i dont know sir

               six feet away from west mueller suddenly raises his rifle 
               and pulls the trigger

               ext louisiana bayou  earlier last night

               kendall and childs running in the direction of the grenade

                                     pike
                         childs job is easy he only has to 
                         delay kendall long enough for mueller 
                         to get away

               suddenly machine gunfire shatters the night

                                     childs
                         get down

               he tackles kendall into the mud

               ext louisiana bayou  creek bed  earlier last night

               mueller smoking rifle in hand uniform covered in blood 
               stands over wests dead body he turns and runs off into the 
               brush a moment later childs and kendall come into view at 
               the top of the embankment

                                     pike vo
                         now all mueller has to do is get rid 
                         of the evidence

               int cabin  earlier last night

               mueller still covered in blood enters the dark cabin he 
               strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace striking 
               a match igniting the bloody rag

                                     pike vo
                         and wait for everyone else to arrive

               mueller watching the evidence burn

               pike leans forward

               and mueller fires

               pikes head snaps back

               the gunshot deafening then for an eternity silence

               nobody moves nobody breathes as if time has stopped

                                     kendall
                         oh my god

               mueller lowers his arm the pistol clattering to the floor

               his face as shocked as the others

                                     mueller
                         he wouldnt stop talking

               he takes a step forward towards pike a hole in the middle 
               of the black mans forehead

                                     dunbar
                              softly

                         i

               almost mechanically dunbar begins to reach for his own gun

               the unmistakable sound of a two rifles magazines being racked 
               simultaneously dunbar turns to see childs and nunez their 
               m16s in hand levelled at him

                                     childs

                         after us thats the story

               mueller collapses on the ground head in hands

                                     mueller

                         none of that matters now we got two 
                         dead bodies and a story that explains 
                         them youre either with us or 
                         against us  which is it

               dunbar and kendall looking at each other its clear what 
               the wrong answer will mean a long beat until

                                     kendall
                         okay 

               he is cut off as the wind outside roars  the hurricane 
               mounting to its full force  and the windows blow inwards 
               showering childs mueller and nunez with glass

               dunbars hand flies to his pistol pulling it

               mueller screaming trying to claw the glass from his eyes

               childs seeing dunbar move pulls the trigger

               and the cabin is filled with the thunder of gunfire as kendall 
               goes down clutching his arm

               dunbar fires hitting childs directly in the chest

               childs still shooting falls back his random spray of 
               bullets punching into mueller who jerks like a marionette

               nunez drawing a bead on dunbar about to shoot when

               a great crescendo of wood splintering and supports buckling 
               overtakes them and the cabins roof comes down on their heads

               hours later the rain has lessened and the hurricane has 
               begun to lift as dunbar pulls himself from the debris

               hearing a faint cry from his left

               kendall half conscious his arm bloody

               dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun 
               begins to peak through the clouds overhead

               ext louisiana bayou  sunrise

               dunbar carrying kendall towards the clearing when gunfire 
               comes from behind he turns to look

               nunez the only other survivor from the cabin a hundred 
               yards back rifle in hand coming after them with a vengeance

               dunbar sprinting towards the clearing bullets at his heels 
               and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a

               helicopter overhead

                                     dunbar vo

                         mueller flips out and shoots their 
                         fall guy which means they have to

               and then his mouth slams shut teeth cracking together over 
               and over again like a metronome on speed and his body jerks 
               horribly going horizontal shaking violently

               osborne leaping to her feet

               hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove 
               it into kendalls chattering mouth his teeth clamping down 
               on the metal and hardys hand drawing blood

               kendall looks up focusing on osborne a slight moment of 
               clarity in his eyes

               and relapses into another fit as security guards drag hardy

               later hardy and osborne sit in silence eyes downcast

               it crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can

               he reaches under the table and rips out the hidden microphone

               hardy knowing hes right in a flash he reaches down pulls 
               osbornes gun and grabs dunbar slamming him up against the

                         gentlemen it has come to my attention 
                         that there is a traitor in our midst 
                         someone who was going to break the 
                         code of fraternal brotherhood that i 
                         have endeavored to create in all of 
                         you perhaps that failure is mine 
                         but we take care of our own and 
                         this traitor must be made to pay

               he walks down the line of the six men eyeing each of them

               finally stopping at one putting a hand on his shoulder

               his hands and climbs out of the gully

               pike creeping through the foliage trying to listen for 
               sounds of movement through the storm his eyes narrow as he

               dunbar nods

               nunez begins backing away rifle still trained on him

               and then dunbar spies something behind and to the left of 
               nunez

               west

               staring down at him from behind some brush watching

               nunez slowly backing away he pauses as his foot catches on 
               a fallen branch looks away from dunbar for a split second 
               to step over it

               west nods to dunbar as if to say go on

                                     dunbar

               and dunbar fires

               gunshots swallowed by the storm dunbar lowers his head in 
               agony west walks down

               dunbar a clear shot at his back

               slumped in the corner two holes in his chest dead

               osborne lowers her weapon shaking

               hardy points to the top desk drawer which is open inside 
               it sits an ivory handled pistol fully loaded safety off

               its presence tells them everything they need to know

               string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the 
               building securing the site for investigation

               hardy takes in the entire scene from afar standing by his 
               gto watching as several mps finish questioning osborne

               when shes done she spies hardy and walks over to him
