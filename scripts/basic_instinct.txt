          towards her

          gently to the brass bed his eyes are closed  tighter 
          lowering hips into his face lower over his chest his 
          navel  the song plays

          he is inside her his head arches back his throat white

          she arches her back her hips grind her breasts are high

          extends her arms the right arm comes down suddenly  the 
          steel flashes his throat is white

                        turf  dr lamott teaches the psycho
                        pathology of psychopathic behavior 
                        at stanford and is also a member 
                        of the justice departments

                        there are two possibilities  one  
                        the person who wrote this book is 
                        your murderer and acted out the 
                        killing described in ritualistic 
                        literal detail  two  someone who 
                        wants to do the person who wrote 
                        this book harm read the book and 
                        enacted the killing described to 
                        incriminate the writer

                                    nick
                               after a long beat
                        what if the writer did it  what 
                        are we dealing with

                                    dr lamott
                        youre dealing with a devious 
                        diabolical mind  this book must 
                        have been written at least six 
                        months maybe years before it was 
                        published  that means the writer 
                        planned the crime at least in the 
                        subconscious back then  the fact 
                        that the writer carried it out 
                        indicates psychopathic obsessive 
                        behavior in terms not only of the 
                        killing itself but in terms of 
                        applied advance defense mechanism

                        willing to kill an irrelevant and 
                        innocent victim to place the blame 
                        on the person who wrote this book  
                        we are talking about deepseated 
                        obsessional hatred an utter lack

          the black ferrari is in the driveway  he sits in an unmarked 
          police car on a hillside above the house watching  it is a 
          bleak leaden gray day

          catherine comes out of the house  she is dressed casually

          she gets into the ferrari

          int his police car

          he stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic 
          highway  a twolane mountain road which leads from stinson 
          beach into marin county

          she suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road cutting 
          in and out passing cars very fast

          he has to start cutting around cars to keep up  this woman 
          really drives

          he cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a grey 
          lines tour bus headon  close call sheer drops on either 
          side

          he looks frazzled

          int his police car

          he is behind her at a distance on a hilly mill valley road  
          little streets terraced hillsides sharp turns

          he goes slowly looks around thinks hes lost her  and then 
          he sees the black ferrari parked in front of a house obscured 
          by hedges

          he parks the car a distance behind the ferrari sits there a 
          long beat  he gets out goes carefully up to the hedges looks  
          a small nondescript house  he watches  he cant see anything 
          inside the house

          an envelope out looks at the name hazel dobkins

          in her 70s is with her  she hugs the old woman gets into 
          the ferrari starts it up

          he waits a beat and then starts after her  he stays behind 
          her at a distance  she is going slowly  and then she suddenly 
          guns it cuts her lights  her wheels screech

          he guns his car after her  he makes a turn  she is gone

          he sees the outline of her body now

          she starts to take her clothes off  there in the window 
          behind the curtain  he watches her body as she does an almost 
          languorous strip  his eyes are intense ravishing

          int the detective bureau  night

          he is alone nobody else in the big room

          move together

          their eyes are on each other as they move the eyes burning 
          the movements tighter hotter and he suddenly grabs her and 
          kisses her as they keep moving the song seques into the

          to get out of the way  nick looks after him a long beat shakes 
          his head

          int a car  night

          someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street  
          he turns a corner walks down the alley towards his porsche 
          parked behind the country and western bar

          the car suddenly speeds up  roars down on him from the back 
          full bore

          ext the alley

          he hurls himself across the porsches hood barely avoiding 
          the car  he sees the car at the end of the alley turning out 
          it is a black ferrari

          int his porsche

          he guns it down the alley makes a wild turn in the direction 
          the ferrari turned

          ext the street

          the porsche dodges around cars very fast almost sideswiping 
          them looking almost out of control its motor screaming

          int the porsche

          he sees the ferrari turn ahead  when he gets to where it 
          turned he turns wildly

          ext the street

          the ferrari is making fast wild turns into little streets in 
          north beach its motor screaming  the porsche is gaining 
          ground behind it making turns

          int the porsche

          the ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a 
          road going up a hillside  he yanks the wheel hard

          ext the steps

          the porsche rockets up the steps  bouncing high into the 
          air almost out of control                                                                     

          int the porsche

          as it crests the steps and gets to the street  nick guns it 
          and it looks like it flies high down the hillside into 
          blackness

          ext the street

          but it lands on more steps  heading downward  bucking 
          almost spinning it bounces onto the next street

          int the porsche

          another set of steps leading up he guns it it rockets up 
          roars bucking 

          ext the street

          and lands on the next street  nick makes a wild right turn 
          onto the street  and the black ferrari appears from around a 
          curve to the right heading right for him

          int the porsche

          nick steps on the gas and heads headon for the ferrari

          the ferrari screams headon for him

          ext the street

          and at the last moment in the game of chicken the ferrari 
          tries to swerve around him on this narrow road goes out of 
          control and over the side turning over and over as it rolls 
          down the hillside

          ext the hillside

          the ferrari has landed rightside up

          he runs down the hillside and gets to it  a beat and he opens 
          the car door

          roxy lies hunched over the wheel her eyes open  her neck is 
          broken  she is dead

          ext the hillside  night

          nick looks at him expressionless

          ext his apartment  night

          he parks his car  it is dark  foggy

          he starts heading inside

          int his apartment  night

          he goes in  he starts to walk up the dark stairway we see 
          him walking up several flights of steps

          int the corridor to his apartment

          he opens his door with his key

          int his apartment

          he walks in  the apartment is dark

                                    a voice
                               behind him
                        hi

          it is a whisper almost a hiss  he spins fast  catherine 
          stands there pressing herself against a wall  they look at 
          each other a long beat  she looks like she is almost in a 
          trance

                                    catherine
                        i heard about it on tv

          he looks at her expressionless  a long beat their eyes are 
          into each other  she looks like she is almost shivering

                                    catherine
                        i cant allow myself to care about 
                        you  i cant allow myself to 
                        care  i cant  i cant 

          she looks very emotional  he moves towards her puts his arms 
          around her holds her very close

                                    catherine
                               in a whisper
                        i dont want to do this  please 
                        i dont want to do this  i lose 
                        everybody  i dont want to lose 
                        you  i dont want to 

          he presses her closer and closer to himself holds her

          int his bedroom  night

          it is dark we cant see clearly

          atop her he makes love to her gently tenderly  
          hardly moving inside her there are tears in her eyes

                                                               dissolve to

          int his bedroom  later

          atop him she is on her knees straddling him he is on 
          his back his eyes are closed her head arches back  her 
          breasts high he strains toward her with his body  she 
          holds her arms high her right hand is in a fist

          we only see the back of her hand and arm it comes down 
          suddenly he bucks writhes then her whole body falls 
          on top of him

          a very long beat

          we cant see him her body completely covers him

          and then finally he moves turns her to the side  kisses 
          her

                                                               dissolve to

          int his bedroom  later

          the stones play sympathy for the devil  in the bg the 
          music is low

          they lie next to each other on the bed  the camera faces them  
          he lies staring at the ceiling on the left side of the bed 
          smoking a cigarette  she is curled away from him toward the 
          right side of the bed  a long beat then 

                                    catherine
                        what do we do now nick

                                    nick
                               after a long beat
                        we fuck like minks  we raise 
                        rugrats  we live happily ever 
                        after

          we see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over  
          he stares at the ceiling

                                    catherine
                        i hate rugrats

                                    nick
                               after a long beat
                        we fuck like minks  we forget the 
                        rugrats  we live happily ever 
                        after

          we see from an angle to the left side of the bed now her face 
          is expressionless  her right arm dangles over the right side 
          of the bed  her right hand is clenched  is she holding 
          something in it against her arm

          we see them from an angle to the left side of the bed now he 
          turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette

          we see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the camera  
          a beat and he turns towards her

          they look at each other  a long beat as the song gets louder  
          we see them in closeup  we dont see her right arm

                                    catherine
                               in a whisper
                        i love you

          a beat and he kisses her  the camera backs away from them 
          slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss and we 

                                                              fade to black

           a long beat as the song keeps playing and we

          fade in

          we see them from the right side of the bedroom  and then the 
          camera lowers slowly as they kiss with more and more passion

          it keeps going lower

          there is something under the bed  the camera moves closer 
          towards it as sympathy for the devil plays louder  we see 
          it now in closeup as the bed rustles above

          it is a thin steelhandled icepick

          the song plays louder and louder and we 

                                                                   fade out

                                     the end
