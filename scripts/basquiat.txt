black

we hear waltzing matilde by tom waits


int museum of modern art – day dream sequence in grainy black 
and white

fade out music 

silence

a welldressed black boy and his mother walk through several 
galleries

they stand before picassos guernica holding hands 

the mother is disturbed crying

the boy looks up confused and frightened concerned to see his 
mother crying in public she looks at him tenderly

her brow furrows she stops crying she stares just above his 
eyes
 
somethings happening she looks with wonder at the top of his 
head his eyes roll upward trying to see – its a crown 

he raises his hands he touches it 

a beam of light illuminates the crown casting its glow on his 
mothers face 

the beam gets whiter the rest of the screen gets black


int cardboard box

silence in darkness we hear a voice – imbued with a sense of its 
own history

voice os
everybody wants to get on the van gogh 
boat theres no trip so horrible that 
someone wont take it the idea of the 
unrecognized genius slaving away in a 
garret is a deliciously foolish one we 
must credit the life of vincent van gogh 
for really sending this myth into orbit 
how many pictures did he sell one he 
couldnt give them away we are so ashamed 
of his life that the rest of art history 
will be retribution for van goghs 
neglect no one wants to be part of a 
generation that ignores another van gogh

the beam of light shines through a small hole it falls upon a 
sleeping dreaming delighted face it belongs to jean michel 
basquiat

outdoor daytime sounds filter in 

hearing the voice jean frowns at being woken up


ext tompkins square park – day

a long rectangular cardboard box 

super new york city


angle on

rene ricard early 30s seated at a park bench hunched over a 
notebook hes a raggedy dandy a poet in a hooded sweatshirt and 
white hightops 

as he writes he reads aloud as if addressing posterity

rene contd
sighing theatrically
in this town one is at the mercy of the 
recognition factor ones  public 
appearance is absolute

beyond him a hand gropes its way out of the box it tosses a can 
of yoohoo chocolate drink

rene contd
i consider myself a metaphor of the 
public i am a public eye i am a witness

a head appears from the box its jeans 

jean sees the start of a crisp colorful autumn day the urban 
park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good 
and bad in life he eases himself out of the oversize box in which 
he has spent the night theres something about the way that he 
stands while waking up that suggests hes almost surprised at his 
own body the adultness of his limbs – just a subtle hint of him 
coming out of a dream

he squints in the sunlight he has a soft gentle haitian face 
his hair is pulled tight to his head he wears two pairs of blue 
jeans one cut like chaps over the other a paintcovered wesleyan 
university tshirt and the inside lining of an overcoat his 
appearance is unruly but its deliberate hes stylish 

he shakes himself off and collects his stuff which includes a 
small book of pontormo drawings a can of black spray paint and a 
cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking 
tape

jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the 
sky 


superimposed in the sky – stock footage of a hawaiian surfer

jean sees the surfer riding the nose in glistening shimmering 
sunlight

ext tompkins square park – day

rene grabs the box for use as a desk and continues to speak out 
loud as he writes 

rene contd os
part of the artists job is to get the 
work where i will see it


ext lower east side st – day

as he speaks we see jean pass the wall of a funeral parlor he 
spraypaints samo as an alternative to god

rene contd os
when you first see a new picture you 
dont want to miss the boat you have to 
be very careful because you may be staring 
at van goghs ear

jean signs his words with his logo a triple pointed crown 

as he presses the spray can we hear the roar of a breaker

a picture of gina using his fingers and the silverware rendering 
her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines

crafts some of the sadder patients stare off into space as jean 
crosses the room he carries a plate of cookies and a full glass 
of milk

he approaches a sad nicelooking middleaged black woman – the 
same one from the dream earlier she sits alone fondling a pillow 
in her lap its his mother matilde she doesnt see him coming

as he sets the plate in front of her she notices him she 
recognizes him and seems pleased even in her isolation he kisses 
her on the cheek

basquiat
hey mom

she smiles slightly 

jean takes a cookie she does likewise

they eat in silence looking at each other communicating what 
they can 

time passes in between cookies her fingers find and break the 
stems of the pillow feathers

cookies

instruments beer cans and homemade art theres a couch with a 
sheet over it 

junk is piled in a corner – mostly art books and drawings 

benny sits down at an electric piano which hes evidently 
playing he sings along softly working out the words

ring at noon and six am 24 strokes
how many times we counted them
we called our bed the cloud
and there wed float
the bathtub was in the kitchen
and took forever to fill up
wed bathe together afterwards
oh the countless cigarettes and
take out chinese food
the bed was so narrow
three years we made it fit
the sheets were green the 
sheets were pink the sheets
white linen from the past
little home farewell
the broken windows
and the bodega on the corner
now from my balcony
i look out over all new york

int ginas apartment – day

jean watches the little rascals on tv in the living room the 
sound is turned off and a record player plays gypsy music loudly

rolled up in a large drop cloth gina is asleep on the floor next 
to her jean works on all fours drawing figures crowns and 
houses

working feverishly he writes hey hey hey in big clusters 
then writes other words shark immortality john the revelator 
fame ink teeth hawaii supermarket pole star baboon and tar

he has an acoustics manual and bible open on the floor he copies 
the technical blueprints from the manual he reads the bible 
following the text with a dirty finger it seems that he watches 
tv draws listens to the music and reads at the same time 

he mixes liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings he 
draws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor up the 
wall through the fridge across the window

he takes off his paintcovered clothes and changes into ginas 
black slip he rummages around the room gathering pieces of his 
and ginas clothes

he spreads the clothes on the floor and selecting wide brushes 
with long bristles picks up the cans of liquitex paint

when paint spills on the clothes he spreads it into shapes

gina wakes up she reaches for one of the painted shirts

gina
in disbelief
basquiat those are my best clothes 
what are you doing

basquiat
cmon baby i painted them for you 
theyre beautiful now

gina

she begins to cry

jean wipes his hands off on his thighs and puts his arms around 
gina holding her

basquiat

gina

jean lets her cry for a moment then notices the music playing on 
the stereo – a gypsy song sung in spanish

basquiat

gina

basquiat
manzanita
translating song

piece of paper i want you to know how

hair your face your face

gina looks up at him

basquiat contd
even though you were never mine
and you never will be

he reaches down wiping off 
ginas face
gypsy gypsy your hair your hair your 
face your face

no longer crying gina leans her head against jean

we hear a call from the window

benny and two guys come barreling into the apartment immediate 
chaos benny holds up a packet of drugs and jiggles it temptingly 
they make themselves at home jean sits with them and starts to 
chop up the drugs 

gina gives jean a look she stands still wrapped in the drop 
cloth she lets it fall to the floor shes wearing only her 
underwear she walks to the bedroom benny watches her

gina doesnt respond she comes out of the bedroom with a small 
suitcase

gina

int ginas apartment – later

kneeling on the floor jean covers the surface of the refrigerator 
door with fast rushing strokes he mixes paint in a large 
soupbowl and dips his hair in the bowl pressing his head to the 
door he paints with his hair he stops to examine the marks 

he hits his head against the door harder and harder

fade to white


int ginas apartment – morning

camera pulls back revealing jeans eyes theyre open and 
motionless his head is tilted toward his chest 

off screen we hear the sounds of gina coming home 

the lock turns the door opens 

gina comes in and drops a bag on the floor

gina

the room theres a lump on the floor its jean

painted hair 

she shakes him harder his body is totally limp

the whites of his eyes are red his pupils slowly float up 
vanishing

gina

she listens to his breath then to his heart

gina
panicking

she finds heroin sprinkled into some pot on the floor near him

gina
slapping his face

proper place

like pinnocchio the long sleep made his limbs wooden

basquiat

he finds an old joint and lights it up

gina
basquiat dont lie

he offers her the joint


ext st marks place – night

jean and benny walk along sharing a beer in a brown paper bag 

they approach a drug dealer and exchange money for dope

jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and carries 
it with him

they sit down on a stoop jean rolls up a dollar bill empties the 
dope onto the window and splits it into two lines he hands the 
rolled up bill to benny who snorts the line 

benny shakes his head involuntarily making a violent face as 
though the dope burned a hole in his sinus

benny
we got beat

basquiat
for real

jean takes a taste with his finger he tastes his tongue and 
makes a face

he snorts part of his line anyway to make sure 

he frowns

they continue onwards jean still carries the window

benny

basquiat
yeah ill paint on it


int party – night

the partys winding down – hiphop kids lower east side types 
jean and benny pass through the room ignoring the two or three 
clusters of people – maybe fifteen in all 

jean encounters a familiar face an enormous redhaired dealer – 
rockets 35 they greet each other as friends 

rockets leads jean aside they stand near a wall where a painting 
hangs flats fixed it bears jeans threepoint crown

rockets

jean shrugs

basquiat

for awhile

jean hands him twenty dollars rockets hands him two dime bags as 
if thinking better he hands the bill back to jean

rockets

jean repockets his money he gestures to rockets as if to say 
fine – its a deal

he and benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the 
window as before this time its good they lean back into it 
slumping down into the couch

nearby rene sits on a couch with three street kids – artists who 
weve seen at milos opening they sit on their knees looking out 
a window passing binoculars back and forth

artist 1 looks through the window with a pair of binoculars he 
points down towards the street trying to get renes attention 

artist 1

rene lunges towards the window the stereo blares curtis blows

them – kind of like photographs weve seen of jackson pollock we 
hear miles davis flamenco sketches


int – basement anninas – day later

grandmaster flashs white lines fills the room 

the walls are covered with halffinished unstretched canvases 
two or three more lie on the floor

he works like a maniac buzzing back and forth from one painting 
to another adding figures crossing out words all the while 
smoking and eating cookies the crumbs fall onto the paintings he 
walks on them 

every so often he refers to a book of davinci drawings torn 
pages litter the floor beneath the book 
 
we hear someone thumping down the stairs 

its rene a puppy follows him 

he dumps a huge load of paint supplies art books and carryout 
ribs the puppy sniffs around happily licking at jean and walking 
over the paintings wagging his tail

he stops the tape player and inserts some persian music

jean empties some foilwrapped bags of coke he cuts a line of 
coke on a foil plate 

rene starts reading from a poem hes evidently written

rene

he sed dont call me boy well

been seeing him for 2 12 years
in kangaroo court i want to be
able to say i never kept a 
slave but he tricked me in
to tying him up and busting his 
face hell jump up at my trial
yelling he wupped me gud

jean warms the plate til the coke crackles and then chases the 
dragon sucking the smoke through a straw

he offers it to rene who refuses he lights and hands rene the 
joint rene takes a hit jean takes it back

jean starts to work again

the puppy runs around chasing after him getting in his way 
running across the paintings jean laughs playing tag the puppy 
gets a hold of jeans sleeve it unravels about ten feet

while jeans playing rene spots a painting with the words famous 
negro athletes

rene

without hearing him jean walks towards the painting and with a 
swipe paints out what rene is pointing to

benny arrives at jeans side holding a bottle of jack daniels and 
a shot glass

benny

jean manages to advance a few more feet through the crowd then 
runs smack into rockets his drug dealer

rockets

step into my office

nearby benny sees this meeting and walks off disgusted thinking 
this is why jean gave him the brush off

basquiat

jean looks off and sees big pink fingering the scarf saying 
something to gina 

gina slaps her in the face

jean tries to get around the dealer

gina turns to leave she catches jeans eye 

she walks out

rockets

gift

the dealer palms something to jean

basquiat

jean steps away from rockets but is trapped in the crowd rockets 
looks after him with disappointment

rene arrives with andy bruno and a photographer

rene
edging his way in
this guy wants a picture

they shrug and crowd in – jean andy and rene the photographer 
gets them to squeeze closer and closer 

photographer

frame

rene fumes albert milo arrives with his parents jack and esther 
milo they are a nice jewish couple in their 70s

basquiat

albert crowds in the photographer snaps a picture and the flash 
blinds everyone momentarily 

albert milo

jean pulls out a joint and lights it as if it were a cigarette he 
offers it to albert who takes a hit

bruno
to jean

for a second 

basquiat

remains smiling waiting for an answer

bruno

andy warhol
bye jean 

jean makes his way through the crowd as we see images of the 
crowd and fragments of paintings as he nears the door he feels 
his arm pulled
 
rene
hissing
you fucking little whore you sold my 
painting im gonna tell you something 
brother – when youre climbing up the 
ladder of success dont kick out the 
rungs believe that shit

basquiat
ill make you another one 

rene
forget it 

he pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing

basquiat
rene –

rene shushes him he hisses loudly like a cat

rene
shhhhhh later
speaking to himself
what is it about art anyway

jean pauses he turns around and surveys the room once more 

a blink 

silence 

we see the crowd in slow motion

everyones eyes are shut

rene os contd
 that we give it so much importance 
artists are respected by the poor because 
what they do is an honest way to get out 
of the slum using ones sheer self as the 
medium the money earned is proof pure and 
simple of the value of that individual 
the artist 


int  ext gallery – night

the camera rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows jean 
as he makes his way toward the street

we begin to dissolve into a montage of stills of artists

rene oscontd
the picture a mothers son does in jail 
hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is 
possible even in the most wretched and 
this is a much different idea than the 
fancier notion that art is a scam and a 
ripoff but you could never explain to 
someone who uses gods gift to enslave 
that you have used gods gift to be free


ext street – night

jean enters a waiting limo it pulls away from the curb

rene finishes as the limo threads its way through the nightlit 
twinkling city


int limo – night

quickly jean gets out of the limo he leaves the door open 

the driver watches as jean talks to two drug dealers 

jean jumps back into the limo

the driver pulls away in the rearview mirror he sees jean 
separate a bag from a bundle of ten he rips it open and snorts 
directly from it 

he lays his head back and takes a deep breath 

basquiat
calm relieved

spontaneously david mcdermott climbs onto the tabletop downstairs

as he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto he glides over 
glasses and plates executing a leap to another table in midsong 

the restaurant staff and other dinner guests watch agape

carefully surrounding with blue

kabuki theater in japan i painted it

painting i felt like he couldve painted 
it or maybe someone else was painting it

they could start over as someone else

that wrote that has the compassion of a 
housefly thats your enemy not your 
audience your audience hasnt even been 
born yet its a lie that art is popular

a crude stone jail – almost medieval – fairytale like a thick 
wooden plank suspended by chains for a bench a candle on the 
wall

a small crowned prince the boy seen in the dream in intro 
looks longingly out the window at rolling green hills terraced 
hillsides cedar trees cottages smoke wafting up from chimneys 
dirt streets

the prince smashes the window he hits his head on the bars 
gripping them tightly 


ext medieval village – day

the villagers cease their activities as they listen to the sound 
looking up they smile as if warmed to their souls by some 
unearthly and intangible substance they look heavenwards

camera follows their collective gaze skywards

we shoot up up into the sky

basquiat os
there was this little prince with a magic 
crown an evil warlock kidnapped him 
locked him in a cell in a huge tower and 
took away his voice there was a window 
made of bars the prince would smash his 
head against the bars hoping that someone 
would hear the sound and find him the 
crown made the most beautiful sound that 
anyone ever heard you could hear the 
ringing for miles it was so beautiful 
that people wanted to grab the air they 
never found the prince he never got out 
of the room but the sound he made filled 
everything up with beauty

basquiat os
its definitely time to get out of here
