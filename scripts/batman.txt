year old in gotham city or any

blackness of the theater

ext gotham movie theater  street  night

family exits the theater heads down a deserted street  suddenly  a 
flash of lightning  a closer louder clap of thunder  dr wayne takes 
marthas arm  bruce straggles behind staring at the pavement

there is a deafening roar as chill fires the gun lifting dr wayne off 
his feet hurling him backwards

bruce

martha screams  a bolt of lightning flashes  chill turns

chill

martha
oh my god

martha tries to escape but is jerked back by chills hand as it closes 
on her necklace  bruce runs at chill grabs him by the leg tries to 
pull him down

bruce

chill fires again  the necklace snaps free as martha is jerked 
backwards then crumples next to her husband

close on bruce

he kneels over his mothers body pauses in shock then looks up the 
barrel of chills gun comes into frame

close on chill

the necklace in one hand his gun in the other  he looks down at 
bruce his expression suddenly changing

back to bruce

he stares at chill his jaw inadvertently twitching with rage  a loud 
clap of thunder rolls across the sky  bruces eyes have become steel 
visible fury shooting forth from them in an almost demonic fashion

chills gun hand suddenly starts to tremble  incredibly the savage 
face of this young boy has unnerved him

chill
stoplookin at me like that kid
no response
stop looking at me like that

suddenly  a flash of lightning  rain begins to fall in sheets  
chill runs up to the street disappears into the rainswept darkness

angle on apartment building

lights have flicked on in the apartment building across the street  
faceless witnesses stand silhouetted in the windows gazing down at the 
tragedy across the street

camera pushes in on one particular window  a shadowy figure half
emerges from the darkness his face still hidden from us  all that is 
visible is an oversized pair of striped pants and a large white daisy 
stuck through the coat lapel  the shadowy figure pauses then reaches 
out an arm and slowly lowers the window shade

from behind the shade  an insane maniacal giggle starts to rise  
tiny at first but gradually building to a sudden explosion of 
cascading frightening glee

back to bruce

kneeling in the rain across the street paralyzed with shock and grief  
he looks up from the bodies of his parents as a couple approaches along 
the pavement above

bruces voice
helpoh please help me

the couple stop stare down at the scene

bruce
itsmy mom and dad  pleasei
think theyre dead

the couple exchange a quick horrified glance then hurry off down the 
street

back to bruce

sobbing uncontrollably now tears mixing with the rain  in the 
distance the low whine of an approaching siren  camera rises into the 
night sky

a flashing bolt of lightning rips across the screen the residue 
remains in the night sky  a searing yellow dot  another bolt of 
lightning  another yellow dot  then a deafening clap of thunder as 
the grayblack clouds arrange themselves into a dark and eerie 
silhouette  the siren grows louder piercing shrilly through the 
rumblings of the storm  the silhouette becomes more familiar now as 
the billowing clouds form themselves into a dark cape  the dots of 
lightning begin to pulsate as they evolve into two searing yellow eyes

this then is the signal of the future presence of the dark redeemer of 
the night  the black wraith  the avenger of countless wrongs

ironic

ext gotham  day

a more downbeat section of gothams business district  camera closes 
on a specific building the monarch playing card company  thornes 
voice continues over

that a good man like thomas wayne
who spoke up so forcefully for the
rights of criminals should himself
become the ultimate victim

contiguous deck of cards  there are harlequin chairs jesters and

edges it across the table toward chill who eyes it suspiciously

smile becomes cruel

thorne on tv
in the meantime our hearts go out
to the wayne family particularly to

back to joker

watching thorne  his face twists into a cruel smile

thorne
thoughtful pause
and id like to think that one day
thomas wayne will look down on this
earth and this city and say

as thorne and the joker speak simultaneously

thorne  joker

rupert thorne is one heck of a city
councilman

board being held by a japanese instructor

lashes out  then  an instantaneous second scream as his fist crumples 
against the unyielding board

bruce stands facing a large brightly colored archery target on the 
lawn of wayne manor  from os behind his back we hear a whirring 
sound

close on arrow gun

a gleaming steel arrow clicks into the firing slot of an automatic
fire gatling gun device  suddenly  it fires

back to bruce

wheeling around to face the onrushing whizzing arrow  lifting a 
heavily padded hand to catch it in midair

he misses  the arrow thunks into his chest directly over his heart  
bruce sighs removes the arrow jerking it out of his hidden protective 
vest

bruce

another arrow whizzes at him  bruce drops to one knee this time 
almost catching it as the steel tip rips away a piece of the heavy 
padding on his hand

to his housekeeping

int exercise room  day

bruce is on the rings again  by now using them with considerable 
expertise swinging his body in somersaults then performing the 
difficult iron cross maneuver  he pauses at full extension then 
swings back launches himself towards the parallel bars

catching the bars expertly he performs a complicated routine pausing 
at the top to look across the room

a thin balance beam sits below ten feet away

bruce swings back one more time on the upper parallel bar then flies 
through the air for the beam  his feet land on top for one split 
tenuous second  he teeters  then crashes heavily to the floor  
shaking his head to clear the cobwebs he stares back at the beam 
determined

mystified

narrowly missing him

bruce is scaling the side of the house  a thick rope encircles the 
chimney of wayne manor as bruce makes his way up the structure hand 
over hand  suddenly  the old brick chimney starts to crumble  the 
rope jerks free as bricks fly everywhere and bruce tumbles heavily down 
to the lawn at alfred feet

bruce looks up grins sheepishly  alfred glances back up at the 
demolished chimney then back down at bruce again

alfred
santa will be heartbroken

int karate studio  day

a terrifying scream  a pine board is smashed to smithereens by a 
lightningquick fist

bruce wheels to face camera  he is now seventeen years old  cool 
clear eyes flick in the opposite direction as

two students charge him  he flips one over his head flips the other 
while simultaneously spinning around to face the instructor who closes 
ranks from behind

the fight is furiously expert  hands and feet working like windmills  
bruce is parrying every thrust the
instructor has to offer countering every move but is nonetheless 
being backed into a corner

the instructor moves in for the kill as bruce suddenly vaults up and 
over him in a sevenfoot backflip  grabbing the mans black belt from 
behind for leverage he hoists the instructor over his head then sends 
the bewildered man flying through the air crashing onto the mat in a 
heap

bruce looks over suddenly concerned  he holds the instructors black 
belt in his hands  the instructor is halfdazed in some pain  his 
eyes suddenly pop open  he grins broadly back at bruce

instructor
thats okay  keep it

out brokers face alfred and bruce

drives in his final piton hoists himself up onto the tiny circular 
crest of the needle

victory personified

int wayne manor living room  night

it is late  alfred relaxes in an easy chair reading an edition of the 
gotham tribune

strikes again

alfred puts down the paper stifling a yawn  he hears a muted voice 
from upstairs rises curiously

int bruces bedroom  night

bruce is spreadeagled on the bed fully clothed  fast asleep  a 
voice drones from a bedside tape recorder

tape voice
an atom with a magnetic dipole ex
posed to a nonuniform magnetic field
undergoes a linear force in addition
to its tendency toward orientation

alfred stops in the doorway with a sympathetic look

tape voice contd
the use of an atomic beam makes
possible an observation of an
induced transition

alfred switches off the tape adjusts a quilted coverlet over bruce 
with a paternal smile

int exercise room  day

camera pans past the balancing beam parallel bars and exercise rings 
to bruce who faces them confidently but this time with a big 
difference  he is blindfolded  he takes a tentative step forward 
gauging his distance then leaps up into the air  grabbing the rings 
with perfect accuracy  he performs a series of difficult routines with 
clockwork precision then swings through the air to the parallel bars 
latching on to the lower one then propelling himself up to the higher 
one  his gyrations become faster gaining speed and momentum  
suddenly  he launches himself toward the balance beam

bruce lands on the end of the beam like a cat  keeping his balance 
having calculated the exact distance to the inch  he steps forward 
with total security travels the length of the beam with the ease of a 
pedestrian  reaching the end he does a complete forward somersault 
lands solidly on his feet  bruce removes his blindfold stares back at 
the path hes just taken amazed by himself

alfreds voice
incredible

bruce turns  a proud alfred beams from the doorway

alfred
why you were blind as a bat sir

thunder clap  rain falls as he reaches into the car takes out a 
topcoat and hat  he starts to pull the convertible top up glances 
down the street

people scurry to avoid the rain  down the block across the street a 
couple with a young daughter look over nervously as a toughlooking 
biker on a huge harleydavidson rolls up parallel to them on the 
street

gun he herds them back into a dark alleyway

explodes across the street for the alleyway

at bruce through the rain  he rolls forward slowly almost as if 
enticing bruce to follow him now disappears again

back to bruce

bruce arrives at the rear of the building which faces on a vacant dirt 
lot  he edges forward through the mud turning the corner suddenly 
coming face to face with

the biker  still grinning  switching off his harley  muscles bulging 
through his wet tshirt as he dismounts

biker
congratulations man
wide smile

the roar of engines is heard  bruce turns to see  two more bikers 
rolling into position behind him  bruce is hopelessly trapped

the other two bikers now dismount and close in  the first biker draws 
his gun  biker 2 looks bruce up and down critically squinting at him 
through the rain

biker 2

biker 2 snaps his arm forward  a switchblade appears in his hand  he 
flicks it at bruce who stands his ground slicing a button off the 
front of his raincoat

biker 2 contd

lick it clean and hand me my coat

bruce stares icily then slowly bends down to retrieve the button from 
the mud  suddenly  biker 1s foot flashes into frame headed 
straight at bruces face  in a lightningquick move bruce grabs the 
swinging leg with both hands rises swings biker 1 off the ground in 
a circle sends him crashing into the motorcycles as his gun goes 
flying

from his belt  bruce sidesteps  the knife slashes through his 
raincoat sending it billowing out behind him like a cape  biker 3 
whistles the chains past bruces ear  he snatches them karatekicks 
biker 3 in the stomach simultaneously belting biker 2 across the

int living room  night

bruce enters the empty living room  his expression is numb  he 
pauses lost in thought  then moving as if by instinct he heads for 
the stairs leading to the basement

int basement hallway  night

bruce descends the stairs walks down the hallway to a door  he stops 
looks down at the heavy padlock which seals it shut  his eyes close in 
pain remembering an earlier time

int young bruces lab  night

seen through dim halflight  his childhood lab is coated with dust  a 
room obviously left unused for years  we hear a key turning in the 
lock  the door to the lab swings open  bruce trains a flashlight on 
the interior of the musty room  he enters finds a light switch flips 
it on

the lab table is much as we remember it crammed with old test tubes 
beakers etc  bruce crosses stares down lost in his past then 
switches on the holograph machine  he stares  stunned and amazed as

the holograph figure of tenyearold bruce wayne springs to life  an 
exact visual reproduction of the child who used to be  the young boy 
peers down through a cobwebbed microscope in precisely the position we 
first saw him

bruces eyes fill with tears  he shuts them tightly as he hears a 
voice from long ago

young bruces voice
its called a holograph dad
pretty neat huh

one laser beam suddenly shorts out with age  the image of young bruce 
disappears  the second beam continues to burn its energy directed at 
a disintegrating basement wall

bruce slumps at the other side of the table oblivious his face buried 
in his hands

overlapping images and voice start to appear on the screen

martha wayne			    giggling with young bruce then kissing 
her husband passionately

dr waynes voice
this  is definitely not a guy

thomas wayne			   his face twisted in anguish as chills 
bullet blows

marthas voice
oh my god  no

a sharp crack	     as a piece of something crumbles away

angle on bruce

looking up  staring across the room

the remaining laser beam has eaten away a piece of the basement wall  
there is a dull echoing thud as the plaster hits the bottom of some 
unseen cavernous space below

back to bruce

rising  crossing curiously to the hole in the wall  training his 
flashlight torch through it

angle down hole  his pov

an immense cavern trails down and away into the blackness  a network 
of aged timbers intersect themselves shoring up the side of the 
foundation

back to bruce

staring  playing his flashlight against the visible parts of the 
underground cavity  he picks up a beaker from the lab table then lets 
it fall through the hole  there is an interminable wait  finally  
the impact of shattering glass

angle back through hole

seen from inside  the torch beam shines  suddenly  a long length of 
rope is tossed through  bruce appears in the opening  he wriggles 
through hanging on to the rope

bruce expertly shimmies down the rope a man completely at home in an 
action he knows well  the beam from the torch dances across the walls 
of the cavern  highribbed jagged walls suggesting some sort of 
labyrinth beyond  the rope has played out  bruce hangs by the end 
looks down lets himself fall to the cavern floor below

he rises plays the torch against the sides of the cave

angle on beam  his pov

the beam searches into crannies exploring dark gray walls  it comes 
across a large patch of solid black

back to bruce

looking curiously

back to black patch

as the beam hits the black patch fully  dozens of yellow eyes appear  
the entire mass launches itself into camera with a terrifying screech 
and the sound of beating wings

back to bruce

his jaw drops stunned as the colony of bats swarm over him  he 
stumbles protecting his face  the torch drops to the floor  its 
shaft of light dances crazily around the cavern

from os  a low moan is heard from bruce  it rises gathers in 
volume and intensity gradually becoming a deep booming guttural roar 
 at once a scream of total pain and a cry of defiance  the terrified 
bats scream back in a maze of hot and cold light bouncing off beating 
black wings

int alfreds bedroom  night

the wind and rain batter against alfreds partially open bedroom 
window  mixed with the sounds  a strong echo of the roar from the 
cavern  alfreds eyes pop open  he rises groggily makes his way to

ext cemetery  close on moon  night

a flashing lightning bolt  camera pans down from the moon through the 
raging storm to the graves of thomas and martha wayne in the country 
cemetery high on the hill

kneeling between them is bruce  fists clenched head bowed tiny 
rivulets of water running off his face and body  totally lost in 
silent prayer

up to his nose inhales deeply shaking his head

steelgray skintight fabric stretched across a massively muscled 
chest

whether to laugh or obey

sending it whizzing in the direction of the voice

close on knife

the knife whistles through the air toward camera  suddenly a black
gloved hand miraculously snatches it out of midair spinning it then 
sends it flying back
the switchblade pierces the corsage jerking it out of the thugs hand 
sticking it into the wall where it quivers behind him  the thug 
freezes turning white

voice

cuffed to overhanging metal handholds  the center vertical pole

camera looks down from the roof of a gotham skyscraper at the windows 
of a fortystory apartment house below

camera holds on a pair of glass doors leading out to a rosettacarved 
stone balcony  clearly visible through the doors  an elderly couple 
lie face down on the floor of their living room guarded by a masked 
burglar holding a shotgun  another burglar has managed to open a wall 
safe and begins stuffing valuables into a gunny sack

camera zooms back

we are some thirty stories higher across a wide avenue

a blackgloved hand enters frame holding a thin clear nylon cord with 
a tiny barbed fishhook on the end

the other gloved hand steadies a gleaming titanium rifle barrel with an 
infrared scope  the fishhook is threaded through the chamber

a flap is opened in a thick compartmentalized black belt  the 
moonlight glints off a cylindrical silver gas cartridge

angle across street through scope

seen through the magnified infrared scope  the cross hairs of the 
rifle sight settle in on the head of the burglar holding the shotgun

the cross hairs pause  then suddenly lower to the balcony  the rifle 
fires with an audible hiss of compressed gas

angle on rosetta balcony

as the fishhook whistles through a hole in the rosetta stone framework 
of the balcony  on impact with the floor it pops open  expanding to 
ten times its size having now become an effective grappling hook

the burglar with the shotgun turns at the muffled metallic noise looks 
through the glass doors at the empty balcony

ext balcony floor

the grappling hook inches across the balcony floor catching a firm 
hold against the stone

ext skyscraper roof  night

the nylon cord has been pulled taut  it disappears down into the 
blackness at a dizzying height some four hundred feet above the avenue 
and crisscrossing traffic lights below

blackgloved hands take hold of the cord testing it

an ominous black shadow cape billowing out behind in an eerie 
silhouette passes in front of the glowing yellow ball of the full 
moon

angle down cord at balcony

the balcony and double glass doors whistle up at camera at a dizzying 
speed growing larger by the millisecond

int apartment  night

the burglar has finished his work at the safe  he nods to the other 
burglar who grins then cocks his shotgun pointing it down at the 
helpless couple on the floor

the flicker of an outside shadow flits across the room  the burglar 
blinks wheels with his shotgun

suddenly  the double doors explode with a hail of shattering glass  
almost simultaneously  the shotgun fires

int young bruces lab  day

young bruce waynes lab room remains much as we remember it except 
that the gaping hole in the wall caused by the laser has been 
reinforced and shaped into a doorway  a makeshift ladderlike 
stairway leads down into the cavern below

footsteps are heard climbing the ladder from deep within the cave  
after a moment bruce appears stripped to the waist still wearing his 
utility belt and the bottom half of his batman suit  his chest and 
stomach are nicked with small cuts and bruises from his previous 
nights work  his forehead glistens with sweat born of utter 
exhaustion  he sits heavily on a cot buries his face in his hands 
looks up suddenly as the door to the lab opens

alfred enters stares silently first appalled by bruces physical 
condition then shaking his head with sympathy  bruce stares back 
eyes heavy with lack of sleep

bruce
youthink im crazy dont you
certifiably insane

alfred
pause smile
a biteccentric perhaps

bruce
itswhat i have to do alfred
after all those years of searching
 it was always what i had to do

alfred
if i may be permitted sir
with difficulty
ivenever had any children of my
own  never saw the advantage in it

always thought myself more talented
at raising flowers than people

simply watched you grow

conference on a tiny transistor set next to him  his eyes flutter open 
with amusement

tv reporter
well considering the fact he apprehended

transfixed by what he sees

a stunninglooking woman silver st cloud steps out onto the high 
board of the pool dressed in a daringlycut shiny white latex tank 
suit  a shining mane of glistening silver hair cascades down across 
her shoulders  she pauses a shimmering white diamond in the sun

to know that several polls taken

to smile at him and wave

when

at silver who executes a complicated but perfect dive into the pool

bruce wayne greets his arriving guests his neck craning around in vain 
for a sight of silver

gordon stands by the bar downs a double scotch scowls at guests who 
talks animatedly to him while flapping his arms like wings  doing a 
crude imitation of the batman  the guest howls with laughter moves 
off as gordon orders another drink and bruce joins him with a 
sympathetic smile

bruce

ext wayne manor  night

now heading into the driveway is a brightly painted version of an old
time twenties paddy wagon with two lookalikes of the old keystone 
kops riding on top  they honk a comical horn loudly as laughing 
parking attendants greet them

int wayne manor  angle on dance floor

bruce and silver glide smoothly across the floor  a perfect fit  
bruce looks down curiously

oddly dressed gentlemen outside with a
singing telegram for the commissioner

alfred

bruce makes his way to the bandstand whispers some instructions to the 
bandleader  a loud fanfare is played  all conversation stops as the 
front door opens

now entering wayne manor  the two keystone kops in their twenties 
costumes with handlebar moustaches  they dance their way to the center 
of the room in a prearranged routine singing in harmony from pirates 
of penzance

kops
when a felons not engaged in his
employment
or maturing his felonious little
plans
his capacity for innocent enjoyment
is just as great as any honest
mans
oh a policemans lot is not a happy
one

the guests applaud loudly  gordon joins bruce and silver as the kops 
break into a vaudeville routine

kop
excuse me sir  have you seen a
policeman around here

kop 2

kop
drawing gun

several guests laugh  bruce winces at the bad joke

kop 2
but this watch isnt worth anything
it only has a sentimental value

kop
well give it to me anyway  i feel
like a good cry

gordon laughs loudly as the kop turns to him

kop contd
now commissioner if we could
borrow your watch for a moment

gordon
taking it off

the kop smiles takes the watch dangles it from his hand  kop 2 
silently sidles in behind bruce and silver

smithereens  kop 2s gun suddenly at the back of silvers head 
hammer cocked

the guests scream as six more kops burst through the front door 
carrying automatic weapons  bruce silver and gordon are herded back 
against the wall with the others

the kop grins then suddenly starts to giggle insanely  he takes off 
his helmet as a shock of green hair is exposed  he wipes his lips 
clean which now become ruby red  cackling in glee the joker faces his 
victims his gaze suddenly becoming cruel and cold

joker

jewels and no ones headll wind
up looking like the commissioners
watch capisce

kop 3
hey boss  look

the joker turns  kop 3 and a partner have set gordons huge birthday 
cake on the floor now wade through it stomping up and down kicking 
the insides across the room

kop 3
were doing the cake walk

the joker giggles then shoots a satanically maniacal look at the 
guests who instantly begin stripping off their jewelry taking out 
wallets etc as more kops pass by with a gunny sack  the joker walks 
down the line stopping to level a searching and curious gaze into the 
eyes of

bruce wayne between gordon and silver his face set eyes steely 
staring at the joker  his jaw twitches

silver watches him noticing the twitch  she gives him a tiny 
sympathetic smile then turns to face

kop 2 who has moved down the line to silver  he looks her up and 
down hungrily as she stares back in defiance  his fingers slowly reach 
up to grip her necklace then linger

kop 2
in your case lady id like to
rip the rest off and leave this on

suddenly  bruces fist flashes into frame  kop 2 is knocked backward 
through the air as another kop lunges at bruce who grabs the gunny sack 
filled with jewelry and bashes him in the face  the kop crumples to 
the floor as bruce wheels to face the joker and sees

the joker grinning cruelly the barrel of his gun pressing up under 
silvers chin  her eyes are welded shut with fear

joker
now that was extremely bad manners
mr wayne  especially from someone
gestures
to the manor born
giggles
so why dont you rejoin the lady here
or if you like
cocks gun glowers
i can send part of her over to you

bruce hesitates then rejoins the line  the joker lowers his gun 
turns to stare at a painting on the wall as a kop holds out the open 
gunny sack to gordon

gordon
to joker
ill see you rot in the gas chamber
for this

the joker smiles ignoring him looking at the portrait painting which 
is of a distinguished older man  he removes it from the wall  an 
indignant alfred speaks up from farther down the line of guests

alfred
be careful you clot  that portrait
goes back to mr waynes grandfather

joker
why  is there something wrong with
it

the joker cackles punching the painting out of its frame

close on bruce and silver

bruce stares silently  his jaw twitches with anger born of 
humiliation  silver notices again

silver
whisper
look on the bright side  youre
adorable when your jaw twitches

back to scene

the joker crosses to gordon with the empty picture frame  another kop 
points a camera as the joker holds the frame up to encircle his and 
gordons face

but pleasant enough in a harmless
sort of way

bruce

around in the middle of all you
hardworking ants

silver
something like that

bruce takes her hand gently stares deeply into her eyes

bruce
and you  how would you describe me

silver
staring back
i dont think youre harmless  and
i dont think anyone whos looked
straight in your eyes could say so

bruces jaw twitches involuntarily  silver grins  he leans in kisses 
her lingeringly on the mouth  they break  he gazes into her 
disoriented eyes

as a kid they always had to drag me
off the roller coaster

stupor  the bottle of scotch next to him has clearly been emptied

suddenly  a gust of cold wind ruffles his hair  his eyes flutter 
then look over at the open office window

gordon

eased scum infesting this city

gordon backs up toward his desk smiles nervously

gordon
of course it is

criminals are a cowardly lot at heart
but human garbage like the joker is
taking over gotham  in spite of
everything that you and other men of
good will can do about it

gordon

batman

to rally around  someone who isnt
hamstrung by the very laws hes
sworn to uphold whose hands arent
tied with red tape  they have a
right to justice

gordon

pulls gun from
drawer
thats why youre under arrest

gordon levels the gun  they are frozen for a moment  batman advances 
slowly  he speaks in measured tones eyes clear voice almost 
hypnotic

batman
you wont pull that trigger because
you realize im your last chance
youre fighting a war youve already
lost and you know it

batman stands inches away from the gun barrel now  gordon peers deeply 
into his eyes through the cowl

cooperation  together we could rid
the streets of gotham of violence
and corruption

gordon blinks  his gun hand wavers

interconnecting steel girders jutting out over the black waters of 
gotham river

forty floors above the water seems to be aiming his gun into the 
blackness

i think weve run out of floors

a black cape swirls around the side of a girder  malone panics 
squeezes the trigger rapid fire  then  silence

gang of handcuffed crooks is being led off by the police

back to girders

river  he clicks his gun  empty  throws it at the batman missing 
him  the batman advances coldly

batman
they say a cornered rat can be dan
gerous  you dont look so tough

as batman advances suddenly  his foot slips  he tumbles over the 
side of the girder hangs on his fingers jammed into the rivet holes

angle on below

an audible gasp from the assembled audience

back to batman

straining to hold on his fingers almost coming out of their sockets  
he looks down  the network of girders dissolves dizzyingly into black

malone starts forward grinning broadly

malone

malone claps loudly  batman winces hangs on

malone contd
now a foot

malone brings one show down hard on batmans hand grinds it in  then 
the other foot on the remaining hand  batman grimaces in unbelievable 
pain

suddenly  batman swings his leg back  he bursts forward again in an 
arc propelling his feet under the girder and up again around the other 
side  his boots crash into the back of malones legs  launching him 
out into space with an agonizing scream

the batman stands on the girder looking down  he gives a tiny salute 
then dives out into the night  sailing down through the blackness for 
more than a hundred feet he hits the river with an enormous splash 
then disappears

back to gordon

gordon watches stunned as a reporter comes up

reporter

drapery in the shape of an open umbrella also in black and white  it

head a thermometer sticking out of his mouth

propped up on black silk sheets against blackandwhite checkered 
pillows  a cooing sound makes him glance at a partially opened window 
where a pigeon has landed now looks at him questioningly  the penguin 
makes a clucking birdlike sound of welcome which the pigeon seems to 
recognize  it flies over to his bed hops up into his lap

wrapped around her neck

nautilus machines rings  even a trapeze  the acetylene torch whines

camera pans  another section features a myriad of complicated machines 
and a fully equipped crime lab

past the crime lab  bruce lies on his back under a partially 
constructed futuristic automobile  he trains an acetylene torch 
against one section as the sparks fly  its just the shell of a car 
now  other sections and odd electronic devices are strewn about the 
area  bruce shuts off his torch removes a faceplate reaches back for 
a long cylindrical network of crisscrossing cables  he starts to fit 
it onto one underside edge of the chassis

bruce

spaghetti in aid of

versions of the cabled cylinders  they stand upright some eight feet 
apart from each other  bruce leans down opens the top of a large 
transformer box

leads to form a force field of a
million volts

bruce flips a switch  dazzling blue light begins to dance between the 
cable cylinders  alfred turns with the gun in his hands as bruce calls 
to him from behind the sparkling wall of blue light

suddenly

too late  alfred fires  the bullet bounces off the blue wall of 
light then ricochets back at alfred pinging into the cavern wall next 
to his head  alfred hits the deck as the lead cartridge continues a 
seemingly endless path of ricochets until there is sudden silence

alfred rises sweat dripping from his brow  bruce grins turning off 
the blue light

nervously

archerd
youretaking quite a chance
showing up in public like this

batman
the way i see it were all taking
quite a chance if we let a sick
criminal mind like the joker paralyze
this entire community with fear

an angry muttering is heard from within the crowd

crowd member

face if youve got the guts

the crowd hangs back confused and frightened  more angry muttering is 
heard now mixed in with boos

councilman thorne is right of
course  and i expect every other
decent citizen of gotham city to
stand up and be counted

beat thorne theatrically extends his arm to silver who hesitates then 
reluctantly joins him  they start for the orchestra section as others 
in the crowd begin to follow

avoiding his gaze
well i was younger than you are

napkin squeezing it into a tiny ball

wander then suddenly spots something

onto the ribbon near the center of the page  she moans still 
recovering from the effects of the drugs

like a human dynamo

he turns looks  batman has disappeared

ext gotham museum  dawn

the gurney carrying silvers body is loaded into an ambulance  it 
takes off red lights flashing siren wailing  the rising sun is just 
beginning to crack the clouds on the horizon  camera widens starts to 
rise

the ambulance becomes a tiny red dot as we now view the magnificent 
downtown section of gotham

camera continues to rise shooting up some eighty stories then ninety 
then one hundred finally revealing

we dissolve as

the dark majestic figure of the batman standing on the top edge of 
the tallest building in gotham  he looks down silently cape billowing 
out behind him a regal black prince surveying his steel and concrete 
realm

now swinging up and across from a nearby lower building

the imposing grimfaced colorful figure of robin  dressed in his 
green shirt red vest flowing yellow cape and black mask he lands on 
the roof noiselessly

batmans eyes acknowledge his presence without turning  robin 
advances then stops silently several paces behind

the dynamic duo has been joined  both for now and for the future 
adventures which await them in gotham

fade to black

the end
