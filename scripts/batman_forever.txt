                   better for you

                                 bruce
                   so what youre saying this guys a

                                 bruce
                   you have a thing for bats

         chase follows his gaze

                                 chase

         bruce looks back up in fact just an ink blot only he
         saw a bat within its bleeding lines

                                 chase
                   i think the question would be do
                   you have a thing for bats

                                 bruce

                   not much

                                 chase

                   obsession is born of fear recall a
                   moment of great terror in your life
                   say you associate that moment
                   with
                          random
                   a bat the bats image becomes a
                   cancer of the mind grows more real
                   than your daily life can you
                   imagine something like that

                   why not ruin him first expose his
                   frailty and then when he is at his
                   weakest crush him in your hand

314      bruce scans the room as he and chase pause by the first       314
         display where a socialite steps into a column of energy
         she gasps with delight as she finds herself suddenly
         dazzling in diamonds from head to toe

315      they pass the next column where a chubby professor sword     315
         in hand fights off a knight on horseback

316      they pass the next display where a bald guy steps into a      316
         beam suddenly he is in a classic stoners pad circa
         1967 and best of all he has long flowing hair

         chase looks amused bruce suspicious

336      int  abandoned station  ventilation shaft                   336

         a wide spiral staircase of scaffolding hugs the walls of
         a tremendous ventilation shaft

         the thugs race down the steps knocking out bits of
         scaffolding as they go sending entire chunks of already
         traversed staircase plummeting past them

         pan up

         batman arrives on a wide platform of scaffolding at the
         top of the staircase his cape whips up around him as if
         from some low infernal wind

337      batman  pov down the fragmenting staircase at the bottom   337
         of the shaft a tremendous fan spins chewing chunks of
         falling scaffolding and plaster spitting plumes of dust

338      twoface                                                      338

         stands at the bottom of the well he grabs a rack of
         scaffolding and wrenches the old aluminum supports away

339      the platform                                                  339

         where batman is standing gives way planks falling
         sending batman tumbling towards the deadly blades below

340      batman  pov the giant whirling blades coming up fast      340

341      batman falls stairways and laughing thugs whipping past     341
         his hand shoots out and grabs

         a thug

         by the jacket wrenching the fabric over the goons head
         jerking him hard into the railing like a human anchor

         batman climbs the struggling thug like a ladder leaps
         onto the staircase cracks the thugs head on the rail
         then races down the stairs

342      bottom of the shaft                                           342

         the remaining thugs disappear through a dark doorway
         batman runs past the beating fan blades into

343      int  abandoned tunnel                                        343

         dark steep and sloping the thugs are running dead
         ahead without stopping they begin grabbing pieces of
         debris flip them under their feet begin riding down the
         descending tunnel like snowboarders

         batman races after them

344      the snowboarders                                              344

         really are good they ride the rails the low gas pipes
         even bank the curving sides of the tunnel

345      a thug  close looks back to see batman closing mistake    345

         whip pan

         as he is clotheslined by a low hanging danger sign he
         flies off the snowboard backwards out cold

         batman races past him

346      the end of the tunnel slopes so drastically the dark maw      346
         at the end seems more a pit than a door

347      the boarders circle and one by one drop through like         347
         bits of filth down a drain

348      batman drops into the darkness landing on a small ledge      348
         beyond a precipitous drop he turns to face

349      int  abandoned subway station                                349

         years ago this cavernous space glistened with immense
         gothic statuary elaborate tile mosaics tremendous
         decorative arches and spectacular cathedral ceilings

         no more

         now the giant space from floor to ceiling is a frozen
         maelstrom of twisting cast iron trusses broken steam
         pipes fragmented scaffolding and hanging cables

350      down these manmade slopes and obstacles ride the             350
         snowboarding thugs cruising pipes jumping curved faces
         of statues jacking from scaffold to truss

351      batman whips a pair of nunchucks from his belt over a        351
         hanging metal rail using the chain as a pulley shoots
         down a curving rail into the mad dance of twisting steel

352      a thug                                                        352

         fires at him from his whizzing board as it careens along
         an adjacent piece of scaffolding

353      batman angles towards him picking up speed                  353

354      the thug banks off some statuary takes a few more shots     354

355      batman shoots around the curve jumps from one rail to        355
         the next catches the villain in the face with his boot
         and sends him flying

356      another thug shoots past over head                           356

357      batman flips onto another pipe is closing fast chasing      357
         the thug towards a loop that banks towards the blackness
         of an abandoned tunnel

         he is closing on the thug closer closer

358      suddenly the thug hops to a truss the rail batman is on     358
         whipping him around a curve that banks into the mouth of
         the tunnel over gunshots

359      twoface                                                      359

         stands in the shadows firing his machine pistol blowing
         a hole in the curving rail directly in front of batman

360      the rail breaks                                              360

         batman flies off directly into the dark tunnel

361      batman  pov a rushing darkness he smashes into a wall     361

362      int  mouth of tunnel                                         362

         twoface stands staring into the dark with his thugs he
         grabs an aging valve wheel set into the crumbling wall

                                 twoface
                   nothing worse than a bad case of
                   gas

         he begins to turn the creaking wheel

363      int  inner tunnel                                            363

         a long forgotten pipe by batman begins to hiss a thick
         purple gas

364      int  mouth of tunnel                                         364

         twoface swings a grenade launcher before him takes a
         step back aims into the tunnel

                                 twoface
                   lights camera action

         as his thugs scramble for cover twoface fires the
         grenade flies into the tunnel slamming into the gas
         main an explosion

         suddenly a tremendous secondary explosion debris falls
         everywhere as the gas ignites the mouth of the tunnel
         suddenly brightening into a flaming white fireball

365      int  tunnel                                                  365

         the huge fireball rushes towards batman batman wraps
         himself in his cape

366      hand  close as he reaches to his utility belt presses a    366
         stud there

367      his cape begins to run and flow like water morphing into      367
         a protective sphere just as

368      a tremendous fireball roars races down the tunnel             368
         engulfing batman in a world of flame

369      int  mouth of tunnel                                         369

         twoface stands staring into the inferno

         billowing smoke residual flame and falling debris
         everywhere no batman a moment of dead quiet

                                 twoface
                   finally

         then twofaces smirk vanishes

                                 thug
                   it cant be

370      reverse angle                                                 370

         a shape rises phoenixlike out of the flames the
         figure moves forward

371      batman  close as his cape parts over his face              371

         wider

         he lifts his arms the cape splitting down the center
         reverting to its original form arms going wide to
         familiar wings

         the bat heads towards twoface and his men

372      twoface  close consumed with rage                         372

         he grabs a section of the walls support scaffolding
         and begins to wrench it free with crazed fury

                                 twoface
                   why wont you just die

         in a final rage of maniacal fury harvey wrenches the
         scaffolding free its ancient supports gone

373      the ceiling                                                   373

         begins to crack and fall debris pouring in at an ever
         more furious pace

         batman is suddenly doused in a rain of rock and sand

374      the tunnel                                                    374

         between harvey and batman is obstructed by tons of
         falling metal and plaster and sand twoface stands as
         the ceiling falls all around him

375      batman is driven down by a storm of wreckage                 375

376      twoface can barely contain his joy plaster and rubble       376
         fall ever more furiously

377      batman stumbles as the ground beneath him suddenly gives     377
         sucking him into a quickly filling pit of sand and tile

         he reaches for his utility belt but its too late

378      batman is nearly buried sand coming up over his mouth       378
         his eyes until finally he is gone

379      twoface stands watching eyes full of childish delight      379

         the floor in front of him begins to give way running
         with deep cracks

                                 twoface
                   boys lets go have us a party
                          turning
                   anybody else feel like donuts

         harvey and his men head away up out of the tunnels

380      the sand pit  close still no motion                       380

         a gloved hand breaks the surface clutching a batarang a
         weak flip of the wrist

         the batarang hist the sand

         the hand goes limp a beat another suddenly

         a green gloved hand  close grabs batmans hand

         wider

         dick hangs on a wire above batman in an aerialists
         maneuver he secures his grip and pulls

         dick  close straining

         suddenly batmans face breaks the sand

         dick uses the leverage of his body on the rope to pull
         harder batman begins to rise free

         the two face each other hands still clasped

381      int  batcave  later                                         381

428      bruce presses on sweat beads on his face                    428

         ahead a diffusion of moonlight illuminates a curving
         rock chamber bats here too bringing the walls to life

         bruce moves into the moonlight looks up

429      bruce  pov a narrow chute the fall he took as a child     429

         he kneels there on the floor worn by years of weather
         a single book a diary

         bruce kneels touches the leather cover fingers
         lingering for a moment on his fathers embossment before
         he turns yellowed pages to the last entry painfully by
         moonlight he reads

                   not my fault it wasnt my fault

         rising slits opening to reveal two blood red eyes

         the giant monarch bat spreads its wings huge as it
         rises suddenly airborne rushing toward him

431      bruce  close and terrified he turns to run the bats      431
         flapping wings beat like drums closing fast

         bruce holds his ground resolved he turns and faces the
         monster screeching towards him glistening fangs barely
         inches from his face

         something remarkable happens the bat holds its
         position stares into bruces eyes wings spreading wide

         a beat then bruce raises his arms a living mirror the

         batman remains stoic but the riddler is right on

                                 riddler
                   so lets help you decide once and
                   for all who you really are behind
                   curtain 1

         a curtain rises chase in a cylinder bound unconscious

                                 riddler
                   the captivating dr chase meridian
                   love of bruce waynes life behind
                   curtain 2

         another curtain reveals dick in similar peril

                                 riddler
                   batmans one and only partner

         beneath chase and dick open wide angle down to the
         jagged rocks and crashing surf below

                                 riddler
                   a watery grave

501      a button  close shaped like a glowing green skull          501

502                              riddler                               502
                   a simple touch and five seconds
                   later these two day players are so
                   much gull feed on the rocks below
                   not enough time to save them both
                   so who will it be bruces love
                   batmans partner you decide is
                   this fun or what

                   but cant be found on your mark

         the riddler reaches for the button batman steps forward

503      angle from the water below                                   503

         the floor between where batman stands and the riddlers
         throne platform is translucent a hologram masking a
         tremendous gap batman is about to step into an abyss

504      batman stops short looks up at riddler                      504

                                 batman

                          getting it
                   because there is no way for me to
                   save them or myself this is one
                   giant death trap

                                 riddler
                   excellent see who says a guy in a

                   to die now

         riddler touches the skull button over a screech

         batman looks up

505      high above the riddlers antenna a giant monarch bat          505
         glides across the night

506      the bat  close                                              506

507      batman  close no fear a moment of communion               507

                                 batman

                   what am i

                                 riddler
                   oh please youre blind as a bat

                                 batman
                   exactly

         batman slams his utility belt releasing a high energy
         batarang which he hurls at the riddlers huge antenna

508      the batarang                                                  508

         smashes into the riddlers antenna a tremendous
         explosion of sparks as the transceiver short circuits

                                 riddler
                   no

         the room goes pitch black

509      riddlers finger  close hits the skull button              509

510      dick and chase                                                510

         drop plummet through space

511      batman  close two metal lids shut over batmans eyes       511

512      batmans pov  inside the mask                                512

         small sonar screens on the back of batmans eyepieces
         reveal the phantom floor and the wild crisscross of
         interconnected steel beams and the crashing ocean below

513      batman                                                        513

         throws another batarang which lassos a beam overhead
         swings forward grabbing a falling chase as he passes
         depositing her on a steel platform

514      batman  pov sonar screens dick drops to certain death    514

515      batman                                                        515

         dives towards the sea below as he whips another batarang
516      around a passing girder he catches dick just above the       516
         rocks precisely as the batrope pulls taught using the
         batwinch to shoot them back up to the platform

517      batman  pov sonar screens                                  517

         as he rests dick on the platform beside chase suddenly
         his world flares a blinding white

518      twoface                                                      518

         stands on the platform before him a halogen light
         strapped around his head blinding batmans sensors

         twoface brandishes his gun

                                 twoface
                   all those heroics for nothing no
                   more riddles no more curtains one
                   and two just plain old curtains

         he cocks the trigger

                                 batman
                   havent you forgotten something
                   harvey youre always of two minds
                   about everything

         the handsome side of harveys face turns toward them

                                 twoface
                   oh emotion is so often the enemy of
                   justice thank you bruce

         he takes out his famous coin and flips it batman starts
         to reach for his utility belt to outsmart twoface but
         as the coin flies high up in the air it comes down just
         a hair too far away

                                 twoface
                   no

519      as twoface reaches out to catch it he loses his balance     519
         and falls to the rocks and angry sea below

                                 batman
                   help chase ill be back

                                 chase

                   did twoface call him bruce

                                 dick

         the lights are still down but the antennas functioning
         again the riddler in his throne absorbing pulses of
         neural energy too much his entire head seems to
         distort fluctuating in size and wavering

                                 riddler
                   why cant i kill you now theres a

         edward  close knees drawn to his chest pathetic
         whimpering mad

         batman looks down his eyes sad compassionate
