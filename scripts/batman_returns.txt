     int a stuffy mansiona night about forty years ago

     the viewer floats through an overbearing mansion and
     up its sweeping staircase to where a stern man in
     conservative dress is pacing back and forth smoking a
     cigarette in a cigarette holder  he is the father  the
     throesoflabor pants and moans of the mother can be
     heard from down the hall

     now eerie gaas and goos chill the air  the father stops
     and gapes the cigarette holder out of his mouth to see a
     dazed nurse shuffle out of the birth room and disappear
     down the hallway

     a traumatized doctor next wanders out  the father runs
     past him into the room  the viewer remains outside and
     hears the fathers subsequent screams

     int mansion living roomchristmas eve past

     a bizarrely corrugated cage sits amid the plush period
     and christmasedup surroundings of the mansion  with
     their backs turned to the sickly squeals emerging from
     the playpen from hell father and mother holding
     martinis look out a window of gentle snowfall with
     bloodshot eyes  a 50stype radio warbles santa claus
     is coming to town

     a strange pair of eyes peer from the cage  taking the
     point of view of the eyes from inside the playpen one
     sees the mansions christmas tree from between the dark
     cage slats

                             giddy yuletide singers
               he knows when you are sleeping
               he knows when youre awake

     the family cat skulks past the cage  almost  without
     warning the cat is yanked  so fast and powerfully it
     seems that its been sucked  through the bars into the
     cage  a feline scream then sickening silence

     with dead syncopation mother and father finish off their
     martinis and plop the empty glasses down

     ext a parkthat night

     a happy couple in 50s dress pushes a baby carriage
     through the park cooing toward their bundle of joy
     inside

     father and mother straggle from the other direction
     creaking forward an ominously closedup wickedly de
     signed baby carriage that serves to muffle nasty whining
     and thumping noises

                             happy couple
               merry christmas

     father and mother fake a smiling response that collapses
     as the happy couple passes  they then brake at a story
     book bridge over a bubbling brook  with dark nonchalance
     father and mother each grab an end of the carriage and
     heave it upward

     the carriage innocently slides through the murky waters
     of the awesomely cavernous and creepy sewer softly
     surfing its sides

     int a dark lairnight

     the resilient carriage spews from a gaping pipe into a
     moat of water that surrounds a vast patch of snow and
     ice that is the centerpiece of a dark and mysterious
     lair

     the carriage rides a gentle wave onto the sanctuarys
     arctic island into a patch of light  from out of the
     darkness of the lair four statuesque emperor penguins
     with distinguished gray bellies regally approach the
     carriage and surround it with spooky authority

     allamerican dad to exaggeratedly hide the present behind
     his back 

     just behind them an adorable little girl takes a dollar
     from her precious little purse and gives it to a
     salvation army santa  a sweet microphoned voice wafts
     out over the plaza

     the viewer goes from gothams bowels to its summit  the

     is a tower of ivory with a large friendly sentinel of
     a cat at its tippy top  two men stand in the window
     pointing down to the plaza below

     int max shrecks conference roomnight 

     the conference room presents itself in its hightech
     splendor  a mighty shreck corporation logo of a friendly
     cat adorns one wall

     the two men are max shreck and the mayor  max is a
     pillar of community charisma  the mayor is more
     straightforward less spectacular

                             mayor

     this clown grabs innocent bystander selina kyle  in the
     scuffle a heel cracks off one of her shoes

     the blitzing batmobile comes to a skidding halt  the
     clown presses a sleek stungun to selinas neck

                             selina
               i probably shouldnt bring this up
               but this is a very serious pair
               of shoes you ruined  couldnt you
               have just been a prince and broken
               my jaw  my body will heal but
               this was the last pair left in my
               size

                             clown
               all these innocent bystanders and i
               had to pick you shut up

     the batmboile door whooshes open  batman pounds straight
     at the clown an eerie force of nature  an acrobat
     somersaults into his face  batman casually punches his
     lights out

                             clown
               listen up mister manbat you
               take one step closer and ill

                             batman

     batman gunslingers out his grapple speargun  the wired
     hook rockets past the clowns jerking away head and into
     the wall behind him

                      jeers
               nice shot mister

     batman yanks the wire ripping off a chunk of wall that
     smacks the back of the clowns head  as he staggers

                             selina
               you shouldna left the other heel

     with her surviving heel she kicks the crumpled clowns
     knee knocking him and the stun gun to the ground

     batman bends to his vanquished foe  touches the triangle
     tattoo over his left eye as selina gushes

                             selina
               wow  the batmanor is it just
               batman  your choice  of course

     batman finds himself staring at the lovely young woman
     for a moment time freezes

                             batman
               gotta go

     in a wink hes a halfblock away being schmoozed by
     commissioner gordon  onlookers cheer

     its just selina alone here with her unconscious attacker

                             selina
               well  that was  very brief
               like most men in my life  what
               men  well theres you but 
               you need therapy

     she kneels beside the clown  picks up his stungun
     zaps him jolting his body a bit

     ext plaza side streetnight

     hearing the sounds of cheers max smiles and stops atop
     a manhole to wipe his brow  suddenly the manhole cracks
     in half sucking down a wailing max  the manhole flaps
     back up into a normal seemingly untouched position

     ext the plazanight

     the commissioner hustles to keep pace with batman

                             gordon
               thanks for saving the day batman
                    good natured huff

                             batman

               the caped crusader  we dont
               deserve you  they almost made off
               with our mover and shaker max
               shreck  but 

     belatedly it dawns on the mayor  he looks around
     blinking

     then he turns back to batman  but batman has vanished
     too

     int selinas apartmentlater that night

     selina enters hanging up her winter coat and calling out

     turns on her answering machine

     ext the old gotham zoonight

     the viewer is suddenly wafting over the creepy panorama
     of an abandoned zoo expo area

     we whoosh downward to a decrepit arctic world pavilion
     and through its colossal cracked observation window

     int penguins lairnight

     we continue to squirm down the walls of the lair where
     penguin found his home before settling to a tight glimpse
     of max shreck slumped over the edge of a block of ice

     max teeters up into consciousness glancing to his side
     to see a grand emperor penguin curiously staring at him
     max yelps  the penguin yelps back

     calming himself max turns to face forward then screams
     again  the block of ice is revealed to be a strange con
     ference table populated by the red triangle circus gang
     including  a disturbingly ratty poodle and its matching
     owner a ratty poodle lady the organ grinder and his two
     monkeys the tattooed strongman the sword swallower the
     knifethrowing dame the fat and thin clowns the three
     stiltwalkers flame the snakewoman and four nd acrobats

     an awesome seedy electrical generator wires to a massive
     air conditioner wheezes sparks with a malevolent hum

     the gangs snickering now fades into respectful silence

     actual penguins of every size heedlessly horseplay in
     the icy moat  now we hear the sound of a drip  max
     turnsthe drip is seen thudding against an umbrella
     improbably held by one of the penguins  as he emerges
     from the pack we see that he wears a grimy coat  then
     he flaps down his umbrella revealing his face for the
     first time in glory  it is not a penguin but the penguin

                             penguin
               hi

     max launches into a facecontorting wail but his shock
     prevents him from emitting actual sound  he closes his
     mouth then tries another munchesque wail to no aural effect

                             penguin
               i believe the word youre looking
               for isaaaaagh

     then

                             penguin
               actually this is all just a bad
               dream  youre home in bed
               heavily sedated resting
               comfortably and dying from the
               carcinogens youve personally
               spewed in a lifetime of profiteering
               tragic irony or poetic justice
               you tell me

                             max
               my god  its true  the penguin
               man of the sewers  please dont h

                             penguin
               quiet max  what do you think
               this is a conversation

     max shuts right up  penguin idly tries out his little
     umbrella  it spits fire  satisfied he sets it down

                             penguin
               we have something in common we
               two  were both perceived as
               monsters  but somehow youre a
               wellrespected monster and i am 
               to datenot

     there is a small arsenal of umbrellas at his feet  he
     picks up another one  it shoots knives

                             max
                      mustering courage
               frankly i feel thats a bum rap
               im a businessman  tough yes
               shrewd okay  but that doesnt
               make me a mon

     penguin cuts him off with a cackle

                             penguin
               dont embarrass yourself max  i
               know all about you  what you hide
               i discover  what you put in your
               toilet i place on my mantlepiece
               get the picture

     penguin is playing with a third umbrella  he begins to
     twirl it at max  its got a bright spiral pattern like
     one of those cheesy hypnodisks from the backs of
     comic books

                             max
               what is that supposed to
               hypnotize me

                             penguin
               no just give you a splitting
               headache

                             max
               well its not working

     penguin fires the umbrella at max  a deafening
     gunshot  max flies back in horror  am i hit

                             penguin
               you big baby  just blanks  would
               i go to all this trouble tonight
               just to kill you  no i have an
               entirely other purpose

     suddenly penguin is solemn subdued  is that a tear in
     his eye

                             penguin
               im ready max  ive been
               lingering down here too long  im

               your acumen  i wasnt born in the
               sewer you know  i come from 

     he looks up at a place far above the sewers

                             penguin
               like you  and like you i want
               some respect  a recognition of
               my basic humanity  an occasional
               breeze 

     even the circus gang looks touched  max stays poker
     faced

                             penguin
               most of all i want to find out who

               learning my human name  simple
               stuff that the good people of
               gotham take for granted

                      boy is he tough
               and exactlywhyamigonna helpyou

     on cue one of the carny creeps hands penguin a grimy
     christmas stocking with max disturbingly stitched on it

                             penguin
               well lets start with a batch of
               toxic waste from your clean
               textile plant  theres a whole
               lagoon of this crud in the back

     he pulls a rusty thermos from the stocking and from the
     thermos pours some goo onto the tabletop which sizzles

                             max
               yawn  that coulda come from anywhere

                             penguin
               what about the documents that prove
               you own half the firetraps in gotham

                             max
               if there were such documents  and
               that is not an admission  i would
               have seen to it they were shredded

     another carny goon hands over a sheaf of papers  theyve
     been shredded but carefully placed together with tape

                             penguin
               a lot of tape and a little patience
               make all the difference  by the way
               hows fred adkins your old partner

                             max
                      rattled
               fred  fred  hes  actually hes
               been on an extended vacation and 

     from under the table penguin pulls out a discolored human
     hand and happily waves it at a whitened max

                             penguin
                      ventriloquist
               hi max  remember me  im freds
               hand
                      leans forward
               want to greet any other body parts
               or stroll down memory lane with
               tornup kinky polaroids  failed
               urine tests  remember max 
               you flush it i flaunt it

     max sits here  chastened thoughtful considering all
     the incriminating evidence before him  now he manages
     a smile

                             max
               you know what mr  penguinsir
               i think perhaps i could help
               orchestrate a little welcomehome
               scenario for you  and once were
               both back home perhaps we can
               help each other out 

                             penguin 
               you wont regret this mr shreck

     he puts out a hand  max shakes  penguin abruptly pulls
     his flipper away leaving max holding freds severed
     paw

     the carny crew booms in laughter  max offers a weak giggle

     ext gotham plaza  next day

     the mayor accompanied by tv newscams grimly tours the
     scene of last nights rampage  accompanied by his wife
     holding their baby great photo op and an appropriately
     solemn max

                             mayor
                      to reporters
               i tell you this not just as an
               official but as a husband and
               father  last nights eruption
               of lawlessness will never hap

     suddenly from behind the ravaged tree an acrobatthug
     somersaults at the mayors wife and snatches the baby
     then leaps onto the platform and holds the baby up like
     an oscar

                             acrobatthug
               im not one for speeches so ill
               just say thanks

     the mayor lunges for the attacker and gets pivotkicked
     to the ground  the thug races through a frightened crowd 

      and falls into an open manhole  as bystanders gather
     and try to peer into the darkness below we hear

                             thugs voice
               hey  oww

     now the thumps of somebody taking a mercilesspounding
     and the screams of the thug  now he comes scrambling out
     of the manhole dazed and emptyhanded  and madly
     dashes away 

     next amid cries of stand back and my god look the
     bystanders back off revealing the spectacle of the
     mayors tiny child levitating  as if by magic  from
     the depths of purgatory  but no its not magic 
     its penguin  he holds the babe aloft in one yucky
     but powerful flipper

     int wayne manor living room  that night

     alfred is standing on a stepladder attaching ornaments to a
     christmas tree but finding his attention claimed by the tv

     bruce is sitting on the couch also entranced by the lead
     item on the local news

     insert  tv screen

     the rest of the scene in gotham plaza plays out on video

     now penguin is fully out above the pavement so we can
     see how hed miraculously floated up  on a big rubber
     duck attached to a tall scissorlift  as camera zooms
     in

                             anchormans voice
               thats him  the shadowy much
               rumored penguinman of the sewers
               arisen  until today hed been
               another tabloid myth alongside
               the abominable snowman and the loch
               ness monster 

     the mayors wife snatches up her baby in tears  then
     fighting nausea she embraces the modest abashed
     penguin  whose eyes heartbreakingly blink in the
     unaccustomed light

                             anchormans voice
               but now this odd little manbeast
               can proudly stand tall alongside
               our own legendary batman

     the mayor tries to shake penguins hand  but somehow
     max shreck is standing between them patting penguins
     back

               gothams leading citizen max shreck
               had been on a factfinding mission in
               gotham plaza

     shreck whispers something in penguins pointy little ear
      cmon youre a hero its your moment  embarrassed
     but  aw what the hell  penguin takes a little bow

     gotham plaza erupts  joy to the world peals over the

     int wayne manor living room  night

     bruce and alfred are both frozen alfreds arm
     outstretched to the tree ornament dangling  both still
     staring at

     insert  tv screen

     penguin is in gotham plaza doing a live interview
     shabby but proud in his tattered cloak shielding his eyes
     with a small touchingly frayed umbrella from the glare of
     the studio lights  he haltingly earnestly tells camera

                             penguin
               all i want in return  is the
               chance to  to find my folks
               find out who they are  and
               thusly who i am  and thenwithmy parents just  try to
               understand why  why they did
               what i guess they felt theyhadto do to a child who was born
               looking a little  different
               a child who spent his first
               christmas and many since in a
               sewer

     int wayne manor living room  night

     alfred is back to trimming the tree  but bruce still
     stares at the tv screen  presently

                             alfred
               mr wayne  something wrong

                             bruce

               his parents  i  i hope he
               finds them

     alfred murmurs his agreement  that would be nice

     hold on bruce as he continues to scrutinize the image of
     the penguin on the screen

     ext hall of records  next day

     press photographers jostle to snap photos through the
     windows of the baroque old building  frustrated journal
     ists barred from the building by a row of cops inter

     an aggressive reporter tries to sneak in through a side

                             guard 1
                      escorting him off

               amendment abridging the freedom
               off the press 

     suddenly max shreck is standing here surrounded by a
     posse of his own sympathetic reporters who jot down every
     pearl

                             max
               what about the freedom to rediscover

     he flicks off the reportersrecordbutton

                             max
               and give the constitution a rest
               okay  its christmas

     int hall of records  day

     we find penguin alone in the vast silent main hall
     seated at an enormous table  surrounded by files marked
     birth certificates  hundreds of thousands of birth
     records of gothams citizens past and present 

      and penguin is patiently checking each certificate
     thumbing through them all with his slimy left flipper

     his right flipper is wrapped around a pen  every so
     often penguin pauses then jots down another name on a
     legal pad  so singleminded in his search he doesnt hear
     the muffled cries of his name through the windows from
     reporters 

     dissolve  its night now  a cloak of darkness through
     the oversized windows  even the press has gone home 
     but penguin is still here he hasnt budged

     still methodically flipping through all those birth
     certificates  and still jotting down names malenames boy names on a legal pad  hes filled many
     pads by now  a tall stack of them

     by the eerie light of a single tablelamp he keeps
     writing

     ext gotham street  night

     the batmobile sleekly cruises down a deserted street

     int batmobile moving  night

     as batman drives alfreds face comes on a screen inside
     the batmobile

                             alfred
               the citys been noticeably quiet

                yet still you patrol  what
               about eating  sleeping  you
               wont be much good to anyone else
               if you dont look after yourself

               are you concerned about that
               strange heroic penguin person

     batman scoffs  then glances out the window at

     the hall of records

     surprise thats where hes cruising

     the one light inside still burns throwing a long shadow
     of the strange hunchedover penguin  at his desk
     resolutely doing his research

     in front of the building are a shreck guard and a police
     man  both slumped on the front stairs both snoozing

     int batmobile  late night

     as batman drives around the hall checking the silent
     street for trouble then surveying the single lit window
     again

                      ambiguous

     grand welltended boneyard for the rich and expired
     gothams own forest lawn and a flying wedge of the citys
     finest arms interlocked keeps out the rabble as 

     the penguin in threadbare black waddles past the
     manicured headstones to the twin markers etched with the
     namestucker cobblepotandesther cobblepot

     now reaching his parents final resting places he falls
     to his knees  not very far to go  the plucks two wilted
     old roses from his sleeve and places one upon each plot

     from behind the police barricade camera motordrives
     whirr  not an instant of this drama is being lost to
     posterity  a penguin groupie faints  around her other
     girls pick up the cue  some wail others swoon

     after a moment of silent contemplation penguin rises again
     mournfully shambles back to the crowded cemetery entrance

                             aggressive reporter
                      hes back
               so  mr penguin

               mr cobblepot  youll never get a
               chance to settle up with em huh

     around him the crowd gasps in shock at such nerve

     but penguin doesnt look shocked merely surprised  as
     the flashbulbs flash penguin doesnt cringe  hes
     already used to this media mishegas he pensively twirls
     his umbrella and in a reasonable facsimile of a soft
     sweet squawk

                             penguin
               true  i was their number one son
               and they treated me like number
               two  but its human nature to
               fear the unusual  even with all
               their education and privilege 
               my dad a district attorney mother
               active in the dar  perhaps when
               i held my tiffany baby rattle with

     the newspaper is on microfiche and its projected on a

     bruce scans the articles and murmurs as he scrolls from

     he sips the soup

                      then
               supposed to be cold right

     he returns to his search through the file

                             alfred
               mr wayne  does the phrase
               christmas holiday hold any
               resonance for you

     bruce laughs  then grabs an interactive cd on his table
     top and lobs it at alfred like a frisbee

                             bruce
               listen to yourself alfred  hassling

     alfred dutifully pops the cd in a player and hears his
     own voice recorded last night in the batmobile

               what about eating  sleeping  you
               wont be much good to anyone else 

     bruce snaps it off

                             bruce
               i learned to live without a mother
               a long time ago thanks

                 circus is back with a freak
               show that may not be suitable for

               lady the worlds fattest man and
               an aquatic birdboy

     he turns to alfred  what do you make of that  alfred
     shrugs

                             alfred
               why are you now determined to prove
               that this penguin  er mr cobblepot
                is not what he seems  must you be
               the only lonely manbeast in town

     but bruce is already engrossed in the next article
     onscreen

                             bruce
                circus folded its tents
               yesterday perhaps forever  after
               numerous reports of missing
               children in several towns police
               have closed down the red triangles
               fairgrounds  however at least
               one freak show performer vanished
               before he could be questioned

     bruce turns back to alfred a strange smokinggun smile
     on his face

                             alfred
               i suppose you feel better now sir

                             bruce
               no actually i feel worse

     the two men regard each other  wordless worried
     finally

     ext shreck buildingthat night

     as we boom up to the executive suite we see selina kyle
     at her desk in the outer office slaving away

     int outer officenight

     selina makes notes  now her pen nervously jerks as max
     oozes in surprising her with a smarmy palm on her
     shoulder

               yes im boning up for your bruce

               waynes hopedfor investment
               ive studied up on all of it 
               i even opened the protected files
               and 

     max looks surprised

                             max
               why how industrious  and how did
               you open protected files may i
               ask

                             selina
               well i figured that your password
               was finster  your pomeranian
               and it was  and its all very
               interesting though a bit on the
               technical side i mean about how the
               power plant is a power plant in
               name only since in fact its
               gonna be one big giant

     max encourangingly nods  go on  she consults her notes

                             selina
               big giantcapacitor  and that
               instead of generating power itll

                      checks notes again
               suckingpower from gotham city
               and storing it  stockpiling it
               sort of  which unless im being
               dense is a novel approach id say

                             max
               and who  would you say thisto

     selina is suddenly a tad less certain of her position as
     max lights a match and sets her notepad afire  she
     swallows

                             selina
               well  um  nobody 

     max drops the charred notepad and moves toward her

                             max
                where did curiosity get the cat

                             selina
               im no cat  im just an assistant

     selina swirls downward through shattering glass and snow
     flakes with tragic beauty

     her fall is luckily slowed by a protruding flagpole
     with the smiling shreck cat logo on its flapping flag
     then she luckily lands in a deep snowdrift

     her eyes creak open fuzzily focusing on the happy cat above

                             selina

     miss kitty summoned by her desperate owner now appears
      leading cats of every shape color and demeanor from
     every direction  selinas cat crawls up onto selinas
     blouse and begins to breathe into her mouth in an eerie
     feline cpr ballet

     a siamese whispers in selinas ear awsocute tabbies
     snuggle against the soles of her feet  a scraggly tom
     viciously bites her finger  selinas eyes fly open

     int selinas apartmentstill later that night

     battered bloodied and clutching miss kitty selina
     reenters her apartment  she is the malevolent antidote
     to her poignantly pleasant previous self  she stares in
     unmoving but torrid selfcontemplation  then she
     explodes into vivid montage

     with a black spray paint can in each hand selina attacks
     everything pink and eggshellcarpet couch wallpaper

     with uncoiled wire coathangers she sets about trans
     forming her murphy bed into something weird and painful

     she flings her childhood picture off the wall into a
     minibonfire that includes her sad christmas tree set
     up on her kitchennook table

     she lustily shoves a stuffed unicorn into her garbage
     disposal  the carnage of other excute toy creatures
     are spread about

     miss kitty races about purring in delight

     with a sewing needle selina repeatedly stabs her dolls
     house annihilating the microdetailed rooms  in closeup
     the rooms seem to be invaded by a giant silver missile

     next with the same needle we see her stitching together
     something slinky stretchy and black

     then she assaults her feelgood neon sign  with bare
     fists she punches out the last letter of the first word
     and the first letter of the second turning hello there
     into hell here

     int selinas apartmentthe next morningday

     as the sun rises through the windows selina sits in a
     lotus position on the floor of her very redone apartment
     she is wearing her sinful black handsewn catsuit  she
     slides a pristine bowl of milk to her content cat and
     speaks in a sultry voice  her catwoman voice

     the superbatarang whizzes with wild concentration pin
     balling from creep skull to creep skull slamming them
     all including a lunging gang member behind batman to
     the ground

     but now as it wobbles back to batman the ratty poodle
     leaps up and snatches the batarang in his rotten teeth
     the poodle led by the poodle lady scurries off

     before batman can give chase the raggedy swordswallower
     leaps out at him  batman gives him a strategic elbow to
     the ribs and pulls the sword from his mouth  a thin

                             catwoman

     batman nods  lay it on me

               the world tells boys to conquer the
               world and girls to wear clean
               panties  a man dressed as a bat
               is a heman but a woman dressed
               as a cat is a shedevil  im just
               living down to my expectations
               lifes a bitch  now so am i

     she runs her talons over the whiplifeline  meantime
     with his free arm batman reaches into his bat belt and
     pulls out a plastic minitest tube with a blue fluid on
     top red fluid on the bottom separated by a thin barrier

                             batman
               a heman  sure  they shine
               that beacon in the sky then wonder
               what hole i crawl out of

                             catwoman
               wow a real response and youre
               not even trying to get into my tights
               but explain me  if youre

               exploding department stores keep
               me up  one 

     he snaps the tube  as the blue seeps into the red and
     the tube slowly glows purple 

                             catwoman
               i cant sleep either lately  a
               little link between us  but

               strain on our relationship

               four five

     he lobs the nowbubbling tube as catwoman starts to sever
     the whip  the mixture explodes against her forearm  she
     shrieks like a dying cat and soars down onto the next
     ledge barely

     batman leaps down to her  her talons frantically claw
     and scratch as she tries not to plummet  batman grabs
     her pulls her up  for a moment theyre embracing

                             catwoman
               who are you  whos the man behind
               the bat  maybe he can help me
               find the woman behind the cat
                      pressing armor
               thats not him  ah here you
               are 

     her talons poise at the edge of batmans armor just above
     the waist  suddenly catwoman thrusts  batman roars with
     pain and fiercely swats catwoman away  off the building

                             batman
                no 

     he watches in shock as her body hurtles toward the ground

     ext gotham streetnight

     but at the last minute from out of nowhere a dumptruck
     filled with sand passes and catwoman lands in a soft dune

     ext truck movingnight

     as the truck motors off catwoman waves a paw up at
     batman  then murmurs as she cozily rolls around in the
     sand

                             catwoman
               saved by kittylitter  some
               date 

     then lit by a streetlamp she tears up her sleeve to
     study the nasty injury batman dealt her

                             catwoman
               so its not a corsage  but a

     her paw into the birdcage  she pulls out the canary and
     shoves it into her mouth  penguin leaps up frantic

                             selina
               the news these days  weird
               people looking to superheroes for
               their peace of mind and blaming
               their problems on supervillains
                instead of themselves or
               their spouses at least

                             bruce

                             selina
                      shrugs
               i detest violence but 
               christmas complacency can be a
               downer too

                             bruce
                      chuckles

     selina responds by leaning forward and planting a wet one
     on bruces mouth that lingers  when their lips finally
     part

     mortified penguin spazzes  looking for a second like
     a rapper  his performance is greeted with snowballs 
     then a couple of eggs and tomatoes find their way to his
     face

     finally penguin gallops away from the mike  bumping into
     max shreck who is fighting to get off the platform

     penguin claws at his mentor losing a glove in the
     process

                             penguin

                      shakes his head
               i think youd feel out of place at
               my party  you see its for
               winners

     he scrams  leaving penguin wiping his face and wondering

                             penguin
               why is there always someone who
               brings eggs and tomatoes to a
               speech

     when suddenly a posse of livid gothamites ripping off
     their oswald cobblepot buttons come at him like a human
     wave

     ext gotham parkday

     penguin makes a wild dash through the park just ahead
     of the angry mob barely leaping a park bench  as the
     gothamites gain he turns firing a salvo from his
     patriotic umbrella  in response the park cops unholster
     their weapons and shoot back  penguin saves himself by
     diving off the storybook bridge  the very bridge his
     parents dumped him from many christmases ago  splash
     ing deep into the icy brook

     int penguins lairday

     penguin trudges head down out of the abyss of his sewer
     pipe back into the light of his lair  thuds into his rubber
     duck boat and revs it toward the abandoned arctic island

     oblivious to his pain his penguins squawk and play
     this brings a dark smile to the penguins thin lips

                             penguin
               my babies  did you miss me

     as he docks his duck the remaining members of the red
     triangle circus gang straggle into the lair through a
     tunnel of snow and ice  the thin clown pops into his
     face

                             thin clown
               great speech oswald  the way you
               told those rubes the score

     penguin brutally smacks the clowns skull with his umbrella

     he yanks off his tux rips off his other glove and wiggles
     his webbed hands as he rallies his gang

               love is false and suffocating

     red triangle hoods are reading the names  evan black
     181 shepherd lane thomas frankel 273 carlton avenue

         through the window  scoops up the infant vaults out
         as an alarm wails but the infant sleeps on 

     the montage quickly accelerates  a swift succession of
     sleeping bundled babes handed through windows doors 

     int lair  night

     penguin impatiently waits pacing as he twirls two
     identical long elegant umbrellas

                             penguin
               ooh this is gonna be good

     he turns to max confined to a cage halfsubmerged in
     goo clutching a tattered blanket against the cold

                             penguin
               to cut down a whole crop of
               gothams most promisingbeforetheir prime

     he gestures at a brownish gurgling subterranean lake

                             penguin
               how do i lure em in you ask

     he pops one of the umbrellas at max who flinches

                             penguin
               little pied penguin action

     the umbrella is wickedly charming open its a mini
     merrygoround playing the penguin theme in a haunt
     ingly childlike rinkydink style  penguin shows with
     a happy prance how hell use it to lead the kids to
     their doom

                             penguin
               and you get to watch them all sink
               in a deep puddle of your industrial
               byproducts  then you join them
               tragic irony or poetic justice
               you tell me

     we dissolve from the twirling merrygoround umbrella to
     a wagonwheel turning  then widen to reveal

     ext circus train  night

     the lead circus wagons in a long caravan of wagon wind
     ing through gothams dark and empty streets  the wagons
     are barred more heavily than indumbo  reminiscent in
     fact of penguins playpen of yore  the sides painted
     with the faded peeling red triangle circus logo
     through the heavy bars we glimpse a little pair of
     hands a pair of frightened eyes  hear the occasional
     cry of a cold or thirsty baby

     at the wheel sits the organ grinder impatiently petting
     his monkey  now he barks at his unseen subordinates

                             organ grinder
               wouldya hurry up loading those
               kids already

     a shadow falls the silhouette of a caped figure
     batman reaches down and yanks the organ grinder up out
     of frame

     int lair  night

     as a silent despairing max shreck and a manic amused
     thin clown look on penguin practices his balletic walk
     over to the toxic lake waving his merrygoround
     umbrella with its tinkly theme

                             penguin
                      dry run
               this way kiddies  jump right in

     now the organ grindersmonkeyappears at the top of the
     stairs holding something  as he scampers down

                             penguin
               so  wherere the kids  dont
               tell me they stopped at mcdonalds 

                             thin clown
               boss  hes got a note

     indeed the monkey waves a little piece of stationary
     which penguin snatches from him and reads

                             penguin
               dear penguin  the children
               regret theyre unable to attend
               have a disappointing day  batman

     penguin is working to control his rage  he glares at the
     hopping dancing monkey and reminds himself

                             penguin
               youre the messenger  it doesnt
               make sense to shoot the messenger

     the other long umbrella is a semiautomatic  now penguin
     swivels and sprays the thin clown with bullets

     int elsewhere in the lairnight

     penguin militarily struts as he addresses his legion of
     penguins  theyre wearing eerie headgear  on each ones
     back is strapped a large bazooka

                             penguin
               my penguins  we stand at a great
               threshold  its okay to be
               scared  many of you wont be
               coming back 

     hes choked up  he has to pause compose himself

                             penguin

     the penguin army on remote control swivels in unison
     and splashes toward the big open sewer pipe

     behind them penguin dries his eyes and gloats

     int a sewernight

     all is quiet in a musty sewer  then a buzzing noise is
     faintly heard and suddenly batman plows at the viewer
     driving a sleek dark vehicle that is part boat part
     jetski  the bat boat slaloms up the side of the sewer
     pipe to avoid colliding with

     a division of penguin commando bombers marching in
     unison  their headgear clicks and whirs

     ext gotham city streetnight

     another squadron of penguin mercenaries pours out from an
     open sewer grate and continues to march in eerie forma
     tion through a deserted city street

     int the sewernight

     as he rockets ahead batman communicates through a
     strange phone device

     two penguins suddenly appear before batman firing their
     payloads  batman savagely curls his boat all the way up
     the oval pipe until he is momentarily upside down  he
     swooshes back down past the penguins and the twin
     explosions

                             batman
               as i was saying

     int the lairnight

     penguin stands in front of a screen watching his army
     waddle down the street  then gleefully rubs his hands
     as the fat clown starts the countdown off a big clock

     ext gotham street leading to plazanight

     the vanguard penguin division stops  gotham plaza
     heavily populated looms ahead  as one the penguins
     bend forward angling their bazookas for maximum
     destruction

     the last of the coordinates crackles over alfreds

     the readout reads  frequency jammed

     ext the regiment of penguinsnight

     the penguins headgear begins to whine and rattle

     the penguins simultaneouslyturnand trot away from the
     plaza

     int the lairnight

     penguin is glued to the screens elated at a gotter
     dammerung thats only seconds away

                             penguin
               ah gotham  you wouldnt put me
               on a pedestal so im laying you
               on a slab

     meantime the fat clown is frantically punching the
     controls

                             fat clown
               well um funny thing your
               penguins theyre not responding
               to the launch command  fact
               theyre kind of turned around
               now like someone jammed our
               signal

                             penguin
               but who couldve  no dont say

                             fat clown
               my lips are sealed

     penguin punches up the controls so the image of batman
     plowing through the sewers is spread out across the
     screens in cinerama

                             penguin
               im starting just starting
               to lose my temper now

     ext gotham park  night

     the penguin army advances en masse  the old zoo looms
     in the distance

     int the lairnight

     penguin grabs the nearest umbrella and jumps into his
     rubber duck

     the fat clown rushes forward to join him but penguin
     heedlessly slams his vehicle into his former cohort 
     catapulting his huge carcass across the lair where it
     lands with a definitive thud in front of maxs cage

     penguin steers his duck for stairs  then rides it
     all the way up the stairs and out of the lair

     meantime max reaches out and grabs a key off the fat
     clowns keyring releasing himself  then creeps out of
     his cage  he pauses to swipe the gun from the fat
     clowns holster and stashes it in his back pocket  then
     starts to dash off when a familiar cat o nine tails
     snaps into frame coils around his ankle and drags him
     offscreen

     int sewer  night

     as batman thunders up the pipe toward the lair he hears
     a bleep  the screen on his console shows a thermal
     image shaped like a duck heading for the surface

     batman has just reaches a fork in the sewer pipes  at
     the last second he spins the wheel steering into the
     pipe that anglesup

     ext arctic worldnight

     penguin grandly plows around a corner with a victorious
     laugh 

     simultaneously the batboat comes crashing through the
     top of arctic world 

     penguin stops laughing as he looks up and sees the bat
     boat in midair 

     it crashlands on top of penguins rubber duck

     a beat of silence  stillness  batman dazed pops open
     his cockpit and alights looking for penguin  for
     penguins corpse perhaps  pinned inside his rubber
     duck  when

     from out of frame a shrill and frenzied penguin springs
     at batman  his legs wrapped around the caped crusaders
     neck the beast savagely gouges with his umbrellatip
     and pecks with his beak  snarling as he attacks

                             penguin
               i think youre jealous that im a
               genuine freak and you have to wear
               a mask

                             batman
               maybe youre right

     penguin jumps down off batman

                             penguin
               but in the end all that counts is
               whos holding the umbrella

     he activates his umbrella  a long blade protrudes
     in response batman pulls outhisweapon  a palmsized
     multicolored button like the one that lit the gotham
     plaza christmas tree  a standoff  but now over
     batmans shoulder penguin sees

     standing here  what the hell are they doinghere 
     his pokerfaced penguin commandos

                             penguin
               my babies 

     batman turns to look  and penguin lunges with his
     umbrellasword  batman swipes at it dropping his
     buttonweapon in the process

     cackling penguin snatches it up  aiming it at batman
     he vengefully presses the button

     suddenly aninsane family of batsbillows out of
     breakaway panels in the batboat and thunders straight at
     the penguin

                             penguin
               ah you brought your inlaws  im
               sure once you get to know them 

     he tries to swat them away with his umbrella but the
     bats besiege penguin biting and screeching as they send
     him reeling back and down shattering through the
     observation window

     int the lair  night

     penguin spectacularly twirls down into his lair bats
     tearing at him all the way until he splashes down into
     the moat

     ext arctic world  night

     batman at the observation window looks down  penguin
     is submerged but he can see the struggling catwoman and
     max

     simultaneously the penguin army  headgear clacking
     back on schedule  launches its payload

     batman standing between them and the old zoo now looks
     up at the magnificent trajectory of missiles overhead 

     ext zoo groundsnight

     the grand panorama of rotten zoo cages and decayed expo
     tecture is mightily laid to glorious waste in a symphony
     of fireballs

     int the lairnight

     flaming debris from the big bombs has devastated the
     floe melting most of the ice and blasting the odd chunk
     out of the warmedup water

     revealed in her arousingly tattered costume catwoman
     is dragging max by his neck toward the lairs ominously
     buzzing electrical generator

                             max
               i dont know what you want but i
               know i can get it for you with a
               minimum of fuss  money jewels a
               very big ball of string

     ext arctic world  night

     batman darts to the observation window and looks down at
     the struggling catwoman and max below

     he hooks a grapple to the edge of the glass

     int the lairnight

     catwoman continues to drag a balky max toward the
     generator

                             max
               lets make a dealotherthan my
               blood what can i off

                             catwoman

                             max
               either youve caught a cold or
               youre planning to kill me

     batman does a slide down the grapple that ends in a
     graceful touchdown  max crawls toward him

                             max
               youre not just saving one life
               youre saving a city and its way
               of life

     batman heaves a kick into max that sends him sailing
     against the generator

                             batman
               first youre gonna shut up  then
               youre gonna turn yourself in

                             catwoman

               apply to people like him  or us 

                             batman
               wrong on both counts

     he tries to grab max but catwoman makes a lunge for
     batmans abdomen sending him reeling  he picks himself
     up then talking in a calming soothing way

                             batman
               why are you doing this  lets
               just take him to the police then
               go home together

               down the middle please

               your castle forever  just like in

     she leans forward as for a kiss  batman touches her face
     about to rip off her mask  but she whips back lashing
     out at him kicking him sending him stumbling backward

                             catwoman
               i just couldnt live with myself
               so dont pretend this is a happy

     max squeezes off a shot at batman as he rises nicking
     the caped crusaders neck  now max swings the gun
     toward catwoman  who sexily saunters right at him

     together before getting lost in a dense display of
     crackling sparkage

     ext gotham plazanight same time

     the lights of the city vividly flash on and off a
     vision that max had prophesied 

     the batm beacon eerily winks against the sky

     the grand christmas tree brilliantly blinks  now we see
     that the plaza is filled with ecstatic parents reunited
     with dazed and delighted children 

     int the lairnight

     catlike screams of joy waft out off the mysterious mist of
     wattage

                             bruce
               selina kyle

     bruce frantically searches the thickening mist
     but finds only maxs bodynot selina  he stumbles back
     as

     penguin rises like a wraith behind him soaking and
     bleeding and sweating  wiping his brow and gasping for
     breath he stumbles toward the shortedout compressor
     using his long elegant umbrellas for support

                             penguin
                      pants
               gotta crank the ac  stuffy in
               here

     he drops one umbrella  with his free flipper penguin
     vainly twiddles the singed dials  nothing  the units
     kaput  fiery rubble continues to rain down on the lair
     raising the temperature even higher  penguin turns away
     in defeat from the busted airconditioner  and sees

     a stonefaced brucebatman standing here pitilessly
     watching

                             penguin
               without the mask youre dropdead
               handsome  so drop dead

     with great effort he raises his elegant umbrella  and
     fires it  no  not quite  its the merrygoround

                             penguin
               shit  picked the cute one
               heats gettin to me 

     penguin reaches down for the other umbrella  the
     deadly one the one that brucebatman is holding

                             penguin
               hey  you  wouldnt blow away
               an endangered bird 

     he desperately tugs at his collar a la rodney  his face
     is turning a deep precoronary scarlet 

     brucebatman wordlessly raises the umbrella and aims it
     between penguins eyes

     penguin pivots  starts waddling away  huffing
     puffing 

                             penguin
               you wouldnt shoot me in the back 
               wouldya 

     brucebatman never takes the gunumbrella off penguin 

     who is waddling slower and with greater difficulty
     toward the onceicy nownearlymelted moat

                             penguin
               im overheated is all  ill
               murder you momentarily 

     with a last ounce of strength he pulls open his collar

                             penguin
               but first a cool drink 

     then one more step  and he bellyflops in front of
     one glistening beckoning chunk of ice that was blown
     out of the water

                             penguin
               of icewater 

     one flipper feels for the block of ice  its just an
     inch away  and then the flipper falls

     penguin belongs to the ages

     a beat then brucebatman sets down the deadly umbrella
     and silently watches slightly awed

     in death as in birth the four elder gray bellied
     emperor penguins surround their fallen disciple  then
     like pallbearers they lift penguins body with their
     beaks and mournfully bear him away into darkness

     ext gotham plazanight

     the bat beacon light the city lights and the christmas
     tree lights continue to flash in wondrous syncopation
     the carolers begin singing again

     the mayor his staff and commissioner gordon out of
     their costumes look up at the flashing bat signal

                             gordon
               think hell ever forgive us

                             mayor

     alfred drives  as the limo zips past gotham plaza bruce
     soulfully gazes out at the celebrants

               yes i suppose that we did

     he turns taking a shortcut away from the crowds
     through a dark back alley 

                             alfred
               well  come what may merry

     suddenly hes brought up short by a loudmeow  bruce
     glances behind him 

     in time to see the shadow of something dart from the
     street into an alley  was it just a cat   or some
     thing taller shapelier
