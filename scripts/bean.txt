int  national gallery  boardroom  day

a very grand room with lots of wood and some very famous portraits 
round the walls

a group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen  they are the trustees of 
the national gallery  lord walton a very grand man sits at the table 
head  to his right sits his assistant gareth  all are deep in 
thought  lord walton fidgets with a pencil on the table  he raises 
his head as though about to speak  everyone looks up expectantly  
and lord walton goes back to fidgeting  so does everyone else

ext  mr beans street  day

mr bean comes out of his house ready to face the world

he walks up the street tutting slightly at a no parking sign he 
passes  the street is totally carfree except for a very visible lime 
green mini  a policeman strolls by and glances down at a pair of legs 
sticking out from under it next to a toolbox  he moves on satisfied 
that someone is mending their car

bean approaches the car and whips out the fake legs he left there  he 
then unlocks the big padlock that secures the car door pops the fake 
legs inside fiddles with something else in the back seat and drives 
away at a frightening speed with a smug look on his face

the theme music  big and dramatic  begins as do the rest of the 
credits

bean gaily motors on  then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps 
as if it has hit a scratch the cinema audience should be worried 
theres a sound fault

bean comes to a street full of sleeping policemen  he goes at them at 
quite a lick  and every time he shoots over one of the bumps the 
theme tune jumps violently

bean looks a little annoyed into the back seat  we now see the cause 
of the problem  instead of having a car radio bean has an old record 
player strapped into the back seat playing the theme tune

on he drives through empty streets  then jolt  hes reached the 
glorious familiarity of central london big ben and all  but heels now 
in dreadful traffic

heels not happy  he looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway  
he takes out a metal comb from his pocket and using it like a bombers 
sightlinechecker measures the front of his car and the width of the 
alley  he s satisfied  does a 90degree turn  and shoots down the 
alley  it is such a perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles 
as they graze the walls

but at the end of the alley the traffics just as bad  bean notices 
hes outside harrods  theres a tailcoated security guard at the 
front door  bean watches him stroll a bit down the street  and takes 
his chance  he turns and drives straight through the double doors 
into the store

int  harrods  day

bean and his car whizz through the ground floor past perfume counters 
and leather glove racks

cut to a security guard  as he passes one of the counters beans 
little car just shoots behind him  the guard continues through the 
childrens section there are giant elephants and teddies childrens 
size cars then two huge plastic tractors  and then stock still 
strangely in harmony actually the lime green mini with bean in it  
the guard walks straight past

the moment he is gone bean shoots off again  but damn spies 
another guard and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep 
stairs indeed  the theme song goes crazy as the record player jumps

cut to

6 people waiting at a gilded lift  they hear a strange sound and turn 
to see what it is  in fact its coming from inside the lift  when 
the lift doors open out shoots the mini through the double doors and 
back into the street

ext  knightsbridge  day

out in the street bean is faced by an accident  there are flashing 
lights a crumpled car suggestions of hurt passengers  bean looks 
concerned

cut to
ext  the strand  day

an ambulance roars through the traffic  it reaches its hospital turns 
off and there right smack behind it is the mini  cut in to see bean 
smiling broadly  he whizzes into trafalgar square maybe even across 
it sending pigeons and tourists flying and parks directly outside the 
statuesque national gallery  of course theres not another car there  
just the gallery and the mini

cut to

ext  national gallery  day

bean gets out of the car takes out his bag  thinks a little opens it 
and takes out a doctor on call sign  to reenforce it he puts a 
bone in the back window and a skull of the front seat  happy with the 
arrangement he relocks the padlock and sets off smiling up the big 
stairs to work

as he does so pan up the building and into the window of the room 
where that board meeting was taking place

gareth
look i dont hate the man but 

lord walton
i know gareth  its the mental strain he inflicts on us all  how is 
professor bradbury

a grand gentleman mr morrison pipes up

im morrison
heels got the feeling back in his fingers  but his hands are still 
stapled together

lord walton
mmmm and how far are we with the computer hubert

hubert
timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak milord  an 
awful thing to say but when the programs up and running our mr bean 
will become a little less than  useful

a glimmer of hope



int  national gallery  portrait section  day

bean wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in 
them  he passes a guard

guard
not looking up from his book
morning bean

the guard sighs with boredom  he gets this from bean every day  as 
bean moves on he treads on the heel of a tourists shoe  it comes 
off bean moves on blithely

int  national gallery  cartoon room entrance  day

bean is passing the very special room where leonardo da vincis 
cartoon the virgin and child hangs preserved by a very dim 
artificial light  there are silhouettes of a few tourists in the room 
reverently studying the work listening to a female gallery guide

bean dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings 
out a coin  the coin drops and rolls into the special room  bean 
follows it into the darkness

gallery guide
hushed
 by leonardo da vinci  as you can see the special light in here 
goes some way to protect the drawing from photodisintegration caused by 
gamma 

the camera stays outside the room with the picture in view  we hear 
the squeak of a tiny door open then a click  the room is suddenly 
flooded in blazing white light  the onlookers gasp in horror

bean reemerges from the room with his precious coin  as an 
afterthought he pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the 
light  he scuttles away  the gallery guide shakes her head in total 
exasperation

gareth
maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks and 
move the entire national gallery somewhere else  and not tell him

hubert
seconded  we could all move to france

george
all those in favour

they all raise their hands wildly

lord walton
come on  settle down everyone

int  national gallery  elevator  day

bean stands in the elevator silently with four other people  he gives 
himself a long squirt of breathfreshener  then offers it to the 
others who politely refuse him  so he stands still again  pause  
bean then smells something unpleasant  he leans and has a little sniff 
of the person to his left  all right there  then he sniffs to his 
right and reels at what he smells  he again takes out the breath 
freshener and forces it upon vincent an elderly gentleman who is 
mortified

at this moment the elevator stops  bean and vincent get out and the 
camera follows vincent as he heads for the boardroom door and enters  
he is another trustee  this dialogue is heard from behind the closed 
door

vincent
im sorry im late

gareth

why cant we just give him the boot for crying out loud

vincent
steady on old man i only 

gareth
not you you idiot

int  national gallery  corridor  day

bean with cup of tea walks along a corridor  he cant not interfere 
for tidiness sake  one empty room he switches off the light  another 
he shuts the door

he passes a computer room with an open door where a big man is busily 
typing in a programme  bean looks at him snootily and heads on

he approaches the door to his office  a sign reads storage  
catalogue  there is a huge padlock on the door  bean takes out a big 
key and enters his domain

cut to

int  national gallery  storage office  day

bean enters  hes been here for years and made it his own  its an 
odd little world  theres a framed picture of shirley bassey on his 
desk and airfix planes hang from the ceiling  also a large cosy 
armchair and a tv

a pleasant man in a suit around 40 breezes in

suit man
ah bean im looking for a painting by van hocht  still life  circa 
1670  can do

bean nods  this is what bean likes to do best  the camera follows as 
he turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him

his office is just a tiny corner of a massive storage room hundreds of 
feet high and long the walls completely full of rack after rack of 
stored paintings  at the end of the room we can see hundreds of 
sculptures busts modern abstracts men on horses classical maidens 
rodins the lot  its like the giant storehouse at the end of raiders 
of the lost ark

7

bean sets off into it in his own eccentric way  he knows exactly where 
heels going  he climbs a ladder like you find in a library  then 
pushes himself off and whizzes the entire length of the room on 
slippery wooden runners

he has now reached the sculpture area but the painting heels looking 
for is on the other side  he crosses the room by using the sculptures 
as a kind of artistic obstacle course  in front of him is the burghers 
of calais a rodin statue of 5 prisoners in chains  he simply walks 
across their 5 heads like stones in a stream

he then comes to an abstract modern piece which he uses as a slide and 
at the end of which he crawls through the hole in the next modern 
thing  he then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues 
using the mouths as footholes breasts as support codpieces as steps 
and empty eyes as finger holes

after a problem getting his foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured 
dog he walks flat along a modern sculpture then uses a sequence of 
classic sculptures as stairs  on the head of a little degas ballerina 
one step on to the bottom of a horse two steps onto the head of the 
person riding the horse three steps and now hes on the other side of 
the hall

he then triumphantly pulls out a painting  its the one

suit man
what would we do without you  the entire inventory of british art 
stored in that one curious brain of yours

gareth

vincent

beans hitherto talents obsolete

hubert
theres no question

lord walton
very well  mr bean is art history  we can all stop taking the 
pills

a reserved smatter of laughter from relief more than anything  lord 
w talks into an intercom on the table

lord walton
miss hutchinson would you send mr bean up to the boardroom please

miss hutchinson
vo 

yes sir oh and lord walton the grierson gallery called again

lord walton
thank you to the room one final thing  once again we have been 
invited by the grierson gallery of southern california to second one of 
our staff for a short visit  the grierson has a fairly modest 
collection  but it does include the most famous american painting of 
all whistlers mother  any thoughts

cut to the trustees  they shake their heads and wrinkle their noses 
not very interested  a 106 year old sir rupert puts up his hand

lord walton
yes  sir rupert  and may i say sir how honoured we are that you 
still grace us with all your time wisdom and infinite knowledge  
your invaluable thoughts sir

sir rupert
could you speak up please  i didnt catch the question

int  national gallery  storage office  day

back in his office area bean ceremoniously hands suit man the van hocht 
painting  hes very proud of himself

suit man
thank you bean  youre a genius

bean laughs  delighted  suit man exits and miss hutchinson enters 
warily

miss hutchinson
mr bean  lord walton would like to see you in the boardroom

bean gives a little pleasured squeak  how exciting for him  he 
follows miss hutchinson out into the corridor

cut to
int  national gallery  corridor  day

bean walks along the same corridor as before  turns off another light  
then comes to the room where he saw the programmer  the computer 
showing a van gogh portrait is on and noones there  bean who hates 
wasted electricity goes in to switch it off

we see the van gogh change to a pictorial representation of the storage 
room  with an arrow pointing to where the van gogh is located  bean 
is clearly going to be replaced by this programme  or not  bean 
searches for the plug but its under acres of desk  so he simply 
pulls a cable out of the back the computer  the entire system clicks 
off  at which moment the programmer comes back in

programmer
whats happening here

bean
ahm

with a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with 
puzzlement at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a 
random guess  and a disastrous one  there is a ugly electrical 
fizzle  the screens come on white then pop out completely

bean
ah ahm

bean realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the 
cable into another circuit  the van gogh appears happily on the 
screen  bean and programmer both give out a sigh of relief  bean 
smiles and leaves quickly  but a second later the computer screen 
disintegrates and the van gogh slides down the screen like a water
colour in the rain  the prog difficult to breathe

lord walton
you have your voting slips gentlemen  please remember the americans 
are looking for something quite high powered  a doctorate 
preferably

there is a knock at the door  bean enters  lord walton smiles  the 
rest of the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug  
bean is very nervous indeed

lord walton
gravely
ah mr bean  please take a seat for a moment  i have some news which 
will not im afraid

the phone rings  lord walton answers  bean sits next to vincent and 
sniffs at him  vincents breath hasnt improved

lord walton
into phone
yes  put him on timothy  the computer  yes when  how  all 
of it absolutely all of it  did you back it up  how long will it  
  another six months  fair enough  come up here will you dear boy

he slowly hangs up  everyone has got the gist of what has just 
occurred with the new computer the energy drains from them all as they 
contemplate another six months with bean still on the staff  lord 
walton coughs politely

lord walton
as i was saying gentlemen  the grierson gallery south california  
great opportunity  thousandsof milesaway though it is  doctorate or 
 impishly  no doctorate perhaps

all get the message at the same moment and hurriedly scribble on their 
voting slips  the slips get handed down the line to lord walton  we 
see that every single slip has bean on it

lord walton
mr bean  wonderful news  you are going to america

mr bean
overwhelmed
ooooh how lovely

there is a knock at the door  the fat bespectacled
programmer puts his head round it

lord walton
beaming 
ah timothy  youre sacked

int  national gallery  corridor  day

bean rounds a corner and walks towards us imitating a bowlegged 
cowboy  the theme from bonanza plays  he whips out his pair of 
imaginary six shooters spins them on his fingers and returns them to
their imaginary holsters making gun sound effects  hes very happy
he passes the security guard  he draws his gun on him  zero reaction 
the guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns

bean heads on through the gallery merrily  but suddenly his good mood 
is broken when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition 
called the ultrahuman form  this worries him  and we soon see why  
bean heads in to the room where all the paintings are very graphic 
nudes and the 3 girls are having a good giggle

bean quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the 
painting theyre inspecting

two girls then move on to the next painting  which unfortunately also 
has breasts  bean stretches and just manages to cover them with his 
other hand

now the third girl heads on so bean can drop the hand on the first 
painting  but now has to try to cover the breasts on the third 
painting which is a real long stretch away  he cant quite make it 
so he takes off his shoes which gives him the extra 3 inches  again 
safe  just

now all three girls leave the paintings  but to beans chagrin head 
over to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room  its 
like the 3 graces 3 naked women back to back  bean thinks fast  he 
quickly whips off his

12

belt and rushes over to the statue where he succeeds in looping it 
round to cover all six nipples

unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the 
other side of the gallery  to beans horror  because at that moment 
we reveal what is on the other side of the room  a epic painting in 
the style of the others  with literally 40 graphically naked people

bean sprints across the room stands on a chair and desperately tries 
to cover a particularly lurid example of a gentlemans manhood

at which moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls 
appear and scream in chorus  bean thinks that it is the painting that 
has caused offence and is in outraged agreement with them  he turns  
cut wide to reveal that they are screaming because hes beltless
trousers have fallen down

ext  grierson gallery  america  day

830 am california time  a modern building with plenty of glass  
large modern sculptures are spotted around its grounds including a 
dramatic one of two huge old cars head down in the ground backs 
protruding into the air

thomas grierson owner of the gallery wearing a slick expensive suit 
walks with dave leary and bernie both in casual jackets and ties  
grierson is a vain slightly pedantic and pompous man  maybe short  
always just trying to show hes boss  the three are strolling towards 
the main entrance  huge sign the grierson gallery with a silhouette 
of whistlers mother taken from the painting as an incorporated logo

grierson
lord walton assures me this guys one of the very top scholars in the 
english art world  has a couple of doctorates no less

bernie
great news

bernie is smooth and smiley  david leary vice president is a very 
pleasant but slightly worried man knocking on 40 too nice for his 
own good  the three pass a lone mime artist wearing a cheap vacform 
president clinton face mask  david cant help being just a little nice 
to him and finds himself left behind  he scampers to catch up

9
first catching under the handle  then the couch then

four other chairs  and finally the deep freeze  noones going to get 
in through that door

back in the hall bean pushes the string back inside the letter box and 
slaps his hand in satisfaction  he locks the doors enormous padlock 
looks about carefully to make sure no ones around and then hides the 
key under a garden gnome on the floor standing amongst a row of 
pathetic pot plants

mix through to
int  airport  reception desk  night

the lady checking in bean looks puzzled as she holds his passport  so 
he pulls the shockingly stupid face 0h yes she sees thats the guy 
in the picture  she hands him his ticket

checkin lady
here we go sir  youve been moved to l st class  apparently your 
friends at the gallery were so delighted that youre finally on your 
way

bean is very touched

cut to

int  airport lounge  night

bean enters the first class lounge  its fairly empty but bean still 
squeezes himself between an old lady drinking a cup of tea and a very 
grand looking american military man in a business suit

the grand man lights up a cigar  this doesnt please mr no smoking 
bean  first he waves the smoke away in small then big then huge 
wafting motions  then he tries miming to cut it up into segments and 
move them aside  the man pays no attention at all

bean puts a plastic mug over his face like a gas mask and breathes 
heavily  the man looks at him  but doesnt give a damn

bean now takes a paper bag  catches some of the smoke and take it 
over and empties it into the dust bin

the grand man goes on smoking stubbornly  he then sees a magazine rack 
and leaves his cigar as he goes to get one

david

sounds like a real coup sir getting this doctor of 


grierson
various things  thank you  however as you know this is not an 
inexpensive venture and financially speaking were in very serious 
crap right now

he cant quite hide his tackiness david holds the door for grierson  
then sees an old woman coming towards him  he waits for her to go 
through and due to his sweetness is again left behind  he rushes to 
catch up

they are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop  david 
exchanges smiles with the cashier annie  very bubbly not very 
bright  the shop is full of whistlers mother memorabilia  posters 
cards porcelain statuettes

grierson
so  im wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your 
home instead of some expensive hotel

bernie
love to sir but no can do  no spare room  period

grierson
david

david
oh look i mean its kind of the last thing i mean id really 
like to but things at home are kind of sensitive so i couldnt 
really er 

grierson
i thought perhaps as vicepresident and in view of the unfortunate 
attendances for the summer show this year the massive financial 
loss 

david
on the other hand  maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my 
family needs  yes  great news  fabulous  triumphant  course it 
might need a little smoothing over  whens he due

grierson hands david a piece of paper

grierson
tomorrow  you have a problem with that

pause

david
no perfect  looking forward to it

7 pm california time  a pleasant suburban house  davids car pulls 
into the drive  jennifer his slightly gothic 16 year old daughter is 
kissing brad her scruffy boyfriend  he sits astride a motor scooter  
he has a bumfluff moustache

david gets out of his car and approaches them                 


david

ext  mr  beans bedsit  night

house with its motor idling  its driver looks fed up waiting  bean 
appears at a downstairs window motioning to his watch that he will not 
be long

int  mr  beans bedsit  day

mr bean is ready to leave his room  battered old

suitcase in hand he checks the room from the doorway

every conceivable thing that can be opened  cupboards

drawers fridge sports an oversized padlock  even

beans old gpo phone has one on its dial

bean looks across to his teddy who is lounging on a miniature chair 
inside an upsided cardboard box  the box is sits on an armchair  a 
handwritten sign taped to its roof reads teddy hotel followed by 
three stars 
19

a smaller sign informs us that the hotel is full  bean is just 
about to leave but stops to consider  taking a felt tipped pen he 
adds two more stars on the hotel hoarding as a treat

he then slightly incomprehensibly begins to tie string it around 
various objects in the flat  the fridge  the corner of a chair a 
couch leg

int  mr  beans residences hallway  day

bean leaves his flat lee notice a large official sign stuck on the 
door saying no smoking  he now turns his attention to the pieces of 
string hanging out the letter box in his door  grabbing the bunch of 
them he pulls

cut to back inside the flat we now understand the string  as all the 
furniture starts to move across the flat  it works incredibly neatly 
the chair reaches the door

20

bean acts fast  he takes the cigar  and quickly dunks it in the old 
womans cup of tea

he sits there guiltlessly as the grand man returns  simultaneously 
the man tries to suck the wet cigar and the old woman drinks the 
disgusting tea  a horrid experience for both

int  aeroplane  day

boarding time  bean enters the plane and turns right into the body of 
the plane  after walking right down the plane he is directed by a 
hostess back up to first  as he walks back we notice the ridiculous 
contrast from totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of children 
and muzak to the elegance and space of first class

bean couldnt be more thrilled  there follows a sequence of short 
moments from this nightmare flight

1 the old teadrinking lady is being helped with her luggage  a 
hostess slides it into the compartment above her head

old lady
be careful  its for my granddaughter

the next instant bean comes up with his case  he opens the same 
locker and tries to fit his case in  doesnt quite go  so he pushes 
it violently  we hear crunching cracking sounds  finally its almost 
there  bean slams the locker door  one final definitive though 
muffled smash  the old lady looks at bean suspiciously

2 bean sits down  and who should be his next door neighbour  the 
grand man whose name is reynolds  bean smiles merrily  the affection 
is not mutual

champagne comes round instantly  bean takes it along with a small 
bowl of nuts and clinks glasses with his unsmiling partner  bean 
tries to impress him by throwing nuts up into the air and catching them 
in his mouth a well practised art  no response

bean then switches on the noisy overhead air blower  then cant turn 
it down again  its very stuck  he manages however to push it away 
from his face  straight into reynolds  reynolds looks annoyed bean 
guiltless

21

then bean has an idea  he takes a tissue out of his pocket puts in 
his mouth chews it into a spitball

and rams it into the blower  both of them are relieved  reynolds 
picks up his champagne to have his first proper sip  and whapp  the 
spitball under high pressure shoots

into it sending champagne spraying all over reynolds  not a good 
start


3bean is reading the inflight magazine  theres an annoying sound  
he looks sideways  it is the headphones of the young boy in the seat 
across the aisle  hes fallen asleep with his headphones on  bean 
looks annoyed  then suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a 
little pair of scissors he carries  he holds out his hand to snip the 
nail  and accidentally on purpose simply cuts the wire of the boys 
headset  thats better

4 night  wide shot of the plane  everyone is asleep except one pool 
of light  its mr bean still up reading

but even he is wilting  his eyes close and his body starts to waver 
towards sleep  next to him reynolds is in a total lying position  
and unfortunately as bean slowly tips over his mouth comes into 
direct contact with reynolds flies

from across the compartment a hostess sees whats happening  shes 
shocked comes over and taps bean on the shoulder  he shoots up and 
nearly strangles her in shock  she calms him down shows him how to 
put his chair back  and leaves him to sleep  cut on

5 reynolds still asleep  with bean asleep completely on top of him  
completely  his hand is spread on reynolds face  reynolds eyes 
open  he sees whats happened  his arm goes up and rings for the 
hostess

6 morning has broken  reynolds is still trying to sleep  bean is 
wide awake  the hostess approaches and the mother of the young boy 
says her son isnt very well

bean decides to cheer him up  he mimes an aeroplane which makes the 
boy feel more ill  then does a rather good lizard impersonation by 
sticking bits of paper to his tongue and eyelids and fluttering them

he then brings out a scrunched up bag of dolly mixtures and does his 
trick of throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth  the 
boy is too ill to be impressed

bean tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a 
cowboy and then a tough american cop  nothing  then he has an 
extremely fun idea  he empties the dolly mixtures from the paper bag 
and pockets them

22

he then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake reynolds 
when he sees its got a hole in it  no fun

meanwhile the boy has taken out his sickbag  bean is delighted  
yes thats perfect  he turns away for a split second to scrunch up 
the useless bag while unseen to him the boy vomits into his bag  
bean turns grabs the bag from him  blows into it puts it right into 
reynolds face at arms length and smacks his hands together  cut at 
just the right moment

patch in a semicircle around his neck  bean comes to a moving

brave gripping the handrail as though he was travelling at 100 mph

hands off the rail  there are a couple of cops leaning against a wall 
chatting  bean notices their guns  slipping into roleplay mode he 
reaches into his breast pocket ready to bring out his imaginary 
shooter  the last security guard he tried this with just yawned  so 
bean thinks its safe  but this time the cops turn and stare at him 
tensely

flustered by their interest in him bean needs to get away  he turns 
but finds that he is walking in the opposite direction on the spot  
the cops read this as suspicious behaviour and move towards him 
suspiciously  bean turns to gets himself going in the right direction  
the cops follow  bean runs  the cops give chase

you want when about to meet your new boss  damn

there now follow a quick complicated piece of business

1 bean spots a papertowel dispenser  he turns towards it at just the 
moment a man exits from a booth  bean turns back to the sink to hide 
his trousers as the man swiftly does his hands goes to the paper 
dispenser and takes the last towel  damn again

2 bean now puts his hope in a rolling towel  but its rather high  
he has to jump to try to reach the trouser  at which point another man 
enters  jumping bean has been caught in a very weird position  he 
pretends he has chosen the mens room as the place to do his rather 
energetic exercise routine

3 as the man leaves he then tries to blow the patch dry with his 
mouth  another man enters  again bean is 1 compromised  pretends 
its even more exercises  that man also enters a booth

4 bean suddenly notices the hand drying machine  he turns it on  a 
healthy blast of warm air  annoyingly its also rather too high  he 
tries jumping and bouncing to get his waist to the right height  its 
not going to work  brainwave  he climbs up on two sinks  now the 
drier is blowing in exactly the right place  bean sways to let the air 
cover the whole area  its working excellently

5 at which moment one of the men exits from a booth and sees him in 
the mirror  bean is in an immensely compromising sexwithmachine 
position  he pretends hes there to change the light bulb above which 
he takes out calmly and polishes  the man leaves bean smiles  but as 
he exits beans face transforms  hes totally scalded his fingers on 
the scorching bulb

full of paintings

grierson and bernie look up from a computer screen at david and bean 
who is rather weirdly carrying a newspaper in fronts of his flies  
grierson approaches david and shakes his hand

grierson
ah david  finally checks his watch deliberately  and this must be 
our professor from across the sea

david
yes this is doctor bean

bean
actually im not  er 


grierson 
this is bernard schimmel bernie the doctor

bernie offers his hand  bean has to do a nifty handchange to free up 
the correct hand for the handshake  the newspaper stays firmly in 
place

thomas grierson
ah  the tribune  mind if i just 

he reaches out to borrow the newspaper  bean has to squeeze in right 
next to the desk and sit behind it before he can hand the paper over    
thus ensuring the continued invisibility of the wet patch  grierson 
studies the paper for a second

grierson
take a seat gentlemen although before we settle  feast your eyes 
on these

grierson goes to a painting on a wall  david and bean follow  bean 
about one inch from davids back walking in perfect rhythm

out  venus and the cat aesops fables  isnt that something

he heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall  and bean and 
david follow still totally glued together  a strange sight

theyre beautiful sir

grierson
maybe  hell of a price i11 tell you  anyway  down to business

they head back to the desk  but bean in a momentary lapse of 
concentration fails to follow  hes now stuck on the wrong side of the 
room unable to turn around

grierson
bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a crossgallery computer 
system  dr bean  would you like to look at this  very exciting stuff 


bean
ahm  no

grierson is slightly surprised  but they persevere

bernie
what im doing dave is developing the ultimate userfriendly 
interactive public guide to the gallery

punching buttons on the computer he reveals wonderful maps of the 
gallery and when clicking on sections of the map graphic explanations 
of each rooms contents

42

meanwhile  bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room  he 
moves around the room always facing straight to the wall  when he 
reaches the fan he switches it on unfortunately its a rotating fan  
so to keep the wind on his trousers bean has to do a strange rhythmic 
dancing movement following the arc of the fan

david
its very good bernie

bernie
but the particular glory of the system is that it can also work oh 
large screens in each individual room  so we can network the program 
to every room in the gallery

grierson
not bad eh  what do you think doctor  ah doctor bean

bean turns shocked to have been observed  he looks down at his 
trousers and hooray theyre dry at last  hes delighted and moves 
back across the road towards them hands in pockets in a big 
confident grointhrusting drytrouser boasting walk

grierson
well thanks for dropping by  enjoy your stay with our vice president 
and his family  theyre simple peoplebut warm yes doctor

bean
im not actually um

grierson
 settled in yet  i know  plenty of time  bernie perhaps youd 
like to take dr bean on a tour of the gallery

bernie
absolutely  this way sir

bean displays his crotch proudly one last time before he and bernie 
exit  grierson tries to fathom the strange man who just left

grierson
hes a genius right

grierson

beans interest is drawn to the mime artist we met before in his 
clinton mask performing his heart out in front of the dead cars 
sculpture  bean lingers

the mime accosts a woman pretending to brush dust from her clothes 
comb her hair etc  the mime is a bit of a pain in the ass really  the 
woman quickly moves on

bean is intrigued  the mime mimes climbing a ladder  bean goes up 
next to him  and looks up  theres nothing there  he decides the 
mime is a bit of a tricky  this is confirmed when the mime pretends 
hes locked behind a pane of glass  bean simply pokes his finger 
through the imaginary glass wall and hits the mimes nose

cut to david watching bemusedly some way off

the mime is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last  
he takes a handkerchief from beans pocket and gets bean to guess 
which hand the hankys in its not in the left  not in the right  
bean isnt the slightest bit impressed  he just reaches round and 
takes the hanky from where its tucked into the mimes trousers  and 
heads away  as he moves off the mime touches h on the shoulder  
bean turns and the mime starts a mocking gun duel  he draws his guns  
bean is pretty unimpressed

the mime turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw 4 he turns 

but now bean decides to settles it once and for all  in a brilliant 
piece of big mime he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside 
an arnold schwarzenegger movie  he sets up a pedestal  opens a case  
lifts out a hugely heavy gun  then the 7 bits that click on that gun  
then opens another case and takes out the huge artillery shell to load 
it

the mime is getting very frightened  then bean pulls up an imaginary 
stool to sit behind his megagatling gun  the mime begins to run away  
bean twirls in his imaginary seat and lines up his sights following 
the terrified mime

45

finally in a boom that almost knocks bean out of his imaginary seat 
he fires 10 seconds delay and the mime falls in a very dramatic 
death 50 yards away

bean is happy  and heads back to the parking lot where david arms 
folded leans against his car  david gets into his car  bean opens 
the passenger door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive 
car nextdoor same as this morning

ext  shopping mall  parking lot  day

david parks next to a beaten up convertible

david

okay  ill get some steaks  alison loves steak  wine  good  
candy  no candy  alison hates candy  we gotta do this right bean 
or  looks at bean just stay out  of trouble okay

bean nods  david gets out and  heads for the mall  nearby woman tramp 
bag lady goes  through a trash can

bean tries to control himself  but weakens  he plays with all the 
buttons and switches on the dashboard windshield wipers lights  then 
he notices a throbbing noise  he gets out of the car to investigate

bean swiftly locates the throbbing sound  the eempty convertible has 
its engine running  bean notices the keys in the ignition  how stupid 
of someone  he turns off the engine and takes out the keys  there are 
several people returning to their cars with groceries  bean offers the 
car keys to them as if to say are these yours

the following should take place at quite a speed real drama

then suddenly a robber dashes towards bean from the direction  of the 
mall weaving in and out of parked cars with a small white carrier 
bag assumedly full of money  he wears jeans a black poloneck and 
much to beans delight a president clinton facemask  as far as 
beans concerned this is his old friend the mime

robber throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible 
and gets in  but he cant find the keys to start it  he frantically 
searches all his pockets 

46


bean leans into shot  he holds out the keys grinning

robber
gimme the keys

bean runs away with them  or doesnt  he is in mime mode  and runs 
on the spot getting faster and faster  the robber approaches this 
obvious madman  he is quite a tough scary and scared individual

robber
i said give me the keys

bean turns and holds out two hands just like the mime did to him  the 
perplexed robber picks one hand  wrong one  he then pulls a gun 
and puts it hard to mr bean in beans face  passersby scream and fall 
to the ground the bag lady amongst them  sudden harsh reality

but not to bean  he simply takes the gun and waves it in the robbers 
face ticking him off for breaking the rules

robber
okay okay  take it easy

bean gestures the robber to turn around he does sure this sicko is 
going simply to shoot him in the head but instead bean puts his back 
to the robbers back and starts to count

bean
1234 5 678 910

he turns and gestures to the robber its time to draw  by this time a 
crowd has gathered

robber
but i havent got a f

bean
ssssh

he points out a small child watching from behind a trash can

david is hurrying back to the parking lot with a bag of groceries and 
a big bunch of red roses he stops dead in his tracks as he spots 
something

away

ext  shopping mall  parking lot  day 

bean waves the gun at the robber

robber
i havent got a gun

but bean is pushing him to draw  finally

robber
okay okay i11 do it

he draws  bean draws too  they fire  and bean really fires  to his 
amazement  onlookers scream  bean throws the gun away in startlement

the robber lunges for it  bean kicks it away trying to help him avoid 
such a dangerous implement

the robber lunges at bean who throws the keys away over his shoulder  
the robber has to scrabble under a car for them bean thinks of final 
joke  and niftly swaps the robbers bag for one of the old bag ladys 
bags  a few dollar notes spill out of it

when the robber emerges with the keys bean s waiting to escort him to 
his car  he opens the door  then spots a tourist hiding and puts his 
arm around the robber and gets him to take a photograph of them  bean 
removes the robbers mask as the picture is taken  forgetting himself 
the robber smiles for the camera

the robber jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching police 
car sirens jumps in the car and drives away  bean waves goodbye to 
the convertible as a couple of police cars screech up  cops jump out

david approaches the scene with groceries and roses what kind of hell 
has bean caused now  but instead of trouble he sees the passersby 
are getting to their feet applauding bean and whistling  they crowd 
round the cops explaining what a hero bean has been

bean hands over the gun to a cop  he doesnt really understand what 
all the fuss is about  he notices the bag

48

lady wandering away with her bags  should he tell her that he has 
swapped one of them for the robbers  no hes getting too much 
attention to be bothered  a cop comes up to bean  it is cop 1 from 
the airport scene

cop 1

closed venetian blinds  two or three detectives slouched in the 
shadows

table smoking  he is looking at a photo  a closeup reveals it to be 
a full length one of bean and the robber outside the mall with the 
robbers face unmasked  brutus eyes bean for a while  bean is 
terrified  brutus taps the photo

brutus
its eddie guardino  go pick him up

one of the detectives lazily leaves the room  brutus leans forward on 
his elbows

brutus
guardino fled the scene with 160 k in a white plastic bag we got the 
car  we got the bag  and we got 20 pairs of stinking pantyhose 
drags on his cigarette anything you wanna tell me

bean looks at h4m blankly  brutus holds up the photo

brutus
fraid im gonna have to keep this

bean calmly takes the picture and tears it in half  he gives back the 
robber half and puts the other half with himself on into his pocket  
brutus glares at him

brutus

goblins  he gets his delighted face right up to the screen  he sings 
along with the catchy tune  kevin is getting frustrated

kevin

kevin clicks on a cuckoo clock in the wizards room  the cuckoo pops 
out holding a key in its beak

kevin
its gotta be here  something to get the key away from the stupid 
cuckoo

repeatedly clicks on the frog

bean
click click click click click 

the frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone  kevin gets 
excited

kevin

bean grins and makes winkle pick up the stone  then he clicks through 
to inside the wizards house  he makes winkle throw the stone at the 
cuckoo which instantly drops the key from its beak

david

bean acquiesces  he starts from the beginning with pictures of him as 
a kid  always standing on his own

picture of bean with mop of frizzy hair at 16  david smiles  bean 
mimes stupid disco dancing

david turns another page  it is a sequence of pictures of bean at 
famous uk locations  big ben stonehenge buckingham palace 10 
downing street  they are idiosyncratic because all taken by him at 
arms length with his polaroid  so he never quite makes it squarely 
into shot

a whole page of teddy  then three pages of beans mini with dates on 
labels going way back

then a whole page of garden gnomes

david
none of your folks here  family

bean starts to look for something in particular  david uses the pause 
to broach the awful subject

david

here twelve all

bean has found what he was looking for  it is the picture of the 
family that he took from the landing on his first night here  whats 
left of the polaroid of himself from the mall that he rescued from

its padlock

there is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet 
seesaw fashion  one end of it is wedged under the wardrobe

beans gpo phone rings on the table and its vibrations cause the 
bust of beethoven to fall over the edge of the table  it lands on the 
end of the ironing board  the wardrobe groans as it is set off balance 
and falls against the wall with a heavy thump and raising of dust

bean and david do the rest of the journey in quick cuts  along 
corridors  in an elevator  a sense of expectation and excitement  en 
route they are joined by elmer the huge security guard

the three arrive outside a large oak door  elmer ceremoniously unlocks 
the door all the time glaring at bean  who swallows hard  a light 
turns green and a buzzer sounds

then there is the door to the inner sanctum  elmer stares at bean as 
he unlocks it  another light turns green and another buzzer sounds

david
as you can see securitys pretty tight in this section  nobody gets 
past elmer here  isnt that right

elmer
not in one piece anyway  i see mrs whistler as kind of  like my own 
dear mother  id kill any man that tried to interfere with her  the 
vice president here will vouch for that

bean nods  david leaves him  bean is still for a while and then goes 
up and inspects it closely

he tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame  he 
blows it away fussily  he steps back to admire the painting  there is 
dust up his nose and sneeze  all over the painting

he takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic  then 
looks back at the painting  unfortunately there now seems to be a big 
blue mark right across mrs whistlers face

bean checks his handkerchief  yes theres wet ink all over it  he 
finds the leaking pen in his pocket 0 god  he takes out his shirt 
spits on it and tries to wipe the painting but he cant make the shirt 
reach it  he takes the painting down from the wall and has another go  
no good  the ink just spreads right over whistlers mothers pure 
white collar

bean now looks round in panic  what the hell can he do  he goes to 
the heavy door  and looks out into the corridor  he hears someone 
coming hides and sees a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a 
slightly squeaky trolley past covered with a white cloth

he goes back in  and has an idea  he goes to a little table in the 
corner and begins to take thing off it

int  gallery  upstairs corridor  day

the door opens and bean emerges pushing what appears to be a trolley 
covered with a white cloth  although if you look carefully this 
trolley actually has no legs  it is the painting covered with the 
table cloth  to make it a bit more convincing bean makes an apt 
squeaky noise

he proceeds along the thin corridor  and then sees another exactly 
similar trolley coming right towards him a problem  as they get 
close bean suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the 
oncoming man

bean
silently mouths
what the  

when the man turns bean just twists his painting sideways and shoots 
past him  we see the face of the deeply perplexed trolleypusher when 
he looks back and bean is no longer there  he turns round to bean who 
turns back to him with a totally blank and innocent look  bean sees an 
elevator and heads for it

bean manages to get the painting into trolley position before the doors 
open to a group of six very fat middle aged people  they all wear 
large badges declaring them to be members of a diet club  they 
squeeze into the elevator along both sides of beans trolley  there is 
a very very thin woman behind them who cant fit on

thin woman
i guess ill see you up there guys

the doors close  as the painting is wedged against the fat peoples 
stomachs on both sides bean is able to let go of it and make a great 
show of checking his watch  he nonchalantly drums the fingers of both 
hands on the top of the trolley  the bell dings

toilet  about a yard wide  but the picture fits in

bean starts to wash the painting very carefully and lo  the ink

david
yes  i11 mention it to him  but  hes kind of his own guy you 
know

bernie
howls he getting on with the family

david
ah fine  its good  its great

we will be slightly distracted by the observation that whistlers 
mother americas most valuable painting is at this moment balanced on 
a very thin ledge three floors up  where bean has put in outside the 
mens room window  a bird and then a couple more birds perch on it

bernie
and howls alison

david
shes  well shes good

bernie
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers  nice 
guy  good looking

david

bernie
its great when people who work together can become real friends

david

bernie
i like to think thats whats happened with you and me  even though 
youre kinda my boss  still maybe it wont always be that way huh

david doesnt quite see what bernie is getting at but smiles politely

now we see beans plan  he has emerged at a nearby window  he cant 
reach the painting at first  so he stretches further and further out 
the window  no good  finally he has to go out on the ledge  he shoos 
away the birds who then decide to settle on him instead  finally he 
gets a hand on the painting  as he does so he loses hold  he just 
manages to grabs a window before he falls

david
look ive left bean on his own nice to chat though bernie  always a 
subtle joy

bernie
thanks david  always a pleasure

period

bean is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window 
with the painting  it is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics  david 
turns to go

bernie
by the way  dont know what you think mr vice president but ive 
been hinting to the old man that someones got to have the balls to 
take some sort of emergency measures around here  or were all in the
crap house  what do you think                     


david
emergency measures in your book means sack people right

bernie
not necessarily  thats where this   points to his brain  comes 
in  no ive had a better idea than sacking people  youll hear soon 
enough

a small storeroom where beans wriggling bottom is just coming back 
through the window  he has the picture and is safe

he sets the picture down on a table  darn  the birds have done their 
business on it

he maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a 
shelf  he chooses a can too rusty to read its label takes off the 
lid and sniffs  this smells like the right sort of stuff  he pours 
the liquid on to a rag and rubs it on the face of mrs whistler  the 
solvent effortlessly removes the ink stain  whistlers mother looks as 
good as new

bean is so so relieved  but then he notices something else 
happening  the liquid did not stop with removing the stain  it is now 
busy removing whistlers mothers face entirely  as bean watchesin 
frozen horror americas most famous painting turns back to a blank 
canvas

bean thinks for a second  and then has a desperate thought  removing 
the pen that started all the trouble he decides to try to draw back on 
whistlers mothers face  he doesnt have much time  it shows  
where once was a sublime oil painting is now a biro linedrawing which 
looks a little like danny de vito

bean lifts it against the wall to check how its worked  
unfortunately theres a nail there  the picture tears bean panics  
it tears even more  total destruction

knock  bean moves the big table in front of the door  hes

seems to be a problem with the doorpause wheres the picture gone

bean
ahm

david
what  what

pause  pause  bean finally shows it  not a pretty sight

david
oh jesus  oh god  oh jesus god  oh mary mother of jesus oh jesus of 
nazareth

bean
oh dear

david
what happened

bean
ahm setting himself up for an interesting comprehensive answer

65

david
dont bother panicking oh my god

he rushes to the door he just came in  and locks it

wait a minute  why am i worrying about this i did it  i just go out 
and tell them what happened  youre a madman from england and you did 
this terrible thing and its not my fault  thats right isnt it

bean nods knowing he deserves his doom

perfect  and then they say  who left him alone with the picture and 
i say  me  and they say youre fired  and i say  right  and 
so i get fired and you go to jail and no ones any happier

bean shakes his head

and then they say firing david isnt enough  lets prosecute him for 
negligence  and they prosecute me and it turns out i was negligent and 
i go to jail and my wife leaves me and my daughter becomes a 
prostitute and i end up on death row sharing a cell with butch mcdick 
the infamous gay rapist  or worse i end up in the same cell as you

bean looks hurt

no nonow lets just be calm lets think about this calmly he 
tries  and fails   oh godigodigod  okay now wait  lets have 
another look at it

bean shows it to him

jesus  im already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as paradise 5 
minutes ago  just walking along shooting the breeze with my old pal 
bernie

bean then he has a brilliant idea  he hangs the painting back up in 
the security cupboard and closes the doors  then he removes from his 
pocket a small note book

66



he scribbles something on it tears the page out licks it and sticks 
it on the cupboard door it reads out of order 



david
brilliant  brilliant problem solved

bean is delighted 

apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the 
cupboard will say look someones totally destroyed whistlers 
mother lets kill them 

bean is less delighted

no  the most important thing is tbat noone sees it
ever again

he locks the cupboard with his plastic card key

thats the first thing  then  thats the first thing next  
next is the next thing which is obviously ritual suicide  look 
lets get out of here  try to act natural

the let themselves out and go into the corridor bean acting his 
version of natural  very liquid

int  corridor  day

they bump straight into grierson and elmer

grierson
ah david  showing dr bean our good lady

bean
actually im not a

david
thats right  whistlers mother looking at his mother  not his 
father  not interested in his father couldnt give a flying doughnut 
for his sisters or brothers  just his mother yes 


grierson
well good  think i may go and look at her myself 
	

67


david
no

grierson
er  pray tell me why

elmer
because theyve just cut her into tiny pieces sir  thats why

bean and david die and go to hell until elmer laughs at his own little 
joke  grierson laughs too

elmer
i better continue my rounds sir

he strolls away

david
the thing is sir ive just been giving the painting a very thorough 
inspection with the help of dr bean here  and we feel the times come 
for whistlers mum to have her first facelift

grierson
time taken its toll on the old girl eh

david
exactly  shes in a surprisingly terrible state  isnt she bean

bean
oh yes

david
whistler was a great painter but he wasnt a great chooser of paints 


bean hudders at the thought of his paintchoosing

the colours are beginning to fade  however  if you give me just one 
little year i can restore the picture to its original glory the way it 
looked when whistlers mom first looked at it and said 0 actually 
im not sure youve got the hair right darling by the way your hair 
is looking great today sir

68

grierson
thank you david  however flattery will get you nowhere  truth is i 
have a rather different plan for whistlers dear mama  bernie and i 
have been inspecting our books  and the long and short of it is we 
cannot survive with our current losses so 

david
 you have to sack me  i understand sir  ill go quietly  in fact 
ill go right now

grierson
no no no hold on  we cant sustain our loses  so ive decided 
to sell whistlers mother

david lets out a little yelp

grierson
brilliant huh  i already have a prospective buyer  the current 
governor of california no less who is flies in tomorrow to inspect 
her and clinch the deal  spread the news  i think decisive leadership 
has done the trick dont you

david
yes sir  yes sir  congratulations marvellous thing  bravo

grierson leaves  david turns to bean

david
bean  do you drink

bean shakes his head

david
neither do i

int  bar  night

it is very late and very gloomy  just a couple of loners staring into 
their drinks  the bartender is up one end of the counter smoking and 
reading the sports pages  there is a tv on above the bar showing 
baseball

69

bean and david are sitting up at the bar  the latter has had far too 
much whisky and looks the worse for it  bean has a tall glass packed 
with fruit and paper umbrellas  we can guess how much hes had to 
drink by the way he has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth  
david almost but not quite slurs his words

david
its just a matter of acceptance isnt it  lose your job  lose you 
wife  cest la vie  you ever been married bean

he turns to bean who has the end of a straw up his nose

david
i guess not

he fills his glass from a bottle

you know i dont get it  the new artist exhibitionthis year  people 
might not all have liked the dead sheep but  the place didnt look 
that empty to me  it wasnt full but i saw people  i just dont 
understand how the gallery can be so bankrupt they have to sell the 
whistler

he looks at bean who now has peanuts in each nostril  
david notices the bartender looking at bean strangely 

david
hes english okay  you wanna make something of it

bartender goes back to reading  david searches for his last train of 
thought taking a huge swig from his drink

david
 to hell with the figures  im not a damn accountant  im an 
artist you know me and ali met in art school  i cut quite a figure 
then  far cry from the man you see before you now  then i smoked 
gitanes before i went to bed to help me sort out the problems of the 
world  now i take a spoonful of laxative before i go to bed to help 
me sort out the problem with my bowels

70


bean at that moment is keen to show david his nut trick  he throws a 
peanut high into the air  and catches it in his mouth  then does two  
then does it with his eyes closed  actually its rather impressive

david
truth is i disappointed her  i turned out to have no spine  
spineless  a kind of medical miracle  mr flippyfloppy  i just dont 
seem to be able to fight  cant stick up for myself  too nice  i 
mean i should never have let you come stay and i should be handing you 
over to the police right now  shall i tell you something beanie 

bean has been interested all this even looking to check whether david 
does indeed have no spine  but now the baseball on the tv is making it 
hard for him to concentrate onthis important confidence  he raises a 
finger for david to be quiet for a second  he blows a peanut from 
his nostril at the tv  it hits the button and changes station to a 
pleasant quietmusic station

david
do you want to know what the reality of the situation is

bean nods his head very curious listening hard

this is it  because you moved into my house my wife has left me  she 
might have done it anyway  but you were the ten ton weight that broke 
the camels spinal column

bean stares at david  something is getting in hes actually 
registering this

thats point one  and point two  is that youve destroyed whistlers 
mother which was the last hope for the place where i work  so within 
a week im going to lose my job as well

bean nods seriously dispirited

71

david
so youve totally and utterly destroyed my life  do you understand  
youve put me in a position where it would have been better if id 
never been born

he puts his hand on beans shoulder  bean looks down

very sad  this is actually the first time in his life that hes 
realised that his actions have really effected the life of another 
person  bean looks up sadly  sad music plays

david is asleep in bed  the camera moves out into the hall and into 
beans room


int  the leary house  beans room night

bean is lying fully dressed in the darkness on his back  thinking  
worried by what hes heard  then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes  
the music is like his brain he jumps off the bed

there follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence  
but the tools here are distinctly bizarre  bean picks up his 
suitcase and in quick cuts rushes through the house and collects

davids plastic key card
a pair of yfronts

a torch
some of kevins chewing gum 6 eggs
a cooking basin
a cup
a large paint brush
a bottle of clear nail varnish davids large tin of laxative  a hair 
drier
an action man doll
a poster of the girl and her bottom with the tennis ball

two oven gloves
a skateboard
and 4 volumes of the encyclopaedia britannica
fully tooled he snaps the suitcase shut

ext  gallery  night

the building is floodlit by ground spots

bean arrives silently with suitcase on the skateboard  soon his full 
plan will be revealed  the gallery is empty apart from the one 
security guard buck visible through the glass front of the building 
drinking coffee watching his 12 security monitors  bean swallows at 
the sight of buck  he is a massive gorilla of a man

cut to


int  grierson gallery  reception  night

buck is casually watching his screens when suddenly horror of horror 
the huge silhouette of a person hanging themselves from a tree outside 
appears the shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery 
wall  buck frantically rushes out  and bean subtly slips in

cut to


ext  grierson gallery  night

buck is looking for the body amongst the trees  he finds nothing  
because he fails to notice the tiny action man swinging gently in front 
of one of the groundlevel floodlights

cut to


int  grierson gallery  night

inside bean is casually pouring the entire contents of davids large 
laxative tin into bucks coffee  he also swaps two keys on the board 
of keys by the desk  he then takes the opportunity to put the oven 
gloves on his feet one shaped like a pig one like a crocodile so he 
can move silently

buck returns  he sits down and takes a long gulp of coffee  pause  
bean watches  buck feels something uncomfortable in his stomach  he 
takes a key from his rack of keys and sets off and rounds a corner on 
a monitor screen bean watches him break into a canter  as he passes 
through another monitor buck is at full sprint  bean giggles

bean is satisfied hell be uninterrupted for a while  he goes to the 
keyrack borrows two keys and sets off on his mission  the next 3 
minutes of film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios

73


first buck  his next 10 minutes are not happy ones  when he reaches 
the toilet the key he chose does not unlock it  he has to sprint 
back grab all the keys and charge back again to the door  then he 
has to try out every single key  we never see him find the right one

second scenario  all the activities of the night shown on the security 
monitors  buck sprinting desperately through shot  bean casually 
going about his business and on one occasion buck running right past 
bean but not seeing him  he has other things on his mind

third scenario  we actually see beans big plan

he unlocks the merchandise shop  so he can see properly and have his 
hands free he puts the yfronts on his head and wedges the torch into 
them like a headlamp  he then takes a poster of whistlers mother 
and replaces it with the rolledup tennis ball girl  he unrolls the 
whistler and places the 4 encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it 
down

he separates the yokes from the eggs mixes the whites with clear nail 
varnish and varnishes theposter with it  dries it off with the hair 
drier

with the now stiff poster he heads up elevators and escalators to get 
to the whistler room itself all the time chewing gum frantically  
once there he unlocks the final cupboard with davids plastic key 
takes the whistler down and removes the destroyed mother from its 
gilded frame and its wooden support frame  he uses the chewed gum to 
stick the new one down to the old frame

he then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security 
cupboard and relocks it with davids key card

the job is done  he scrunches up the old torn picture pops it in a 
dustbin and heads off

takes out a small screwdriver and twiddles with something on the 
engine

the bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the

pleased with himself indeed

bean smiles and gives kevin a thumbsup  kevin returns the gesture and 
exits

back to the computer bean clicks on an icon which takes him to the 
ground floor gallery  he clicks through various paintings and stops at 
the painting of the woman in the castle wearing the chastity belt  
bean clicks and enlarges the painting to fill the screen

he happily hums the catchy tune from goblins 2 and homes in on the 
tiny padlock on the chastity belt  padlocks interest him  he clicks 
on the keyhole rapidly as we have seen him do with the frog in goblins

mr bean
click click click click click

suddenly to beans surprise the padlock starts to flash redthen 
the whole screen starts to flash  before going dramatically back to 
black  now flashing in the centre of the monitor is an icon of a 
tiny key  beneath it a row of six dashes appears eg        
 a cursor is flashing over the first dash

bean is totally absorbed  he loves these kinds of puzzles  with one 
finger he slowly types out letters on the keyboard he has to search 
for some of them  as he does so they appear over each dash in turn

is dawning on him he punches in

bean panics a bit turns and half climbs over into the back seat when 
he spies a drinks cabinet  he has a very good idea  he finds a cut 
crystal decanter of brown liquid opens it and uses it to douse the 
fire  not a wise move with brandy  before the cut we see the 
whooosh of a major fire in the front seat of the car

the front of the car isnt what it was  there has been a big fire  
its out now  three decanters lie empty  bean is not happy  finally 
he decides to go for brute strength  he turns the car on again puts 
it into reverse and puts his foot down on the accelerator

we see the car from above  full throttle  totally still  totally 
still  and then whoooosh wham  it reverses at 100 mph straight 
backwards smashing violently into and destroying the back of the car

reynolds stops to admire a small painting  a twelfth century 
crucifixion of christ

grierson
ah one of my favourites  it expresses a universal agony that the 
established church so rarely acknowledges dont you think

reynolds

feet like that  dammed if i have  lets move it shall we

bernie spots a slightly concerned david

david

int  parking lot  day

bean is inspecting the car  hes not too happy with it  he tries to 
get the bonnet down but it insists on staying up  he shrugs his 
shoulders and gets in to drive off again having to wind down the 
window and drive by leaning his head out  this means that as he heads 
for the exit he fails to see the system to stop people leaving without 
paying a foot high barrier that appears out of the ground  when he 
hits it the car stops dead

bean gets out leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where 
normally the attendant would be  but everyone is in the gallery at the 
moment  inside he pushes a couple of buttons and hurrah gets the 
one that drops the barrier  less hurrah he has forgotten to put on 
the hand brake

as he moves back towards the car it glides slowly down the ramp on the 
outside of the building then accelerates and finally on a 
particularly sharp turn smashes through the wall and flies off the 
building  we hear a crash  but do not see where it lands

atmosphere

everyone enters

david
ladies and gentlemen  most of you have seen whistlers mother before 
can i ask you just to step back  thank you

its part of his plan of caution  he knows theres something wrong  
and wants as few people as possible to see the painting close up  the 
crowd moves back

david
id like the governor to have as it were a private audience with his 
new friend

reynolds is flattered  silence  david inserts the plastic card key  
opens the doors  and sure enough there in all its glory is whistlers 
mother  respectful silence

reynolds is delighted  he stands back to inspect her

reynolds
well hello maam  yes  she certainly looks a million dollars to me  
or should i say ten million dollars

everyone applauds

grierson
bravo  what do you say to a final glass of though i say it myself 
rather expensive champagne grins smugly

91

people start to file out  reynolds grierson bernie and david stay 
behind  david spots bean arriving  he hands the car keys back to 
bernie with a slightly dazed smile  david eagerly takes his arm and 
brings him over

david
governor i dont believe youve met dr bean our expert from england

they turn to each other  recognition from bean its the man from the 
plane  he does a very quick handshake and tries to make a getaway 
before reynolds recognises him

bean
ah hello sorry i  ahm sorry 

bean turns  in fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops 
anyone getting too close to the great painting  he spins and falls in 
the direction of the painting

cut to the looks of horror on all the faces

going to tear the painting  he doesnt  he simply catches hold of the 
bottom of the ornate frame  it snaps off

raises a glass of champagne to bean and smiles

int  operating theatre  night

inside the operating theatre a body is waiting in position  there are 
3 attending nurses and an assistant doctor  they all look up to bean 
as he enters fully kitted up

assistant
good evening doctor what we have here is a bullet wound in the lower 
thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung and theres severe inner 
bleeding along the abdomen

nurse 2
hes coming round

assistant
give him a t 70 straight away

the victim starts to move  he looks up  we see his face for the first 
time  it is the police officer brutus  he is in great pain  as the 
sedative shot goes in bean takes off his mask and smiles with a 
little wave  a look of total panic goes over brutus eyes as he loses 
consciousness

assistant
shall i do the cut sir

bean nods  hes not going to argue with anyone  the assistant cuts  
bean is horrified almost faints then snatches the knife  he cant 
believe this maniac has just cut through another personas flesh

100


assistant
im sorry its only my first week

bean hands the knife to the nurse testily

nurse
im afraid well now have to wait for the xrays doctor or well 
never find the bullet  come on everyone sort out the support systems

everyone turns to get on with their particular jobs  bean is left with 
the body  a pause  he gets a little bored  takes a sweet packet out 
of his pocket  only one sweet left he takes it out lovingly and then 
does what he always does  throws it up into the air to catch it in 
his mouth

unfortunately he forgets that he is wearing a mask  it hits the 
middle of the mask and bounces into the cut in the body

bean looks down annoyed  checks round him  everyones still busy  
so he puts his hand in the body really rummages around finds the 
sweet takes it out and then realises hes in fact got the bullet 
between his fingers guiltily he slips it back into the body 
rummages a bit more finds the sweet wipes it  pops it in his mouth  
at which second the xray arrives

assistant
here we go doctor  studying the xray  the bullet is here  so 
well probably have to extend the cut to here think we all better be 
prepared for a long one here  this is tricky

bean tuts scornfully  youre wrong 1 reaches in again feels around 
for a second and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers

they all applaud

with here sir

alison looks round and shakes her head  bean kicks david in the 
shins  david looks round puzzled  there is a poster of the human 
skeleton  bean points to the spine  david looks but cannot fathom a 
relevant meaning from it

another doctor comes along  the same one who they spoke to first  
hes young confident slightly arrogant

alison
excuse me doctor

doctor

spineless

david

a hint of a smile arrives on alisons lips shes heard that somewhere 
before

david

explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be 
absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention 
you are going to give her case

nervous and shifty  dead silence as grierson stands very solemnly

grierson
colleagues  what can i say  incidents such as occurred yesterday 
teach a man important lessons  on reflection i realise it would have 
been a sin to sell whistlers mother to such an impertinent philistine 
as governor reynolds  and therefore i blame myself for having ever 
let things get to such a pass that we felt we had realise our the staff 
 twelve got today ive schimmel as to sell her  i suddenly problem 
here hasnt been its been the leadership flabby lazy and so decided 
to appoint bernie my new vicepresident

this

grierson
hes a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st 
century

bernie
thank you sir  although im afraid i dont quite see how we can 

grierson
good point bernie  precisely the kind of perceptive interjection id 
expect from my new vp how can we you ask survive without whistlers 
mother  our single greatest asset  well the truth is  we cant  so 
what am i saying  will we find her again  never  this robber was 
clearly the work of a criminal of great genius

bean looks pleased  but then realises its not a suitable emotion  so 
nods sagely

insurance  not a chance  those bastards never pay  so surely were 
bankrupt  surely your jobs are forfeit  surely youre back on the 
unemployment lines scraping a living as waiters and boys  yes  yes 
indeed  except for one little thing one little thing done by one 
little man  dare i say one helluva little man  watch this

everyone is totally at a loss  grierson stands and moves to the framed 
poster of whistlers mother on the wall  he then produces a plastic 
key card and inserts it in a slot on the side of the frame  a buzz and 
a click  an electric motor starts to whirrrr 

the glass along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster 
slides gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster 
is in fact the original oil of whistlers mother

grierson
ladies and gentlemen  the real whistlers mother

there are gasps from the room  bean is open mouthed

grierson beams as many applaud and bean now joins in hyperactively  
hes saved

grierson                                  
the best security in the world is no match for a master criminal  but 
no master criminal is a match for me  thank you all  now if you would 
please return to your posts my new vice president bernard shimmel

heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred through your recent 
lack of professional judgement  a loss i trust bernie will be able to 
reverse

he pushes a button that sends a picture of whats happening in his 
office throughout the gallery

my friends good news  mr schimmel is not only no longer vice 
president  he actually no longer works here

bernie

here at his fingertips pointing at bean theres your criminal

into applause

seat of one  grierson bean  david watch

to uniformed cop

ask him a few questions about the destruction of the whistler copy

bean nods his head firmly  the car pulls away  then breaks and 
reverses  the sidekick gets out

sidekick

sidekick opens the back of the car  he takes out a huge bunch of 
flowers

the chief said i was to give you these

bean is delighted  then sniffs the flowers  what a nasty stink  not 
his sort of thing at all

sidekick drives away  grierson turns to david

grierson
i owe you a very serious apology young man  it wouldnt surprise me 
if you wanted to leave us after this  i sincerely hope that you do 
not

david

he looks sideways to bean who is frantically pointing to his spine  
david gets the message and changes his tune

let me think about that thomas  wed have to talk quite a salary 
hike

grierson

david

grierson
mmmmm


david
maybe two cars

grierson
a car sounds sensible

david

david heads off  bean wants to follow but needs to get rid of the 
stinky flowers  he turns to annie and gives them to her to be rid of 
them  she beams with delight after all he did love her

bean heads off with david to the parking lot  as they go david puts 
an arm round bean

who shoos him away instantly  no sloppiness for him

off bean sticks his hand of the window  and waves a last farewell to 
alison and jennifer  at last a sentimental moment  romantic music 
swelling  like liza minelli at the end of cabaret

until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as 
the car squeezes past

the three 30 year old women dressed in curly red wigs from the

bean nods abruptly picks up his case checks his watch and goes  he 
doesnt look back  kevin and david turn and walk away  david does 
stop to look back over his shoulder at bean heading off in the 
distance  but bean doesnt turn so david walks on

then there is suddenly a tap on his shoulder  its bean as though

grin and then a little wave  and heads away  in the distance he 
treads on the back of some ones shoe

empty gallery and shakes his head

and goes to his mini where teddy sits on a pile of books in the front 
seat wearing a seat belt  bean gets into the car which is laden with 
suitcases starts it up and drives 

 straight into the huge crate he has built  a rope tied to the 
back bumper pulls the lid closed behind him
