        fade in

        ext winter river connecticut  day

        a crisp and perfect new england town  almost too neat
        to be real  no visible townspeople  camera explores
        town


        camera flies

        over a rickety bridge  past the maitland hardware and
        appliance store  past the church  the historical
        society  up over the graveyard on the hill and
        finally 

        to the maitland house  the perfect victorian house
        surveying the tiny village  suddenly 


        a giant daddy longlegs spider

        mounts the crest of the hill beside the house pauses to
        wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of
        the maitland house

                                adam os
                  well well youre a big fella

        a hand  as big as gods  with a huge tweezer
        gently reaches down out of the sky and lies palm up
        in the yard next to the house  daddy longlegs climbs
        into it  the hand rises into the sky again


        int attic  new angle  day

        reveals winter river as a miniature town while the
        daddy longlegs and the hand are normal size  above the
        model are a homely representation of moon sun and
        stars  a whole tiny mechanical universe to track
        the hours of the day  a large plat map of the city is
        prominent on the wall

        the hand is adam maitlands  in his late 30s hes a
        solid easygoing citizen  capra used to make movies
        about him

        adams model town sprawls across most of the attic
        space  windows on either end of the attic shed good
        light into the warm room  adam very carefully lifts
        the spider out the open window  smiles as he drips him
        lightly on the breeze


        camera tilts up from the window

        to see the real winter river laid out exactly as the
        model at the foot of the hill  adam breathes deeply
        and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him


        on his huge hand again

        as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into
        the tiny window of maitlands hardware store on main
        street  it reads

                    adam and barbara maitland
                               are
                           on vacation
                              hooray

        adam leans down and eyes the sign

                                barbara
                         behind him
                  im ready

        adam turns to see entering  barbara maitland 35  a
        wholesome beauty who is mellowing well  she smiles at
        him  perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her
        because they dont have children

                                adam
                         happy to see her

                                barbara

                  it looks great

                                adam
                         nodding
                  thanks

        she pushes a wrapped present across the table

                                barbara

        adam smiles and gives her a present hes hidden under

                                adam
                  enough to do the guest room

                                barbara
                  its a beauty

                                adam
                  yeah it turned out okay  we
                  applied for a historical plaque
                  for it  thatll be the third one
                  on main street

                                barbara
                         jokingly
                  with all these historical
                  landmarks in town where are they
                  going to put the condominiums

                                adam
                         grinning
                  slow down there honey i dont
                  want the vibration to weaken the
                  model

                                barbara
                         nervous
                  oh im sorry

        barbara starts to apply the brakes

        just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road
        stops to pee  barbara swerves  as the car hits the
        rickety bridge the speed is just a bit too much

        boards rattle and loosen the car skews and catches in
        an open slot careens to the right then the left and
        the bridge


        int car  day

        a piling has smashed through the window on the pas
        senger side crushing the upper part of barbaras
        arm  she is wailing in pain and fright

        adam tries to help barbara  he tries to get out of the
        car  none of this succeeds


        ext bridge and river  day

        the dog finishes looks over at the car walks across
        the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
        car aloft

        the car rocks back and forth for a moment and then
        slides forward toward the water


        ext car and bridge

        the car plunges into the rushing water  it floats
        for a moment and then sinks like a stone

                                                   fade to black


        fade in

        int barbara and adams living room  day

        quiet still expectant  there is a fire laid in the
        hearth  suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
        and burns with a furious cheerfulness

        barbara and adam enter dazed wet and bedraggled

                                barbara
                  something like thisalwayshappens
                  when we try to go on vacationalways

        adam leads her toward the fire

                                adam
                  youll feel better when youre
                  dry

        he holds out his hands to be warmed  barbara comes up
        beside him  all this time shes been holding her
        injured arm with the other hand

                                barbara
                  this fire wasnt burning when we
                  left the house

                                adam
                  hows your arm

                                barbara
                  im not sure  it feels frozen

        she holds her arms out to warm them  one hand catches
        on fire


        barbaras left arm

        they stare at it dumbfoundedly before adam regains his
        senses and snatches it out of the fire  two of the
        fingers are burning like candles and barbara indus
        triously blows them out

                                barbara
                  oh adam

                                                   cut to


        int living room  a few minutes later  day

        they are sitting on the couch together  barbara is
        looking away slightly  as one does when a doctor is
        drawing blood  while adam looks at her fingers  he
        frowns

        he looks at his skin  it is pale  he looks at
        barbara

                                adam
                  youd better sit down hon

                                barbara
                  i am sitting

                                adam
                  ill tell you what barbara  i
                  dont think we survived that
                  crash

                                barbara
                         pause
                  oh adam  were home  in our own
                  house  nonsense  ill make some
                  coffee  you get some more
                  firewood

        adam gets up a little absently she follows him as he
        wanders to the front door  he peers out

                                adam
                  lets take things extra slow  do
                  you remember how we got back up
                  here

        barbara tests her hand clenches and unclenches her
        fist

                                barbara
                  im fine  my arm works fine

        adam exploring opens the door steps out on the front
        porch


        ext front porch  twilight

        adams face is painted with color of sunset  he stands
        atop the steps leading down to the front yard  barbara
        stands just inside the open threshold looking out
        worriedly

                                barbara
                         quiet sarcasm
                  the end of a perfect day

        adam starts to step down to the yard

                                adam
                  honey im gonna go down to the
                  bridge and retrace our steps

        he steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
        disappears

                                barbara
                  adam


        ext the great void

        adam is nowhere  theres no ground no sky nothing to
        stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance
        just vast nothing  not white and not colored either
        noise of a clock ticking

        adam looks about surprised doesnt like what he
        doesnt see  he turns around to head back up the
        steps  there are no steps

                                adam
                  barbara

        his voice echoes strangely  he runs off a little in
        the distance and calls again from over there

                                adam
                         continuing quietly
                  where are you

        he goes even farther away


        in the foreground

        an enormous geared wheel  the size of a man  rolls
        by tearing up the unseamed ground  something pours up
        out of the tear  ooze or stuffing

        adam runs forward and stares after the wheel which is
        now out of sight


        two smaller gears

        looking very much like components of a giant watch 
        spin along behind him  one of them veers suddenly
        toward him and though adam jumps out of the way the
        gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it  loud
        ticking


        a perfectly enormous gear

        comes barreling toward him  adam leaps out of its
        way  the gear turns fishtailing kicking up ooze and
        stuffing

        adam flings himself suddenly to the right but trips
        into the path of the gear  as hes about to be
        crushed hes suddenly jerked up to safety


        ext front porch  night

        its barbara whos grabbed him and quite evidently
        saved his life  not life perhaps  but existence
        hes shaken breathless

        barbara stares at him as if wondering what hes just
        been through

                                adam
                         weakly
                  you saved my  uh  life or
                  whatever

                                barbara
                  two hours

                                adam
                  what

                                barbara
                  thats how long you were gone

                                adam
                         pondering that
                   hmmm


        int living room  night

        barbara leads adam into the house

                                adam
                  anything happen while i was away

                                barbara
                  yes it did  yes it did  i made
                  a couple of small discoveries


        barbara

        stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle  on the
        mantle is barbaras prize collection of porcelain
        horses  adam comes to stand beside her  they look
        into the mirror and there is no reflection of them

        barbara picks up one of the horses and trots it through
        the air  the horseisimaged in the mirror

                                barbara
                         continuing
                  theres that and theres this

        she picks up an ancient leatherbound book  its
        yellow and worn about the size of the boy scout
        manual

        closeup  its title is handbook for the recently
        deceased

                                adam
                         reading
                  handbook for the recently
                  diseased

                                barbara
                  deceased  i dont know where it
                  came from  look at the publisher

                                adam
                         he does and reads
                  handbook for the recently deceased
                  press

                                barbara
                         finally admit
                          ting it
                  i dont think we survived the
                  crash


        int bedroom  night

        adam is already in bed reading from the handbook
        barbara is getting ready for bed  going through a
        ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of
        their married lives

                                barbara
                  i dont like situations like this
                  i hate it when im not in control
                  so just tell me the basics

                                adam
                  this book isnt arranged that
                  way  what do you want to know

                                barbara
                  there are a thousand things why
                  did you disappear when you walked
                  off the front porch  is this a
                  punishment  are we halfway to
                  heaven or are we halfway to hell
                  and how long is this going tolast

                                adam
                  i dont see anything about
                  rewards and punishments or
                  heaven and hell
                         frustrated
                  this book reads like stereo
                  instructions  listen to this
                  geographical and temporal
                  perimeters functional
                  perimeters vary from manifestation
                  to manifestation  this is going
                  to take some time


        barbara

        paces she trips on her wallpaper rolls  kicks them

                                barbara

                                adam
                         thoughtfully
                  maybe we should set up a normal
                  routine

        she looks at him like hes nuts

                                adam
                         continuing
                  i mean lets try to nail down
                  something in our lives  a regular
                  schedule  we can keep track of
                  time and go on with our projects
                  up here in the attic

        she shakes her head exasperated  flops down on the
        bed

                                barbara
                  oh god maybe this is all just a
                  bad dream

        on adam  tight  a somber look comes across his face

                                adam
                  im afraid not honey

        barbara looks up at him questioningly

                  why  whats wrong  adam

        she stands and joins him at the window


        their pov through the window

        in the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
        threading its way toward the nearby cemetery  head

        on barbara and adam

        she drops her head sadly on his shoulder  he leans his
        face slightly into hers

                                                   fade out

                                barbara
                         looking at the
                          dusty walls
                  in heaven there wouldnt be dust
                  on the wallpaper

        ext maitland house  day

        unhearing jane heads for car  sound of wind up
        blows her dress  little jane straggles along with her
        like an apprentice


        int attic  day

        barbara watches adam and shakes her head  he stops

                                barbara
                  she cant see you right

        adam nods

                                barbara
                         continuing
                  in the book rule number two  the
                  living usually wont see the dead

                                adam
                  wont  or cant

                                barbara
                  just says wont  wait a minute
                  here it says the living are
                  arrogant they think theyll
                  never die so they refuse to see
                  the dead

                                adam
                  arrogant  thats jane all right

        barbara sighs and nods

                                barbara
                  at least we wont have to worry
                  about her

        adam smiles and goes to his model


        ext maitland house  day

        jane drives away  camera hinges to see a for sale
        sign  across it  another smaller banner  it reads
        sold

                                                   cut to


        int master bedroom  morning

        the maitlands are asleep  camera explores the room a
        bit  it is getting slightly tatty  adam rolls over
        pulling the covers off barbara  we see

        on barbara  she is hovering off the side of the bed

        an ominous rumble  like a 40 earthquake shakes
        the house  glass rattles the ceramic horses on the
        mantelpiece jump around  barbara falls to the floor
        they look at one another with horror  they leap up and
        run downstairs


        int  living room  day

        the rumble builds to a climax there is a loud metallic
        squeal and then a crash just as barbara and adam
        arrive


        the front door

        smashes open revealing a moving van ramp


        a tenfoot electricblue italian leather couch

        slides smoothly down the ramp  on the couch sits delia
        deetz

        the couch crashes into the base of the staircase
        smashing the newel post and several of the balusters
        barbara cringes  one of the balusters falls at delias
        side  she grasps it like a scepter

        two moving men rush down the ramp

                                moving man 1
                  sorry about that mrs deetz

                                delia
                  dont worry  it was going anyway

        delia is relentlessly new york relentlessly fashion
        able relentlessly thin  totally self assured

        she is also a woman with a mission  to gut barbara
        and adams house and remake it in her own very upscale
        image

        delias gaze is on the living room but she looks 
        through adam and barbara as if they werent even there
        which to her eyes theyre not

        still holding the baluster delia gets up off the couch
        and moves into the living room surveying it with an
        odd mixture of ambition and resolution


        behind her

        the two moving men bring in a matching blue leather
        armchair  in the armchair sits lydia deetz

        lydia age 14 is a pretty girl but wan pale and
        overlydramatic dressed as she is in her favorite
        color black  shes a combination of a little death
        rocker and an 80s version of edward goreys little
        girls

        she has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
         and is already taking photographs of the moving
        men  lydia is cool lydia is sullen lydia is her
        fathers daughter by his first marriage  lydia is
        usually about halfpissed off  but underneath we
        like her a lot

        the moving men still hold up the chair waiting for
        delia to decide where she wants it

                                delia
                         continuing
                  jesus  who lived here  the
                  waltons

        tight on lydia  calmly surveys the house

        delia signals wearily that the moving men can put the
        chair down anywhere

                                delia
                         continuing
                  get all this other crap out of
                  here

        lydia hops down out of the chair and comes farther
        into the living room

                                delia
                         continuing
                  where is your father probably
                  in the kitchen

        thats the cue for charles deetz who comes in through
        the swinging door and across the dining room a ner
        vous but basically pleasant man charles deetz is
        intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same
        vengeance that earned him millions in real estate

                                charles
                  thenoisein that kitchen  noisy
                  refrigerator noisy faucets
                  well have to replace it all  i
                  want no humming in the house


        lydia

        exploring on her own gazes around the living room with
        growing pleasure she backs up for a good angle to
        photograph

        camera hinges  she is standing with her back right up
        to barbara  who is horrified at this creature

        charles enters

                                charles
                         to lydia
                  what do you think honey

                                lydia
                  delia hates it

        lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs

                                lydia
                         continuing
                  i could live here

        a movement makes lydia turn around andscream  it is
        delia  not barbara

                                delia
                  settle down lydia  i wonderwherewe are going to get
                  counseling for you out here

        a violent falsetto scream turns the deetz familys
        attention to the front windows

                                otho oshelp  oh help


        othos massive body

        wedged in the window frame  the short stubby legs
        dressed in the worlds largest pair of georgia armani
        slacks protrude into the living room waving fran
        tically  expensive italian loafers are kicked off the
        feet revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks
        by their feet shall ye know them

                                delia
                  its otho

                                charles
                  otho why didnt you just come in
                  the door

        othos voice comes as if from a great distance

                                otho os
                  its bad luck  and i believe
                  hugely in luck

                                delia
                  hold your breath and well pull

        delia turns to charles and lydia for help  doesnt
        get it  and at last pulls otho into the living room
        singlehandedly

        all this while the moving men are variously carting out
        the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous
        new furniture

        otho is robert morley at his most obscenely fat and
        faggoty  but hes not all fat and fun  this customer
        carries nasty emotional weight as well


        otho

        holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled
        through the window  and when he is at last all the way
        through and upright on his feet he suddenly gives a
        tremendous yank  the whole drapery apparatus
        including valences crashes to the floor

                                otho
                  that was the single most
                  unattractive window treatment i
                  have ever seen in the entire of my
                  existence

                                delia
                         starry eyed
                  imsoglad you could leave the
                  city to consult me otho

        otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
        horror

                                otho
                  yes of course you are  well
                  otho had an intuition  call it a
                  hunch  that it was going to be a
                  fabled monstrosity of a house
                  and it certainly is  charles
                  youre lucky the yuppies are
                  buying condos so you can afford
                  what im going to have to do to
                  this place  we are talkingfromthe ground upsville

                                charles
                  thats fine otho  just keep me
                  out of it  i am here to relax and
                  clip coupons  and goddamnit i
                  mean to do it

        he exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house
        during this speech otho has been surreptitiously pos
        ing for lydias camera  she clicks the shutter

                                otho
                         ignoring her
                  is the rest of the house as bad as
                  this

                                delia
                  the rest of the house is probably
                  worse  when can you and i get
                  started

                                otho
                  no time like the present as my
                  wicked stepmother used to say

        out of the pockets of his size 56 georgia armani
        jacket otho takes two cans of spray paint  the kind
        the graffiti artists use  and shakes them as if they
        were castanets  they certainly sound like it

                                otho
                  delia lets get this show on the
                  road


        int upstairs hallway

        at one end near the stairs leading up to the attic
        barbara and adam are slumped against opposite walls

                                barbara
                  adam wearein hell  i hate

                                barbara
                         continuingghosts

        barbara is shocked at the reality

        otho and delia come up the stairs at the end of the
        hallway

                                otho
                  were dealing with negative
                  entertainment potential here  i

                  walking flowthrough

        otho looks down the hallway  its empty  adam and
        barbara are no longer there

        delia turns and spraypaints on the wall  in luminous
        orange  the word mauve

                                delia
                  okay

                  who can read my mind  i dont
                  think people realize how strong a
                  connection there is between
                  interior design and the
                  supernatural

                                delia

        delia opens the door and they step inside another room

        wallpapered it before the accident  her tools are still
        there

        delia smiles  behind delia and otho the rooms closet
        door swings slowly open with and ominous creak


        delia and otho

        turn that way with a suggestion of dread  inside the
        closet barbaras corpse is suspended from the ceiling
        by a belt  the corpse twists with a creak and barbara
        grins ghostly  and slowly tears off her face leaving
        nothing but muscle and bone beneath  her eyeballs
        dangle on her cheeks

        delia and otho stare aghast

                                deliaoh my god

        there is one slight difference however because on the
        rag rug in the middle of the floor lies adams headless
        corpse  standing over him holding in one hand a long
        knife and in the other adams bloodandgore dripping

                  the woman who lived here had the
                  aesthetic instincts of betty
                  crocker

                                barbara

                  traffic patterns and  perhaps

                  lets see  we could turn that

        they head up the stars to the attic


        int study  same time

        adams head has a look of terror on it

                                adams head
                  oh god  i forgot to lock the
                  attic door

        adams headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
        out of the room


        int staircase to attic  same time

        otho and delia climbing  the headless corpse careens
        past them around the bend in the stairs and out of
        sight

                                otho
                  did you feel something

        delia shakes her head

                                otho
                         continuing
                  i felt a cool wind

        the expression on othos face suggests he knows more
        than hes telling


        int landing outside attic door  same time

        the headless corpse rushes through the open door into
        the attic


        int attic  same time

        the headless corpseslamsthe door shut turns the key
        in the lock  then he slumps against the locked door in
        an exaggerated stance of relief


        int attic landing  same time

        delia tries the knob  the door is locked

        int study  same time

        barbara still holding adams head

        charles still calmly leafing through the audubons

                                adams head
                  whew  that was close

                                barbara
                  i cannot witness this

        barbara distractedly puts adams head on a bookshelf
        his headless body fumbles with the books and finally
        reattaches the head


        int study  day

        adam turns away from the window

        barbara fuming moves around charles making wild
        gestures

                                barbara
                  whats the good of being a ghost
                  if you cant frighten people to
                  death

                                adam
                  oh honey

                                barbara
                  no im not putting up with this

        she storms out of the room


        int kitchen  moments later

        barbara storms in as if straight from the room up
        stairs  she heads straight for the back door  just as
        she opens the door adam rushes up

                                adam
                  barbara honey  dont go out
                  there  you dont know 

                                barbara
                  nothing can be worse than this

        she flings open the door and steps outside  she
        promptly disappears

                                adam
                  barbara


        ext surface of saturns moon titan  day

        barbara plunges into the dusty surface of titan with an
        enormous saturn looming in the sky  she looks around
        with wonder and some fear


        a sulfur volcano

        erupts in the distance  a meteor crashes with a lurid
        explosion  as from a great distance she hears adams
        voice  like thunder

                                adam
                  barbara

        she turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers
        the surface of this distant moon


        barbaras pov

        adam is trudging towards her  behind him hovering
        isolated in the air is the kitchen door


        back to scene

        adam at last catches up with her  surveys around them

                                barbara
                  oh adamfindsomebody  im
                  getting all yellowdosomething


        behind them

        something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the
        sand  the something could be right out of dune


        barbara and adam

        stare for a moment then adam grabs her and pulls her
        toward the kitchen door  but the kitchen door has
        moved so they veer in the new direction

        the something follows them andrises out of the sand


        on something

        it is a very big very nasty and very hungry snapping
        sandworm  it roars and lunges at them


        barbara

        slightly angered at it instinctively bats at it


        the sandworm

        is momentarily stunned at barbaras audacity  it
        freezes and shakes its loathesome head


        barbara

        bats at it again  adam is wideeyed tries to pull her
        away  the sandworm recovers and roars after them


        adam

        grabs barbara and tries to escape but they slip and
        sink in the sand

        they make it to the door just in time swing it open
        and hurl themselves through  the door shuts with a
        bang just in front of the roaring sandworm

        the sandworm

        rears and roars in frustration howling to the ringed
        planet


        int kitchen

        barbara weeping throws herself in adams arms

                                barbara
                  oh adam dont ever leave me
                  alone

                                adamyouleft me

                                barbara
                  i know  im sorry

        she hugs him tight

                                barbara
                         continuing
                  i just realized that i could have
                  been killed alone  dont ever
                  leave me honey

        both contemplate that horror

                                barbara
                         continuing
                  were trapped in this house
                  forever with those people

                                adam
                  you cant say that for sure  it
                  could be a transitional thing
                  like a postlife crisis  we just
                  have to be tougher with them
                  come on  have some brandy
                  spirits

                                barbara
                         a tentative smile
                  death didnt improve your sense of
                  humor

        they head for the dining room


        int dining room

        in the door and stumble upon the deetzes at their

        lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and
        anger


        outside the door  on the stairs

         listening sit barbara and adam  a tear rolls down
        her face


        int attic  day

        adam and barbara are lying down on the floor peering
        out of one of the small windows overlooking the front
        yard of the house  the handbook open in front of them

        the entire front yard is alive with workmen and their
        vehicles  plumbers electricians cable tv men etc

        in the deetz modern expensive and ugly furniture
        they collide with goodwill men coming out with the
        maitlands lovely antiques and personal possessions

        int kitchen

        charles away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping
        a mug of herb tea  his solitude is interrupted by a
        2500 lb vulcan range breaking through a toosmall
        kitchen window

                                charles
                         shouting through
                          the window
                  what the hell are you trying to do
                  out there


        delia  outside

        is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks
        periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling
        under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures


        lydia

        snaps photos of the mayhem  she stops to scan the whole
        house


        lydias pov

        when her gaze reaches to top of the house she suddenly
        glimpses barbara and adams faces in the window


        back to scene

        lydia blinks hard  her mouth drops open  she looks
        all around  as if shed just seen a ghost or two


        jane butterfields car

        pulls up  little jane sits in the front seat burdened
        with an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies

        lydia catches sight of jane and runs over

        lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti
        tiously  she follows delias shrieking


        ext house  day

        lydia rounds the corner to see delia pinned flat
        against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp
        tures  two movers are struggling to free her  lydia
        snaps a quick photograph

        they finally free delia  she clutches at her head
        just short of tearing her hair out

                  thats all we need


        int upstairs hallway  day

        lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing  shes
        a little scared  she decides to go up the dark stairs

        in the hall

        at the end of the hall stands charles directing men
        who are carrying books into the room that will be his
        study

        he continues on


        a blast of steam

        fills the hallway because workmen are already going at
        the wallpaper  lydia emerges from it  looking up at
        stairway to attic mounting courage


        int staircase to attic  day

        lydia creeps upward taking the skeleton key from her
        pocket  floorboards squeak


        int attic  day

        adam works on his model  he hears the squeak looks up
        confidently

                                adam
                         whispering
                  dont worry  ive locked it

        barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair


        int attic landing

        lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic
        door  she turns it  the key is stiff  she turns
        harder  its stuck  lydia tries the door  its no
        go  she turns the key again  this time it goes all
        the way around


        int attic  day

        barbara and adam surprised by the key look at each
        other carefully very quietly stand up and tiptoe
        toward door


        on the screen of an old tv set

        in the corner of the attic suddenly a ghostly
        image pops on


        on tv  a bizarre smallish fellow

        outfitted in a toobig cowboy hat bad wig and over
        sized sunglasses appears on screensingingvery
        quickly  its a heavily disguised betelgeuse


        behind him

        the camera quickly pans an assortment of tombstones a
        la cal worthington

                                betelgeuse
                         singing

        camera tilts down a flashing tombstone with
        betelgeuse written on it  adam rushes over to shut
        it off  he cant find a plug  he looks around behind
        set no workings inside at all  he peers around to
        the screen  it is blanksuddenly betelgeuse pops
        on again

                                betelgeuse

        he pops off  adam and barbara stare at each other


        int landing  day

        lydia listens  did she hear something  she puts her
        hand on the knob and tries to turn it  its stuck

        then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on
        the floor

        charles head suddenly appears behind her  scares her

                                charles
                  what are you doing


        int attic

        adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door  with
        her knitting needle barbara has poked the key out

        the two stand absolutely still listening terrified of
        the living intruders


        int attic landing  lydia and charles

                  but it doesnt work

        she hands her father the key  he looks at it and
        throws it in the corner

                                charles

                  dad

        he continues

                                charles
                         irritated over

        a blast of steam from below drowns out her words
        charles stops and turns around  the blast stops

                                charles
                  what


        tight on lydia

        charles continues  she begins to follow slowly


        on key

        behind lydia  widen as adam rushes out the door grabs
        the key and rushes back in again  lydia hears some
        thing but doesnt see


        int attic

        barbara and adam have moved away from the door

                                adam
                         looking through
                          the handbook
                  we need some help  i found
                  something this morning  here
                  emergencies
                         reads
                  in case of emergency draw door

                                barbara
                  draw door  i dont know why we
                  keep looking in that stupid book

        adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on
        the exposed brick of the chimney

                                barbara
                         continuing
                  you dont actually think this
                  is going to work

        adam draws a doorknob  then he tries to turn it  the
        door perhaps to his surprise fails to open

                                barbara
                  yet another triumph for adam and
                  barbara in the afterlife  why
                  dont we try this beetle guy

                                adam
                  wait

        he looks at book then writes on the door  knock and
        enter  he exchanges a glance with barbara  shes even
        more skeptical than before  turns away in disgust

        adam knocks on the door and turns the knob  nothing
        she is more disgusted  adam goes back to the book

                                adam
                         continuingaha  knockthreetimes


        another angle

        he knocks three times  turns knob  the chalked door
        swings magnificently open

        behind is an eerie light source soaring music maybe
        even a heavenly choir singing pearshaped syllables

        barbara and adam look at one another again  they hold
        hands and step tentatively through

        their figures are lost in the blinding light

        they start to shut door after them


        on the attic landing

        lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the
        attic door  it suddenly goes out

        on lydia

        she is dumbfounded  she listens


        on the landing

        int charles study  day

        charles fiercely intent on relaxing paces like a
        catfish out of water  ralph lauren in kmart  he
        stretches  he sits uneasily in an easy chair tries
        like hell to get comfortable  finally he puts a book
        under his bottom to get sitting straight  looks around
        tapping his fingers  what to do  looks at watch

        he takes down a book from adams library it is an
        audubon book of birds  he whips through it like its
        the comics and then looks around for more

        he finds the illustrated walden by thoreau  he
        speed reads it

        he is now really bored  goes to the fireplace tries
        to light it  cannot do it  goes to desk and writes

                                othoinstall gas fire logs in
                                study

        he studies bird posters  finds beautiful cardinal
        picture

        takes field glasses and looks out window

        on charles

        horrified  wrinkles his nose

        lydia enters  he jumps

                  jesus christ

        lydia is shocked

                                charles
                         continuing
                  darling cant you see im
                  relaxing in here

                  wont let me relax  go help your
                  mother

        charles returns to field glasses spies something  she
        looks at him in frustration

                                lydia
                         on her way out
                  fine  maybe you can relax in a
                  haunted house  but i cant

        she exits  charles peers after her brow furrowed
        looks out again at the village  uses his field glasses
        to get a better look


        his pov

        it is the bozman building  ernie is out front pol
        ishing the brass lion


        on charles

        he thinks  moves the field glasses to punctuate his
        discovery of the building  his eyes never leave field
        glasses throughout the following

                                charles
                  nice building bad paint  good
                  lines bad roof  good
                  parking hmmm

        that really registers with him  without looking he
        dials a familiar number on the phone with one hand
        lifts the receiver  he clacks his teeth together pur
        posefully

                  called

        he hangs up and continues to spy on bozman building
        clacks his teeth

                                charles
                         continuing

                                                   dissolve to


        tight shot  barbara and adam

        very still they look cautiously to the right and left
         just with their eyes  theyre astounded by what
        they see though we dont yet see it

                                adam

                  worms

        carnal shreddage

        adam and barbara look around for a moment then very
        quietly they reach out to grasp hands

        lydia kneels down with a screwdriver a nail file an
        ice pick and a credit card  she inserts nail file
        into the door  she struggles and after several
        attempts  finally uses the ice pick and pop  the
        door swings open ominously


        int attic  day

        lydia enters  the room is dim and filled with dust
        motes  there are shadows in all the corners

        she bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and
        moon and that eerily illuminates the model town  shes
        frightened then entranced

        she peers at it from different angles her fear for
        gotten  she notes small tools scattered around an
        unfinished area  she continues around the model
        oblivious to everything else  then

        she kicks something  ducks under the table and comes
        up with something holds it up to the light  its the
        handbook  she looks through it  finds the marked
        page looks at the chalk door


        int office  day

        barbara and adam are still holding hands as if they
        hadnt moved  like waiting for an irs audit

                                barbara
                         to adam

                  wouldnt have had my little
                  accident

        she holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke
        wriggles them indicating her slashes

                                other corpses
                         all togetheramen

        barbara and adam look at them  corpses resume doing
        what they were doing  a grinding noise os  the
        receptionist looks up

        barbara and adam also look os


        their pov

        a message delivery wire grinds along loudly on a
        pulley  the actual message is held in the hand of the
        messenger a flattened corpse suspended as if on a
        shirt clothesline tire marks on his face and clothing
        a major roadkill  dust and gravel ground into him  he
        smiles wanly at barbara and adam as the receptionist
        takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it

                                receptionist
                  maitland party of two  take your
                  handbook and go to the sixth door

        barbara and adam upset at the loss of their handbook

                                barbara
                  we forgot our handbook

                                                   cut to


        int attic  day

        lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest

                                charles os
                         from distant
                          downstairs
                  lydia delia needs your help

        lydia gives one more look at the book and then goes to
        the door quickly and silently

                                charles os
                  right now delia says


        int office  day

                                receptionist
                         shaking her head
                          in disgust
                  out that way through the typing
                  pool down the corridor sixth
                  door on your left  sixth door
                  two threes
                         shaking her head
                  airhead

        adam and barbara walk through a door


        int typing pool  day

        a vast room of desks arranged in a grid straight
        out of how to succeed in business each desk is
        occupied too but most of the secretaries are merely
        skeletons or mouldering corpses slumped over their
        typewriters

        only one secretary somewhere in the vast grid is
        typing slowly with long pauses between words

        the messenger on his return trip parallels barbara and
        adam as they walk along  barbara cant look at him

                                messenger
                  how do i look  therere no
                  mirrors on this side

                                adam
                         trying to be
                          pleasant
                  fine you look fine

                                messenger
                  thanks  ive been feeling a
                  little flat


        another angle

        he laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the
        very very narrow slot in the wall where the line
        runs  adam and barbara look to the right and left
        a vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out
        onto the floor


        int corridor  day

        barbara and adam enter corridor

        empty like a hotel corridor but all the doors are of
        different types  a revolving door a dutch door
        church doors  they walk past a waisthigh window
        covered by a rollup shade

                                barbara
                  a hundred twentyfive years
                  i cant believe it  i cant
                  believe they didnttellus

        she bumps into the shade and it rolls up flapping  she
        stares in through the window  adam peers in it too


        their pov

        a smouldering mistfilled room  from the smoky plasma
        floats an occasional tortured soul  unspeakably sad
        music wafts from within  they get only a glimpse of
        the bodies in this horrible human soup

                                barbara
                  adam look at this

        suddenly floating up from below immediately on the
        other side of the window a whitecrepe face emerges
        it seems to be that of a woman her eyes are red and
        blue tears rim them  her pale skin is covered with a
        flaking crust of salt  she wears the saddest look
        ever  her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes

                                barbara
                         continuing
                  oh adam what is this

        a reflection joins them on their side of the window


        a sinister little janitor

        wizened and efficient pulls the shade down firmly

                                sinister man
                  thats the lost souls room
                  a room for ghosts who have been
                  exorcised  poor devils  thats
                  death for the dead  its all in
                  the handbook  keep moving

        the man scuttles off  adam and barbara walk on sadly
        until they come to a door that looks exactly like the
        swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of
        their house

                                adam
                  this is it the sixth door

        puzzled  barbara pushes it


        int dining room  night

        everything is dark quiet  but the furniture is
        obviously not theirs and neither is the decoration
        adam and barbara exchange glances and push on through
        into the living room


        int living room  night

        quiet dark  everyones asleep

                                adam
                  my god were back home

                                barbara
                  look at this everything is
                  different down here  all our
                  furniture is gone

                                adam
                  how long do you suppose we were
                  waiting

                                juno
                  three months


        another angle

        a spot comes on revealing juno  their caseworker
        shes an older woman no nonsense about her  over
        dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with
        ruffled cuffs  we will at some point catch a glimpse
        of her slashed throat  she smokes heavily  occa
        sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat

                                juno
                  id nearly given up on you  i was
                  about to leave  i do have other

                  deserved and available

                  we need help  we deserve help

                                adam

                                barbara
                  we probably wouldnt mind sharing
                  the house with people who were 

                                juno
                   like you used to be

                                barbara

        he indicates a particularly bad piece of delias sculp
        ture  juno walks around it shaking her head


        int house

        the following conversation takes place as barbara and
        adam follow juno as she looks around the house and ends
        up in their attic space

                                juno
                  things seem pretty quiet here

                                juno

                  news  it obviously doesnt do
                  any good to pull your heads off in
                  front of people if they cant see
                  you

                  time  and of course practice

        int attic  night

                  what do you mean  whats he do

        a grave look comes over junos face as the light
        changes to suggest someone telling a ghost story around
        a campfire

                                juno
                  i wasnt going to bring it up 
                  but rather than have you stumble
                  into it and makeanothermistake
                  ill tell you 
                         she nervously puffs
                          her cigarette
                  he was my assistant but he was a
                  troublemaker
                  he went out on his own as a free
                  lance bioexorcist  claims to
                  get rid of the living got into
                  more trouble  you remember the
                  chicago fire

        adam and barbara look at each other  juno continues

                                juno
                         continuing
                  he was demoted to a grade6
                  malevolent spirit  hes been
                  imprisoned on that plane ever
                  since in fact i believe hes
                  been sleezing around your cemetery
                  lately  he can only be brought
                  back by saying his name three
                  times

        adam and barbara attempt to interrupt 

                                juno
                         continuingbuti strongly suggest that you
                  remove the deetzsyourself

        she takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke
        billows out the hole in her throat  juno starts to
        fade

                                adam
                  and if we needyouagain how do
                  we

        juno fades  gone  barbara goes to the model looks
        at the cemetery

                                barbara
                  that guy is in our cemetery  oh
                  adam

                                adam
                         holds her shoul
                          ders calms her
                  look shes right  well just
                  start simple honey be tougher
                  i feel confident  cmon

        they exit


        camera follows action  over the model

        the fly buzzes  it lands and crawls along into the model of
        the cemetery


        the fly

        resplendently green and iridescent pauses and fiddles
        with its hairy parts  starts to walk by

                                voice
                  pssstt  over here

        fly stops  tilts its multieyed head


        another angle

        two hands come up from the earth of that grave holding
        a candy bar

                                voice
                  i cant use this  you should have
                  it  flies get so little respect
                  anymore


        the flattered fly

        walks over to the grave  in a flash the hands grab
        the struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the
        grave and then pull it into the earth

                                flybuzzz
                         turns intohelp mehelp me

        a maniacal laugh grows from the grave  wind blows as
        the fly disappears  ivy whips away from the grave
        stone  we see for the first time the chiseled name

                                betelgeuse

        clap of thunder

                                adam
                  unless you think it would scare

        lydia starts to exit

                                adam
                         continuing

                  desperate horrible ghoulish
                  creatures who will stop at nothing

                  dream  can you do any tricks to

        barbara shakes her head a little ashamed

                                lydia
                         continuing

        lydia exits with determination  charles looks up on
        the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of winter
        river just like adams in the attic

                                charles
                         continuing
                  look at the size of these lots

        adam peers at the map puzzled

                                adam
                  what is this guy doing

        barbara follows lydia out  adam thinks intrigued
        exits


        int kitchen  day

        delia is frantically preparing for the evenings dinner
        party  lydia is very much in her way trying to show
        her the photographs  delia isnt looking at them

                                delia

                  friends  do you know how hard it
                  is to get civilized people to set
                  foot in this part of connecticut
                  not a solitary word of this
                  pubescent tripe to anyone

        lydia exits angrily

        camera hinges  barbara is watching horrified at
        delias occupation of her barbaras kitchen  adam
        appears

                                barbara
                  lydias trying but they dont
                  believe her

                  gotta get some help hon


        int attic room  later  day

        adam looks intently through the book

        barbaras eye is caught by something in the model
        cemetery  she moves over and sees a small gravestone
        lit up by neon

                                barbara
                  adam

        adam comes over  looks

                                adam
                  i didnt do that one hmmm

                  betelgeuse

        she looks at adam should i adam chews his lip
        thoughtfully

                                adam
                  go ahead third times a charm

                                barbara
                         after a deep breathbetelgeuse

        zap  they are transported into the model graveyard


        ext inside the model graveyard  night

        wind blows   with shovels and lanterns adam and
        barbara are unlikely gravediggers  the mechanized
        clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon
        throwing weird shadows everywhere  ground fog creeps
        slowly along the graves  it is so eerie

                                barbara
                  what happened

                                adam
                  three times  powerful number

                                barbara
                         standing in front
                          of grave
                  bet el geuse  what an
                  awful name  i thought it was like
                   you know  thejuiceofbeetles

        adam cringes too

                                barbara
                         continuing
                  where is he  what do we do

        adam looks down at the grave  knocks on the stone
        nothing

                                adam
                  has anything been simple so far
                  from the look of the shovel we
                  dig

                                barbara
                  oh adam  i dont have gloves
                  my nails keep getting longer
                  ill break them

        hands her a shovel anyway  she digs


        ext inside the model graveyard  later  night

        theyre almost down six feet  by now they are both
        almost out of sight in the grave  inside the grave 
        adam suddenly hits wood

                                barbara
                  its about time

        they lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the
        coffin

                          betelgeuse

                                adam
                  i guess we open it

                                barbara
                  maybe we should knock first

        a slight tremor shakes them  they look at each other
        and try to scramble from the grave


        topside

        they just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse
        springs out of the grave and jumps on barbaras back
        and plants a thousandyearold kiss on her lips  she
        screams and burbles  adam pulls the corpse off her
        back  the corpse does a three stooges hammer on adams
        head

        adam staggers backward unhurt but shocked  all three
        stop


        on the corpse

        something unreal about him almost mechanical  then
        the corpse grinning insanely at them flies straight
        up into the air over their heads  he crashes against
        the tombstone

        and adam and barbara see the corpse is only a huge
        marionette on a string and pole  a laugh comes from
        behind the gravestone


        puppeteer betelgeuse

        steps out  he looks like someone who just crawled out
        from under a rock  this is one slippery customer
        betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot choosing words
        and phrases from every slang in the world  barbara is
        mighty uneasy

                                betelgeuse

                  in 72

                                beryl
                         sick to death of

        ious

        delia senses that lydia might talk ghosts here

                                delia
                         a threat quietly

                                delia
                         interrupting
                  lydia tried to play a most
                  amusing joke on me this afternoon

                                lydia

        charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler  disgust
        spans the room

        on bottle  it bears the familiar spread wings of
        thunderbird

        rush into the kitchen  otho looks at his glass and
        peers at lydia


        int kitchen  night

        delia rushes to get the sushi  charles finds some
        good wine

                                delia
                         rapidly furious
                  lydia switched wines  charles 
                  if you do not agreeright now to
                  boarding school you can forget

                  again in your natural lifetime

        he nods reluctantly  she rushes back to guests


        int dining room  night

        lydia is looking around curiously  delia and charles
        rush back in with sushi and good wine  delia pours for
        bernard the obvious connoisseur  he tastes the wine
        all wait  is it kerosene du pape  he smiles  all
        smile

        otho is more interested in lydias story  he leans
        toward her

                                otho
                  now lydia favor us about your
                  ghosts

                                deliano  do not encourage this
                  little person

                                otho
                  oh delia lighten up

                                delia
                  shes been without therapy up here
                  and i will not allow her to
                  ruin

        but then


        delia

        something comes over her  she straightens then
        crouches a little her hand sweeps across in front of
        her almost mechanically  and then our delia deetz
        unable to help herself leaves the whitebread world
        behind and possessed sings in someone elses voice a
        rich negro tenor

                                delia
                  if i didnt care more than
                  words could say

        lydias eyes widen  music up  all the guests are
        spellbound

        charles too has the beat  the ink spots in his eyes
        in a voice not his own

                                charles
                  if my every prayer did not
                  begin and end withjustyour
                  name

        delia is shocked  she looks at lydia

                                delia
                  for gods sake stop me

        she is cut short by her powerful inspiration

                                delia
                  i could not be true to you
                  beyond compare


        all the guests

        except lydia are possessed to become the chorus  they
        stand by their chairs they spin in perfect motown
        choreography

                                everyone
                         except lydia
                  shoo doo wop  shoo doo wop

                                delia
                  if i didnt care for you

                                everyone
                  shoo doo wop  shoo doo wop

        a look of sheer delight comes across lydias face
        unlike anything we have previously seen  she dances
        and claps her hands in time with the music  she is in
        teen heaven

        note  delia and the guests are fully aware of their
        singingactions but helpless to stop themselves  while
        it is funny it is nevertheless just a little frighten
        ing

        lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can
        see the ghosts  she cant

        now the song pauses everyone tries to recover for a
        shocked second  instead the tempo changes

        as the tempo quickens the guestchorus is syncopated
        like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled
        into their chairs  they sing throughout


        the song

        crashes to its end  bernard looks down at his shrimp
        cocktail  the shrimp draped over the rice roll
        suddenly rears up like a hand and making a tiny fist
        grabs his dangling tie andsmash

        wider  all the guests are punched by the shrimp back
        over their chairs to the ground  they are stunned 
        suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room


        extint attic room  night

        adam and barbara with huge smiles on their faces dance
        the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front
        of the attic  door is open

                                togetherwe did it

                                adam
                  lets watch em scatter

        they enter the attic and run to the window  look out
        over the front yard


        yard of house  their pov  night

        filled with the cars of the guests as well as delia
        and charles vehicles

                                adam os
                  any minute now  theyll all run
                  screaming


        back to scene

        they wait  nothing moving outside

                                barbara

        adam smiles proudly

        barbara glances at adam  they dont know what to do

                                lydia
                         from outside the

        adam puzzled goes to the door and opens it  lydia is
        standing there sheepish

                                lydia
                         continuing

                  pick any sheets you want


        int living room  night

        the guests are sitting expectantly  the photographs
        are being passed around  the wheels are turning in
        charles mind   he sees a gold mine  everyone speaks
        at once

                                delia
                  it does indicate a marvelously
                  urbane sense of humor on the part
                  of these ghosts  that they
                  actually appear insheets

                                otho

                                delia
                         now changing her
                          tune
                  we were waiting for proof
                  lydias photographs

                                bernard
                         skeptical

                  not until i see some real proof

        lydia appears at the base of the stairs  everyone
        stops squabbling looks at her expectantly

                                lydia
                  they dont want to come down

                                otho
                  why not

        bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate
        hoax  he harumphs

                                lydia
                  i think the reason is they were
                  trying to scare you and you
                  didnt get scared

                  those shrimp dropped down my
                  kamali

        bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put
        on

                                bernard
                         shaking his head
                  total collective hallucination

                                lydia
                         reluctantly
                  the attic

                                charles
                  the attic room is locked

        int landing outside of attic

        delia charles otho and lydia  creep creep

                                delia
                         whispering

                  where theyve been hiding out

        lydia nods  delia suddenly brashly pounds on the
        door

                                delia
                         shouting

                  suicide

                                delia

                  what matters is ive got a roomful
                  of guests down there who think

                  so miserable that you will wish
                  you had neverlived

        delia pounds on door which opens with an eerie creak


        int attic  day

        lydia is pushed in first  she looks around  delia
        charles and otho come in next carefully  one by one
        they straighten up and look around

                                delia
                         whisper
                  so where are they lydia

        lydia shrugs looks around

                                charles
                         offhandedly
                  answer your mother

                                lydia
                  listen you guys  these ghosts
                  are really nice people  i think
                  we scared them off  lets just
                  leave them alone  okay

        charles is suddenly transfixed  he stares at the
        model

                                charles
                  its the whole damntown

        they gather around  lydia is a little sad as she looks
        at the empty room and the model

                                otho
                  look at thatdetail

                                delia
                  look at the tiny figures

                                charles
                  look at all thatparking

                                lydia
                  come on  leave their stuff alone

                                otho
                  theyre not here lydia

        she shakes her head  otho spots the handbook  palms
        it

                                delia
                  i haveneverbeen so
                  embarrassed they havent gone
                  for good have they

        delia is suddenly out the door urging them all outside

                                delia
                         continuing
                  everyoneoutof there  if theyre
                  in there somewhere i dont want
                  to scare them away  come on now
                  stay out of there  weve got work
                  to do

        otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits
        delia carefully closes the door


        camera eases over to the window

        we see two pairs of hands whiteknuckled gripping the
        window sill from the outside


        ext house  night

        barbara and adam are hanging outside the window
        camera eases back to see that instead of hanging from
        the house 

        they are hanging from a ledge over the inferno 


        on inferno

        circles of rosy hell  several devilish monsters slaver
        up at them hoping for new meat for the furnace  small
        geysers spurt foul gasses


        winds

        blow hard on adam and barbara  they struggle to hold
        on and pull themselves back up and into the window

                                adam
                  juno help  juno

        after nearly falling adam barely saves barbara and
        they finally make it up and disappear into the window


        int attic landing  night

        delia charles and otho all start down the stairs one
        by one  all are holding the handrail

                                delia
                  lydia i will never forgive you

                                charles
                         fixing on otho

                  research center and amusement
                  park

                                lydia
                         disgusted
                  i cannot believe this

                                charles
                  delia will cook

        delia glares at him

                                charles
                         continuing
                  ill bring the wine and the
                  business plan  and lydia 
                  youll bring the ghosts

                                lydia
                         frustrated
                  i cantbringthe ghosts  theyre
                  not here

                                charles
                   otho could you actually do
                  something with them

                                otho
                         pats the handbook
                          under his coat
                  perhaps if i were properly
                  motivated

                                lydia
                  thats slavery and murder  you
                  dont know them  theyre nice
                  people

        pov  down the handrail as they walk downstairs
        lydia lags behind sullen


        lower end of the handrail

        lifts and turns  the handrail has become a long fat
        diamondbacked snake  unlike any we have ever seen
        it flashes terrifying steel teeth and a redfeathered
        comb  it turns and hisses at them


        on delia

        she screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail
         it grips the scaly throbbing dripping body of the
        snake


        the snake

        just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the
        air up the stairs toward them  its tail circles delia
        and spins her like a top  when she stops  the snake
        gives her a big wet snake kiss


        snake

        snaps otho in the behind  it hurts


        the snake

        rears up and spreads a redcomb and hisses loudly


        all three

        of them fall over each other trying to escape


        the snake

        hovers horribly over them  grabs charles in its coils
        and squeezes him hard  his fearful face reddens then
        it suspends charles over the edge of the stairs

                                snake
                  weve come for your daughter
                  chuck


        he

        leers at lydia and drops charles like a rock over the
        bannister  charles screams


        the snake

        grins at a terrified lydia


        snake

        rears back for a strike when suddenly like thunder
        one word is heard

                                barbarabetelgeuse  betelgeusebetelgeusethe snake

        looks up with familiar eyes  at top of stairs stands
        an angry barbara

        what happens next is almost too fast for the eye to
        see


        the snake

        shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand
        rail


        betelgeuse

        or his outline whips up the stairs through the door
        and is gone like a rocket

                                betelgeuse
                  rrratt shit


        otho and delia

        rush downstairs  lydia is terrified  she runs away

                                lydia

                  friends

                                barbara
                  no wait

        lydia screams and runs down the stairs

                                lydia
                         screams
                  i hate all of you

        slowly barbara returns to the attic


        int attic  night

        adam and barbara are exhausted  agitated

                                adam
                  great choice weve got here  we
                  get to spend the next century
                  either hanging out that window or
                  doing parlor tricks

        adam is working with the model town  barbara is pac
        ing

                                adam
                  maybe theyll leave now  that
                  snake was a pretty nasty customer

                                barbara
                  he might have hurt somebody

                                adam
                  but he didnt  weve got him
                  where we want him


        on the model

        a column of water shoots high in the air

        adam rushes over to the model  looks down


        int model  day

        betelgeuse has run a beatup old pickup into a fire
        hydrant  he stands nearby hopping mad shakes his
        fist at adam

                                betelgeuse

                  finished the job


        in the attic

        barbara and adam obviously disturbed look at one
        another with concern

                                betelgeuse vo
                         thin and pip

                  short little queen


        angle

        angry barbara reaches down into the model and plucks
        betelgeuse up

        barbara lifts him up toward her squeezing him
        slightly

                                barbara
                  you leave her alone you horrid
                  little prick


        closeup  betelgeuse in barbaras hand

        betelgeuse grins  suddenly large spikes shoot out all
        over his body piercing the skin of barbaras palm and
        fingers  barbaras blood is a rich pink

        she squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum
        mets


        ext model  day

        betelgeuse lands on the town common  betelgeuse is

                  go ahead  make my millenium


        angle

        we hear the tinny strains of honky tonk angel as if
        from down the street  he turns around to follow it

                                betelgeuse
                  this burg got a cathouse  im

        he turns the corner to a whorehouse with women 
        women with demon horns  hanging out of the window
        beckoning  betelgeuse rubs his hands together and
        swaggers inside


        int attic  day

        barbara aghast watching this from above

                                barbaraadam  why did you build a whore

        he doesnt finish  a strong wind blows through the
        attic nearly knocking barbara and adam over  they
        close their eyes against the gale

        when they open their eyes again theyre no longer in
        the attic  theyre in

        appears carrying a candle  she is softly crying

        she sits at her dressing table the candlelight shows
        her writing paper  she begins a very dramatic letter

                  i am alone

        she looks at it and crumpling the paper starts again

                  deceitful worlds  by the time you
                  read this i will be gone having
                  jumped off

                  whores until someone calls him
                  you need to worry about people likeotho  there are a lot of
                  phony trance mediums  they
                  usually cant make the formulas
                  work but if otho stumbles on the
                  right words in that handbook he
                  could hurt you  as in exorcism

        they both look puzzled

                                juno
                         continuing

        they look at juno

                                juno
                         continuing

                  trick

        adam

        reluctantly pulls on his face and contorts it into a
        living breathing horror  juno is even a little
        repulsed

                                juno
                  not bad  not bad  now you  go
                  ahead


        angle

        she reluctantly does with her face a minor version of
        adams horror

                                juno
                         continuing
                  okay  you look great  now go
                  clean house  and dont forget the
                  photographs and the damned
                  handbook


        angle

        barbara and adam slowly stand and walk out the door
        barbaramonster looks back pleadingly  football
        players flood into junos office  one particularly
        dumb player has a revelation  hes pretty grisly
        maybe sat too close to the engine

                                particularly dumb player
                  coach  coach i dont think we
                  survived the crash

        barbara and adam look at each other and continue out the
        door


        outside junos office

        they enter a long dark hallway  they suddenly find
        themselves standing in front of lydias room  adam
        monster looks at barbaramonster as he grabs the door
        knob  she stops him  tears fall down her sad ghostly
        face

                                barbara
                  adam  i cant do it  i like that

                  wait  we cant honey  our

        she throws open the door


        int attic  day

        lydia is standing over the model about to say
        betelgeuses name

                                lydia
                  okay  beetle j

        adammonster runs to grab her  lydia is terrified
        screams

                                adammonster

                                betelgeusesay it  rat shit

        betelgeuse slips off the roof into a patch of thorny
        bushes


        int attic  night

        lydia screams adammonster tries to calm her  lydia
        struggles and thinking she is being attacked runs out
        the door  smack into barbaramonster

        barbara catches her frightens lydia even more
        barbara holds onto her as she struggles  barbara
        monster slowly changes back into regular barbara
        lydia sees who it is and she hugs her  like mother and
        daughter

        on adam  slowly returning to himself  he smiles
        slightly at the scene

                                betelgeuse os

                  he beetle jui

        barbara quickly puts her hand over her mouth

                                lydia
                         continuing
                  he said if i let him out he would
                  take me over to the other side to
                  find you

                                barbara
                  no lydia were dead

                                lydia

                                barbara
                         shocked
                  no you dont  no lydia why

                                lydia
                         after a pause
                          dramatically
                          but for real
                  life is just unliveable

        barbara hugs her  she fumbles for words  this is an
        unusual situation a dead person talking a live person
        out of killing herself  she rocks lydia a little
        barbara looks at adam

                                barbara
                  lydia believe me we know

                  now wed have been more
                  careful

                          dead receptionist
                   we wouldnt have had our
                  little accident

        lydia looks at barbara lovingly

                  father and mother can stay too

                                lydia
                         smiles and says
                          slowly
                  step mother


        adammonster

        is not sure huffs around a little  he is trying to
        change back into adam except for his nose which
        remains like a beak for a minute  finally it changes
        too

        lydia and barbara laugh at him


        angle

        without noticing lydia otho and charles push in
        through the door and grab the model  they take it out
        the door

        adam is beside himself  doesnt know what to do

        barbara stops him from taking action

                                adam
                  what is going on

                                lydia

        adam looks suspiciously at her

                                lydia
                         continuing
                  i really dont  ill go find out

        she runs out the door

                                barbara
                  be careful


        int hallway  night

        lydia runs through the hallway and into the dining
        room


        int dining room  night

        lydia walks into a presentation in progress  sitting
        around the table are otho maxie and delia  sarah dean
        is there too  she looks around lydia hoping for
        ghosts  sarah is heavily made up smells bad

        lydias photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and
        standing on a nearby easel  charles over the model
        with a pointer is lost in midsentence

                                charles
                   in short ive got options to

        sarah gets maxies attention and unable to contain her

                                charles
                         smiling apologetically
                  nonsense every time she says
                  that the paint peels and some
                  wild creature tries to kill us

                                sarah
                         motioning

                  come back and all of us could live
                  in peace if you agreed not to
                  tease them or make them do silly
                  tricks

        sarah is disappointed  she goes to maxie  delia takes
        over

                                delia
                  shes become a little emotional
                  about all this  no counseling up
                  here  but we arent relying on
                  her  no we rely on
                  professionals  we have otho

        the whole room turns to otho  who is scribbling some
        thing and mumbling

                                charles
                  are they still here otho

        otho looks up he missed the question

                                delia
                  are they still here otho

                                otho
                  oh theyre still here  theyre
                  just not showing up

                                charles
                  theyre probably guilty about what
                  they did to me

                                delia
                  not these people  they are
                  ruthless

                                maxie
                  i dont care from guilt  i just
                  want toseethem

                                charles

                  its tricky but i think i can
                  handle it

        he dramatically produces the handbook

                                lydiano

        lydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts
        to another point of view

                                lydia
                  wait a minute  what am i worried
                  about  otho you cant even
                  change a tire

                                otho
                         taking the challenge

                                lydia

        delia gets an idea

        int dining room  night

        delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag  lays
        something out on the dining room table

        lydia stands to see  delia carefully lays out
        barbaras white wedding dress  then next to it adams
        wedding tux

        lydia looks at it  a chill runs through her

                                lydia
                         hushed realization

        then a sizzle a tiny crackle along one side of the
        square


        int attic  night

        barbara with her arm on his shoulder talks to adam

                                barbara
                  weve been given a gift here
                  honey  a real live little girl
                  she likes us a lot  she needs
                  us  maybe thats why we died so
                  young to keep us from getting
                  so attached tothings  the
                  house antiques your model  look
                  at us  we didnt have room for
                  anyone

                                adam
                         after a long thought
                  what makes you think she likes me

        barbara slowly smiles  he does too

        he turns to barbara  camera hinges with him to see 


        on barbara

        her face is frightened  she cannot speak  she reaches
        out to him  but is disappearing  he reaches for her
        but she is suddenly  gone


        int dining room  night

        varicolored lightning bolts shoot from every corner of
        the square  a gasp from everyone but lydia


        on lydia  she is looking away  she turns to see


        on the dress

        barbaras wedding dress floats over the table and fills
        slowly painfully with the arms legs and finally the
        frightened face of barbara  a lightning bolt flares

        lydia rises slowly to her feet unable to resist

        more lightning bolts

                                otho
                  as sudden thunder  pierces the night
                  as magic wonder  mad affright
                  rives asunder  mans delight
                  our ghost our corpse and we
                  rise to be

        lydia walks slowly toward barbara


        on barbara

        she is in pain she is very slowly aging  she speaks
        but no words can be heard  not even by lydia  but we
        can see she is calling for adam

                                lydia
                  stop it

                                maxie
                  shhhh

        lydia screams for adam

                                otho
                         louder
                  as flies the lizard  serpent fell
                  as goblin vizard  at the spell
                  of pale wizard  sinks to hell
                  the buried dead and slain
                  rise again


        int attic  night

        in a lightning flare we see adam searching for
        barbara  he rushes out into the hallway

                                adam
                  barbara  barbara  ba

        his last plaintive call becomes mute as he too begins
        slowly to disappear


        int dining room  night

        on each of the watchers one by one scared but
        delighted too  no one is watching lydia

        on lydia  tears well up in her eyes


        on barbara

        she is slowly aging  now a bewildered adam appears
        floating in his wedding suit  seeing his barbara now
        older than he is adam reaches for her hand

        on hands  as he grasps her hand it seems to be made
        of white crepe it wrinkles and nearly collapses

        adam puzzled calls her name silently

                                delia
                  whats happening to them

                                otho

                  theyre already dead  they cant
                  feel a thing

        obviously not true

        on barbara  she looks down slowly at lydia and with
        effort makes a loving smile  she reaches out toward
        lydia

        completely helpless now lydia weeps openly and then
        something comes over her  she rushes across the room
        stares down at the model

                                lydia
                  whereare you  help us  please

                         continuing
                  okay

        lydia looks down  lydia begins to levitate

        she lifts her head and leaves the white bread world
        behind  in a voice as deep and soulful as percy
        sledge

                                lydia
                  when a man loves a woman
                  he cant keep his mind on nothin else

        behind her ghostly images of the football players
        appear as backup

                                footballers
                  oooooo  hummmoooooo

                                lydia
                  hed change the world for the good
                  thing hes found  when amainneeds a woman he caint keep his
                  mind on nothin else  if shes
                  bad he wont see it she can do
                  no wrong

        music continues over


        angle

        a great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the
        middle  an irritated betelgeuse crawls out on the
        roof  hating the singing he shakes his fist at the
        sky  loses his footing and tumbles into the sand
        terrified he scrambles to get out


        on pile

        a moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside
        again  the sandworm snapping right behind him as he
        runs back out on the roof


        angle

        camera tilts up to see house  it is the perfect new
        england house  camera pulls back from the model  out
        the window of the real house

        outside the real house  we see it is dilapidated and
        undeniably the perfect haunted house

                                                   fade out
