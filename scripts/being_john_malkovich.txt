		    many years ago in the late 1800s
		    james mertin an irish ship captain
		    looking to invest in the future of
		    our great country came to this town
		    and decided to erect an office

				 mertin
			    taken aback
		    i see well it is not my fault that
		    thou art tiny so if it is charity
		    yer after then be gone with ye
		    ye foul demon

				 tiny woman
		    i am not asking for alms but rather
		    the ear of a kind man with a noble
		    heart

				 mertin
			    sighs
		    aye speak then if ye must

				 tiny woman
		    captain mertin surely i am a
		    godfearing christian woman like
		    yourself but alas i am afraid that
		    the world was not built with me in
		    mind door knobs are too high chairs
		    are unwieldy highceilinged rooms
		    mock my stature nor am i a marrie
		    lady captain after all who would
		    marry a person of my diminutiveness
		    so i am forced to work for my few
		    pennies a week as an optometrist
		    why cannot there be a place for me
		    to work safe and comfortable

	mertin wipes a tear from his eye

				 mertin
		    woman your story moves me like n
		    other me own sister was tiny and
		    then died therefore i shall make
		    ye me wife and i shall build a
		    floor in my building between the
		    7th and 8th which will be scaled
		    down so from now on there shall
		    be at least one place on gods green

		    believe your husband has somehow
		    psychically diverted the route

				 lotte
		    that bastard ill gladly dispose
		    of him in the name of the order son
		    of malkovich

				 lester
		    im afraid that no physical harm
		    must come to him as long as he
		    inhabits the vessel

				 man 3
			    raises hand
		    oooh i got an idea what if we
		    build another portal to malkovich

		    name of evil instead of good

	people stop in their tracks

		    a friendly competition if you will
		    your malkovich puppet and my harry s
		    truman puppet appear opposite each
		    other in a play not some vegas
		    burlyq pyrotechnics but a real play
		    that requires actual acting the
		    audience decides who is more deserving
		    of the title the losing puppeteer
		    bows out graciously goes back to
		    obscurity as a file clerk

				 malkovich
		    whats the play

				 mantini
		    say equus its got everything

				 malkovich
		    never heard of it

				 mantini
		    broadways finest three hours its
		    about the suppression of the
		    individual conformity as god in
		    modern society

				 malkovich
		    sounds boring are there any songs

				 mantini
		    nothing but acting to hide behind
		    buddyboy

				 malkovich
		    im not afraid i toured for a year
		    with the national puppet companys
		    production of long days journey

	we come on very close to craigs arm as he lifts it to put
	it around lotte we see a thin almost invisible filament
	we follow it up and discover that craig is now a
	marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
	mantini in a gray jumpsuit

				 mantini
			    in craigs voice
		    i cant wait to see where you and your
		    friends live lotte

				 lotte os
		    its beautiful craig like eden

	follow them up to find that flemmer is controlling mantini

	flemmer throws his head back and laughs the camera moves
	into his mouth and down his throat which oddly enough
	looks exactly like the membranous john malkovich portal
	tunnel
