                         the president is a nice person i 
                         enjoyed it very much

                                     courtney
                         good sir and so it seems did the 
                         president  but we would like to 
                         have some facts such as uh what 
                         exactly is the relationship between 
                         yourself and that of the first

                         i think you should ask mr rand that

                                     courtney
                         of course but since he is ill im 
                         taking the liberty of asking you

                              watching three tv

                         should ask mr rand that

               courtney doesnt understand but continues his questioning

                                     courtney

               courtney listens to the dial tone then puts the receiver 
               down

                                     courtney
                              to himself

                         well the president compared the 
                         economy of this country to a garden 
                         and stated that after a period of 
                         decline a time of growth would 
                         naturally follow

                         its trees are healthy and so are its 
                         shrubs and flowers as long as they 
                         are trimmed and watered in the right 
                         seasons the garden needs a lot of 
                         care i do agree with the president 
                         everything will grow strong and 
                         there is plenty of room in it for

                         newspapers

                         well that is probably the most honest 
                         admission to come from a public figure 
                         in years few men in public life 
                         have the courage not to read 
                         newspapers none that this reporter 
                         has met have the guts to admit it

               table as earlier only this time with the editor of the 
               washington post lyman stuart courtney puffs on his pipe as 
               he speaks

                                     courtney
                         its strictly rumor at this stage 
                         lyman  just something in the wind

                                     stuart
                         something rather big in the wind 
                         id say so whose files were 
                         destroyed the cias or the fbis

                                     courtney

                         nosing around see if we can talk to 
                         some people

               the camera begins to slowly move away from their table

                                     stuart
                         what is it about his past they are 
                         trying to cover up
                              his volume fades
                         a criminal record a membership 
                         in a subversive organization 
                         homosexual perhaps

               the sound of stuarts voice dissolves into thomas franklins 
               as the camera settles on dr allenby and franklin sitting at 
               a table nearby

                                     franklin

                         really believe him of course  but

                         considering the gravity of your 
                         economic situation mr gardiner 
                         shouldnt we the diplomats and 
                         you the businessmen  get together 
                         more often to exchange our thoughts 
                         what does a russian know about 
                         business on the other hand what 
                         does an american know about diplomacy 
                         so why not a coming together an

                              laughs
                         bravo bravo our chairs are indeed 
                         almost touching and we want to remain

                         want them snatched from under us am 
                         i right because if one goes the 
                         other goes and then  boom boom

                         before our time you see and neither 
                         of us wants that do you agree

                         possibilities now i have three 
                         questions is the man a foreign agent 
                         or have we suddenly found that our 
                         methods of gathering data are grossly 
                         inefficient or thirdly have the 
                         mans files been destroyed now id 
                         like some answers

                         gardiner is not a forign agent there 
                         are now sixteen countries 
                         investigating the man we can rule 
                         that out

                                     president
                         very well can we rule out 
                         inefficiency

               there is silence in the room a couple of looks but silence

                                     president
                         i see what about question three  
                         is it possible to erase all traces 
                         of a man

                                     honeycutt
                         highly unlikely sir in fact the 
                         boys around the bureau feel that the 
                         only person capable of pulling it 
                         off would be an exfbi man

                                     baldwin
                              a look to honeycutt

                         intelligence think

                                     baldwin
                         well mr president they dont 
                         know quite what to think

               int chances room  night

               chance is propped up in bed watches an old movie on 
               television the hero gives his lady a passionate kiss and 
               embrace

               the scene seems to sink into chances mind suddenly eve 
               robe over her nightgown comes into the room

                                     eve
                         oh chauncey  i just couldnt stand

               she goes to the bed takes chance in her arms starts to 
               kiss him when he abruptly takes eve into his arms and kisses 
               her full on the mouth once done chances attention returns 
               to the television while eve is in a frenzy of passion she 
               holds him kisses him runs her hands over his body

               chance neither resists nor responds he just watches 
               television suddenly eve stops lets her head fall on chances 
               chest

                                     eve

                         you dont feel anything for me 
                         nothing at all

               chance feeling her sadness gently strokes her hair as he 
               looks at tv

                                     eve

                         when i do it when i touch 
                         myself

               eve slowly gets up from the bed nervously paces the bedroom 
               as chance watches tv she makes a decision moves to chance 
               kisses him

                                     eve
                              getting aroused

                         much

               she steps back slips off her robe she does not undress any 
               further instead leans close to chance

                         know about me yet darling  im a 
                         little shy

               she smiles drops to the floor chance divides his attention

               between eve and the tv watching both with an equal 
               detachment eve becomes more and more involved with herself 
               finding immense pleasure with her own body chance changes 
               the channel with the remote control eve reaches orgasm her 
               body shaking violently then a delicate tremor then she is 
               still chance turns off the tv with the remote turns over 
               in bed

                         man until i met you i always had 
                         the feeling that i was just a vessel 
                         for a man something that he could 
                         take hold of pierce and pollute i

               rands funeral services are being held on a hill overlooking 
               the mansion six distinguishedlooking men stand near rands 
               casket which is placed on a concrete block they are the 
               pallbearers the rand mausoleum is fifty yards further up 
               the hill while the mourners all close friends and associates 
               of rands stand fifty yards down the hill from the 
               pallbearers

               chance stands with eve and allenby the president of the 
               united states is before the microphone which feeds 
               loudspeakers for the rand servants lined up in front of the 
               mansion

                                     president
                         i know that ben said keep it small 
                         and quiet no eulogies no 
                         fanfares and i dont want to go 
                         against bens wishes but i thought 
                         it would be good while our close 
                         friends carry ben to his last resting 
                         place to read from his quotes which 
                         im sure will have special meaning 
                         to all of us who are gathered here 
                         today

               with this the pallbearers pick up the casket and begin the 
               chore of taking it to the mausoleum it is hard work

                                     president
                              reading quotes
                         i have no use for those on 
                         welfare no patience whatsoever 
                         but if i am to be honest with myself 
                         i must admit that they have no use 
                         for me either i do not regret 
                         having political differences with 
                         men that i respect i do regret 
                         however that our philosophies kept 
                         us apart i was born into a 
                         position of extreme wealth but i 
                         have spent many sleepless nights 
                         thinking about extreme poverty

               as the president speaks chance turns and walks away eve
