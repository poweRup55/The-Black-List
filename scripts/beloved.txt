     field the field stretches beyond until a line of distant
     woods stops it around the back of the house stands a rundown

     with a single door serves as the only entrance

     camera begins a slow move toward the house as we

     super ohio 1865we hear sounds from inside the house  bumps a chair falling
     overand feet running on wooden floor boards

                                                            cut to

     steps from the second floor they are fully dressed carrying
     a small bag of belongings

                         howard

     bulgar reluctantly lets go of howards hand as the latter
     runs into the kitchen alone he edges towards the front
     door when suddenly

     the door slowly creaks open on its own scared he steps
     away slowly

     int kitchen  dawn

     howard is trying to toss some food into a bag he spots a
     cake sitting on top the wooden table with some pieces
     already eaten he finds a knife and approaches the table

     he is about to cut into the cake when he sees two tiny hand
     prints appear on the cakes surface howard stops cold 
     dropping the knife

     int front entrance  dawn

     howard exits the kitchen and takes bulgars hand

                         howard

               where you goin

     the brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her they love
     their sister but there are stronger forces here

     a mirror on a wall beside howard cracks down the middle

                         howard
               we gotta go

     bulgar looks up to denver they exchange a look of deep
     affection and pained longing he wants to take her

                         howard
               bye denver you take care

                         denver

     his sister he kisses her hard then breaks away denvers
     outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs midair

                         denver
               nobul

     bulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house
     holding howards hand once more

     denver sits alone at the top of the stairs  she sadly looks
     up and weeps as if to the house itself

                         denver
               now what you go and do that for

     ext road to the train  dawn

     the voice of sethe humming a melody carries over the images
     of

     the two boys running for their lives towards the train
     holding hands all the way  howard is the first to reach it
     as it passes by he throws his bag upon it and jumps in
     bulgar races beside it as howard reaches for him

     cu  howards hand reaching for bulgarsthey connect

     wide shot  the boys are on the train as it leaves town

     on its route the train passes a ramshackle graveyard

     camera moves slowly into the graveyard until it reaches a
     headstone made with flecked pink stone upon the headstone
     is only one wordbelovedext 124 bluestone rd  continuous

     camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124 into a
     closeup of a woman looking out of a second floor bedroom
     window it is sethe mother of the two boys and denver she
     hums her melody softly sadly with a resigned understanding
     of why her boys are running awayand a deep pain that is
     too constant to notice

                                                          fade out

     sethes mixed feelings show all over her face although she
     loved halle there is clearly something unresolved in her

                         sethe
               just got a few more things to do then
               ill start supper

     sethe exits

     ext 124 bluestone rd  late day

     denver is playing in the front yard by herself

     sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing a
     gentle breeze carries a leaf into the bucket sethe sees it
     floating atop the water for a moment then picks it up

     cu of sethe as the image triggers a feeling  and the
     feeling a memory  from long ago

     sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in
     the barren field of 124but rather

     memory

     ext sweet home  late day

     a stunning vista of the plantation sweet home  sun beating
     down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as
     the eye can see sethes figure dwarfed by the majestic
     landscape

     sethe looks frightened her breathing grows shallow she
     hears something

     the sound of a wagons wheels  rolling over a road growing
     louder coming towards her

                                                          intercut

     cu of a wagon wheel moving rapidly on a road camera pans
     up to the man driving the wagon  a stern white man wearing a
     distinctive hat

     sethe turns away from the sycamores towards the road to see

     end of memory

     ext 124 bluestone  late day

     a man driving a horse and wagon with two children in the
     back coming up bluestone road he wears no hat

     sethe breathes easily she looks around her the reality of
     124s barren field has returned the memory of sweet homes
     sycamores have vanished

     denver is playing near the road as the wagon nears 124
     denver looks up and smiles the man whips the horse hard so
     as to ride past the house faster the children stare at
     denver and 124 with horror and curiosity

     the stares of the children destroy denvers smile she
     watches them go then turns to hide her upset and sees her
     mother watching her

     sethe looks to denver with empathy and impotence wanting to
     ease her daughters pain and knowing full well she cannot

     hurt and angry denver runs past sethe towards the woods

     ext woods  late day

     denver runs with a purpose knowing exactly where she is
     going

     she reaches five boxwood bushes planted in a ring the tall
     bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground
     forming a round emerald room in the center seven feet high
     with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves

     this is denvers private place she bends low and crawls
     through the leaves into the center once there this lonely
     child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself
     together she lays her face against the cool earth

     int 124 bluestone rd  night

     denver walks to her room in her night dress she passes the
     opened door of her mothers bedroom and peeks in

     int sethes bedroom  night

     sethe kneeling by her bed as if praying

     beside sethe a white dress kneels as well with its sleeve
     around sethes waist like two friendly grownup women
     comforting each other in prayer

     denver tip toes away

     int denvers room  night

     sethe enters to check on denver whom she thinks is asleep
     she leans over and kisses her forehead only to discover she
     is awake

                         denver
               mama

                         sethe
               what is it baby

                         denver
               you think maybe when daddy comes he
               could talk to the baby ghost maybe make
               her behave and then people wont be
               scared of here no more

                         sethe
               i dont know

                         denver
               why wont she ever settle

                         sethe
               shes mad like a baby gets mad you
               forgetting how little it is she wasnt
               even two years old when she died too
               little to understand

                         denver
               for a baby she throws a powerful spell

                         sethe
               no more powerful than the way i loved her

     hearing her mother say this moves denver

                         denver
               what do you pray for mama

                         sethe
               oh i dont really pray anymore i just
               talk

                         denver
               about what

                         sethe
               oh about time how some things go pass
               on some things just stay

                         denver
               what things

               like the place i was at before here 
               sweet home even if that whole farm and
               every tree and blade of grass on it died 
               itll still be there waiting and if you
               go and stand in the place where it was
               what happened there once will happen
               again

                         denver
               if its still there waiting that mean
               nothing ever dies

                         sethe
               nothing ever does thats why i had to
               get my children out no matter what
               thats why you can never go there

                         denver
               you never tell me all what happened just
               that they whipped you and you run off

                         denver
                    nods

               you stay awhile

                         paul
               well long enough to see baby suggs
               youwhere is she

                         sethe
               dead

                         paul
               aw no when

                         sethe
               eight years now almost nine

                         paul
               was it hard i hope she didnt die hard

                         sethe
               soft as cream being alive was the hard
               part sorry you missed her though is
               that what you came by for

                         paul
               thats some of what i came for the rest
               is you

     sethe doesnt know what to do with her eyes when he says
     thisshe looks away instinctively paul realizes that may
     have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs

                         paul
               the truth be known i go anywhere these
               days anywhere they let me sit down

                         sethe
               come on inside

                         paul
               porch is fine cool out here sit with
               me

     like a nervous little girl sethe takes a sit beside a man
     for the first time in years folding her sweat stained skirt
     beneath her

                         paul
               so baby suggs is gone somehow never
               thought death would find her

                         sethe
               it finds everyone

                         paul
               we managed well enough without meeting
               it

                         sethe
               i suppose

     awkward pause sethe tries to find the words to a difficult
     question  but one that is foremost in her mind

                         sethe
               i wouldnt have to ask about him would
               iyoud tell me if there was anything
               to tell wouldnt you

     paul knows instantly she is asking about halle

                         paul
               you know i would but i dont know any
               more about what happened to halle now
               than i did then

     something about pauls expression might suggest hes keeping
     something from her he turns his gaze outward as he says

                         paul
               you must think hes still alive

                         sethe
               no i think hes dead its just not
               being sure that keeps him alive

                         paul
               what did baby suggs think

                         sethe
               same ha listen to her all her children
               dead and she felt each one go the very
               day and hour it happened

                         paul
               when she say halle went

                         sethe
               1855 same day my baby was born

                         paul
               you had that baby did you damn never
               thought youd make it running off
               pregnant

                         sethe
               had to couldnt be no waiting

                         paul
               all by yourself too

                         sethe
               almost a white girl helped me

                         paul
               then she helped herself god bless her

     awkward silence

                         sethe
               we got spare rooms you could stay the
               night if you had a mind to

                         paul
               you dont sound too steady in the offer

                         sethe
               oh itsits truly meant i just hope
               youll pardon my house

     paul smiles a warm touched smile that after all that theyve 
     survived sethe is worried about what hell think of her
     home

                         paul
               my house i like the sound of that

     sethe smiles then rises to escort him in

     int 124 bluestone road  day

     sethe opens the front door and enters with paul behind her
     hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder as he
     follows her in

     a pool of red undulating light forms around him it worries
     him

                         paul
               you got company

                         sethe
               on and off

     the light undulates faster and faster extending all the way
     to the kitchen at the end of the hall frightened paul steps
     back out the door

                         paul
               good god what kind of evil you got in
               there

                         sethe
               its not evilits justjust sad come
               on just step through

     sethe reaches out her hand paul tentatively takes it and is
     lead through the red light of the hallway through to the
     kitchen where it ends

     as he walks through we can see paul affected by the light
     itissad a sadness that touches him welling up inside
     until tears are brimming in his eyes he reaches the normal
     light of the kitchen and steps out of it

     int kitchen  day

     paul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone

                         paul
               i thought you said she died soft as cream

                         sethe
                    busying herself in kitchen
               oh thats not baby suggs thats my
               daughter the one i sent ahead with the
               boys before i run off

                         paul
               she didnt live

                         sethe
               no

                         paul
               the boys too

                         sethe
               no they alive  they run off before baby
               suggs died the one i was carrying when i
               left sweet home is all i got left

     still affected by the light paul eases himself down at the
     table finding something to say

                         paul
               well probably bestif a negro boy got
               legs he ought to use them sit down too
               long somebody figure out a way to tie
               them up
                    the image disturbs sethe
               you by yourself then

               restaurant in town sew a little on the
               sly

     she places a bottle and a glass on the table before him the
     light jarred him he snatches the bottle to drink and calm
     himself down she jokes

                         sethe
               you look more done in by a walk through
               my front hall than all those eighteen
               years of walking put together

                         paul
               got that right

     int second floor of 124  morning

     denver all of eighteen years old now and beautiful is
     buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down
     in the kitchen she stops her face lights up

               to him

     he addresses his humor to denver who offers no response she
     crosses to the stove and works on lighting it shes mad

               wheres he going to sleep baby suggs

                         sethe

               i got a tree on my back and a haunt in my

     sethes sudden outburst startles paul he watches as sethe
     ushers denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to
     quiet her down

     alone paul is disturbed by sethes words he fishes out a
     pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it searching for
     smoking papers he knows he doesnt havewaiting for sethe
     to return

     when she does she heads straight for the stove she spits on
     her finger and touches it to check its heat she then begins
     to make bread from flour soda and salt  keeping her back to

     sethe pauses something in her decides to tell paul d
     although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control

               but me

     paul listens half dreading where he thinks this storys going

                         paul
               we was talking about a tree sethe

     sethe works faster it is the work taking an action  any
     action  that allows her tell the story numbly without the
     pain of reliving itwithout the images attacking

                         sethe
               schoolteachers boys drag me into the
               barn and took my milk

     yet the images come anyway

     intercut flashes of memory attack as sethe tells her
     story

                                                       jump cut to

     int barn  a night remembered

      sethe being raped beaten held down by schoolteachers
     boys in a barn with a loft

                         sethe in kitchen
               held me down in that barn and took it

                                                       jump cut to

     sethe screams and is smacked across the face

                         sethe in kitchen
               they were like boulders on me their
               hands over my mouth and on my shoulders
               and my legs

                                                       jump cut to

     one of the boys holds her face and mouth and head as the two
     others hold down her body and ravage her

                         sethe in kitchen
               i couldnt move alls i could see was the
               loft above their heads

                                                       jump cut to

     her mouth covered her head immobile  she stares up at the
     loft

     end of memory images

                         paul
               the loft

     int kitchen  present day

     sethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder
     on the biscuit doughthe flashes of images stop

                         sethe
               i told mrs garner on them she had that
               lump on her neck and couldnt speak but
               her eyes rolled out tears i remember
               them boys found out i told on em and
               schoolteacher made one open up my back
               and when it closed it made a tree

                         paul
               they used cowhide on you

                         sethe
               and they took my milk

                         paul
               they beat you and you was pregnant

                         sethe
               and they took my milk

     sethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips
     into the stove as she rises paul steps gently behind her
     he slowly caresses her breasts from behind pressing his
     cheek against her back he rubs his cheek against it
     feeling the scars beneath the dress raising his fingers to
     the hooks as sethe cries silently he undoes her dress which
     slips down to her hips exposing the sculpture her back has
     become

                         paul
               aw lord girl

     grateful to have her body be someone elses responsibility
     for the moment sethe closes her eyes as paul touches every
     ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth the tenderness is
     almost unbearable

     suddenly pauls legs begin trembling he pauses and looks
     downhe realizes it is not his legs that tremble but
     rather

     the floorboards themselves are pitching grinding shoving
     the house from side to side

     sethe slides to the floor struggling with her dress

     on all fours denver crawls in from the keeping room as if
     trying to keep the house together

     paul falling reaching for an anchor begins to shout

                         paul
               god damn it hush up leave this place
               alone get the hell outta here

     a table rushes at him but paul grabs its leg managing to
     stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch he holds
     the table by two legs and bashes it about wrecking
     everything screaming at the house

                         paul
               you want to fight come on god damn it
               she got enough without you she got enough

     the quaking slows to an occasional lurch but paul does not
     stop whipping the table around until everything it is
     absolutely still he leans against the wall panting

     sethe is crouched by the stove a mixed expression of relief
     and guilt  the expression of a mother whose disobedient
     child has been sent away but a child she loves nonetheless

     denver looks frightened more alone than ever now that her
     one companion is gone

     all three are breathing together as if to the same beat like
     one tired person

                                                      lap dissolve

     int kitchen  later that day

     denver walks through the broken furniture and dishes at the
     stove she ashes over the fire and pulls the pan of biscuits
     from the oven

     ext 124 bluestone rd  continuous

     a shirtless paul d is by the water pump washing himself

     int kitchen  continuous

     denver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard its contents laying
     in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf she takes out a
     jar she looks for a plate and finds half of one by the
     broken table she picks it up as she hears paul enter through
     the front door

     int baby suggs bedroom  continuous

     sethe prepares a bed for paul baby suggs quilt is on the
     bed she hesitates whether or not to leave it there

     paul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands his
     shirt hanging open down the front

     sethe is surprised to see him there  she feels awkward

                         sethe
               why dont youtake a restill call
               you when were ready

                         paul
               sure you dont want me to help clean up

                         sethe
               noyoud just get in my way denver and
               mell do it

     they stand in silence looking at each other for a moment
     the awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny
     paul starts smiling sethe covers her mouth to conceal it

     and then just as quickly the urge to laugh subsides  and
     the fear they feel takes its place

     paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the
     floor sethe watches him paul crosses to her he moves in to
     kiss her they approach each others lips like two burn
     victims trying desperately not to hurt the other with their
     touch

     ext 124 bluestone rd  continuous

     denver sits on the porch steps alone once again miserably
     eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate

     int baby suggs bedroom  minutes later

     sethe and paul lay in bed after lovemaking they are still
     fully clothed the lovemaking was fast and finished quickly
     now there is an awkwardness that is without humor or
     excitement  but sits like a chasm between them

     as sethe lays there she remembers

     memory

     ext the corn fields of sweet home  a day remembered

     a brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny
     corn field

     sethe and a slightly older halle  handsome strong  run
     through the field until halle stops them at an isolated spot

                         halle
               hows this

                         sethe
               here out in the open

                         halle
               look around  can you see anybody

     sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks she
     shakes her head no

                         halle
               then nothing can see us neither

     he takes off his shirt seethe giggles as she gets on the
     ground keeping her ankles crossed

     halle lays her back and gently separates her legs she
     giggles halle pauses before laying on top of her

                         halle
               you are a beautiful sight

                         sethe
               dont talk stupid

                         halle
               youre my wife now i can talk as stupid
               as i like about you
                    she giggles
               i aint never loved nothing like you
               before sethe
                    sethe is moved
               and after i get mama outthen i get us
               out too and youll see baby girl
                    smiles
               were gonna have us a liiife

     he sings the word life so that sethe laughs then halle
     lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love as
     camera pans up to a hill above the field we hear sethe ask

                         sethe os
               you sure nobody can see

     we hear halle grunt uhhuh as we arrive on the hill where a
     great tree sits

     ext great tree on the hill  day

     beneath the tree paul d sixo and pauls brothers paul a
     and paul p are pouring water over heads and watching

     pov unbeknownst to halle and sethe their lovemaking is in
     clear view to anyone on the hill

                         paul a
               damn i dont get why she picked him

                         paul d
               halles got that way about him that way
               a woman feels hes doing it all for her
               not for himself at all

                         paul a
               i cant see nothing so special about halle

                         paul f
               what about what hes doing for his mama

                         paul a
               fool thing if you ask me by the time he
               buys it freedom wont mean a thing to
               somebody that old and worn

                         sixo
               freedom mean something anytime it come

     the men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking

     a young paul d in particular watches with tender yearning

     int kitchen at sweet home  early evening

     mr garner the man who owns and runs sweet home he offers
     cooked corn to the men

                         mr garner
               raccoon mustve got into my corn damaged
               a few so no use throwing them out

     the men looks to each other suppressing a laugh

                         mr garner
               sethe get the butter there

     everyone looks at each other as they thank no garner and
     begin to smear butter on their corn and eat

     a neighboring farmer visiting the garners cautions him

                         neighboring farmer
               you spoil these nigger boys

                         garner
               maybe you got boys on your farm my
               niggers are men not a boy amongem
               bought em thataway raisedem thataway

               not if you scared but if you a man
               yourself youll want your niggers to be
               men too

               wife

                         garner
               neither would ineither would i

     sethe hides a smile as she hands a piece of corn to halle
     paul a and paul f hesitate as they think of eating the corn
     which the lovers consummated but sixo digs right in

     paul d eats slowly his eyes never leaving sethe as she moves
     around the kitchen her eyes never leaving hallepauls
     attraction and love for her are apparent

     end of memory

     int sethes bedroom  early evening

     cu on paul on his back turned away from sethe

     what began as sethes memory has blended into pauls

     sethe rises off the bed breaking the thick silence between them

                         sethe
               ill call you when theres something to
               eat

     she exits leaving paul alone on the bed

     ext 124 bluestone rd  the following day

     we see the house now no creaking or sounds of breaking
     furniture just the sound of paul d singing

     int kitchen  day

     paul is singing as he fixes the table he broke while driving
     the baby ghost away

     denver is sweeping the floor  irritated by pauls presence
     and voice

     they both hear the front door open as sethe arrives home from
     work

     they look to each other to see which one will make a move for
     sethe first paul knows enough to bide his time with denver
     he watches as she places the broom down and exits the
     kitchen

     ext 124 bluestone rd  night

     paul and sethe sit on the porch together sethe is sewing
     paul nervously gets up his nerve to ask

                         paul
               sethe
                    she stops and looks
               i was thinking of looking for work around
               here what do you think

                         sethe

                         paul
               hogs is fine

     paul moves to where sethe is sitting

               i dont need much sethe eat sleep
               sing a little when it strikes me i dont
               ask for more toto live somewhere

     sethe realizes what he is asking and tentatively responds

                         sethe
               all right itsits fine with me

                         paul

                         paul
               dangerous to love anything that much
               sethe best thing is to love everything
               just a little bitthat way when it
               breaks or runs off or gets taken well
               maybe youd have a little love left over
               for the next one

     beat sethe is frightened by the prospect of feeling for him

                         sethe
               maybe we should leave things the way they
               are

     sethe rises to enter the house when pauls words stop her

                         paul
               how are they

                         denver
               on what mama countin on what

     sethe can barely bring herself to say to hope to imagine
     paul but for denver she forces herself and whispers

                         sethe
               something

     ext carnival  day

     paul and sethe and denver walk among the hundreds of black
     townspeople gathered for the carnival

     a sign reads colored thursdaytwo pennies entrance fee

     paul is in high spirits saying hello to anyone whose eye he
     catches willing eager to get anything for denver she wants
     feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life

     denver is excited but worried she doesnt want to like paul
     but cant help the thrill shes feeling and when one or two
     passersby shout out

                         various passers
                         by
               hey denverhi there denver

     denver heart almost weeps with joy

     sethe walks cautiously overdressed for the occasion it is
     her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years

     she catches the eyes of some of the women she knowsella
     and lady jonesgood christian women who nod in their
     acknowledgement yet are holding back something a judgement
     a repulsion

     paul doesnt notice them and for this sethe is glad

     montage of scenesthe various carnival acts all performed
     by a white troupe magic clowning fire swallowing spitting
     ribbons acrobats forming pyramids

     our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty

     at one point a white carnival barker shouts to the children

                         carnival barker
               all pickaninnies free

     the phrase stabs sethe and paul a bit but paul whispers

                         paul
               two pennies and an insult well spent in
               my opinion to see the spectacle of
               whitefolks making a spectacle of
               themselves

     sethe cant help but let out a small laugh  and with that
     laugh a sudden sensation of relief

     paul buys denver some licorice peppermint and lemonade
     holding the lemonade for her paul asks

                         paul
               mind if i take a sip

     denver agrees paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim
     where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back
     to her denver in spite of herself is starting to like him

     end montage

     ext country road  day

     our trio are leaving the carnival walking three astride with
     distance in between each the sunlight casts strong shadows

     sethes eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees

     their three shadows are holding handsas they walk home

                                                          fade out

     fade in

     ext a stream and the bank beside it  day

     wide angle of a beautiful wide stream more like a small
     river with a mulberry tree standing tall on the bank before
     it there is not a soul in sight as the stream moves
     gracefully beneath the sun

     suddenly

     a fully dressed young black woman emerges from the middle of
     the stream like a goddess arising out of spiritual waters
     she wears a straw hatt a white dress with buttons a lace
     collar and new shoes she walks out of the water to the bank

     exhausted sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from
     asthma she sits leaning against the mulberry tree she
     seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck yet her
     skin is like new lineless and smooth glowing

     although racked with pain she is smiling smiling the way
     travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long
     and arduous journey

     ext woods  day

     the young black woman makes her way through the woods she
     passes by denvers boxwood bush secret place then continues
     forward as if with a specific direction in mind

     ext 124 bluestone road  late afternoon

     sethe paul and denver approach 124 denver is the first to
     see

                         denver
               look what is that

     all three look to see

     the young black woman sitting on a stump not far from the
     steps of 124

     as the three approach the young woman lifts her head and
     stares directly at sethe

     the two women exchange a moment in their eyes  sethe
     curious yet warmthe young woman happy yet there is a
     hunger in her stare

     int kitchen  moments later

     the young woman seated on a chair as denver refills a tin cup
     of water the young woman drinks greedily cup after cup

                         sethe
               you from around here

     the young woman shakes her head no she reaches down and
     takes off her shoes which sethe notices as new sethe bends
     down to pick them up the young woman never lets her eyes
     leave sethe

                         paul
               those shoes look brand new

                         sethe
               what might your name be

     the young woman speaks in a low rough voice

                         beloved
               beloved

     sethe drops the shoes denver sits down paul smiles

               beloved

     as she spells it we see sethes reaction she is deeply
     touched then denvers  who looks both amazed and curiously
     excited

     sethe hangs her own hat on a peg then approaches beloved

                         sethe
               thats a pretty name beloved take off

     denver eases beloved onto her feet which sethe and paul
     notice do not have a line or sore on them

                         paul
                    whispers to sethe
               look at her feet theyre not walking
               feet more like she rode from somewhere
               all the way here

     yet beloved can barely stand upon them as denver escorts her
     to the white staircase beloved starts coughing

                         paul
               sounds like the croup

     everyone is sitting on the porch after dinner

     beloved looking strong and fit eats a cane stick  gnawing
     at it to the flax keeping the strings in her mouth long
     after the syrup had been sucked off it makes denver laugh
     as she licks her cane stick it makes sethe smile to see
     them both happy

     it makes paul disgusted

     int keeping room  night

     paul confronts sethe as she sews

                         paul
               you gonna just feed her from now on

                         sethe

               until her breathing got better she still
               sounds a little lumbar

                         paul
               she breathe like she can eat she could
               blow this whole house down and all those
               sweets

                         sethe
               sometimes the body needs that sugar for
               strength when its trying to recover
               after an illness

                         paul
               but thats just it she dont seem sick
               something funny about her

               sick good skin bright hands and strong
               as a bull

                         sethe
               she can hardly walk without holding onto
               something

                         paul
               thats what i mean cant walk but i
               passed by baby suggs room this morning
               and saw her lifting the rocker with one

                         sethe
               denver come in here a minute

     denver enters the keeping room

                         sethe

               rocking chair in baby suggs room with one
               hand that so

     denver looks at paul with a hard gaze

                         denver
               i didnt see no such thing

     from pauls expression we can tell denver is lyingand
     whatever fragile connection they were building is swiftly
     destroyed

     int sethes bedroom  night

     sethe is getting ready for bed denver sticks her head in

                         denver
               have you seen her i cant find her

                         sethe

               beloved

     sethe shakes her head denver exits anxiously the mentions
     of beloveds name stir a memory in sethe

     memory

     ext gravestone yard  a day remembered

     sethe talks to the headstone engraver as he works in the hot
     sun his young son helps him

                         sethe
               she need a marker somethin to tell me
               where she is but i aint got no money

     the engraver eyes her body

                         engraver
               what you got then

     sethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone especially in
     front of the young boy

     the engraver rises takes a step toward sethe and touches her
     hip curling his hand around to her back

                         engraver
               what you want it to say

                         sethe
               i was thinking what the preacher say at
               the funeral dearly beloved

                         engraver
                    touching her
               for ten minutes i give you one word for
               free

     his hand glides down to her buttocks sethe cant help but
     see the young boy watching the scene

     end of memory

     int sethes bedroom  night

     as the memory starts to fade form her mind sethe suddenly
     feels someone elses presence she looks up to find

     beloved standing by the door  watching her

                         sethe
               ohi didnt know you were there

     beloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning
     up sethes night dress

                         beloved

               i remember a woman who was mine and i
               remember bein snatched away from her

     sethe nods understanding such things she cautiously
     reaches out to stroke beloveds face beloved responds like a
     puppy pressing her cheek against sethes hand sethe is
     moved

     int kitchen  pre dawn

     sethe enters the kitchen to make bread before she leaves for
     work she finds beloved waiting for her placing out her
     cooking things on the table beloved looks up and smiles

                         beloved

     ext 124 bluestone  early evening

     beloved waits anxiously at the window for the sight of sethe
     coming home from work

     when she sees her she runs through the house out the door
     to meet her

     denver appears at the door upset by beloveds loss of
     attention in her

     ext porch  evening

     cu  sethe as she leans her tired head against the porch
     sitting on the step she closes her eyes and is about to
     drift off when

     beloveds hand gently touches her shoulder settling there

     sethe looks up and smiles patting her hand beloved stands
     above her as denver takes a seat on the step

     beloved searches sethes eyes and asks

                         beloved
               where your diamonds

     the question surprises setheand startles denver

                         beloved

                         sethe

                         beloved
               tell metell me about your diamonds

     sethe hesitates beloved kneels at her feet

                         denver
                    to beloved
               maam dont talk about sweet home

                         beloved
                    ignoring her
               tell metell me about your diamonds

     denver awaits her mothers reaction with great interest
     sethe looks at beloved sweet innocent expression and
     something in her resistance eases

                         sethe
               wellthis lady i worked for in kentucky
               gave them to me when i got married

     denver is both interested and slightly hurt at her mothers 
     willingness to tell beloved what shed never tell her

                         sethe
               what they called married back then i
               remember going up to her in the kitchen
               to tell her id help her make ink for
               mr garner in the kitchen i was fool
               enough to think i was going have some
               kind of ceremonymaybe even a new
               dress
                    continues as we cut to

     sethes continues telling beloved an attentive audience

     denver more attuned to beloveds interest than the story is 
     disturbed at her mothers telling of it

     int kitchen  another evening

     camera moves up from the mended legs of the table paul broke
     to

     a suspicious paul glares at beloved as they eat dinner

     beloved is ever ready to pass sethe a bowl or napkin or
     whatever she needs she is shining  for sethe and for
     sethe alone

     denver notices it as well

     it is raining outside both denver and beloved are wet from
     the rain denvers hair is all tangled

                         sethe
               best unbraid that hair

                         denver
               tomorrow

                         sethe
               todays always here tomorrow never

                         denver
               it hurts

                         sethe
               comb it everyday it wont

                         beloved
               your woman never fixed up your hair

     all three look to beloved puzzled by her question which is
     clearly intended for sethe pauls getting more annoyed

                         paul
               what

                         sethe
               my womanyou mean my mother

     beloved nods paul and denver exchange a curious look

                         sethe
               if she did i dont remember i dont
               think i saw her but a few times

                         beloved
               tell me bout her

     paul and denver look to sethe waiting to see if shell answer

                         sethe
               i remember once she picked me up and
               carried me behind the smokehouse the
               only thing i do remember in fact

     paul is disturbed by sethes carefree storytelling  how it 
     contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it
     will lead to no good

     once again denver is surprised to hear what shes never
     heard before she looks to paul and knows what he is
     thinking paul looks back and knows denver realizes it but
     denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the
     eyes

                         sethe
               she opened up her dress and right on
               her rib right here was a circle and a
               cross burnt right into the skin

                         paul
                    interrupts her
               sethe

                         sethe
               what

     paul doesnt want her to continue but doesnt want to say so

                         paul
               any more beans

     sethe rises to get him more food and she continues

                         sethe
               anyway she points to this mark and
               says to me this is your maam i am the
               only one whose got this mark now the
               rest all dead if something happens to me
               and you cant tell me by my face you can

               too

                         denver
               did she

                         sethe
               no she slapped my face i didnt
               understand it then not until i had a
               mark of my own

     paul is disturbed he can see sethe getting upset he is mad
     at beloved for her damn questions

                         beloved
               what happened to her

     something inside of sethe stops a wall erected something
     unwanted is coming into her consciousness paul notices it
     she rises

                         sethe
               dont know everybody done

     sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as paul asks

                         paul
               well as long as were all asking
               questions getting to know each other
                    to beloved
               why dont you tell us a little bit about
               yourself

     camera follows sethe as she arrives at the sink placing the
     dish inside we hear the others os

                         denver os
                    defensively
               she dont remember nothing

                         paul os

               remembering once you start talking

                         beloved os
               can i have some more pudding

     camera stays on sethe as we drown out the voices at the
     kitchen table she is staring out the window above the sink
     as if watching the memory being relived in her yard

     pov  out the window

     memory

     ext a large tree in a field  a day remembered

     a crowd of people surround a tree several white men are
     preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in
     line awaiting their turn

     among the crowd is a child sethe holding the hand of an
     older black slave woman nan nan is pointing to a woman
     sethes mother who is one of the people waiting in line to
     be hanged nan whispers to sethe

                         nan
               thats your mama  right there

     little sethe looks up and sees her mother  her face a mask
     of courage and rage and tears she looks straight ahead  not
     at anyone in particular especially not her daughter

                         nan
               im telling you small girl setheme
               and your mama was taken by the men many
               timesshe threw them other babies
               awaythe others from the whites without
               names she threw them awaybut you she
               gave the name of the black man she had
               her arms around him child the others
               she did not put her arms around
               nevernever

     the child sethe listens watching her mother move further
     down the line

     end of memory as we cut back to

     int kitchen 

     sethe the memory passing hears the voices in her kitchen

                         paul os
               aint you got no brothers or sisters

                         beloved os
               i dont have nobody

     she finds paul interrogating beloved who eats a second
     pudding denver tries to interfere

                         denver
               she has us now

                         paul

                         beloved
               she told me when i was at the bridge
               she told me

     paul looks quizzically at sethe who shrugs

                         sethe
               must be somebody from the old days

                         paul
               howd you come who brought you

                         beloved

               dress coughs the shoe strings dont

     suddenly she begins to choke on a raisin from the pudding
     and falls backward off the chair

     denver and sethe rush towards her beloved thrashes around
     until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin

     she breathes in sethes arms as denver wipes up the mess
     glaring at paul

                         sethe
               you all right

                         beloved
                    whispers

               come to my room i can watch out for you
               up there

     sethe gets beloved to her feet denver takes her up the
     staircase to her room  glaring at paul

     when the girls have gone sethe turns on paul as she cleans
     up

                         sethe

     cu on paul who doesnt want to explain  or even remember 
     as we cut to

     memory

     ext sweet home  day

     paul has a bit in his mouth chained to a wagon

     he is being lead away from sweet home with other black men
     by three white men the bit jerks his head back saliva
     spills uncontrollably out of his mouth his hands are chained
     behind him his feet chained together at the
     anklesanother chain is connected to an iron belt and
     stretches to a wagon he is being lead away with forty five
     other prisoners

                         paul vo
               i tried to kill brandywine  man
               schoolteacher sold me to dont know what
               possessed meme and about 45 other
               prisoners were being walked from kentucky
               to virginiathen on to georgia two
               places i dont ever want to see again

     he is lead past the milk shed when he sees

     halle alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes sitting
     by the butter churn halles face is covered with butter and
     clabber he sticks his hands in the churn and continues to
     cover his face with the sticky slippery white substance
     covering his face and head squeezing it through his hands

     the white men laugh paul is aching to scream out to him but
     the iron bit holds down his tongue

     as paul is lead past halle a rooster named mister is sitting
     on a tub in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee

                         white man
               look at mister there
                    referring to the rooster
               you go tell these niggers where to go
               there mister crowem right outta here

     mister crows and the white men laugh

     tears of rage and humiliation stream down pauls face he
     struggles to keep a view of halle until he is out of sight

     end of memory

     ext porch  early evening

     paul approaches sethe touching her gently

                         paul
               i didnt mean to tell you that

                         sethe
               i didnt plan on hearing it

                         paul
               i cant take it back but i can leave it
               alone

     sethe instead of collapsing from the information she seems
     hardened

                         paul
               lets do thatlets leave it alone now

                         sethe
                    more to herself
               let it alone just sit down and leave it
               be yeah that would be nice would be
               even nicer to lose it altogether  if i
               had my choice halle did other peoples
               brains stopped went crazy how sweet
               that would have been me and halle
               squatting by that churn smashing cold
               lumpy butter in our faces not a care in
               the world

                         paul
               sethe dont do this

                         sethe
               what a relief to just stop it all right
               there huh close it shut squeeze that
               butterbut i had three children on
               their way to ohio and nothing would have
               changed that and you tell me he didnt
               leave me

     sethe exits os paul is left alone on the porch until
     beloved runs out of the house giggling with denver in
     pursuit as denver passes paul sarcastically remarks

                         paul
               guess shes feeling better huh

     denver gives him a quick disdainful look then continues
     after beloved

     the two girls run towards the woods

     ext boxwood bush room  night

     beloved is dancing beneath a bright moon denver is an
     attentive grateful audience

                         denver
               whered you learn to dance

                         beloved
               nowhere look at me do this

     she puts her fists on her hips and skips

                         beloved
               now you come on come on

     she takes denvers hand and places another on her shoulder
     as they dance denver laughs harder and harder  a giddiness
     from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for beloveds 
     attention

     they spin and fall to the ground like two lovers nestled
     beloved catches her breath as denver asks

                         denver
               why you call yourself beloved

                         beloved

                         beloved
               yes sethe

     and with that denver takes a breath of courage to ask the
     question shes been longing to ask

                         denver
               you my sister aint you you really are

     beloved looks at her and smiles they are so close she leans
     in curiously and  touching denvers face  kisses her on the
     lips

                         denver
               you wont leave us will you

                         beloved

               touched me  real gentle and familiar
               like id felt that touch before

     smiling beloved moves to touch denvers cheek when suddenly
     denver sits up cross legged and urges beloved

                         denver
               dont tell mama you musnt tell her who
               you really are i dont know what shed

     suddenly beloveds face turns to rage as she rises up as
     well

                         beloved
               dont tell me what to do dont never
               tell me what to do

                         beloved

               shes the one shes the one i need you
               can go but shes the one i have to have

     beloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the
     boxwood bush room as denvers pleads

                         denver
               no beloved please dont go i didnt do
               nothing we were dancing dont go

     int denvers  beloveds room  dawn the following day

     the room is still dark from the night but the sun is rising
     outside

     suddenly beloved awakens with a start she senses something
     she rises and looks out the window to see

     pov

     sethe walking across the field

     beloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her as
     denver awakens just in time to see her go

     ext woods early morning

     sethe is dressed as if for church as she makes her way through
     the woods with a specific destination in mind

     soon she comes upon

     ext a clearing in the woods  early morning

     sethe steps out of the woods and into an open clearing a
     large rock sits in the clearing like a pulpit above the pews
     of grass and weeds

     sethe remembers the place as it was she hears the voices
     of a crowda gathering of people though the clearing
     remains empty she crosses to the rock and sits camera moves
     up to reveal 

     memory

     baby suggs vital and strong standing on the rock
     preaching

                         baby suggs
               im not here to tell you all to clean up
               your lives and sin no moreim not
               here to tell you were the blessed meek
               and are gloryboundim here to tell
               you that the only grace we can have is
               the grace we can imagineand if you
               cannot see it then you shall not have
               it

     end of memory

     cu on sethe as she remembers baby suggs words sitting
     alone in the clearing  the images of the past gone

     ext woods  same time

     beloved has found her and watches from a hidden place

     camera moves beyond her to find

     denver having followed beloved watches her from a distance

     ext a clearing in the woods  early morning

     sethe remembers baby suggs advice

                         baby suggs vo

     weep she covers her head from god and cries as she lets the
     memories comememories she can no longer fight from coming

                                                            cut to

     sethes memories

     ext sweet home  a night remembered

     sethe is in the same bent over position only here her back
     is exposed and she is being beaten by the schoolteachers
     boys the boy beating sethe never stops with the whip for a
     second as he rants

                         boy beating sethe

               mouth bout me agin

     they beat her mercilessly

     ext field  night

     sethe tear stained bloody and very pregnant fights her way
     through a corn field as she makes her escape

     her dress hangs torn at the back  her wounds open and
     bleeding her feet already swollen and blistered she is in
     agonizing pain she moves like a figure in a nightmare

                                                            cut to

     a series of images in which we see sethe struggling through
     days and nights of walking and hiding in various locations
     as she makes her way across the state

     the final image is

     ext onion field  day

     sethe falls to the ground unable to move  her contractions
     have started and the pain is unbearable

     her breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body her legs
     are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs
     and rock on her back the tree is starting to form

     she lays there waiting for death until a voice asks

                         amy os
               who that back there

     sethe can not answer as she hears two feet moving through the
     field she clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she
     might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her

     a raggedly looking white girl with arms like cane stalks and
     enough hair for five heads steps through into view

                         amy
               look there a nigger if that dont beat
               all

               man you bout the scariest looking
               something i ever seen what you doing
               back up here

     sethe manages to control her breath and push out the word

                         sethe
               running

     amy looks at sethes swollen bloody flesh at the end of her
     legs

                         amy
               them the feet you running on my jesus

     ext river bank  oak tree  night

     a thunderstorm cracks across the sky and floods the river

     sethe is sitting beneath the oak  the rain soaking her as
     she breast feeds her baby she cries out loud  but her sobs
     and tears are lost in the rain and thunder

     ext riverbank  later that day

     sethe walks downriver with denver tied to her chest she
     stops when she sees

     a flatbed gliding down river she cant make out if theyre
     white people or not so she hides behind a tree until it
     passes

     waiting behind the tree we see that sethe is sweating a
     fever but denver seems to be doing fine

     she sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way she
     sees

     three colored people  an older man and two boys  fishing

     she approaches cautiously

     one of the boys is the first to see her sethes bloody and
     torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight to
     the young boy he taps the old man on the shoulder and
     motions for him to turn around

     the old man takes in sethe and instantly knows where shes
     been and why shes there

     in fascination stamp paid turns to one of them and says

     children

                         baby suggs
               all right boys  mamas home now you be
               seeing her all the timego downstairs

     she still doesnt believe she can just get out of bed walk
     downstairs and be with them the boys leave as sethe cradles
     the little girl

     sethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her
     breast to the little girl she winces with pain and smiles 
     she got her milk to her baby girl

     baby suggs gathers the rags sethe wore when she first arrived

                         baby suggs
               nothing worth saving here

                         sethe
               oh waitlook and see if theres
               something knotted up in the petticoat
               wedding present from mrs garner

     baby suggs finds two crystal earrings

                         baby suggs
               be nice if there was a groom to go with
               it what do you think happened to him

                    skeptical
               well put these on  maybe theyll light
               his way

     as sethe takes the earrings the little baby girl reaches for
     them

     through her eyes we see them sparkle and shine  like
     diamonds

     baby suggs hands gently massage sethes neck as she says

                         baby suggs
               whatever happens nowgod lead you home
               so now layem down sethesword and
               shielddont study war no more lay all
               that mess down sword and shield

     sethe surrenders herself to baby suggs firm safe hands 
     letting go of the diamonds one of which lands in the hands
     of the little girlwho plays with them in fascination

     end of memory

     present day

     ext a clearing in the woods  day

     sethe is remembering these last images she eases her own
     hand up to her neck  rubbing herself the way baby suggs did
     she realizes how much she misses herand wonder who can
     touch her now and help her lay it all down and then quite 
     suddenly

     an image flashes across her mind

      paul gently easing his hands around sethe from
     behindtenderly kissing sethes back

     paulthere is paul sethe realizes as images flash across
     her minds eye

      paul sitting on the porch the first day he arrived

      paul battling the baby ghost

      paul singing as he fixes the kitchen table

      sethe wrapped in pauls big arms as they lay in bed

     sethe rises from the ground as if with a new realization
     she begins to walk out of the clearing and into the woods
     her pace increasing with each image

     ext woods  day

     begin to make love revealing

     beloved watching from the doorway unknown to sethe or paul

     she passes denver as if she werent there

     ext stream in the woods  day

     beloved reaches the stream and steps in she begins to
     violently hit the water around her then begins hitting her
     own face and head clawing at it as if to escape from the
     boundaries of flesh suddenly she submerges herself
     underwater and holds herself there as if to drown herself

     she bursts out of the water gasping for airslowly her
     rage subsides replaced with a calm ruthless understanding

     ext the field of 124 bluestone rd day

     beloved is walking back toward the house she stops

     she looks back at the house to the kitchen window  knowing
     paul and sethe are in there she approaches the kitchen
     window and looks in

     pov  sethe is drying off pauls body and rebuttoning her
     dress

     camera moves slowly into a cu of beloved this time her
     focus is on paul

     int 124 bluestone road  evening

     the inhabitants eat dinner in silence

     denver awaits a look from beloved as beloved passes her a
     bowl of peas with a smile denver is satisfied

     beloved then turns to paul offering him the bowl

                         beloved

     caught off guard paul looks to sethe  whose expression asks

     the men are being led by white guards with rifles

     camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach

     a trench one thousand feet long five feet deep five feet
     wide

     camera tilts down to reveal within the trench

     wooden boxes with scrap limber roofs and a door of bars
     fitted on them like a cage that opens up to a wall of red
     dirt stretching two feet above the top of the bars themselves

               hiiiiiii

     ext trench  day

     three white men walk along the trench unlocking the cage
     doors one by one

     one by one the black men emerge and stand in a line in the
     trench

     when all are assembled a second rifle shot signals them to
     climb out of the trench to the ground above

     waiting for them above the trench is one thousand feet of
     chain each black man bends over and waits as the first man
     on line threads the chain through his leg iron passing it to
     the second and so on

     as they connect each other to the chain camera pans down the
     line of men and while not a word is spoken we hear their 
     thoughtsthoughts to themselves or if possible through
     their eyes to the man beside them

                         black man one
                         vo

     the black men are chained and kneeling in a straight line

     the white guards walk passed them one white guard stops in
     front of the man beside paul d he turns to him

                         white guard

     the white guard unzips his fly and undoes his pants and moves
     a step closer to the black mans mouth

     paul d looks ahead tremblinghe vomitsthe guard steps
     away as another guard steps in and hits paul on the shoulder
     with a rifle

     women they knew the children they had beenthey sing of
     bosses and masters and missesof mules and dogs and the 
     shamelessness of lifethey sing of sisters long gone they
     sing love songs to death

     int trench  night

     a torrential downpour the men in the wooden cages watch the
     rain filling the trench corroding the red dirt wall around
     them

     bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet mud
     covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof

     some finds rest others minds are long gone

     camera finds paulhe is screaming but there is no sound
     coming from his mouth tears flow down his face but when he
     touches them he realizes

     they are tears of mud he looks up and the wooden planked
     roof is breaking under the power of the rainhe looks down
     and the water is up to his thighs

     suddenly the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is
     knocked downhe gets up searches through the mud for the
     chain and notices its slackhe pulls as well

     one by one the men in the boxes realize the chains end is
     being undone by the rain as camera tracks down towards the
     last box to the dirt wall into which the chain has been
     lockedit is giving way within the muddy wall

     the men break through the rotted wood roofs to freedom

     wide angle

     as the men climb out of the muddy coffins grasping for a
     hold crawling with every muscle of their bodies  to get out
     of the trench before mud and water drown them

     paul climbs with the will of ten men with every ounce of
     strength he has left

     end of memory

                                                       cut back to

     int cold room  a winter night

     paul d is wide awake the memories wont let him sleep

     winter has arrived and the night is cold he lies underneath
     a thin blanket in yet another sleeping place even further
     from the house he adds newspapers under and around his body
     to stay warm

     he looks as if he has given up on sleeping altogether he
     hears the door to the cold room open but he does not turn to
     look

                         paul
               what do you want in here

     beloved enters the cold room

                         beloved

               and call me my name

     she hoists up her skirt and turns her head away paul stares
     at a silver lard can so as not to look

                         paul
               when good people take you in and treat

     hes fearful what turning to look will do

                         beloved
               call me my name

     beloved moves closer right up behind him entwining her arms
     around his body like chains

                         paul
               no aint no chains on me

     surrenders

     beloved presses her body against his he turns and grabs her
     kissing her with a passion bordering on hatred

     sounds of lovemaking and cries

     int cold house  another night

     beloved is wrapping her body with a blanket as paul lies on
     his bed of newspapers  their lovemaking finished beloved
     gives him a final look  no tenderness or affection or even 
     friendliness just a cold look void of respect or even
     attraction

     she exits the cold house leaving paul alone he is on the
     verge of tears

     int sethes bedroom  night

     paul stands above the sleeping sethe  his guilt driving him
     mad he wants to touch her to wake her to ask for
     forgiveness and help but he can not and buries his head in
     his hands

     ext sawyer restaurant  late afternoon

     paul waits outside in the cold cupping his hands and
     breathing inside to keep them warm he is rehearsing

                         paul
               look here setheyou aint gonna like

               to me anyway fixing me sethe shes
               fixed me and i cant break it

     sethe appears exiting the back door of the restaurant with a
     scrap pan in the crook of her arm to her surprise she finds
     paul waiting for her

                         sethe
               man you make me feel like a young girl

               out i might start looking forward to it

     she tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap
     before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment

                         sethe
               got to rinse this out

     she enters the restaurant paul watches the dogs eat 
     watching them getting what they wanted sethe reappears with
     a cloth over her head

                         sethe
               you get off early or what

                         paul

                         sethe
               not cut back

                         paul

               you aint gonna like what im about to
               say sethe

     sethe steps forward to hear what paul came to tell her there
     is no apprehension or anger in her look instead a calm
     resolve  as if she were already able to accept whatever he
     had to tell her without it being anyones fault as if she
     already knew he cane to say he was leaving her she smiles

                         sethe
               well say it paul dwhether i like it
               or not

     paul knows what shes expecting and when he sees her
     diminished expectation the melancholy without blame in her
     eyeshe cant tell her about beloved he is filled with
     respect and admiration for her in that moment something pops
     into his head and out of his mouth that wasnt planned

                         paul
               i want you pregnant sethe would you do
               that for me

     sethe breaks up with laughter paul joins in

                         sethe
               you came by here to ask me that you are
               one crazyheaded man you right i dont
               like itdont you think im a little
               too old to start that all over again

     she slips her fingers into his

                         paul
               think about it

     paul lifts them putting the tips of her fingers on his
     cheek he smiles broadly

     she laughs shaking her head a burden transformed into a
     gift so suddenly they begin walking

     sethe and paul catch and snatch each others fingers
     stealing quick pats on the behind joyfully paul throws his
     arm around sethe and squeezes she lets her head touch his
     chest they stop and stay that way for a moment  not
     breathing sethe closes her eyes paul looks up to the trees
     lining the roadside like defending arms against attack
     softly suddenly it begins to snow sethe opens her eyes

                         sethe

     ext bluestone road  early evening

     they continue laughing and moving down bluestone road when
     they are jolted by the appearance of

     beloved waiting in her usual place for sethe her hands
     wrapped in a long shawl waiting to be given to sethe her
     eyes only on sethe not even acknowledging pauls presence

     sethe gets herself down from paul

                         sethe
               crazy girl you out here with nothing on

     she takes the shawl from beloveds hands and wraps it around
     her shoulders

                         sethe
               you got to learn more sense than that

     she walks on ahead with beloved paul suddenly icy cold and
     filled with anger walks behind

     stops before denver their eyes meet paul stares at her as
     if to ask  whos ally are youdenver unnerved by his
     look runs into the house paul waits on the porch until a
     moment later sethe reappears

     as if healed by her strength pauls face melts into relief

     int kitchen  night

     denver is cleaning the dishes beloved sits like an angry
     upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth

                         beloved

     beloved eases herself into denvers arms and cries

     ext window of 124  night

     we see sethe and paul united as the snow begins to pile up

     int sethes bedroom  later that night

     sethe lies with paul in the dark her face looking up to the
     ceiling paul is asleep

     on her face are reservations she rises crossing to the
     window to look out

     at the same time beloved appears silently at the doorway of
     the room looking at sethe  hurt and sad she walks by
     without sethe noticing her

     sethe takes a breath at the window watching the snow fall
     then as she moves back to the bed

     camera moves ahead of her to

     a different bed in which halle is trying to fall asleep a
     younger sethe crawls in beside him

     we are in memory

     int halle  sethes sweet home living quarters  night

     sethe halle and the baby girl beloved sleep together by
     the wall the boys sleep together under a window  halle is
     trying to sleep but sethe is awake

                         sethe

     ext sweet home  a day remembered

     sethe carries a big basket of berries as young howard and
     bulgar run ahead of her she turns in the opposite direction
     and walks along the side of the house to the back entrance of
     the kitchen

     she passes the open window of the classroom and hears

                         schoolteacher
                         os
               which one are you doing

                         boy os
               sethe

     hearing her name sethe stops and peeks through the window

     schoolteacher is standing over the student who has been
     writing in a notebook schoolteacher licks his finger and
     thumbs a couple of pages before saying

                         schoolteacher
               no no thats not the way i told you to
               put her human characteristics on the
               left her animal ones on the right and
               dont forget to line them up

     although sethe doesnt entirely understand something about
     the words disturb her she looks to her children

     int mrs garners bedroom  a day remembered

     mrs garner is sick in bed with a goiter sethe enters with
     some soup

                         mrs garner

                         sethe
               they dont need telling

                         mrs garner

               nothing but negroes and he is a learned
               man being a schoolteacher

     as sethe fills mrs garners basin with fresh water she
     looks out the window and sees

     schoolteacher outside with his students we notice he wears a
     very distinctive hat as mrs garners description continues

                         mrs garner
               i know his ways might be a little more
               strict but as long as the men do as
               theyre told im sure itll be fine all
               right im through talking makes me

     aching and sweaty she struggles to get to her feet and exit

     int halle and sethes living quarters  night

     sethe opens the door to find her children asleep she is
     about to wake them when

     she notices mrs garners light is on in her bedroom window

     sethe blind with rage decides theres one thing she must do
     before she takes her children to the meeting place

     int mrs garners bedroom  night

     mrs garner lies ailing through a sleepless night when her
     bedroom door opens sethe enters  her appearance tells all

     the field is waiting

                         woman
               hurry up youre late

                         sethe

     sethe carefully hands her baby girl to the woman

                         sethe
               put sugar water on that cloth for her to
               suck so she wont forget me til i come

                         sethe
               gogo now

     sethe disappears back into the corn field leaving the woman
     holding the baby girl as bulgar cries out

     ext corn field closer to sweet home house  night

     when suddenly

     her one holding a horsewhip

                         boy with horsewhip
               you nigger bastard

     sethe struggles and is about to scream out when she is
     slapped and muffled and dragged into the corn field to be
     beaten

     end of memory

     int sethes bedroom  night

     sethe awakens sweating from having fallen asleep and
     reliving her past nightmare she sits up and realizes where
     she is she looks beside her and sees paul asleep she lays
     down pressing her body against his so that there is no space
     between  enfolding her arms around him

     ext pig slaughterhouse  day

     pigs are crying in the chute as paul stamp paid and twenty
     other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse

     although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day  his hands numb
     from the cold  paul d is in high spirits he sings as he
     works much to the amusement of his fellow coworkers

               others you aint got much more sense
               than they do

     the men laugh paul smiles and brushes it off

                         paul

               more than that when a man can make plans
               then a man can make good times happen

     ext 124 bluestone rd  early evening

     sethe is sweeping the porch

     paul appears on the road when he sees sethe on the porch in
     the distance he stops

     sethe sees him and smiles  but something about his slow
     approach to the house sends off an alarm within her

     paul makes his way to the porch he stops before her

                         sethe
               already fed the girls you eat
                    he shakes no
               want something

     paul doesnt answer instead he steps up to her as he
     removes the clipping from his pocket and hands it to her

     sethes heart stops beating for a moment  not having seen
     this image for many years but shes survived worse than the
     telling so she faces him

                         sethe
               best you come inside

     she rises and enters the house paul follows

               know what it was like for me to get away
               from there

     she rises and begins to move about the room circling paul
     as she tries to find a way to explain it all

                         sethe
               we was here each and every one of my
               babies and me too i birthed them and i

     she chops at the soil over the roots of the pepper plants
     she stops  sensing something is wrong she looks up at a
     clear blue skyshe hears the birds and the stream way down
     beyond the woods

     she looks around and sees bulgar howard and the little girl
     beloved playing with loud voices by the side of the house

     she sees sethe squatted in the pole beans with denver in a
     bushel basket beside her

     the clok clok of wood being chopped causes her to look over
     to stamp paid helping out with the axe

     she returns to her workbut something is deeply wrong

     and then she hears it

     the sound of horses and a horse drawn wagon coming from the
     distance the same sound sethe heard in her first memory of
     the sycamores earlier on

     she rises up and looks

     stamp paid in between chops looks up and sees the two
     womenthen turns his face to see the men

     but it is sethes face we concentrate on  as we intercut the
     oncoming approach of the four horsemen and hear her words

               before it happens in the open

     over the above speech we see in sethes expression a death
     of soul  an instantaneous loss of hope for possibilities of
     joy and life and with it an insane rage

     sethe grabs denver out of the basket then scrambles after
     the crawling little girl beloved scooping her under her

     sethe clutching the dead baby to her chest is led out of
     the shed by stamp paid

     outside a throng of black faces have gathered who stop
     murmuring the second they see her among them are ella and
     lady jones they are shocked and pained

     sethe is led past them to a waiting cart  in total silence

     baby suggs at the same time is getting the boys up the
     porch into the house when denver cries in stamp paids arms
     she stopslets the boys sit and runs towards the cart

     sethe is seated in the cart beside the sheriff baby suggs
     takes the crying denver from stamp paidshe tells the

     as stamp paid does what he canfinally sethe wins and takes
     denver with her free hand undoes her dress and nurses her
     with a bloody breast

     baby suggs breaks inside breaks right in two although from
     outwards appearances she looks merely numbed by shock

     a white boy makes his way through the crowd with a pair of
     shoes and hands them to her

                         white boy
               mama says wednesday she says you got to
               have them fixed by wednesday

     that jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it
     sethe has no responsethe distance between these two people
     in this small room is suddenly vast

     paul rises playing with his hatnot knowing how to leave
     but desperately needing to he moves to the exit and stops

                         paul
               you can set aside supper for me might
               be late getting back

     unable to look at her he turns to exit when sethe speaks in
     a soft forgiving tone he stops to listen

                         sethe
               after all i told you paul d and after
               telling me how many feet i have you
               think saying goodbye is gonna break me
               into pieces

     paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through
     him

                         sethe
               youre a sweet man

     unable to bear it paul turns and leaves

     sethe stands still fighting tears and whispers

                         sethe
               so long paul d

     int kitchen  day

     sethe is scrubbing the floor with denver trailing by with
     dry rags

     beloved enters holding a pair of ice skates

                         beloved
               what do these do

     sethe and beloved look up sethe smiles

                         sethe
               my lordwhered you dig up those

                         denver
               there for skating on the ice
               we have another pair and half of another
               i think

                         beloved
               can we try them

     sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious
     lightness

                         sethe
               go ice skating ha
                    beat
               why not

                         denver
               you sure mama

                         sethe
               strikes me that after your man leaves it
               might just be the wrong time to be
               scrubbing floors might just be the
               perfect time to go ice skating

     denver and beloved register hopefulness in the light of
     sethes attitude sethe speaks to denver

                         sethe
               go get the shawlsand find me an old
               shoe for that half a pair

     the girls get excited sethe tosses the scrub brush into the
     pail

     ext a frozen creek  day

     a bright cold winter day beloved wears a pair of old
     skates denver wears the second pair and sethe has one skate
     and one shoethe two girls giggle and fall as they try to
     skate on the ice helping each other up their skirts 
     whirlingtheir laughter mingled with screams of delight

     sethe wearing only shoes watches them and laughs

                         denver
               come on maamtry

     sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly
     falls on her rear the girls scream with laughter sethe
     tries to get up and falls their laughter infecting her as
     well the girls try to help her and fall over each other in
     the trying

     denver rises and tries an independent glide the tip of her
     skate hits a bump and she falls flapping her arms wildly
     all three laugh so hard they start coughing beloved goes to
     denvers aid

     sethe rises up on her hands and knees her laughter shaking
     her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air

     beloved helps denver and falls as well the two girls see
     sethe laughing and play it up even more a few more times

     until denver notices something and motions beloved to stop
     and look

     the two glide back to sethe her laughter has stopped but
     her tears have not they gently comfortingly touch her
     shoulder

     int kitchen  night

     it is a snowy night outside the windows

     sethe has laid out blankets and quilts in front of the fire
     in the stove she has made sweet milk that she hands to the
     girls before taking her place in between them on the floor
     facing the fire denver on her right rests her head on her
     lap beloved sits on her left

     she looks over to beloved who is staring at the fire the
     illumination highlights her beauty and her profile the chin
     mouth forehead  all copied and exaggerated in a huge shadow
     the fire threw on the wall sethe cant help but stare as
     another thought occurs to her

                         baby suggs vo
               all i remember is how she loved the
               bottom of burned bread her little
               handsi wouldnt know em if they
               slapped me

                         sethe vo
               here look here see this mark if
               you cant tell me by my face look here

     beloved lifts her head towards the fire at the same time she
     leans back to rest on a proppedup pillow in the flickering
     of the firelight sethe can see

     a smile of a scar beneath her chin

     sethe knows before shes aware of it consciously and just as
     it hits her beloved begins to hum a melody

     sethe recognizes it as her own melody

                         sethe
               i made that song up i made it up and
               sang it to my children

     denver lifts her head from her mothers lap to look at sethe
     knowing what is happening

                         sethe
               nobody knows that song but me and my
               children

     beloved turns to sethe

                         beloved
               i know it

     a click sethe looks at her daughter returned there is no
     gasp of astonishment  no exclaim for the miraculous for
     what is truly miraculous is so because the magic lies in the
     fact that you knew it was there for you all along

                                                       dissolve to

     morning

     int kitchen  morning

     of the stove but denver awakens upon hearing her mother load
     the stove with dry wood and begin to cook breakfast sethe
     hears her wake up and turns as she beats eggs in a bowl

                         sethe
               back stiff

                         denver
               that was fun

     beloved snores lightly beside her

                         denver
               should i wake her

                         sethe

     denver smiles  but it is a cautious smile something about
     her mothers statement both elates and disturbs her

     fade inspringext 124 bluestone rd  morning

     the sun shines on a warm april daya day abundant with
     growth and renewed hope

     but a shadow appears to be hovering over 124 it looks more
     worn than beforeneglected abused

     a broken windowthe front door off its hingea front
     step splintered and dangerous

     int 124 bluestone rd  morning

     camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house
     revealing the same neglect inside

     broken furniture dusty floors mess and disorder

     camera enters

     int kitchen  morning

     dirty pans crusted food on the table window curtains
     hanging askew

     sethe sits hunched over asleep in a chair against the wall
     she wears a dirty torn dress that hangs on her body  which
     seems withered frailer since we last saw herin her lap
     lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing
     when she fell asleep from fatigue

     a loud crash wakes her up followed by a loud frustrated
     yell her face registers fear she realizes where she is
     what time it isand begins organizing breakfast

     she places the dress neatly on the chair then grabs a cloth
     and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper
     placing them in the sink

     she opens a pantry cupboard to reveal bare shelves except for
     a single egg and a bowl of hominy grains about 14 full she
     searches in a panic for more food  anywhere  opening 
     cabinets doors  places that never stored food she realizes
     there is none left

     int denvers room  morning

     denver finished dressing she has been able to maintain a
     semblance of order about her person and room

     but as she steps out into the second floor hallway we see
     the same disarray as downstairs

     she passes by baby suggs old room and discovers

     beloved sprawled across the bed half naked her belly is
     huge her body unwashed she looks and behaves like a wild
     animal

     a broken lamp lies on the fall  pushed over by her leg as
     she shifted in bed her feet overhanging the bed are still
     touching the bedside table where the lamp sat

     she is awake now  making a small hole larger in baby suggs
     old quilt

                         denver
               you shouldnt be in here

     beloved jolts her head up to denver she doesnt like being
     looked at unawares

                         beloved
               what do you know about it i sleep where
               i want

                         denver
               you best leave that quilt alone that was
               grandmas quilt

     beloved looks at denver then at the quilt  then abruptly
     tears the hole apart with one strong pull

     triumphant she gets out of bed and exits passing denver

                         beloved
               breakfast ready im hungry

     int kitchen  morning

     sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it
     on one plate which she sets on the table she stands at the
     stove with her back to us picking crusted pieces of food
     off the bottom of the pan

     beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and
     begins to eat shovelling the food into her mouth

     denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs
     as she pretends to wash the dishes

                         sethe
               morning

                         denver
               morning maam

     sethe turns not realizing denver was there as well their
     eyes meet sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the
     pan crumbs she smiles

                         sethe
               you hungry

     knowing there must be nothing left denver answers

                         denver
               no maam

     sethe looks relieved

                         denver
               ill finish those why dont you sit
               down

     denver crosses to the dishes taking the pan from her mother
     sethe nods and crosses to the table to sit down

     but as she sinks into the chair beloved kicks it away

                         beloved
               you dont sit with me

               but ella you cant just up and kill your
               children

                         ella
               no and the children cant just up and
               kill the mama whats fair aint
               necessarily right
                    the women listen
               now you all know how i felt about the
               whole thing i know the rage sethe felt
               in that shed that day  we all do but
               what i could not understand and still
               dont was her reaction to it prideful
               too damn complicated for a black woman in
               her position before god but whatever she
               done i dont like the idea of past
               errors taking possession of the present
               i dont cotton to sin moving in on a
               house unleashed and sassy every day
               life takes enough takes all a woman has
               sufficient unto the day is evil thereof
               and nobody needs more nobody needs a
               grown up evil sitting at a table with a
               grudge as long as that ghost showed
               itself from a ghostly place i respected
               it but once it take on flesh and come
               into this world well the shoes on the
               other foot now i dont mind a little
               communication between worlds but this
               heres an invasion

     the women agree

                         grace
               should we pray

                         ella
               uhhuh first then we got to get down to
               business

     int 124 bluestone rd kitchen  days later

     denver comes down the stairs entering the kitchen

     sethe worn out looking more beaten and ravaged than before
     stands at the sink with an ice pick chopping up ice denver
     speaks to her but she does not turn or acknowledge her

                         denver
               mamamama im going out
                    no response
               mama i got a job working over at the
               bodwins at night mr bodwin coming over
               now to pick me up on his way back from
               town ill be staying there nights and
               coming back here for the daytime well
               have some money mamamama

     sethe continues her action as if hypnotized denver
     approaches her from behind and whispers softly

                         denver
               im going help you mama dont you give
               up yet

     denver touches her gently but sethe acts as if she hears and
     feels nothing denver exits

     ext 124 bluestone rd  late that day

     denver is sitting on the stump waiting for mr bodwin when
     she hears

     thirty women gathered together walking up bluestone rd
     towards 124 singing a holy song

     denver is amazed by the sight as the women position
     themselves right in front of 124  armed with bibles
     crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they
     could find

     int 124 bluestone rd the keeping room  day

     sethe is rubbing a naked beloveds forehead with a cool cloth
     filled with ice when the two women hear the singing

     beloved rises first and moves to the window to see

     ext 124 bluestone rd  day

     the women continue singing

                                                            cut to

     ext further down bluestone rd  day

     mr bodwin sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse is riding
     toward 124 when he hears the singing as well

     we notice that mr bodwin is wearing a hat similar to the one
     schoolteacher wore on that fateful day

                                                       cut back to

     ext 124 bluestone rd  day

     the women continue singing as

     sethe and beloved her belly as big as a pregnant womans
     exit the house

     the women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by
     the lack of fear between the women

     sethe is holding beloveds hand beloved is smiling brightly
     at the beautiful singing

     denver looks to her mother

     tears run down sethes face but she is not crying the sound
     of the womens voices wash over her like a baptism she looks
     to all the women faces she remembers faces she has missed
     although up until this moment was not conscious of missing

     then sethe looks beyond the women and sees

     mr bodwin approaching in his wagon she sees mr bodwin
     wearing a hat that looks like schoolteachers

     sethes expression turns to fear then rage in her ravaged
     mind she thinks it is schoolteacher coming back

                         sethe
               nono hes not coming into my yard he
               not taking my best thingno

     she releases beloveds hand and moves forward

                         sethe
               nonono

                         denver
               mama

     she passes denver feeling for the ice pick in her apron

                         sethe
               nonononoooooooooooo

     as mr bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from
     124 his eyes focus in wonder on the naked beloved as

     sethe runs towards him and the women her hand extended
     holding the ice pick

                         denver
               mamanooooooo

     denver runs after her sethe reaches the women and lunges for
     bodwin but the women seize her creating a hill of black
     people sethe rising to the top her hand extended denver
     reaching her from behind pulling her back and punching her
     out cold as the bodies fall around them

     beloved watches from the house  watches sethe attack and
     defend with the ice pick  and something within her is
     resolved for a moment we see a calm spirit instead of a
     wild animal and a tear upon her face

     then just as quickly she sprints around the side of the
     house and disappears from view

     the women try to help sethe as denver cries for her mother
     mr bodwin looks on stunned

     wide angle  of a naked black woman with a full belly running
     through an open field reaching the woods then disappearing
     into the trees

                                                          fade out

     fade in

     ext richmond st  day weeks later

     paul d is on his way to work when he sees

     a poised confident denver walking in the opposite direction
     she spots him and smiles

                         denver
               good morning paul d

     paul is clearly impressed by the sight of her

     runs towards her shouting

     can walk into a house and make women cry make women tell him

     and the crowd gives her music singing in four part harmony
     camera pans the crowd of beautiful faces singing together
     among the crowd we see familiar faces

     we see the women who sang at 124
