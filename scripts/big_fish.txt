               we look down at the river where edwards reflection is caught 
               in the dark water as the water ripples past something 
               changes

               sure enough as we look up again its a younger edward bloom 
               20s staring into the water hes not just handsome not 
               just charming its as if all the forces of the natural world 
               had conspired to create him

                                     will vo
                         it doesnt always make sense and 
                         most of it never happened

               suddenly this edward thrusts both hands into the water 
               grabbing hold of

               the beast

               he brings the catfish up to his face looks it right in the 
               eye a beat then the beast spits out edwards gold ring

                                     will vo
                         but thats what kind of story this 
                         is

               smiling edward takes the ring then throws the beast back 
               into the water with a splash

               young dr bennett stands between the wifes legs shes 
               flustered and sweating but the doctor has a comforting 
               bedside manner

                                     young dr bennett
                         now mrs bloom ill need you to 
                         give me one good push on three 
                         one

               suddenly we hear a pop as a slimy mass of human being rockets 
               into the doctors unprepared hands bennett tries to hold 
               tight but the infant is slippery like a fish it shoots up 
               into air

               the nurses and the husband try to grab the baby but no one 
               can hold it as the newborn sails upward towards camera we 
               can see a giggling smile on its face

               as it falls the newborn knocks over a tray which provides 
               it a ramp to slide right out of the room everyone races 
               after it

               a nurse finally scoops up the slippery baby everyone lets

                         if only to eat misbehaving children 
                         and the occasional puppy who wanders 
                         into her yard witches use those 
                         bones to cast spells and curses that 
                         make the land infertile

               creepy house its broken windows strangling vines and eerie 
               gargoyles halfburied in the dirt even bats are afraid to 
               fly over it

                         said to contain mystical powers

                         i guess im saying id like to know

               the old woman turns leaning her face right in front of his 
               and on a silent count of one two three  edward looks 
               into the eye

               witnesses his death he stares transfixed perplexed and

               his future has something strange in store

                                     edward

                         bones and my bones couldnt keep up 
                         with my bodys ambition so i spent 
                         the better part of three years 
                         confined to my bed with the world

                         the way to the gs hoping to find 
                         an answer to my gigantificationism

                         it occurred to me then that perhaps 
                         the reason for my growth was that i 
                         was intended for larger things after

               theres no answer

                                     edward
                         my name is edward bloom i want to 
                         talk to you

               from deep in a cave a thunderous voice

                                     voice os
                         go away

               the giants voice has such force it blows edwards hair 
               back

                                     edward
                         im not going anywhere until you 
                         show yourself

               a beat then we hear a rumble like a train coming edward 
               braces himself fists ready for a fight if thats what its 
               going to take

               as the rumble gets louder the ground starts to shake even 
               edward starts to worry just how big is this guy

                                     edward vo
                         armed with the foreknowledge of my 
                         own death i knew the giant couldnt 
                         kill me all the same i preferred 
                         to keep my bones unbroken

               edward picks up a stone ready to play david to goliath

               then suddenly the giant bursts forth hunched over he slams 
               into a stunned edward knocking him halfway down the hill

               karl the giant is bigger than any man youve ever seen not 
               just tall but massive hes completely feral with a beard 
               to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered what remains 
               of his clothes are ragged and muddy god knows whats living 
               in his matted hair

               karl leans over edward blocking the sun edward throws his 
               rock but it just bounces off the giant didnt even notice 
               it

                                     karl
                         why are you here

               edward ponders the best response settling on

                                     edward
                         so you can eat me the town decided 
                         to send a human sacrifice and i 
                         volunteered

               karls eyes narrow confused edward stands up

                                     edward
                         my arms are a little stringy but 
                         theres some good eating on my legs 
                         i mean id be tempted to eat them 
                         myself
                              beat
                         so i guess just if you could get 
                         it over with quick because im not 
                         much for pain really

               edward closes his eyes hands at his side ready to be eaten 
               karl just stares at him not sure what to do

               after a beat edward opens his eyes a tiny bit just to see 
               what the giant is doing relieved to see hes not licking 
               his chops 

                                     edward
                         look i cant go back im a human 
                         sacrifice if i go back everyone 
                         will think im a coward and id 
                         rather be dinner than a coward

               karl sits down with a boom dejected

                                     edward
                         here start with my hand itll be 
                         an appetizer

               reaching up edward shoves his hand into karls mouth but 
               the giant spits it back out

                                     karl
                         i dont want to eat you i dont 
                         want to eat anybody its just i get 
                         so hungry im too big

               and thats the sad truth karl is less a monster than a freak  
               a giant man but in the end just a man

               edward takes a seat beside him

                                     edward
                         did you ever think maybe youre not 
                         too big maybe this towns just too 
                         small i mean look at it

               circling behind them we look down at ashton  a tiny town 
               in a tiny valley

                                     edward
                         hardly two stories in the whole place

                         got buildings so tall you cant even 
                         see the tops of em

                                     karl
                         really

                                     edward

                         a small town youre a big man you 
                         should be in the big city

               karl smiles but then it fades a certain sad suspicion 

                                     karl
                         youre just trying to get me to leave

                         certain size in a place like this

                                     edward
                         now first we gotta get you ready 
                         for the city

               ext river  day

               in a single shot karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers 
               while edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt

               ext main street of ashton  day

               spirits buoyed by the high school marching band all the 
               good citizens of ashton are gathered to see off edward and 
               karl

               theres a few tears amid the familiar faces

                                     mayor
                              loudly for the crowd
                         edward bloom first son of ashton 
                         its with a heavy heart we see you 
                         go but take with you this key to 
                         the city and know that any time you 
                         want to come back all our doors are 
                         open to you

               edward ducks a bit so the mayor can put the key around his 
               neck the crowd cheers and with that edward and karl start 
               walking waving as they go

               only don price smoking on the corner isnt sad to see edward 
               go he crushes his cigarette under his heel he wishes he 
               could crush edward

               many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug edward or 
               shake his hand

                                     edward vo
                         that afternoon as i left ashton 
                         everyone seemed to have advice

                                     various townfolk
                         find yourself a nice girl dont 
                         trust anyone in kentucky watch your 
                         pride edward bloom

                                     edward vo
                         but there was one person whose counsel 
                         i held above all others

               as the crowd parts he finds himself face to face with

               the old woman

               the ruckus slows and quiets as if a strange spell has been 
               cast she motions for edward to lean down so she can whisper 
               something to him although were very close we cant hear 
               her voice

                                     edward vo
                         she said that the biggest fish in 
                         the river gets that way by never 
                         being caught

               the advice only succeeds in confusing edward

                                     edward
                              to the old woman
                         okay thanks

               edward and karl keep walking the old woman shuffles off 
               somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded

                                     karl
                         what did she say

                                     edward
                         beats me

               ext road  day

               we tilt up from the road to reveal edward and karl walking 
               out of ashton each wears a backpack with all his earthly 
               possessions

                                     edward vo
                         there were two roads out of ashton 
                         a new one which was paved and an 
                         older one that wasnt people didnt 
                         use the old road anymore and it had 
                         developed the reputation of being 
                         haunted

               edward and karl come to a bend where the paved road veers 
               left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight the old road 
               is blocked with signs and warnings of danger

                                     edward vo
                         since i had no intention of ever 
                         returning to ashton this seemed as 
                         good a time as any to find out what 
                         lay down that old road

               karl looks at the dirt road wary

                                     karl
                         you know anyones whos taken it

                                     edward
                         that poet norther winslow did he 
                         was going to paris france he must 
                         have liked it because no one ever 
                         heard from him again
                              beat
                         tell you what you take the other 
                         way and ill cut through here meet 
                         you on the far side

               a little paranoid

                                     karl
                         youre not trying to run away

                                     edward
                         just to be sure you can take my 
                         pack

               karl perks up even though it means more for him to carry

               ext dirt road  day

               the road is overgrown but not altogether creepy the sun is 
               still shining and the birds still chirping

               spinning the key to the city edward whistles because its 
               a day meant for whistling

               ext further along  rough path

               the road has narrowed to a rough path spikes of sunlight 
               break through the thick canopy catching particles in the 
               air still edward whistles

               coming around a bend his pitch drops as he sees thick thorny 
               vines growing across the path he stops for the first time 
               he realizes the birds have stopped singing the forest is 
               dead quiet

               he looks back the way he came its tempting to go back it 
               would be easier to go back but edward presses on

               he carefully steps through the thorns his trouser legs catch 
               on the barbs we can hear the fabric tear

               further along

               a scratched and sweaty edward waves off various stinging 
               bugs flying at him finally whipping off his hat to swat at 
               them

               just then a cawing crow swoops down and grabs the hat right 
               out of his hands

                                     edward
                         you stupid sonofa

               he stops his swearing but grabs a rock and throws it the 
               stone ricochets off a tree and into a bees nest the swarm 
               roars out

               edward hightails it each step still precarious

               ext the dark forest  day later

               edward is bruised battered and beestung

               a halfbroken sign lies in the road edward picks it up 
               reads it

                                         warning

                                     jumping spiders

               sure enough up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with 
               thick cobwebs heavy from the rain

                                     edward vo
                         there comes a point where a reasonable 
                         man will swallow his pride and admit 
                         hes made a terrible mistake the 
                         truth is i was never a reasonable 
                         man

               edward tosses the sign and forges ahead into the spiderwebs

                         and what i recalled of sunday school 
                         was that the more difficult something 
                         became the more rewarding it was in 
                         the end

               edward emerges from the forest brushing the last cobwebs 
               off and shaking the spiders from his shirt one is stuck in 
               his sleeve and he has to dance to get it out even then he 
               still keeps twitching convinced another one is left behind

               at his feet the gravel road has returned smooth and dusty 
               and comforting

               ahead lies a tiny onestreet town  smaller even than ashton  
               with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it dangling 
               from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes their 
               laces tied together

               he passes a sign that reads welcome to spectre

               ext the town of spectre  day

               talbots five and dime als country store everything is 
               old but this isnt a ghost town in fact theres a group 
               of about 20 citizens spilling out to see edward approach 
               most are smiling there are even a few tears of joy

               a fortyyear old man named beamen comes out of the seed store 
               to greet edward friendly but a little drunk hes the closest 
               thing the town has to a mayor hes carrying a clipboard

               by the light of the full moon edward soaks his feet in the 
               water trying to make sense of it all the key to the city 
               dangles around his neck

               he stares at himself in the reflection he smiles

               its then that a woman emerges at the far side of the river

               no telling where she came from  she must have been swimming 
               underwater we never see her face

               she stands in the river with her bare back to edward 
               squeezing the water out of her golden hair oblivious to his 
               presence edward is breathless its the first woman hes 
               seen in her natural state and he doesnt dare move lest he 
               frighten her away

               then he sees the snake

               its a cottonmouth has to be it leaves a break in the water 
               its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh

               theres no decision to be made on pure instinct edward 
               dives in he swims as hard as can

               grabbing the snake

               just as its about to strike

               the woman dives back underwater understandably terrified 
               that a man is coming at her

                                     edward
                         no its okay i got it i got the 
                         snake

               as the splashing subsides edward looks at what he holds in 
               his hands which isnt a snake at all but rather a common 
               stick and a nonthreatening one at that

               while edward ponders his mistake he looks around to discover 
               that the girl in the river is gone he never even saw her 
               face

                                     edward
                         wait im sorry hello

               edward keeps expecting her to surface somewhere but she 
               never does he stands alone in the river wondering what

               given the day hes had so far edward isnt inclined to follow 
               up on the issue he starts to wade back to the bank

               complete chaos from farmer to bakers wife everyone wants 
               to dance with edward who finds himself tossed around like a 
               stick caught in a whirlpool still hes having a blast

               jenny grabs both his hands and they spin wildly

               beamen plucks his laughing daughter away to dance with her

               then mildred cuts in to dance with edward its hard to hear 
               over the music

                                     mildred
                         jenny thinks youre quite a catch 
                         we all do

                                     edward
                              not hearing

                                     mildred
                         i said youre quite a catch

               edward stops dancing a beat then he heads for the edge of 
               the crowd beamen is there with jenny on his shoulders

                                     edward
                         i have to leave tonight

                                     beamen
                         why

                                     edward
                         this town is everything a man could 
                         ask for and if i were to end up 
                         here id consider myself lucky but 
                         the fact is im not ready to end up 
                         anywhere

                                     beamen
                         no ones ever left

                                     jenny
                         how are you gonna make it without 
                         your shoes

                                     edward
                         i suspect it will hurt a lot

               and with that edward walks down main street the townspeople 
               stop dancing disbelieving some shaking their heads

               poor edward blooms gone crazy

                                     beamen
                              calling after him
                         you wont find a better place

                                     edward
                         i dont expect to

               jenny runs to him shed tackle him if she could

                                     jenny
                         promise me youll come back

                                     edward
                         i promise someday when im really 
                         supposed to

               its not good enough but it will have to do edward keeps 
               walking 

               ext the dark forest  night

               various shots edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet 
               its horrible almost unendurable

               and then it gets worse

               the trees ahead are moving at first it just seems to be 
               the wind blowing the branches but as we hear the wood 
               cracking and groaning theres no mistaking it theyre trying 
               to block him

               snakelike white roots shoot out of the ground grabbing for 
               his ankles he leaps up kicking off one tree trunk to grab 
               another ones branches he swings off lands and rolls now 
               all the trees are moving to block him their dark shapes 
               towering over him in the flashes of lightning

                                     edward vo
                         as difficult as it was to reach 
                         spectre i was fated to get there 
                         eventually after all no man can 
                         avoid reaching the end of his life

               as he ducks under branches the chain holding the key to the 
               city gets caught hes almost strangled but the chain finally 
               breaks the silver key disappears into the mud

               scrambling forward he looks for a way out but the trees 
               have encircled him their spiky crowns bending down to crush 
               him

               he screams up at the night until his breath is gone

                                     edward
                         and then i realized this wasnt the 
                         end of my life

               with a sudden calm

                                     edward
                              aloud
                         this isnt how i die

               another lightning flash and suddenly the trees are back 
               where theyve always been edward is lying shoeless and torn 
               in a muddy puddle staring up at the rain and laughing

               ext the road  day

               his bare foot steps onto asphalt

                                     a deep voice
                         friend

               edward turns to see

               karl

               to his right coming down the larger paved road

                                     karl
                         what happened to your shoes

               edward looks down at his muddy bloody feet

                                     edward
                         they got ahead of me

               with that the men start walking down the larger road

                                                              crossfade to

               int dining room  night

               edward and will sit at opposite ends of the table with sandra 
               and josephine in the middle although edward has a small 
               plate of food in front of him he hasnt touched it hes 
               exhausted from the trip downstairs but determined to maintain 
               the family dinner ritual

               the other three eat awkwardly each clink and scrape of a 
               knife or fork resonating will finally breaks the silence

                                     will
                         i dont know if youve seen it but 
                         josephine has some photos in the 
                         most recent newsweek

                                     sandra

               a beat as will scoops out another serving of potatoes edward 
               suddenly speaks

                         i dont know if youre aware of this 
                         josephine but african parrots in 
                         their native home of the congo  
                         they speak only french

               all three stop to listen

                                     josephine
                              amused

                         youre lucky to get four words out 
                         of them in english but if you were 
                         to walk through the jungle youd 
                         hear them speaking the most elaborate 
                         french those parrots talk about 
                         everything politics movies fashion

               carries herself like a much younger woman with blue jeans 
               and sneakers

               she accidentally makes eye contact with will as he passes 
               we hold on the woman who tracks will as he reaches sandra 
               its hard to read her reaction does she recognize him or 
               just find him attractive

               will notices the gaze the woman turns away

               will racks his brain  does he know this woman

               semicasually noticing that both will and sandra are looking 
               she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave

                                     sandra

               the cashier turns to look he can only get a profile as the 
               woman leaves

                                     cashier

               radio on the nightstand is playing a callin am sports show 
               just a wash of background chatter edward lies asleep on his 
               back

               at the window josephine quietly lowers the shade she reaches 
               over edward to switch off the radio he stirs from the silence  
               he wasnt fully asleep  and sees josephine stretched over 
               him

                                     edward
                              playfully lecherous
                         hello

               she smiles

                                     josephine

                         i woke up my parents they told me 
                         it was just a dream to go back to 
                         bed but the next morning my aunt 
                         stacy was dead

                                     josephine

                                     edward

                         me young boy with that kind of power 
                         wasnt three weeks later that the 
                         crow came back to me in a dream and 
                         said your grampa is going to die 
                         well i ran right back to my parents 
                         my father said no gramps is fine 
                         but i could see there was trepidation 
                         and true enough that next morning 
                         my grampa was dead

               he sits up a bit in bed his strength returning

                                     edward
                         for the next couple weeks i didnt 
                         have another dream until one night 
                         the crow came back and said your 
                         daddy is going to die
                              beat

                         finally i told my father and he 
                         said not to worry but i could tell 
                         he was rattled that next day he 
                         wasnt himself always looking around 
                         waiting for something to drop on his 
                         head because the crow didnt tell 
                         how it was going to happen just 
                         those words your daddy is going to 
                         die well he went into town early 
                         and was gone for a long time and 
                         when he finally came back he looked 
                         terrible like he was waiting for 
                         the axe to fall all day he said to 
                         my mother good god i just had the 
                         worst day of my life

                         she said this morning the milkman 
                         dropped dead on the porch josephine 
                         smiles a halflaugh which gets him 
                         smiling too

               a long beat then deadpan

                                     edward
                         because see my mother was banging 
                         the milkman

                                     edward
                         he was slipping her a little extra 
                         cream

               she nods a bit more of a laugh

                                     edward
                         he was filling her basket he was 
                         making deliveries around back

               as edward continues she cant help but laugh harder 
               especially as the metaphors get more vulgar

                                     edward
                         he was buttering her rolls pumping 
                         her churn splashing milk in her 
                         box

                                     josephine
                         stop

                                     edward
                         they were squeezing the cheese 
                         clanking the bottles licking the 
                         popsicle

               shes starting to cry from laughing

                                     edward
                         cracking the eggs and making an 
                         omelet

               with that he stops she regains her composure

                                     edward
                         spooning the sherbet

                                     josephine
                              interrupting

                                     edward

               he rolls his eyes why not

               josephine leaves heading down the hall to get her camera 
               we stay with edward in bed

                                     josephine os

                         and my father i had an extra print 
                         made

               edward grimaces a flash of pain around others hes hiding 
               how much it hurts but alone we can see how bad it is

               he controls his breathing trying to push through it

                                     josephine
                         i want to see pictures of your 
                         wedding ive never seen any

               she returns with her camera edward smiles doing a good job 
               masking the pain

                                     edward
                         thats because we didnt have a

                         told it all wrong anyway all the 
                         facts and none of the flavor

                                     josephine
                         oh so this is a tall tale

                         well its not a short one

               a devilish smile pushing past edward we settle on the 
               whirling fan

                                                              match cut to

               spinning pinwheel

               held by a little boy hes slumped over his fathers shoulder 
               being carried towards a bigtop tent we are

               ext olympia circus  night

               where the secondrate carnival is parked for the moment 
               in an alabama field to the left we spot edward 20ish 
               halfway through a bag of peanuts hes still carrying the 
               backpack we saw earlier and scratched up from his trip 
               through spectre

                                     edward vo
                         i had just left ashton and was on 
                         my way to discover my destiny not 
                         knowing what that would be exactly 
                         i explored every opportunity that 
                         presented itself

               joining the crowd he heads into the bigtop

               int big top  night

               a troupe of stiltwalking firebreathers finishes their act 
               to tremendous applause

               as the performers clear away the circus ownerandringmaster 
               amos calloway 50 approaches the stands he may only be 
               four feet tall but amos has a titanic presence

                                     amos
                         ladies and gentlemen you may think 
                         youve seen the unusual you may 
                         think youve seen the bizarre but 
                         ive travelled to the five corners 
                         of the world and let me tell you 
                         ive never seen anything like this

               from behind amos carnies start rolling a massive ball towards 
               the crowd

                                     amos
                         when i found this man he was picking 
                         oranges in florida his fellow workers 
                         called him el penumbra  the shadow  
                         because when you were working beside 
                         him he blocked out the daylight he 
                         could take a whole tree in his hands 
                         and shake off the fruit i had to 
                         pay his crew boss 10000 just so i 
                         could take him with me

               amos comes up to a middleaged woman in the first row a 
               quieter moment

                                     amos
                         not to alarm you maam but if this 
                         man wanted to he could crush your 
                         head between his toes
                              she trembles
                         but he wont
                              a long beat
                         hes not going to hurt her folks 
                         because hes our own gentle giant 
                         ladies and gentlemen i give you 
                         colossus

               the carnies back away from the ball as a deep drum roll 
               begins a moment then the ball starts to bulge from inside

               a foot suddenly bursts out from within gasps from the crowd 
               that foot is massive in the stands edward looks closer 
               intrigued

               as the drum beat intensifies a second foot breaks out 
               followed by hands shoulders finally the head this is 
               colossus

               from a very low angle we look up to see just how massive he 
               is he seems to fill the heavens with his shaved head and 
               giant club he seems more ogre than man

               in the bandstands a young boys jaw drops in awe colossus 
               walks down the row letting the crowd get a better look at 
               him some reach out to touch him disbelieving a tight 
               spotlight follows him revealing faces in the crowd

               colossus passes edward who seems unimpressed he leans with 
               the spotlight whistling to get the big mans attention

               he points to the edge of the stands where his friend is 
               sitting on the dirt 

               karl the giant

               stands up so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold 
               him hes a good foot taller than colossus theres a gasp 
               from the crowd along with nervous anticipation  what will 
               happen next

               angle on amos stunned megaphone dangling

               angle on colossus realizing the gig is up with a resigned 
               shrug he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into 
               the shadows

                                                                    cut to

               int bigtop  night  later

               as the stands empty edward and karl talk to amos

                                     amos
                         whats his name does he talk its 
                         not important

                                     amos
                         tell me karl have you ever heard of 
                         the term involuntary servitude

               karl shakes his head

                                     amos
                         unconscionable contract

               shes wearing a blue dress and hat for no good reason she 
               looks back at edward

               the two make eye contact and as they do all motion freezes

               spilled box of popcorn hangs in midair each kernel like a 
               snowflake even the elephant is midpoop

                         but not her name and not where to 
                         find her

               not just that theres moaning coming from inside

               suddenly the rocking and moaning stop a beat then the 
               door handle begins to rattle it seems to be stuck

               edward turns the knob

               suddenly the door bursts open edward is knocked down by a 
               massive black dog biggest youve ever seen it has green 
               glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue

               edward wrestles with the beast its mouth snapping at his 
               throat 

               blocking with an arm edward tries to push himself free but 
               the creatures hands  it has hands instead of paws  hold 
               on tight

               entwined they roll across the dirt the other nearby carnies 
               scatter for cover mr soggybottom pulls a revolver out of 
               his clown suit loads a silver bullet

               edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off he rolls 
               to his feet

               the hell hound squares back on its haunches growling ready 
               for another leap mr soggybottom sheds a clown tear aiming 
               the revolver at the dog

               at the last moment

                                     edward
                         no wait

               edward in the shoulder knocking him down

               the carnies gasp

               licking its chops the dog approaches the helpless edward 
               who feels the ground around him looking for some kind of 
               weapon he finds only a small stick he waves it at the dog 
               ready to strike it

               like magic the dogs whole demeanor changes it bounces 
               excitedly ready to play fetch

               seeing an opportunity edward throws the stick as far as he 
               can the dog bounds after it

               smashing down three cars

               it returns a beat later with the flaming stick which it 
               drops at edwards feet its tail whips back and forth

                         it was that night i discovered that 
                         most things you consider evil or 
                         wicked are simply lonely and lacking 
                         in the social niceties

               edward throws the stick again the dog takes off in a new 
               direction

               a chinese ventriloquist is on stage with his communist puppet 
               we have no idea what theyre saying to each other but every 
               act is fundamentally the same

               the emcee comes on to usher him off the stage before hes 
               finished the ventriloquist protests but finally gives in 
               the emcee makes a shoot him in the neck motion to one of 
               the armed guards offstage

               he cant steer hes helpless

               but then a blast of fireworks from the sides of the stage 
               the lights go out as a drum roll begins its just enough 
               cover for edward to remain unseen

               he lands with a clang on the lighting catwalk above the stage 
               he barely grabs on disconnecting his chute just as the 
               curtain goes up edward looks out at the sea of excited 
               soldiers every one of them would kill him hes the legless

               the two men begin to scuffle

               music starts a vampy torch song ping sings melody while an 
               offstage voice carries perfect harmony

               fight knocking the guard out with a right hook

               as ping and jing reach the last chorus they strike a final 
               pose in the shape of a heart their arms forming the arches 
               their backs forming the curves

               a black car pulls up two army officers get out

                                     edward vo
                         and so it was no surprise that the 
                         army believed i was dead

               hearing the news sandra cries out the pain of her shout 
               makes church bells ring

               ext behind the templeton house  day

               sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines forming a 
               tunnel of fabric

                                     edward vo
                         after four months sandra had gotten 
                         over the worst of the nightmares 
                         when the phone rang she didnt think 
                         it was somehow me calling her when 
                         a car drove past she didnt get up 
                         to check out the window

               pulling a dress out of the basket sandra looks up to see

               a mans silhouette

               on the sheet in front of her she freezes watching the shadow 
               ripple across the white fabric blowing so softly in the 
               breeze she knows it cant be him hes dead

               she turns away with all the strength she can gather she 
               hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket

               looking up she sees not a shadow but edward himself standing 
               before her she gasps disbelieving but his hand is real 
               it is destiny

               without another moments hesitation she kisses him

                                                              crossfade to

               bright sunlight

               filters through soft sheets were under the covers where a 
               mans hand traces the curves of a womans bare back a beat 
               then she turns over in bed revealing her to be

               josephine

               she blinks slowly just waking up will is watching her

               to the outside

                         you have to understand when i was 
                         growing up he was gone more than he 
                         was here and i started thinking  
                         maybe he has a second life somewhere 
                         else with another house another 
                         family he leaves us he goes to 
                         them or maybe there is no family 
                         maybe he never wanted a family but 
                         whatever it is maybe he likes that 
                         second life better and the reason 
                         he tells all those stories is because 
                         he cant stand this boring place

                                     josephine

                         you could say about edward bloom 
                         its that he was a social person 
                         and people took a liking to him one 
                         night he was returning from three

               no choice edward stops the car puts on the handbrake just 
               as suddenly the sound changes  no longer pounding but

                         they only had edwards words to

                         he sold them on the dream

                         you can structure it as a historical 
                         trust but youll need every 
                         contiguous piece of property its

                         not asked to leave or pay rent or 
                         anything they were just asked to 
                         keep doing as they were doing in 
                         that way he could make sure the

               in the distance he sees a shack so old its nearly fallen 
               he walks toward it the marshy ground squishing up around 
               his feet soaking the hems of his trousers

               we hear a piano playing from inside the shack edward knocks 
               on the halfhung door which swings open by itself

               the inside is nicer than youd think a real home a fire 
               burns in the stove and curtains hang in the windows

               with her back turned to him jenny hill plays the piano 
               edward doesnt recognize her as the little girl who used to 
               have a crush on him without turning she says

               jenny stops playing her piece not quite finished she turns 
               to face him edward still doesnt recognize her

                                     jenny

                         buy a town

               he looks at her puzzled and surprised no one has really 
               asked before

                                     edward

               edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves but it 
               breaks off in his hands its not the clean exit he was hoping 
               for

               inside jenny looks out surprised and annoyed

               edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges but they 
               snap off the door frame buckles and the whole shack creaks

                                     edward
                         im sorry

               he tries to lean the door against the frame but it keeps 
               slipping

                                     jenny
                         its okay just leave it

               he leans the door a different way it holds for a beat then 
               falls in smashing a small table

                                     edward

               finally backs away turns and heads back towards his car

               we stay on jenny watching him go shes furious but theres 
               something more in her feelings for him something softer

                         most men in that situation would 
                         accept their failure and move on

                         as the months passed he found more 
                         and more things to fix until the 
                         shack no longer resembled itself

               edward and karl cut down a tree letting in a flood of light

               through the golden pollen hanging in the air we rise up to 
               see the shack is now

               the lovely house

               we saw before its tiny and white with black shutters and

               and watching him with deepest affection

                                     edward
                         of course the best part was creating 
                         new material by the time the twins 
                         and i got to havana we had a whole 
                         new routine worked out for them 
                         with just a ukulele and a harmonica

               finished with his work he takes his hat off the chair and 
               hangs it on the rack perfect

               a beat a look between them with that last job done theres 
               no reason for him to be staying any longer

               hand lifting his hat up to the peg shes very close  
               just a halfinch from kissing him when

                         on business in wichita you were 
                         born a week early but there were no 
                         complications it was a perfect 
                         delivery now your father was sorry 
                         to miss it but it wasnt the custom 
                         for the men to be in the room for 
                         deliveries then so i cant see as

                         suppose if i had to choose between 
                         the true version and an elaborate 
                         one involving a fish and a wedding 
                         ring i might choose the fancy

               to see shes already standing in the river beside them

               the reflection of the light off the water gives sandra an 
               unearthly glow shes more tranquil and more beautiful than 
               weve ever seen her

               as the kiss ends edward tries to pull off his wedding ring 
               but its stuck finally he sucks on it pulling it free 
               with his teeth

               a look to will a smile with a glint of gold will takes the 
               ring out of his mouth

               edward suddenly drops out of wills arms with a splash for 
               hes no longer a man but rather

               a fat catfish

               swimming at his feet

               we watch as the catfish circles then heads for deeper water 
               disappearing

               will and his mother stand kneedeep in the water watching 
               edward bloom swim away into the sunlight josephine is back 
               on the shore along with the entire crowd

               music builds to a climax then

               down the river a giant fish suddenly jumps out of the water 
               cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset it then dives 
               back under with a splash

                                                         crossfade back to

               edward smiles proud of both of them his eyes are so pale 
               and so open we can almost see his soul in every atom of 
               his body in every thought edward bloom is entirely happy
