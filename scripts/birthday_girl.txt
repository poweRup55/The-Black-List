               in a russian summer meadow a young girl spins around and 
               around a simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches 
               her hair around her neck is a pair of field binoculars and 
               she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face 
               spying butterflies birds rabbits she reaches the top of a 
               hillock and jumps into the air and flies up into the sky 
               we float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up 
               up into the sun

                                                       fade through sun to

               an aerial shot of the rolling english countryside nothing 
               but fields and trees for miles the shot describes a panorama 
               before looking directly down at the earth and we begin to 
               move

               we fly low over a field a ditch and straight out over six 
               lanes of motorway cars and lorries tear below at a hundred 
               miles an hour we fly over the hard shoulder to another field 
               beyond

               we descend on two young boys in the field a pornographic 
               magazine is spread out of the flattened grass one of the 
               boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick 
               up we begin to move again across the field over a path 
               and into a suburban garden

               we fly over five or six gardens over a barbecue over 
               children splashing in a pool over a woman sunbathing a man 
               mowing his lawn a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden 
               trampoline to arrive on the patio of john buckingham he 
               walks out onto the patio where he sits in a chair facing 
               his house setting down a mug of tea

                                                                    cut to

                         literally of course i suppose i 
                         only say this because i always thought 
                         people who did this sort of thing 
                         were i had an image that they 
                         were losers not losers a bit sad 
                         but i think this is the modern world 
                         and i think really its quite a brave 
                         move quite a brave reasonable thing 
                         to do

               russian some of which is subtitled some speak in english 
               the women slide on and off the screen overlap and collide 
               as the titles appear closeups on mouths and eyes tight 
               and pixellated it becomes a wall of image and sound

               the arrivals gate slides open and passengers flood through 
               john stands among the chauffeurs and cab drivers as the 
               passengers trundle by

               we follow one young woman long enough to think this must be 
               her but its a false alarm shes lifted up and spun around 
               by someone else

               theyve all passed thats that she wasnt on the flight

               john wanders away from the gate he stands about in the swirl 
               in the middle of the airport people bustle by everyone 
               going somewhere

               gradually we get the sense we are being watched a woman 
               stands nearby she is about twenty very beautiful tired 
               and laden with luggage

               suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the 
               speeding car john panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder 
               amidst loud horn blasts

               ext hard shoulder  day

               john navigates his way round the rover in the rain to find 
               her kneeling on the verge throwing up he puts a hand on 
               her shoulder but she stands up quickly maintaining an icy 
               dignity considering what has just happened

               ext johns close  day

               news

               we see alexeis face over her shoulder behind her back 
               unreadable behind his back she rubs her wrists

               int bathroom  night

               some hours later its dark outside john still tied to the 
               bidet the door opens a crack and somebody slips inside we 
               hear the toilet seat go down as his eyes adjust he can dimly 
               see nadia sitting on the toilet she doesnt look at him as 
               she finishes she finally turns and holds his eye she stands 
               and slips out the door leaving him alone

               ext dual carriageway  night

               cars crawl by on the road outside their taillights 
               stretching over the hill

               the shot processes and fades into dawn and light

               the early morning commuters now use the carriageway

               int bathroom  day

               bright sunlight pours through a high window john is still 
               on the toilet he begins to try to struggle free

               after a great deal of fierce deadpan shimmying and pulling 
               he succeeds in loosening his bindings freeing an arm he 
               yanks the duct tape from his mouth and sits there panting

               the first thing he does is take a pee then he drinks handfuls 
               of water he catches his reflection but cant look at himself

               int main room  day

               john collapses in an armchair rubbing his eyes he looks 
               shattered

               the russians have gone

               int motel bathroom  day

               john in the shower just standing there letting the water 
               hit him

               int motel main suite  day

               john dries himself in silence he pulls on his trousers 
               sits down to do his socks one sock on he walks to the 
               smaller bedroom he opens the door and peers inside

               int smaller motel bedroom  day

               tied to the radiator gagged with duct tape is nadia

               john looks down at her she looks away as her eyes fill with 
               tears

               he sits on the bed facing her they stay like that for a 
               long moment before he reaches over and starts untying her 
               knots he peels the tape off her mouth suddenly he slaps 
               her across the face

               her head hits the radiator nadia gasps hard from the shock 
               of the blow without warning she slaps his face equally 
               hard

               this starts a long silent fight kicking hitting biting a 
               real struggle

               its intensity is almost sexual but has the edge of real 
               violence they end up on opposite sides of the room both 
               panting hurt and beaten

               john lies there on the floor panting and he hears the 
               english words

               exhausted john stands wipes his mouth and rushes her anew 
               nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear 
               the whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has 
               the strength to go on nadia staggers into the bathroom where 
               she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably john 
               lies on the bed listening to her cry

               his coffee and puts it down he begins speaking very calmly

                         problems of a great many individuals 
                         this took a lot of understanding and 
                         sympathy to try to work out solutions 
                         to their problems but you see im

                         observers capacity it seemed you 
                         two were getting on pretty fucking

               the window soon a big tear rolls down her cheek she starts 
               to cry

               john glances up from his map but ignores it but she keeps 
               crying he tosses the map in the back pulls the car to the 
               side of the road and switches off the engine as nadia cries 
               john gazes impassively out of the window this goes on for 
               almost a minute until nadia pulls herself together when 
               without looking across john restarts the engine and pulls 
               away

               john thinks it looks as if hes going to tell the whole 
               story in the end he shrugs

                                     nadia
                         listen its definitely a fox now 
                         im scared

               they listen to the fox crying in the night

                                     nadia
                         you know you can come under the 
                         blanket

                                     john
                         its alright

               the scene from birds eye view john lies back and stares at 
               the stars nadia curls up on the other side of the fire and 
               hugs herself

               we push down closer and closer until we are on johns face 
               the theme returns

               the cricket boys from johns close stand in a line in the 
               middle of the street bathed in flashing blue light we pan 
               round and end on johns house

               it is surrounded with police

               police cars police vans plastic police tape police line 
               do not cross

               johns neighbours press against the tape as officers come 
               and go

               inside the house is full of police ransacking his possessions 
               and dusting fingerprints a policeman is standing reading 
               the englishrussian dictionary

               we push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room

               an officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the 
               bed he then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points 
               them out to a detective they exchange a knowing grin a 
               photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a 
               blinding flash

               the birthday cake is there half eaten a policewoman puts 
               it in a baggy

               we pan across the bed across the magazines and underwear in 
               plastic bags down below the bed where we find the photograph 
               of nadia with the binoculars

               the young girl smiles hopefully out at us from the past

               early dawn a woodpigeon coos john wakes up next to the 
               dead fire nadia is gone

               ext forest slope  stream  day

               john slides down a rocky slope he scans the forest but 
               theres noone around he hurries through high bracken then 
               stops suddenly by a large oak

               ext stream  day

               in a pool in a stream below nadia is washing herself she 
               has her back to us

               john watches her for a moment before his eyes avert and 
               his head bows

               ext field  day

               a shimmering sun a giant combine harvester cuts a wide swathe 
               through a field of high corn as it passes we find john and 
               nadia coming towards us through the heat haze

               they arent speaking and both look tired as they pass we 
               crane up out of the corn to catch an enormous 757 jumbo jet 
               just above us coming into land we pan round to see half a 
               mile away the massive airport beyond

               they walk towards it two tiny figures

                                                                    cut to

               is a folded note marked john john holds it in his hands  
               slowly deliberately he screws it up and drops it in the 
               case like a bin

               through the binoculars passengers crisscross but we find 
               nadia sitting alone waiting for her call

               john lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport he 
               raises them for one last look

               we watch alexei approach her she looks up and is completely 
               thrown

               yuri stands about ten feet away in shades

               alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away

               and yells back but something alexei says seems to melt her

               he holds her face and kisses it she turns her face he 
               tries again and this time she accepts the kiss slowly she 
               kisses him back

               there she finds what she is looking for alexeis hunting

               blackness john drops down holds his breath

               john scrambles back to the previous window with real effort

               nadia stands alone holding her unlit cigarette thinking 
               she looks at the two guitar cases at her feet she looks 
               across at john anxiously drumming on the ticket sales

               he glances at nadia then looks at the young airport official 
               the blood beating in his ears

               for a few interminable seconds the officials eyes burn into 
               john john turns to nadia and holds her gaze

                                     john

               behind him as they round the corner she hands him a case

               they walk side by side without speaking

               both look forward straightfaced as it both are thinking 
               about what it is that they are actually doing john looks 
               back once but he keeps walking he looks across at nadia 
               but she doesnt look back

               with a deafening roar an aeroflot boeing 757 lifts slowly 
               from the runway and climbs up into the night sky where it 
               becomes a distant star

               a distant aeroplane in a cobalt blue sky through binoculars

               the young girl from the very first scene lowers the binoculars 
               and lets them hang around her neck she squints up at the 
               sun

               a voice calls her

                                     womans voice
