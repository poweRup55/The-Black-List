                                             november 1987






a black screen

various voices  big six thats six the hard way
                 seven or eleven play two

fade in

ext  upper east side  new york city  night

one of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the
garbage seems gift wrapped  the voices continue over as
we move in on a particular building where a doorman is
holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle

the voices continue  hit me double down let it
ride hit me anymore for the come out
card

in contrast to the outside of this sedate quiet
brownstone we go inside to find


int  brownstone apartment

 a miniature las vegas complete with music drinks
tuxedoed dealers and croupiers  roulette craps black
jack  wall to wall people  the fact that casino gambling
happens to be illegal in new york doesnt stop these
connecticut slummers hollowcheek nightlifers and junior
wiseguys from having a good time

at the card table

nick conklin holding a dollar cigar is trying to pull a
winning hand  in his late thirties nick has the sort of
quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate
his moe ginsburg rentatux is too tight his ruffled
shirt out of date nick could care less

two other players are still in the game  one of them is a
lithe debutante surrounded by an entourage of giggling
friends and tuxedoed men  the pot is huge

nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot

                         nick
          one and one on top

                         dealer
          house sees

                         player one
                  hesitates
          im out

disgusted he throws down his cards

its down to nick and the debutante  the cocky deb gives
nick a long look confident she can win

                         debutante
                  her eyes still on
                   nick
          i see the deuce and one to chase
          them home

she throws her chips on the pot  nick hesitates then
decides to match it

                         nick
          call

                         debutante
                  showing her hand
          ladies aces wired  sorry sport

nick turns over his cards jacks and tens not good enough
to win  elated the deb gets up from the table and joins
her giggling friends  nick walks over to her

                         nick
          very nice barbie
                  pointing toward her
                   boyfriend
          now id take ken over there and go
          home

                         debutante
          whys that

                         nick
          its time  thats all

                         boyfriend
          the lady wants to play  someone
          should teach you to be a better
          loser loser

                         nick
          listen ken 

                         boyfriend
          my name is not ken 

                         nick
           im offering you the benefit of
          my experience

                         debutante
          looks like you have a lot of
          experience in places like this  it
          was nice of them to relax the dress
          code for you

that draws a laugh from her friends  the entourage heads
for the bar

charlie skloaris twentythree steps in front of the
debutante blocking her path

she steps to the side  charlie steps with her  charlies
pushing it hes always pushing it  shes not amused
finally charlie lets her pass  he comes up to nick

                         charlie
          typical new york woman big
          attitude small apartment no tits

only two things count to charlie  his job and his women
but not necessarily in that order

                         charlie
          i think she got to you pappy

                         nick
                  checking his watch
          you want a popsicle go to good
          humor  and dont call me pappy

                         charlie
                  glancing at the
                   door
          still you gotta wonder how shed
          look in handcuffs

nick wary eyes this kid  charlie shrugs spreads his
arms defensively  the sound of pounding on the front
door

the door

splinters  the bouncer steps back as four helmeted
emergency service officers  the first members of the
raiding party  rush in

pandemonium  people rush for the exit  any exit

at the bar

nick and charlie hold up their glasses

                         nick
                  calmly
          alley oop

they down their drinks then set them down

charlie pulls out the binaca offering nick a spritz but
nick is already pulling out his police badge and hanging
it around his neck  charlie quickly follows suit

a half dozen cops

line the patrons up against the wall  the asst da
patty zachara climbs onto the crap table  a petite
nervous woman patty has dressed in a channel suit for the
occasion

                         zachara
          settle down  hey quiet please

not a prayer

                         nick
          shut the hell up goddamnit

that quiets them

                         nick
          my name is conklin  lets do this
          fast so i can go home

zachara annoyed looks at nick

                         nick
                  softer
          its all yours

                         zachara
                  reads
          under section 216 of the new york
          state penal code i serve notice
          that this premise and its
          occupants

nick

catches the debutantes eye across the room  she smiles
at him he was right  he shrugs spreads his hands
thats life

a well groomed middle aged man who well come to know as
cavello suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against
the wall

charlie spins around to stop him 

                         charlie
          whoa  where do you think youre
          going hotdog

cavello butts him with his head sending charlie to the
floor  then crosses his arms in front of his face and
plunges through the window

nick not missing a beat gives a small sigh as he
follows

                         nick
                  sighs
          fabulous

he takes off after him


ext  street upper east side  night

nick short of breath chases cavello down the residential
street past the dogwalkers past the doormen past the
furcoated women climbing out of taxies unfortunately
cavello has a good half block on him

from nowhere charlie blasts past leaving nick a half
block behind silently cursing his age

at the corner

a limo jerks to a halt and cavello jumps in  the limo
streaks away

charlie

turns to see nick hands on knees gasping for air

                                            cut to

int  locker room  two eight precinct  night

now in their street clothes charlie and nick stand in
front of the mirrors  charlie is working his brush and
hair dryer as if his life depended on it  nick in
contrast shoves his hair back with his fingers and
glowers at himself in the mirror

                         charlie
                  over the dryer
           its not like you were slow or
          anything i think you did just
          fine  i think you did great

                         nick
          thanks

nick turns to leave

                         charlie
          hey hey where you goin

                         nick
          home


ext  police parking lot  night

nick strides out the door  charlie hurries after him

                         charlie
          wait up  you know the guy who did
          the weismuller through the window 

                         nick
           cavello  ronnie cavello

charlie trails nick to his motorcycle  a harley hog
complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks  the
bike is held together with tape and baling wire

                         charlie
          you know him

nick tries to kickstart this behemoth but its not easy

                         nick
          he works for frank abolofia
          atlantic city  casinos

                         charlie
          so why dive through the glass for a
          nickel and dime bust

charlie puts his foot up on nicks fender to tie his shoe
nick spotting an ankle holster peeking from charlies
sock grabs charlies foot  charlie teeters

                         nick
          whats this

                         charlie
          let go

nick pulls out a beretta 32

                         charlie
          backup

                         nick
          get rid of it

                         charlie
          why

                         nick
          its not regulation  and the only
          way youre gonna stop anybody with
          it is to show it to him and while
          hes laughing you can shove it down
          his throat

                         charlie
                  looking at nicks
                   bike
          ill get rid of it when you get rid
          of the eggbeater

the harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke
nick puts on his paintflecked helmet slides down some
ski goggles

                         charlie
          nick lets go hunting  bag
          cavello

                         nick
          charlie

nick pops the bike into gear

                         nick
           you still got shaving cream on
          your ear

nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke


ext  belt parkway  verrazano bridge  night

we find nick a lonely solitary figure bobbing in and out
of the lights and shadows  the sound of wind whips
through his helmet cold air stings his cheeks the tail
lights of nicks bike disappear into the night


ext  suburban street  staten island  night

civil service heaven  nick hits the cut switch and glides
past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this
development  a basketball net in every driveway a buick
or chrysler in every garage

one house sticks out  the lawn is brown paint is peeling
off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the
driveway  nick glides once around the cul de sac looking
at the house  his house  its as inviting as an open
grave  he shoots away


int  el greco diner  staten island  night

a hanger sized roadhouse wall to wall red velvet

nicks the sole figure at the counter coffee and the
daily news in front of him  a nurse walks in and sits
down a half dozen seats away  nick look up

          give me a break would you

                         connie
          if you give me one

nick kisses her  the first suggestion of real affection
the sound of someone knocking on the door  reluctantly
they stop  connie gets up and puts on her robe

                         nick
          are you expecting anyone

                         connie
          i wasnt expecting you

she disappears down the hallway  we hear the door open
then telling someone to wait

                         connie
                  poking her head in
                   the room
          imagine a small greasy boy scout

int  connies apartment

nick wearing only his pants is doing a slow burn
charlie is holding his hands up defensively

                         charlie

                         nick
           hey i got a better chance of
          being hit by a bus then moving up

charlie looks away momentarily letting it slide  he
knows hes on sensitive ground

                         charlie
           look they told me at the
          greeks you were here  im sorry i

          i like her  shes nice
                  lowering his voice
          for her age

the bedroom door opens  connie enters dumps nicks
clothes on the couch tosses his gun on top of the pile
without a word she goes back inside and slams the door
behind her

nick pissed slowly turns to face charlie  charlie
shrugs  nicks got nothing better to do than go

int  lime house  chinatown  night

the lime house is a little piece of italy in the heart of
chinatown and tonight its packed  any selection on the
jukebox that isnt frank sinatra is jerry vale  behind
the bar are two fat brothers  one pours drinks the other
dishes out scungilli  its three am  its always three

at the back table

our man cavello is unloading steaming scungilli onto an
already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
japanese man  the japanese man in his midfifties wears
a gray suit and not a strand of his jet black hair is out
of place

a japanese translator doing his best to translate
cavellos heavily accented english sits between them

at the bar

charlie is looking straight ahead afraid cavello might
peg him  nick is at ease

                         charlie
          what are they doing now

                         nick

charlie trying to relax gestures toward his foot

                         charlie
          whatdaya think  bostonians
          eightyfive bucks
                  lowering his voice
          girls go for shoes  second place
          they look
                  off nicks
                   reaction
          hey i read it in a magazine

nicks attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door

                         nick
                  dead serious
          charlie dont do anything  promise
          me

                         charlie
          what

what they see  two bodyguards are making a quick sweep of
the bar  frank abolofia s stocky man with silver grey
hair sweeps in behind them  abolofia has mitts like a
meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure  a heavyweight
mafioso

                         nick
          frank abolofia

                         charlie
          the wolf

abolofia walks to cavellos table  all rise and shake
hands  the two hitters take seats at the bar  the two
brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests

                         nick
                  in a whisper
          some party

                         charlie
          maybe we should do something

                         nick
          charlie take your gum stick it
          under your ass and keep it warm

nick turns away resumes his drink

nicks pov in the mirror behind the bar  two new japanese
men step in the door  early twenties spiky hair dark
versace suits

number one

wears tortoise shell shades  he coolly checks out the
room then nods to 

number two

who pulls a spas 12 automatic shotgun from under his
coat and spits out three rounds  a window shatters
everyone hits the floor

number one

slowly walks toward cavellos table

number two

covers the floor  abolofias bodyguards show their empty
hands

nick and charlie

on the floor  they dont have the artillery for this guy
either

at the table

our japanese businessman knows these people  he eyes them
contemptuously

abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
philosophical about it  he stops chewing  a tiny
hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
precipitous action

                         number one
                  in japanese
          give it to me

the japanese businessman looking straight ahead  a long
silent pause then still not facing him

                         businessman
                  in japanese
          go to hell

number one slips his fingers beneath his shades massaging
his eyes  in a flash he pulls a shuto from under his
coat  the 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube

he presses the tip of the blade against the businessmans
throat

charlie

his hand close around the grip of the beretta  he unsnaps
the ankle holster  the snap can be heard across the room
nicks hand closes around charlies and squeezes till the
knuckles turn white

                         charlie
                  in a whisper
          what are you doing

                         nick
          saving your life

number two

levels the scattergun at nick and charlie

at the table  number one

calmly holds the blade at the mans throat as he reaches
into the mans jacket and removes a small rectangular
plasticwrapped parcel

he feels its weight then flips it to number two

abolofia realizing that whatever is going on doesnt
affect him or his resumes eating

                         abolofia
          you people are wild wild

number one backs the blade off  the man raises his napkin
to the small wound  a droplet of blood has stained his
shirt collar  number one turns around as if to leave

what happens next could be a whim an after thought
number one spins around and thrusts the blade deep into
the mans chest  he withdraws it with a half twist and
in the same motion fatally slashes the translators throat
before the old mans body hits the floor

blood pours from the businessmans mouth onto his
scungilli spreading across the white cloth and onto the
floor

cavello

reaches for a gun under his coat  but number two pumps
two rounds into his face  at this range theres not much
left

the killers slowly back out the door covering the room
with the scattergun  the minute the door shuts nick
leaps up pulling his shield and revolver

                         nick
                  shouting
          police officers  everybody stay
          put
                  to charlie
          get back up

abolofias eyebrows rise at this development

nick bolts out the door leaving charlie in charge  hes
never been in charge before

                         charlie
                  nervously showing
                   shield
          police

a lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up

nick flies out the lime house door and hits the ground

number two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the
trigger  hes wild  the front windows of the lime house
shatter

the limo driver jerks to a halt  number two tosses the
package to him

nick empties his revolver  number two goes down

the driver floors the accelerator leaving number one to
take off on foot  nick follows reloading as he runs


int  the lime house

everyones frozen on the floor

                         charlie
          call 911  tell them an officer
          needs assistance  say ten thirteen

nothing from the owner who looks at abolofia  charlie
grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the
phone

                         charlie
          do it you dumb bastard

suddenly charlie feels something wet at his feet  he
looks down to see that hes standing in a pool of blood
from the massacre  so much for his new shoes

he wheels around then quickly backs out the door


ext  street  down the block from the lime house

deserted  the wail of police sirens in the distance
charlie has his gun out  hes drenched in sweat  where
is his partner

                         charlie
          nick  shit shit

another street  alley  night

nick gun drawn slowly rounds the corner to the alley
its the ad hoc drugstore for the night  drugs going up
and down in pails two dozen junkies buying shooting
slumped on the ground  everyone scatters  the ones
that can

an abandoned pail

swings slowly back and forth from three stories up  nick
cautiously moves down the alley holding the gun in both
hands  a junkie steps out of a doorway nick swings his
gun and nearly blows him away

number one

we see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
the back of the alley  from now on well call him kobo
his sunglasses are on his forehead his hands dropped
casually at his side  a very cool character

kobo slowly raises his hand and making a gun with his
finger slowly points and shoots at nick he lowers
his hand

                         nick
          on the ground man  now

kobo cups his hands around his ear  he doesnt understand
english  nick keeping his gun fixed comes up to him and
kicks out his legs

kobo falls flat on his chest

nick pulls out his cuffs  but kobo lunges for nicks
ankle and yanks it toward him  nick stumbles backward
kobos on his feet  before nick can stand kobo lands a
brutal kick to the side of nicks head

nick gets up barrels into him  kobo knees nick in the
solar plexus then lands two more well placed kicks in
nicks back  its not that nicks a bad fighter its
that this kid is so damn fast

nick slowly gets to his feet  kobo lands two more brutal
shots to the side of nicks head  hes a bloody mess

two police cars

stop at the end of the alley  four officers climb out

charlie

joins the cops as they run down the alley to find nick
getting pummeled

charlie shoots at kobo  misses  kobo turns to see the
five cops guns drawn

nick on one knee spits out blood and a few teeth

kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
drops it next to nick  the blade gleams in the light
that was next  nick got lucky

kobo towers imperiously above nick  their eyes lock  we
hold then

                                            fade to black

fade in

fifty identical desks  fifty identical phones  fifty
identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working
under the fluorescent lights of this large open room

mid forties sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk
ohashi prides himself on order

nick and charlie are standing in front of him

                         nick
          get me something like an identikit
          and ill give you a description

ohashi remains poker faced  he continues to arrange
papers and apply his hanko personal seal to the bottom
of a stack of official papers

                         charlie
          there must be some witnesses from
          the airport

still nothing from the good inspector

                         nick
          what is it tea time

still nothing from ohashi  finally

                         ohashi
                  quiet rage
          you lost a man we wanted for some
          time  it was very incompetent on
          your part officer

                         nick
          incompetent is letting people waltz
          through a secure area wearing your

ohashi bows slightly were not sure why

reluctantly they head towards the door passing long rows
of bureaucrats telephones ringing off the hook  nick
stops at the door spots a fuse box nearby  he glances
back to make sure no one is looking

nick pulls out his handcuffs  charlie cant figure out
what the hell hes doing  nick attaches one cuff to the
main lever then yanks it down

the lights go out  the fans stop so do the typewriters
so does the air conditioning  dead silence

nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe snaps it shut
now its impossible to left the main lever

from the far end of the room

the dull roar of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance
breaks the predawn stillness

twenty bosozoku bikers

on their multicylinder high tech street bombers creep
around the corner and slowly ride toward nick and charlie

we get a better look at them  turbo punk elvissamurai
hybrids  some wearing a slipper under their headbands
courtesy of their girlfriends some in leopard skin pants
and tattoos

they head straight for nick and charlie then at the last
moment split and float away in slow motion as if the
cops didnt exist

suddenly the street is empty again  silent except for
the sound of the wind beating against paper lanterns
rustling the wind chimes

hold on nick and charlie standing in the middle of the

a series of shots

a body from the waist down in the claws of six foot
working robotic  the tattooed covered legs swing back and
forth like a pendulum

the torso is wedged in between two enormous printing
rollers

the head is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt
its been drenched in black printers ink which has begun
to congeal

we slowly track past ich charlie and nick watching
charlie has the dry heaves

real sound as we reveal the full crime scene  instead of
the usual cigar smoke camera flashes and radio chatter
there is order and quiet  a slow underwater dance

inspector ohashi

quietly gives an order  someone turns off the robotic
the severed legs stop swinging

nick charlie and ich walk over to ohashi  ich bows
deeply  ohashi doesnt acknowledge any of them talks to
a man holding a tape measurer

ext  printing plant  day

ich nick and charlie are threading their way through the
crowd toward the subway entrance

two bikers their hair slicked back watch the trio from
the top of two different subway entrances

as soon as ich nick and charlie go down the steps they
climb off their bikes and follow


int  subway station

nick ich and charlie are riding the people mover that
stretches the length of this endless tunnel  theyre
sandwiched between the legions of salarymen white collar
workers who all wear identical blue suits and white
shirts

nick looks over at ich who is still suffering in silence
from the recent humiliation

                         nick
          you know inspector you take shit
          once you take shit forever

                         ich
                  smiling
          what does charlie mean

                         charlie

charlie slaps ich on the back

nick smiles at charlies remark  he cant help but like
this wideeyed goofy kid

something makes nicks smile fade

direction  his kamali suit looks like it just came from
the cleaners

                         nick
          charlie

charlie spots him  in a flash the two men jump the
railing and charge after him leaving ich in their wake

ich cant possibly make it over the side  he furiously
shoves his way through the salarymen trying to get to the
end of the walkway

chase sequence

 nick barreling through the mass of faceless salarymen

 kobo hurrying ahead occasionally glancing back

 charlie catching up to nick  theyve lost him  they
   spin around  a half dozen tunnels spin out in all
   directions

 nick and charlie spotting kobo  hes waiting for them
   near the turnstile

nick suddenly realizes its a setup  before he can say
anything charlie sprints ahead recklessly shoving
people out of the way

                         nick
                  calling after him
          its a setup  charlie

charlie hasnt heard him

at the turnstile

kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears
onto the platform  charlie doesnt have a ticket  the
guard points to the automatic ticket machine  screw it
charlie leaps over the turnstile

the guard blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway
police

the platform

charlie pushes through the crowd  a wall of blank faces
kobo is gone

nick

shoving through the crowd  he spots charlie  shouts at
him to wait  charlie cant hear his partner

the subway

pulls in  an immaculately uniformed conductor blows his
whistle and waves his whitegloved hands to keep the crowd
back

a leather jacketed boy shoves charlie from behind he
stumbles forward toward the track  someone catches him at
the last moment  charlie turns around to see its kobo

kobo smiles its all a big joke

what follows happens in a flash

on nick

                         nick
          charlie

nick is close enough to see too far to do anything  hes
blocked by two more leather boys  he tries to shove past
but they grab him

kobo

holding charlie by his coat lapels  an express train
tears into the station  kobo casually glances at

nick

trying to struggle free

kobo

his eyes still on nick drops charlie in front of the
speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry

nick

                         nick
          no

a woman screams

the train barrels through the station

kobo starts toward nick  hes next

a pair of subway policemen burst through the crowd
searching for charlie because he vaulted the turnstile

nick

manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him
they flee into the crowd as the police close in

across the platform  kobo

slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a
train by whitegloved men  its their job to shove
commuters into the already packed cars

nick goes for kobo but the crowd closes in front of him
he cant get through

the subway doors

slam shut  the train pulls out leaving nick standing on
the empty platform

the last car

streaks past him  kobo stands in the rear window getting
smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the
tracks

                         ich
          nick

ich out of breath is standing on the platform  nick
looks at him with disgust  where the hell was he

stay on nick his head bowed being surrounded by the sea
of bluesuited commuters

the door whats left of it is kicked open  the six men
step in shooting in all directions  into the bathroom

from its scabbard

                         sugai
                  in japanese
          contact your associate in new york
          and tell him to hand my plate over
          to abolofia

nothing from kobo

                         sugai
          you have betrayed the syndicate and
          personally dishonored me  i would
          rather the deal fell through than

the guards walk over and turn kobo around  his back is to
sugai  sugai runs the sword across the nape of kobos
neck drawing blood  the guards tighten their grip on
kobos arms

nick

cant believe sugais going to kill him  nick starts to
get up ich stops him

kobo realizes sugai isnt just threatening him

                         kobo

kobo is led back into the room by two guards  the guards
shove him down to the floor  his hands are still bound

nick walks over and stands above him  he doesnt say a
word  just stands above him  then nick pulls spare
change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins one by
one in front of kobos face like kobo did to him  he
walks away

sugai steps in

                         sugai
          abolofias person has received the
          plate  its done

a door opens at the far end of the room  its kobos
girlfriend the one nick and ich had been following

she starts toward kobo a lieutenant intercepts her

                         sugai
                  in japanese
          i wanted you to see him like this

                         nick
          after a court convicts him  he
          belongs to me

theres a long pause  then something unusual happens
sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten kobos wrist  when
he does sugai hands kobo the sword and demands that he
cut off his finger

this is yubitsume  the ritual act within the yakuza of
slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a
mistake

kobo not believing in this ancient tradition refuses
sugai nods to a guard who places kobos finger on the
table

kobo

stares defiantly at sugai  he doesnt even wince as the
blade slices off his finger  the guard hands sugai the
finger in a handkerchief

                         sugai
                  looking at nick
          if anything happens to abolofia or

with their hoes make their way into the water  they dont

a motorcycle coming

the motorcycle rider

slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and
onto the dirt berm toward the house  hes one of kobos
bosozoku  a long way from the streets of tokyo

the rider comes around the bend to see 

a cop

standing in a uniform  ich  for a moment he doesnt know
what to do  then he draws a pistol from his belt and
accelerates toward ich

ich

stands his ground as the bike closes in  the biker takes
aim

ich drops off to the side as 

nick

rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he
passes catching the man across the face  the rider drops
like a swatted fly  the bikers momentum carries it a few
yards before it falls and skids to a halt

nick hurries to the bike

ich drags the biker off the road then catches up to his
partner

nick and ich

raise the heavy bike  nick mounts  he takes the riders
helmet and goggles from ich and puts them on

                         ich
          what are you going to do

nick doesnt know exactly  he taps the bike into gear it
torques like a mule  theres a lot more juice here
than hes used to

nick fishtails for a minute then gets the hang of it

ich heads off taking another route

kobo steps out and not recognizing nick raises his hand
to greet what he thinks is one of his men

bearing down on kobo

on kobo

as nick keeps coming  he is unable to see clearly until
nick is almost on top of him

nick

dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on
kobo

nick and kobo roll off the narrow porch  nick breaks
free  he isnt fighting fair this time  he slams his
foot into kobos face and ribs  kobo tries to get up but
nick knees him in the chin

standing at the top of the steps  a biker is pressing the
muzzle of a sigsaur assault rifle on her  kobos girl is
beside them holding a small pistol

kobo

gets to his feet  the biker tosses kobo the rifle  kobo
works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side
he has all the time in the world

kobo whirls and kicks nick in the groin  nick falls to
his knees in agony

kobo towers above nick as he did in the alley in new york

                         kobo
          still on your knees nick

kobo walks off his back to nick

          anymore  i have the plate  sugais

                         kobo
          you can tell me who i should shoot
          first

nick struggles to get to his feet  kobo turns and faces
nick at the foot of the steps

appears behind kobo and takes him down with an amazing
display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training

he grabs the gun  a biker bursts out of the door  ich
fires hitting him in the thigh  he drops his gun

sugais daughter

grabs the gun

nick

tackles her and wrestles the gun away  she grabs for it
nick slugs her

porch

the shooter is holding a pistol  a glock 17 automatic
he fires at

nick and joyce

who scramble for cover

kobo

continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle  he pops
the clutch and flies off down the road  nick fires after
him but kobos gone

                         nick
                  to ich

nick mounts the other bike and puts the turbo charged
rocket into gear

the road

rain pours down as kobo turns onto the main road  he
opens up the throttle and in less than a second hes a
screaming dot in the distance

nick

comes around the same corner  his bike fishtails and
slides out from under him

further down the road

kobo tears past a police car  the police car takes off
after him

the foothills

a series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep densely
forested hills

kobos bike flies up the road  the police car cant keep
up begins losing ground

the police car

going flat out falling further and further behind
kobos going to escape

suddenly

nick bent low shoots past the cop car  his left arm is
scraped and bloody

on kobo

glancing back to see nick gaining on him  kobos
pleased  he gives it more gas

nick

pulling eightfive ninety one hundred  the rain
stings his face  its hard to keep his eye open

the foothills

kobo leaning into one of the steep turns climbing higher
and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the
peak

nick

is gaining on him  he hears something coming up behind
him

a bosozoku

the one ich shot in the leg is closing fast on his tail

on nick

as the biker draws even

the biker

pulls out his long knife and slashes at nicks shoulder

nick drops back causing him to miss  the biker drops
back  nick tries to speed up but the biker sticks with
him  hes a good rider this boy  very very good

the biker moves in again blade drawn

nick sees

something the biker doesnt

a truck

coming around the corner

nick

swerves to avoid it at the last moment  the biker reacts
too late and runs 

into the gleaming

radiator of the two ton truck and disappears beneath its
wheels

on kobo

around the bend glancing back  empty road  he eases up
on the throttle  a free man he circles back only to
see

nick

burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred
andtwenty miles per hour in the driving rain

kobo

waits and waits  nick draws closer  then kobo tears off
back down the mountain shooting past nick

nick brakes he slows down and starts to turn but the
wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid
heading right for the edge of the road

                                            cut to

nicks motorcycle

flying over the edge of the road and down the cliff

the edge of the road

nick lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff his
arm is probably broken

he tries to get up with a one arm push up  its hopeless
his head falls into a puddle of water

the whine of an approaching motorcycle  kobo has come
back for him

nick in excruciating pain struggles for his gun

kobo

bearing down on nick

nick

struggling to get his gun  finally he does  but its
caked in mud  if the barrel is stuffed it will explode
nick has to take the chance

on kobo

closer and closer

nick

aims as best he can and fires  the mud caked gun explodes
in his hand  nick screams in agony

kobo

pulls his bike up inches in front of nicks head  nick
seems to be bleeding everywhere  his hand his nose his
mouth the side of his head

kobos face and neck is caked in blood from when nick beat
him

the rain pours down

he picks up the gun  points it at nick squeezes the
trigger

                         kobo
                  slowly
          bang bang

he tosses the gun in front of nicks face

                         kobo
           youre dead

the sound of approaching police sirens

kobo swings the bike around goes a hundred yards down the
road then swings back

kobo guns the engine  he gain speed thirty thirty
five

nick

struggles to get up  he cant

kobo

opening the throttle

nick

crawling a few inches thats it

kobo

twenty yards away

nick

reaches into his coat and pulls ichs 18 inch shuto out

he rolls away at the last moment slashing kobos ankle as
he races past

kobo

screams in pain  he tries to stop too suddenly  the bike
flips over  kobo flies into the air then hits the
pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road
he stops on his back  its lucky hes alive

the sound of fast approaching police sirens

the plate

has fallen out of kobos jacket  it rests in the road
halfway between the two men

kobo

crawls toward it on his belly

nick

mustering all his strength struggles across the road on
all fours

kobo

crawling snakelike

nick

still moving his arms and legs feel like lead

kobos fingers

as they reach for the plate

nick

grabs kobos wrist forcing him to drop the plate  nick
picks up a rock  it looks as if hes going to smash
kobos head  instead he brings it down on the plate
shattering it in a halfdozen pieces

nick tosses the pieces in front of kobos face

                         nick
          keep the change

nick exhausted slowly falls onto his back  he looks
over at kobo their faces are inches apart  nick makes a
slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows
the same gesture kobo made to nick through the twoway
mirror in new york

nick passes out  his eyes shut the screen

                                           fades to black

black screen

the sound of three police cars screeching to a halt  the
sounds of the police sirens winding down

the sirens get softer mixing with the sound of ringing
phones clacking typewriters voices
