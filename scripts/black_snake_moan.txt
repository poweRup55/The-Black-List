               and nods

               to follow she absently walks after the truck down the gravel 
               drive

               an intense wave of sorrow hits like a kick to her gut she 
               gasps for breath as she struggles to hold back the flood of 
               her tears

               rae drops to her knees right there in the gravel drive her 
               hair falls in front of her face masking her grief

               her shoulders shudder

               her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly  
               a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning 
               sensation that consumes her

                                     rae

               already upon her the familiar burning

               she inhales in gasps rocking back and forth on her knees 
               the late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy

               snot and spittle has run down the side of raes face  her 
               eyelids stick together as she tries to open them

               there is a creak followed by another rae has become aware 
               that someone is slowly walking up the front porch

               the door opens silhouetted in the days blinding light is a 
               white man in his 40s his face is indistinguishable to raes 
               affected gaze

               is this a dream

               he stands above her and lights a cigarette the zippo lighter 
               clasps shut the man lowers it to his side where rae can see 
               it clearly a bald eagle is printed on the side a sight 
               that makes raes eyes open wide in horror

               her breath grows deeper  a girlish plea this is no dream  
               its a nightmare

                                     rae
                         mmmm mmmm

               a massive hand slaps down over her mouth her crusted eyes 
               peer above the hairy knuckles he sucks on the cigarette a 
               red cherry blazes at the end the man pushes the blanket off 
               of her and grips her panties

               raes eyes close she knows what is next in his clenched 
               fist the panties are ripped off

                                     rae
                         nooooo

               rae flinches awake from the feverinduced nightmare and falls 
               to the wooden floor drenched in sweat weakened and shaking 
               she scampers away finally collapsing in the kitchen her 
               hand reaches out and lands on the strings of lazs guitar on 
               the floor she grips the steel strings with her trembling 
               fingers

               a single bass note twangs as she passes out

                                                                    cut to

               forward her mouth opens

               in her sickened state with the force of something evil and 
               deep inside rae clasps her open mouth over lazs a shriek 
               sounds in his brain as he holds her tighter allowing the 
               kiss to grow in intensity rae falls to her stomach as laz 
               abruptly stands and stumbles across the room what he sees 
               chills him to the bone

               rae is writhing on the floor as if she is possessed  a 
               rant of raspy words pour from her mouth

                                     rae

               rae crawls across a fallen soldier following the sound of 
               ronnies alarm she struggles to breathe she almost faints

               she finds a soldier face down with all her strength she 
               turns him over it is ronnie wideeyed and lifeless

               an awful groan comes out of rae  crippling sorrow she 
               pulls on his vest trying to wake him

                                     rae
                              sobbing

               rae looks up the flaming humvee is gone she is not pulling 
               on ronnies vest but the tangled vines of a squash plant

               laz stands at a safe distance silhouetted in moonlight

                                     lazarus

                         now come on inside with me

               rae looks like a terrified child her eyes well with tears 
               as she shakes her head laz takes a step toward her

                                     rae

               she turns and runs away as best she can laz chases after 
               her hes much older than her and a bit slower but her 
               balance betrays her

               laz wraps his arms around her rae screams to the sky

                                     rae
                         no nooo noooooooooo

               and then stillness rae lies limp in lazs arms unconscious

               he reaches down and lifts her wrist to his face the green 
               screen of the digital watch pulsates with the alarm

               he pushes the side button the beeping stops silence

                                                                    cut to

               laz lays rae back onto his couch her eyes open into slits 
               she can see lazs form over her like the man in her nightmare

               rae grabs lazs wrist he flinches with her force

                                     rae
                              the whisper of a 
                              child
                         isokay isokay

               struggling with exhaustion rae moves lazs hand to her bare 
               stomach she rubs it slowly up and down her form 
               suggestively

               laz slips his hand away and claps it tight over her eyes 
               rae holds her breath waiting to be molested her lip 
               quivering

                                     lazarus
                              singing deep and

               rae relaxes and falls into a deep sleep

               voice of tehronne is heard from earlier in the day

               rae struggles for balance as she attempts to stand the quilt 
               falls away as a heavy chain slides off the couch and thuds 
               on the floor by her feet

               rae feels a tug

               she looks down to see a dark chain locked around her thin 
               waist and coiled on the floor the opposite end is locked 
               around the side coil of the radiator

               she is chained to the house a prisoner

               mud and grass as she claws at the ground

               laz crosses to the radiator and pats it like a proud parent  
               his wedding ring clicks against the iron

               laz crosses to the kitchen rae sits down on the couch 
               noticing the fallen lamp on the floor

                                     lazarus

               shatter as laz falls to the floor

               rae picks up a wooden chair and breaks it over his back 
               before she can do any more damage laz grabs her by the wrists 
               and throws her to the couch

               rae falls to the floor laz stumbles on his feet as he 
               clutches his bleeding head he loses his cool

                                     lazarus

               rae freezes as she sees laz undo his belt buckle her breath 
               starts to quiver as she deeply inhales and exhales

                                     lazarus
                         think im gonna let you do me like

               finger is scratching at her own thigh

                         now take that look outcha eye

               her anguished hum can be heard through her clenched teeth as 
               she rocks back and forth her hands wander down to her inner 
               thighs

                                     lazarus

               rae gets dizzy she rests the top of her head on the floor 
               and sways back and forth laz rushes out the front door

               as the wave hits rae twists and turns wrapping the chain 
               around her she grips the radiator with both hands and rests 
               her face against the side

                                     rae
                         hmmmmmm stopit stopit

               the wave is about to build in to a powerful climax rae gasps 
               for breath

               well water from a tin bucket rae inhales and freezes laz 
               waits and watches

               the burning is gone

               laz kneels next to her and gently frees her bare ankle from 
               the tangled chain

                                     lazarus

               they are both seated on the front porch with paper plates in 
               their laps laz watches with amusement as rae tears into her 
               chicken and gobbles up the vegetables

                                     lazarus

               rae remains under lazarus intense gaze as the cicadas sing

                                                                    cut to

               the chain gently rattles behind her laz has given her about 
               20 feet of slack he holds the chain tight around his fist

               rae grins standing proud in her wolf shirt and panties

                         for them who hear the word of god

               else other than her there is anger in his tone as he rubs 
               ointment on her bare scabbed knees

                         some women prefer not to scent their

               hears the swell of the cicadas her eyes dart to the front 
               door as the familiar creek of footsteps are heard

                         where am i gonna put all this love

               rae gently touches his cheek the wind picks up outside

                                     rae
                         you can give it to me

               rae kisses laz he is motionless at first allowing it to 
               happen his hand moves from the neck of his guitar to the 
               bend in her neck

               the passion intensifies as they squeeze the guitar between 
               them

               laz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his hands 
               they are so close they are breathing into each others 
               mouths

                                     rae
                         you cant start this and not finish 
                         not with me
                              kisses him
                         please

               the guitar clangs to the floor as laz lifts rae in his arms 
               they kiss ravenous for each other he knocks up against the 
               side table causing his bible to fall to the floor face up 
               and open the wind pushes the front door open slamming it 
               hard against the wall

               they turn together kissing laz slowly spinning with rae in 
               his arms but laz is soon distracted by the pages of his 
               bible fluttering on the floor the wind is blowing the pages 
               turning them with an unseen hand

                                     lazarus
                         wait i gotta stop

                              more aggressive
                         rae stop
                              she cant hear the 
                              burning has her
                         dammit rae get off

               it takes a considerable effort to pull rae away she falls 
               to the floor dizzy and sucking in air

                                     lazarus
                         this aint the way for me im sorry

               rae is struggling for breath she desperately grabs at laz

                                     rae
                         not gonna lie to you laz

                         i dont think i can stop this

               her eyes roll back briefly almost losing consciousness laz 
               catches her and holds her tightly

                                     lazarus
                         tell me what to do

                              barely able to speak
                         the chain helps

               laz grips the chain and wraps it around rae

               as the burning increases laz holds rae tight across his 
               lap his back up against the radiator

                                     rae

               her legs itch like they are covered in ants the wave is 
               hitting her hard laz holds her face up to him

                              like a little girl

                         me

               suddenly aware of the rising burn rae grits her teeth

                         hold me oh god

               rae turns away as laz holds her head in his lap she bites 
               down on his middle finger as his hand moves over her mouth

               she is gasping screaming into his hand

               it hits laz holds her

               raes open mouth quivers as the sensation peaks her shoulders 
               slump her chest vibrates she is crying softly

               mirror she looks at the compact in her hand and decides 
               against the purchase

               she rounds the corner and stops she sees sandy on her knees 
               in the center of the aisle building a display of tuna cans

               rae thinks to leave but stops she makes a decision to talk 
               to her she walks up the aisle and stands above her mother

                         as he wanted with the only somebody 
                         you had

               it is clear from sandys reserved anguish that rae is telling 
               the truth

               sandy firmly grips her by the arm and walks her out rae 
               winces in pain like a toddler being led off to a car for a 
               good whipping

                                     rae

                         of doin what i shoulda done

               sandy walks back up the aisle returning to her canned tuna

               and then the rage hits rae

               with each breath rae grits her teeth tighter she grabs a 
               mop off the side aisle and turns around sandy is pricing 
               cans down on her knees she doesnt see rae coming

                                     rae

               night he sits down on the side of his bed and takes off his 
               shirt leaving his tshirt on

               rae is standing in his doorway

                                     rae

               cheek

               rae then walks down the hall to her couch in the front room

               laz turns off the light

                                                              cut to black

               int bathroom  night  flashback

               rae enters the dark bathroom and shuts the door behind her 
               her hair is shorter a shaggy bob bleached platinum blond

               arty always behind the door attempts to enter but rae 
               pushes the door closed and locks it

                         change her fuckin mind

               rae finds the light switch she yelps upon seeing ronnie 
               crouched by the tub

               suddenly feeling violated rae yanks down on her shirt to 
               hide the fact that shes not wearing anything else

                                     rae
                         hey

                         go

               ronnie attempts to get up but its too late rae has already 
               squatted on the commode pinning ronnie between her and the 
               bathtub

               rae is breathing heavy her focus is scattered shes coming 
               up or coming down from a big burn

                                     rae

               ronnie tries to look away trying to make an awkward moment 
               less awkward raes anxiety is hitting her

                                     rae

               ronnie nervously considers this before agreeing to open his 
               mouth he points into the tub

                                     ronnie

               ronnie leans over and dry heaves into the tub it is painful 
               rae leans forward and touches his back comforting him

                                     rae

               ronnie falls back gripping his stomach there are tears in 
               his eyes from the dry heaving suddenly emotion hits him

                              through tears and

               rae pulls ronnie to her he cries into her shoulder she 
               gently rubs his wet face and sings her words of comfort

                                     rae
                         isokay isokay

               ronnie begins to calm down the sobbing abates

               the metal music from the party outside is muffled through 
               the door the two hold onto each other in silence

               rae pees they both giggle a welcome release of tension

                                     rae
                         i feel better do you

               ext lazarus barn  night

               ronnie lifts his head from sleep  his memory of rae has 
               vanished

               he is leaning against the corner of the barn his 45 in his 
               grip his gaze slowly turns toward lazs darkened house

               his hand begins to shake

                                                             fade to black

               ext lazarus home  early morning

               a crow squawks in the rows of corn a bright morning is 
               coming

               int lazarus home  the bedroom  early morning

               laz is still asleep the sound of clumsy guitar playing 
               accompanied by a tiny voice can be heard

                                     rae
                              plucking trying to 
                              find the right note
                         you are my sunshine

               laz opens his eyes

               int lazarus home  early morning

               laz quietly creeps into the doorway to watch rae struggle 
               with the guitar playing he could stay there for hours 
               watching this little girl play his guitar

               rae looks up and sees laz she stops playing

                                     rae
                         sorry

               rae opens her eyes with a delightful giggle laz continues 
               playing

                                     lazarus

               rae doesnt hesitate to obey with her eyes closed and laz 
               playing neither can see ronnie creeping up from the kitchen 
               with his gun

                                     rae
                              singing

                         you make me happy when skies are 
                         gray

               ronnie looks sick with pain as he points the barrel at the 
               back of lazs head

                                     rae

                              opens her eyes
                         ronnie

               laz spins around knocking away ronnies arm bam the gun 
               fires into the wall the guitar cracks on the floor

               rae screams

                                     rae
                         ronnie stop ronnie

               laz lunges at ronnie but ronnie is faster he spins laz around 
               and slams him to the floor pushing his gun into lazs face

               ronnie grips the shaking gun a severe attack is on the rise 
               as he listens to laz

                         oh baby just let me

               rae moves closer to him wanting to comfort him but she stops 
               as ronnie points the gun at her his eyes pleading for her 
               to stay back

                                     ronnie

               a flood of tears are streaming down ronnies face the gun 
               is shaking furiously in his hand

                                     ronnie

                                     lazarus

                              looks at rae and 
                              then back at ronnie
                         and cowboys so lets have it 
                         end me or get out of my face

               ronnie looks like a scared five year old having an asthma 
               attack laz barks at him one last time

                                     lazarus
                         goon do it
                              silence
                         do it

               the last shout from laz completely destroys ronnie his 
               shoulders slump the gun lowers in his grasp a low sob is 
               heard as he falls to his knees

               laz snatches the gun from his hand and stands

                                     rae
                         ronnie

               rae inches closer to ronnie as he kneels over and weeps she 
               gently touches his shoulder he turns his anguished face to 
               her and tries to speak

                                     ronnie
                         i cant stop i cant stop being 
                         scared what am i gonna do

               ronnie hides his face in his hands rae throws her arms around 
               him and holds him tight

                                     rae
                         i got you baby i got you

               laz removes the clip and crosses to the kitchen he slams 
               the gun on the sink opens a drawer and removes the wall 
               phone

                                     rae
                              seeing laz plug the 
                              phone in

                         they gonna help this they ever help

                              laz listens on the 
                              phone
                         dammit laz put the phone down

               laz looks at rae there is hurt in his eyes

                                     lazarus
                         thought you knew me better gal

               int lazarus home  night

               rl crosses from the kitchen he hands a glass of water to 
               rae seated on the couch he hands another to ronnie seated 
               next to her rl sits before them as laz lingers in the 
               doorway

                                     rl
                              to ronnie

               ronnie is very uncomfortable he looks at rae seated next to 
               him and then back at rl

                                     ronnie

                              come to ronnie
                         but when rae gets like she does 
                         and she does the things that she 
                         always done makes me feel like she 
                         loves this place moren me

               rae starts shaking her head tears come to her eyes rl 
               raises a hand to silence her

                                     rl
                         go on ronnie

               ronnie wipes the tears from his eyes with his shirt sleeve 
               rl turns to rae

                                     rl
                              looks at rae

               rae takes a deep breath she looks up at laz he encourages 
               her with a nod

                                     rae

               ronnie is at the wheel of the chevy caprice rae sits silently 
               next to him

               rae looks out the window as a huge 18 wheeler rolls up on 
               her side she tries to ignore it and the tension it brings

               she turns to see that ronnie is sweating another truck is 
               on his side sandwiching them in an attack is coming over 
               ronnie

               his breath is short his chest tightens rae reaches over 
               and gently strokes the back of his neck

                                     ronnie
                         i gotta pull over

               he breaks the two trucks zoom ahead as ronnie breaks to the 
               side dust flies as the chevy skids to a stop on the side of 
               the road

               trucks zip by shaking the car as ronnie tries to get control 
               of his breathing

               rae tries to stay calm stroking the back of his neck as he 
               struggles for breath he puts his forehead against the wheel 
               to stave off the building nausea

                                     ronnie
                              through clenched 
                              teeth
                         fuck

               fear comes to raes face as she notices her middle finger 
               scratching at the back of ronnies neck she pulls it away 
               and shoves her hand between her thighs

               her eyes close as the burning builds she grips the gold 
               chain around her waist

                                                                   flash to

               quick cuts

               the chain tight around rae as she struggles rae panting 
               and sweating on lazs floor she reaches out her hand lands 
               on the strings of his guitar a single string is plucked

                                                             flash back to

               rae opens her eyes  the low note still sounding in her 
               head she places her hand back on his neck and then soft 
               as a prayer

                                     rae
                              singing

                         you make me happy when times are 
                         gray

               ronnie slowly turns and looks at rae his head still resting 
               on the steering wheel the panting has slowed color starts 
               returning to his cheeks

                                     rae

               the anxiety is gone ronnie takes a breath and looks at rae 
               humbled and thankful of her power to soothe him

                                     rae
