     darkness bloodcurdling screams presentation credits roll as we
     fade up on

     int hospital innercity trauma ward  night

     its 1967 the summer of love and 

     boom entry doors swing open as paramedics wheel in a female bleeder
     vanessa 20s black nine months pregnant shes deathly pale
     spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat  

     a shocktrauma team swarms over her inserting a vacutainer into an
     artery to draw blood wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her
     arm 

                           nurse 1
                    with stethoscope
               shes not breathing

                           senior resident
               intubate her

     the respiratory therapist feeds an endotracheal tube down the womans
     ruined throat attaches that to an amblu bag 

                           resident
               bloodpressures forty and falling 

     the woman starts spasming violently it takes three staff members
     just to hold her down

                           senior resident
               jesus her waters broken 
                    calling for help
               shes going into uterine contractions 

     camera pushes in on the woman as she bolts upright screaming to wake
     the dead we plunge into the darkness of her mouth and find
     ourselves 

     inside her bloodstream

     the sound of a heart beating pounding as we whipsnake through 

     corpuscles 

     floating in amber plasma erythrocytes leukocytes neutrophils and
     eosinophils 

     the rhythmic expansion of the artery walls pulsing with each
     successive surge of blood as the heart beats faster and faster
     taking us 

     in utero

     a child alive but unborn shifting in a sea of amniotic fluid
     surrounded by the white protective substance known as vernix
     caseosa the heartbeat races like a locomotive now the unborn child
     shifts turns its head towards us 

      and opens its eyes

     cut to

     a swordblade

     cleaving the darkness radiant light slicing across gleaming damascus
     steel words acidetched in the weapons finetempered surface

     blade

     main credits end

     ext inner city industrial ghetto  night

     a decaying no mans land populated by condemned buildings and hungry
     homeless steam rises from manhole covers drifting across the
     litter lined streets suddenly 

     a black mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill roaring past
     us stereo system belting out filter

     int mercedes  night

     raquel a waspwasted woman sits behind the wheel 20s rich
     sickeningly attractive hungry eyes 

     squirming around in the passenger seat is dennis a modelactor boy
     toy with a subzero iq and a fuck me sideways grin 

                           dennis
               so where we going

                           raquel
               its a surprise 

                           dennis
               i likes surprises 

     raquel eyeballs dennis  if looks could devour 

                           raquel
               what do you have down there little 
               man

                           dennis
               heatseeker

                           raquel
               ill bet

     raquel slides a manicured hand up his thigh squeezes his groin
     dennis moans she pulls her hand away downshifts

     ext vacant lot  night

     the 850 threads a narrow alley into a vacant lot brakes hard raquel
     and dennis climb out she leads him into 

     ext meat packing plant  night

     industry never sleeps and certainly not this grisly facility raquel
     leads dennis around the back of the plant where a host of workers
     are loading refrigerated trucks with product

                           dennis
               what the fuck are we doing here

     raquel just smiles heads on into the plant via a loading door the
     workers ignore her

     int meat packing plant  night

     dennis follows raquel through the bowels of the plant catching
     glimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart 

     through one partially open door we see what might be a line of
     bodybags being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain
     pulleysystem but dennis doesnt have enough time to be disturbed by
     the vision because hes being pulled away by raquel led down 

     a stairwell

     we are in the basement now at the end of the hall is a steel door
     with perhaps just the faintest hint of music heard coming from
     beyond raquel knocks

     a peephole slat opens and a black light shines into raquels eyes
     a voice behind the door offers a verbal challenge speaking a
     language weve never heard laced with a devilish cadence 

     raquel responds in kind the door opens raquel gives dennis a
     knowing wink enters dennis follows 

     int club  night

     raquel and dennis move past a hulking doorman making their way down
     a narrow stairway dennis is suitably impressed

     the club 

     is elite underground  an abattoirchic version of an oldtime
     juke joint with a greasy dangerous vibe whitetiled walls and
     floors for easy hosing chromed fittings runoff gutters drains no
     bar

     bodies 

     writhe on the strobelit dance floor a heavy sm scene leather
     latex tattoos bodypiercings

     a dj wearing headmounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on
     twin decks music assaults us  a beat so heavy it could jar the
     fillings from your teeth brutal darkcore along the lines of
     prodigy or underground 

     raquel pulls dennis out onto the dance floor they sway 

     a lupinefeatured gaultier girl with a streak of white running
     through her raven hair moves in behind dennis pressing up against
     him rachel williams as the angel of death  well call her mercury

     mercury flicks her tongue against dennis ear  its been pierced
     with a silver post which clicks against her teeth tattooed across
     her back in black is a swirling tribal vortex 

     dennis is now sandwiched between raquel and mercury the three of
     them dryhumping their way to every mans glory 

     the beat gets louder the action heavier the atmosphere more
     narcotic people are stripping off their clothes sweating like
     fiends its a virtual orgy

     dennis laughs reveling in the hedonism everything rises to a fever
     pitch 

                           dennis
                    over the music
               fuck i need a drink

     raquel just smiles  then dennis notices a drop of something spatter
     his hand it looks like blood dennis looks up concerned 

      more blood droplets are falling raquels face is sprinkled with
     them now dennis stops dancing what is this some kind of fucked up
     performance art

     raquel turns her face toward the ceiling as if washing herself in a
     summer shower now the other club goers are looking up too 

     blood showers down

     from sprinkler heads in the ceiling drenching the dancers the club
     goers love it thrusting their heads back mouths open wide to
     receive the crimson offering 

     horrified dennis recoils turning towards 

     raquel

     whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl her canines extend
     tapering to razorsharp points her tongue flicks lizardlike as
     fingernails sharpen into claws all this while the whites of her eyes
     bleed red pupils oscillating hypnotically 

                           raquel
               whats wrong baby

     dennis screams pushes away from raquel only 

      mercury has fangs now too in fact everyone in the club does
     with the exception of poor dennis thats because theyre all
     vampires

     dennis tries to run but the burly doorman blocks his exit brutally
     smashing his fist into dennis face 

     dennis falls dazed the clubgoers close in around him they make a
     game of it shoving him from one person to another their pale faces
     leering like twisted jackolanterns

     the strobe lights quicken to a seizureinducing intensity dennis
     spins tumbling into raquels arms she shoves him forward  dennis
     lands on the floor falling at someones bootclad feet he looks up
     a dark figure sits in the shadows unnoticed until this moment the
     figure stands moves into the light as time screeches to a halt  

     a black man 

     towers above dennis wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat  a
     sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of
     horror his name is blade

     blade whips open his long coat shrugging it off revealing an
     arsenal of hightech weapons strapped to his body 

     6point adjustable body armor a modified car15 assault rifle with
     an ultraviolet entry light two casull 454 revolvers a demon
     automatic crossbow a bandoleer of mahogany stakes an indianstyle
     katar punching dagger  and last but certainly not least his
     namesake  a silver sword which is secured in a backscabbard

     close on blade

     a gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun the vampire clubgoers
     stare back nuclear silence and then 

     all hell breaks loose with a snarl raquel charges at blade moving
     at superhuman speed practically a blur  

     blade draws his casulls fires in multiple directions 

     macro bullet shot 

     as a round roars through the air towards raquel a silvertipped dum
     dum bullet which explodes on contact

     wham the round punches a fistsized hole through raquels chest
     continuing on into the vamp behind her vampire blood fountains both
     creatures tumble forward their bodies liquefying into puddles of
     black oil which go gurgling down the runoff drains

     blade continues firing then click magazines empty next he
     holsters the casulls swings up his assault rifle calmly flicks on
     the uv entry light mounted above 

     mercury 

     leaps twenty feet straight up into the air weve never seen anything
     move so fast she crashes through a glass skylight disappearing into
     the night just as 

      a shaft of blinding uv sunlight cuts across the vampires they
     rear back skin smoking from the lights corrosive effects blade
     opens fire pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets
     into the crowd  vampire genocide

     the strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts some of the vampires
     try to flee scurrying up the stairs but the exit quickly becomes
     clogged with liquefying bodies  

      then blades car15 jams the remaining clubgoers see their
     opening surge forward en masse  

     blade drops the rifle reaches over his shoulder and schinggg
     unsheathes his sword with a doublehanded grip 

     the sword

     four acidetched feet of bloodsoaked damascus steel an edge so
     sharp it could cleave a shadow in two

     blade moves like lightning hacking his way into two charging
     vampires blade spins again cuts another vampire clean in half 

     on the far end of the club

     a latexclad vamp makes a break for it blade flings his sword
     sending it spinning end over end  thunk the sword punches into the
     vampires heart the hellish creature convulses dies

     beat blade retrieves his sword then senses 

     something big

     rising up behind him in a flash blade swings his sword downward
     cutting off the vampires right hand at the elbow the severed limb
     falls to the floor  

      but it doesnt slow the hulking creature down it slams into
     blade blade flies backwards thirty feet tumbling over tables
     slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the
     ceiling 

     blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feralfaced sixfoot
     something nightmare named quinn the vampire rears back its head
     jaws stretching wide every inch of his face is covered with ritual
     scarification patterns and maorilike tribal tattoos 

     blade forces an elbow against quinns throat trying to keep him at
     bay with his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer pulls out a
     stake  crunch blade shoves the stake through the vampires larynx
     quinn gurgles clutches at his throat 

     blade rolls out from under unholsters the crossbow secured to his
     leg with a flick of a switch the arms of the bow snap open
     drawing the bowstring taut blade fires  

     the bolt hits quinn in the shoulder throwing him backwards and
     nailing him to the wall as quinn reaches over with his other hand to
     pull out the stake 

     blade fires again a second bolt slams into quinns other arm
     effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board

     up above 

     mounted in one of the corners is a security camera blade fires a
     crossbow bolt straight into the lens 

     blade strides over placing his sword against quinns chest

                           blade
               where is deacon frost

     quinn glares trying to speak gagging on the stake still lodged in
     his trachea 

                           blade
               got something in your throat

     blade yanks the stake free the vampire laughs air whistling through
     his ruined larynx 

                           quinn
               fuck you daywalker i aint saying 
               shit 

                           blade
               frost

     quinn responds with a slew of rapidfire vampire invectives blade
     sees hes getting nowhere fast calmly sheathes his sword he unclips
     a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness  

                           quinn
               you wont stop him blade the tides 
               rising the sleepers gonna 

     blade shoves the grenade in quinns mouth pulls the pin whoosh
     quinn goes up like a roman candle blade turns surveying his work
     ignoring the howling pyre behind him

     all evidence of the vampires is gone  with the exception of a few
     oilyblack puddles clothes jewelry  its all been burned away by
     the acidic process of the creatures accelerated decomposition

     dennis sits huddled in a corner having pissed his pants as blade
     approaches he cringes back 

                           dennis
               please dont 

     blade simply grabs dennis by the jaw tilting his head upward
     rotating it from side to side  looking for bite marks there arent
     any

     blade moves on leaving dennis alone amidst the carnage as blade
     starts up the stairs he pauses in midstep 

     a cockroach

     scurries out from underfoot 

     blade adjusts his footfall sparing the roach he continues on up the
     stairs disappearing in the smoky haze 

     cut to

     int city hospital autopsy room  night

     camera follows a bagged corpse as its rolled into the autopsy room
     by an assistant 

                           assistant
               brought you a baked potato nice

     curtis webb the forensic pathologist 30s white bread a little on
     the smarmy side steps forward unzips the bag 

     its quinn whats left of him anyway burnt to a charcoal
     briquette limbs twisted horribly oozing fluids

                           curtis
               jesus thats rank  

     curtis turns back makes note of the blackened stump where quinns
     arm used to be the ruined throat

               paramedics said he was still screaming 
               when they found him looks like some 
               joker had stapled him to a wall

                           curtis

     int hospital hematology lab  night

     microscope pov

     of a slidemounted blood smear stained with wright stain blue ink
     what we see is a collection of donutshaped pink things red blood
     cells intermingled with some small blue specks platelets and the
     occasional larger lightblue blobs white blood cells

     karen jansen 20s a finefeatured hematologist with a social life
     in suspended animation sits back from the microscope stumped next

                           karen

     curtis sits on a stool nearby slowly nodding

                           karen
               this isnt human blood

                           curtis

                           karen
               the red blood cells are biconvex 
               which is theoretically impossible 
               theyre hypochromic theres virtually 
               no hemoglobin in them 
                    shaking her head
               look at the pmns theyre binucleated 
               they should be mononucleated

                           curtis
               what about the chemistry panel 

     karen looks to julie who reaches for a computer printout

               blood sugar level is three times the 
               norm phosphorous and uric acid are 
               off the scales
                    shrugs
               like the woman said impossible

     karen removes her glasses rubbing the bridge of her nose

     int hospital morgue  night

     the dead of night not a mouse in the house curtis and karen each
     garbed in a mask stand on either side of quinns body which now
     rests on the autopsy table

     quinns body

     a preliminary exploratory yincision has been made across the chest
     stretching from shoulder to shoulder then continuing on down the
     abdomen ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart
     and lungs

                           karen
               you havent started in on the internal 
               organs

                           curtis 
               just the blood sample from the 
               pericardial sac

     curtis pauses studying quinns disfigured face  the features seem
     much less damaged now  almost as if the corpse were healing itself

                           curtis
               thats weird 

                           karen
               what

                           curtis
               he looks different now burns are less 
               extreme some of these wounds have 
               closed up  

     curtis pulls out a penlight flicks it on he leans over quinn
     shining the light into one of his eyes

                           curtis
               tell me something honestly you ever 
               have second thoughts about us

                           karen
                    grudgingly
               sometimes 

     curtis looks up from the corpse grinning beneath his mask

                           karen
                but then i remember what an 
               asshole you were and im snapped back 
               to reality 

                           curtis
               jesus karen youre breaking my heart 
               here 

     quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table sinking his fangs
     into curtis jugular he snaps the mans neck in two for easier
     access sucking in blood like a living vacuum 

     karen stumbles backwards sending autopsy tools clattering

     quinn

     rises from the table flinging curtis twitching body aside he curls
     his bloodsoaked lips back baring viperlike fangs emitting a
     guttural growl 

                           quinn
                    crazed by thirst

     karen backs into the corpse drawers but quinn is upon her in a half
     second wrapping a hand about her throat his mouth opensmorphs
     disturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole caustic saliva
     dripping from his canines  

     karen tries to turn her head away but quinns grip is viselike she
     finds herself staring into his eyes  pupils pulsing rapidfire
     opening and closing hypnotic 

     as quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into karens carotid artery and
     starts to nurse 

     bang a load of mahogany buckshot chews into quinns side he howls
     in pain another load catches him full in the face he drops karen
     she falls to the floor  

     karens pov

     the sound of rushing blood pounding through her skull everything
     spinning she struggles to move turns her head finds herself eye to
     eye with curtis corpse

     in hand sizing quinn up

                           blade
               now dont we look dapper

     quinn bellows with rage ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration
     doors from its hinges flinging it at blade like it was lawn
     furniture 

     blade rolls to the side as the door crashes against the wall quinn
     runs moving through the morgue like a human tornado heading for the
     windows at the end of the room 

     smash out goes quinn taking half the wall with him blade rushes
     to the decimated window looks down 

     blades pov

     quinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below
     caving it in he springs off loping across the tarmac on three
     limbs then screechthwump rolling up onto the hood of an
     oncoming car before disappearing into the night 

     back up above

     blade spins sees karen bleeding her life away on the floor she
     reaches a hand out to him beseeching 

     blade pulls away from her grasp takes a step towards the exit 
     then hesitates 

     a flicker of doubt washes across blades face he looks down at karen
     once more wrestling with his conscience finally making a decision
     he kneels scoops karen up into his arms just then 

     two policemen 

     rush into the morgue weapons drawn 

                           uniform 1
               hold it asshole

     blade ignores them turning to face the window before him its a
     good thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building a parking
     structure  and damned if blade doesnt seem to be considering the
     jump

     the police close in agitated blade crouches switches karen to a
     onehanded grip 

                           uniform 1

      and jumps

     blade clears the impossible distance  almost he snags the ledge of
     the adjacent parking structure with his left hand even as karen slips
     from the grasp of his right 

      a lastsecond save his fingers clamping around her wrist is all
     that stands between karen and street pizza she screams anyway
     dangling below him 

     blade grunts swinging karen like a pendulum heaving her up and over
     the ledge as if she were a sack of potatoes she lands on her
     shoulder clutching it in pain 

     blade heaves himself up crouching beside her

                           karen
                    gasping
               my shoulder  dislocated 

     blade places a hand on her shoulder another around her elbow and
     without any consideration to discomfort crack brutally pops it
     back in place karen screams again as he scoops her up once more and
     heads for 

     his 69 oldsmobile 442

     cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire ultraviolet

     abraham whistler 60s

     hobbles out of the shadows leaning heavily on a cane gimleteyed
     bitter his right leg encased in a metal brace though his face is
     lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray we sense
     he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age 

                           blade
               shes been bitten

               she hasnt turned yet 
                    pointedly
               you can help her

     blade and whistler stare each other down finally whistler turns and
     heads over to the operating theater

                           whistler
               no promises you watch her close she 
               starts to turn you finish her off

     blade nods lays karen down on the operating table whistler turns on
     an overhead light karen is sheathed in sweat ashen shes lost a
     lot of blood

     whistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves probes the wound in
     karens neck with an antiseptic swab  theres capillary damage
     around the perimeter of the wound the tissue looks bruised
     gangrenous 

                           whistler
               localized necrosis shes borderline 
               another hour and shed be well into 
               the change

     whistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under karens
     nose as she starts to stir 

                           whistler
               can you hear me woman 

     karens eyes open wide shes scared disoriented 

                           karen
               what  

                           whistler
               youve been bitten by a vampire weve 
               got to try and burn out the venom 
               just like a rattlesnake bite 

     whistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with causticlooking
     fluid karen sees the syringe resists 

                           whistler
               hold her 

     blade forces karen back whistler readies the syringe

                           whistler
                    reading her name tag
               dr karen jansen listen close im 
               going to inject you with an antidote 
               made from allium setivum  garlic 
               this is going to hurt a lot 

     whistler sinks the needle into karens neck and depresses the
     plunger hurt doesnt begin to describe what karen experiences
     next imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid
     through your veins

     karen shrieks her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms the wound
     on her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous
     vampire venom

     karen clutches at blades arms digging her nails in she stares up
     at him with unflinching intensity like a child desperately searching
     for assurance 

     on blade

     uncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid hed like nothing more
     than to be done with this but the only thing he can do is hold karen
     while she rides out the seizures 

     karens pov

     growing darker by the moment the last thing she sees is blade
     staring down at her  then the night closes in 

     int house of erebus meeting room  night

     close on a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club
     massacre blade turns and stares into the camera fires his cross
     bow the screen cuts to static

     a withered clawed hand

     moves into frame holding a remote with a tap of a button the
     monitor goes dark 

     pull back to reveal a large minimalist conference room  the house
     of erebus seat of the vampire races legislative assembly

     gathered around a massive table are the twelve vampire elders
     representing a rainbow of racial colors  names like pallintine
     von esper ashe bava two of them the faustinas are identical
     twins  lethallooking women with alabaster skin 

     chilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table from
     time to time a member will pour themselves a glass or perhaps help
     themselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks

     at the head of the table is gaetano dragonetti current vampire
     overlord bloodred eyes parchment skin stretched over skulllike
     features incalculably ancient but still deadly and virile as a
     viper

     language which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable
     of reproducing

               has outlived its purpose

     this causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires frost might as
     well have slapped dragonetti in the face

                           dragonetti
                    simmering

     dragonetti slams his fist down toppling a carafe spilling blood
     across the tabletop frost looks to the others 

                           frost
               why should we spend our lives 
               cringing from the daylight when his 
               blood offers us an alternative 
               enough talk its time we stepped out 
               of the shadows

     dragonetti looks apoplectic elder pallintine a fivehundred year
     old vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy interjects

                           pallintine

               out loud what weve all been 
               thinking 

     the fact that no one answers is telling dragonetti glowers at the
     other elders sensing the tide turning

                           dragonetti
               the shadows suit us frost weve 
               existed this way for thousands of

                    to the others
               when the final war between our races 
               comes who do you want leading the 
               charge 

     frost stabs an accusing finger at the overlord

                           frost
               some withered up fossil ready to snap 
               like a brittle bone at the first sign 
               of change

     dragonetti growls like an beast raking his claws across the tyro
     vampires face knocking him to the ground 

                           dragonetti
               get out

     frost picks himself up touches the gashes on his cheek looks at his
     fingers licks the blood from them 

                           frost
               careful old fang you might wake up 
               one day and find yourself extinct

     frost smiles at dragonetti and calmly exits the room

     int whistlers workshop blades cell  day

     on karen as she comes to her wounds have been bandaged she rises a
     little shaky takes in her surroundings  shes in a spartan room
     like a monks cell on the wall is a collection of knives and
     daggers some of them wooden their hilts inscribed with bizarre
     looking runes in the center of these weapons rests 

     blades sword

     hanging like a cross in a chapel dominating all else karen touches
     it then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt
     by a tarnished chain she reaches for it opens it 

     the locket features a photo old and faded its the black woman we
     saw in the prologue vanessa standing in the sunshine 

     karen moves towards the door cautious  

     int whistlers workshop  day

     we hear voices now coming from beyond a series of blackout
     curtains karen pushes one aside and sees 

     blade

     strapped into some kind of inquisitionesque restraint chair his
     shirt is off his body slick with sweat whistler finishes strapping
     blade in then stands back holding up a gaspowered pistol injector
     hesitant 

                           whistler 
               i had to increase the dose youre 
               building up a resistance to the 
               serum 

                           blade
                    impatient
               just do it old man

     whistler nods fitting blade with a bite guard then he presses the
     pistolinjector against blades carotid artery 

     blade shakes violently grinding his teeth through the bite guard
     veins cording in his neck he clutches whistlers hand holding it
     tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure to his
     credit whistler never lets go

     mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs
     its violent course we understand that these shared moments oddly
     private in their horror are the glue which binds the two vampire
     hunters together finally blade slumps forward in his restraints
     exhausted 

     karen

     she draws back instinctively knowing that shes just witnessed
     something she shouldnt have she looks for an exit sees another
     doorway she makes for it  

     int whistlers lab  tank room  day 

     a dusty darkened hole of a room no windows just shadows crumbling
     concrete rust stains and 

     a large tank

     filled with swirling blood plasma choked with electrical leads and
     biomedical sensors something floats within suspended in the murky
     fluid  a child  two or three years of age drifting about like a
     medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde  

     thump the child slams up against the glass karen backpedals
     startled its eyes are open now pupils blown it snarls revealing a
     mouthful of razored fangs trailing mouthslime across the glass as
     it futilely tries to chew its way through to karen

     karen stifles a sob turning and running right into 

     blade

     who now blocks the exit sword in hand karen retreats a step
     wary 

                           blade
               you shouldnt be here

                           karen
               im sorry i 

                           whistler os
               wandered off the beaten path doctor

     whistler has entered the room from a second doorway karen looks from
     whistler to blade trapped between them 

                           karen
               who are you people

                           whistler
               my name is abraham whistler
                    re blade
               this is blade as for our little 
               homunculus here 

     whistler limps over to the tank rapping his cane against it the
     creature snaps at it reflexively following the silver tip back and
     forth like a fish after a lure

                           blade
                hes a vampire

                           karen
               youre joking 

                           whistler
               not at all youre looking at a prime 
               specimen of the homines nocturna 

     whistler toys with the feral creature engaging in a certain amount
     of sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied
     suddenly it surges towards the top of the tank clawing at the
     lid 

     karen becomes alarmed  but then a massive electrical jolt shocks
     the creature back into submission 

                           whistler
               if blade hadnt brought you here you 
               wouldve wound up like him

     karen brings a hand to her bandaged neck recalling the events of the
     previous night she looks to blade

                           karen
               why did you help me

     blade scowls his gaze flickering to whistler

                           blade
               stupidity

                           whistler
                    appraising her
               maybe not i did some checking shes 
               a hematologist knowledge like that 
               might come in handy

                           blade
               its not worth the risk we cant 
               trust her

                           karen
               why

                           blade
               because youre tainted the venoms 
               still inside you you could still 
               turn on us

                           karen
               what happens then

     blade looks to whistler  as far as hes concerned the debates
     over

                           blade
               then i have to take you out just 
               like any other bloodsucker

     blade turns and exits whistler and karen follow

     int whistlers workshop  day

     beyond the grimy outer windows we can see that the day is closing 
     long shadows amber light karen lingers in the doorway reeling from
     information overload 

     blade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt  strapping on body
     armor loading ammunition he strings the tarnished locket around his
     neck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil then pauses to
     inspect a modified pistol sighting down the length of it

                           blade

     clack blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber then checks his
     next weapon 

                           karen
                    sarcastic

                           whistler

               them garlic and theyll go into

     whistler picks up a customized rifle with a uv entry light flicking
     on the beam

                           whistler
                and of course theres always 
               sunlight ultraviolet rays 

     karen shakes her head incredulous

     karen stares at blade whistler gestures to the windows 

                           whistler
               theres a war going on out there 
               blade myself a few others  weve 
               tried to keep it from spilling over 
               onto the streets 
                    beat
               sometimes people like yourself get 
               caught in the crossfire 

     whistler shrugs as far as hes concerned theres nothing else to
     say karen is still protesting though 

                           karen
               i can go to the police i have blood 
               samples back at the hospital i can

               thats ridiculous no ones that 
               powerful 

     whistler sighs he doesnt suffer fools gladly

                           whistler 
               youre talking about a brotherhood 
               that predates the catholic church by 
               thousands of years their survival 
               depends on their ability to blend in 
               chances are youve encountered them 
               and not even known it on the subway 
               in a bar 

     blade slings his car15 onto his shoulder impatient he starts
     towards the olds gesturing

                           blade
               get in you’re leaving

                           whistler
               wait

     whistler tosses a small metal canister to karen

                           whistler
               consider it a parting gift vampire 
               mace  silver nitrate essence of 
               garlic 

                           karen
                    in disbelief
               so thats it you guys just patch me 
               up and send me on my way

                           whistler

               yourself a gun if i were you if you 
               start becoming sensitive to the 
               daylight if you start becoming 
               thirsty regardless of much youve had 
               to drink  then i suggest you take 
               that gun and use it on yourself 
               better that than the alternative

     karen stares at whistler horrified as we 

     cut to

     int the vampire archives  day

     we are deep in the narrow stacks of a sepulchral archive exactly
     what and where this place is will become more clear later on 

     but for now the camera drifts through the warren of aisles along
     the way we catch a glimpse of a hulking silhouette cowering behind a
     series of japanese shoji screens later on we find 

     frost

     tucked away in a carrel surrounded by books and scriptures with
     only the sickly glow of his laptop to provide light

                           dragonetti os
               what are you doing here

     frost pauses seeing dragonetti emerge from the shadows

                           dragonetti
                    outraged
               these archives are restricted to 
               members of the house of erebus

                           frost
               please you and the other elders 
               wouldnt know what to do with these 
               texts if your lives depended on it 
                    cryptically
               which of course they do

                           dragonetti
               youre wasting your time frost far 
               greater scholars than you have tried 
               to decipher these words whatever 
               secrets they hold have been lost

                           frost
               perhaps

     frost studies dragonetti a selfsatisfied grin on his face if the
     act was intended to unnerve dragonetti it succeeded though the
     ancient vampire would never admit it

                           dragonetti
               what are you up to frost

     frost shuts the lid on his laptop rising drawing intimidatingly
     close to dragonetti

                           frosts voice
               wouldnt you like to know old fang

     a beat as the young turk stares his elder down dragonetti is the
     first to lose his nerve frost smiles and exits leaving the old
     vampire to lick his wounds

     camera drifts back to the hulking silhouette which has been
     eavesdropping on the conversation it quivers in fear

     int blades olds on karens street corner  day

     blade brings the car to a stop karen looks at him his eyes are
     hidden behind his glasses his expression stone

                           blade
               remember what we said keep your eyes 
               open theyre everywhere

     ext karens apartment building  day

     as karen climbs out blade swings the door shut behind her the olds
     roars off down the quiet residential street 

     int apartment building lobby  day

     karen crosses the lobby stepping into an elevator just as the doors
     are closing a woman and two men duck in alongside her 

     int elevator  day

     silence the uncomfortableness of an elevator ride magnified tenfold
     karen can feel the eyes of her fellow passengers upon her finally
     succumbing to paranoia she hazards a glance  would she be able to
     tell if these people werent human the woman turns to karen
     smiles 

     karen surreptitiously fishes the vampire mace from her pocket
     clutching it  and now one of the men turns to look at her
     nodding 

     int karens apartment building hallway  day

     the elevator doors open karen hurries out heads left finds herself
     in a deserted hallway she looks back 

      then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out as karen raises
     the canister of mace 

      the trio turn and head down to the right karen breathes a sigh of
     relief shakes her head

     int karens apartment  day

     karen enters quickly bolting the door behind her she picks up the
     phone dials 911 

                           karen
               i need the police this is an 
               emergency 

     as karen waits to be connected she moves to the back entrance and
     checks the locks  then the windows then the fire escape 
     finally a voice comes on the other end

                           karen

     karen hangs up the phone and turns  

     a shaft of bright sunlight

     streams in through a window karen forces herself to look at it and
     winces shielding her eyes again she brings a hand to the bandaged
     wound on her neck she moves to the window pulling the shade down
     frightened

                           karen
               get a grip on yourself girl

     she sinks down into a chair to wait setting whistlers vampire mace
     aside then she shuts her eyes massaging her temples we see 

     a brief flash of

     quinn his mouth opening wide saliva dripping from his fangs his
     pupils pulsating hypnotically we rush into his gaping maw and 

     wham were back to reality karen wakes with a start looks to the
     windows  time has passed its getting dark outside 

      and someone is knocking at the front door karen reaches for the
     vampire mace then moves to the door she looks through the peephole
     cautious 

                           karen
               who is it 

     karens pov fisheye

     a police officer stands in the hallway  30s handsome a knight in
     shining armor as far as shes concerned

               sergeant gideon im responding to a 
               911 call 

     karen visibly relaxes she opens the door and steps aside allowing
     gideon to enter

                           karen
               yes that was me im karen jansen  

     gideon smiles takes a quick glance around the room then studies
     karens face the bandages on her neck

                           gideon

               about that if i were you

                           karen
                    alarmed
               why

     gideons smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun 

                           gideon
               because youre dead too

     karen gasps she has a halfsecond to act  in which she triggers a
     spray of vampire mace into gideons face gideon stumbles back
     blinded cursing rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes  

     karen expects pyrotechnics  but the end result is little more than
     an annoyance a second later gideon is simply blinking sniffing his
     fingers confused 

                           gideon
               garlic

                           karen
               he said it would work against 
               vampires 

     gideon bursts out laughing

                           gideon
               who said i was a vampire 

     gideon shakes his head still snickering he forces karen against the
     wall placing the gun against her head 

                           gideon
               thanks for the laugh you can shut 
               your eyes if you want to

     crash the front door explodes open as blade comes flying through
     it 

     gideon tries to bring his pistol up  but blade grips the mans hand
     and squeezes gideon screams as his bones snap like kindling the
     pistol falls from his grasp 

     blade fires his fist into gideons gut again and again then flings
     the officer across the room sending him smashing into a glasscased
     cabinet bleeding battered gideon struggles to stand 

     blade is all over him kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he
     sinks to the floor in a halfconscious haze

     blade stands over gideons limp form fists clenched breathing
     heavily touching down after his adrenaline high finally he looks
     to karen 

                           blade
               you okay

     karen nods glances at gideon 

                           karen
               how did you know

                           blade
               figured theyd send someone after you 
               thought id wait around and see who 
               showed up

                           karen
               you used me as bait

                           blade
               it worked didnt it

                           karen
               but he couldve 

                           blade
               he didnt get over it

     blade kneels next to gideon he turns the mans head inspects the
     neck the skin behind the ear  

                           karen
               but hes a policeman 

                           blade
               hes a familiar a human who works for 
               the vampires see this mark

     blade pushes aside gideons hair revealing a tiny cryptic symbol
     tattooed into the mans scalp

                           blade
               thats a glyph kind of like a vampire 
               cattle brand that means officer 
               friendly here is someones property 
               any of the other vampires try to 
               bleed him theyll have to answer to 
               friendlys owner 
                    studying the glyph
               this glyph belongs to deacon frost 
               weve been tracking him for a while 
               now 

                           karen
               why in gods name would anyone want to 
               work for them

                           blade
               because theyre vampire wannabes if 
               theyre loyal if they prove 
               themselves then their masters will 
               turn them 

                           karen
               and thats a good thing

                           blade
               for some live forever never get old 
               the ultimate high 

     just then gideon moans blade drags the man up so theyre eye to
     eye

                           blade
               how bout you officer you a good

     blade tears off his glasses karen gasps 

     blades eyes

     arent human nor are they vampire theyre something else  emerald
     green laced with swirling flecks of red 

                           blade

     engine in seconds hes gone tearing off down the street in a cloud
     of exhaust

     we are soaring through the air above the gleaming city skyline
     moving towards the edgewood towers whose windows reflect the blood
     red sinking sun

     int frosts penthouse pool  night

     suffused lighting elegant tilework featuring evocative mosaics the
     quiet strains of classical music  

     mercury

     the lupine gaultier girl from the club glides beneath the water
     surfacing at the deep end we see 

     frost

     lounging in a chair studying a laptop which rests beside him on the
     screen is a digitized image  a page taken from an ancient
     manuscript written in a secret tongue

     officer gideon waits nearby cradling his ruined hand his battered
     face cast downward like a boy whos been called into the principals
     office 

                           gideon
               look i know youre disappointed 

                           frost
               crestfallen

                           gideon
               blade was waiting for me there wasnt 
               anything i could do

     frost nods lapsing into brooding contemplation

                           frost
               tell me something gideon what blood 
               type are you

     gideon hesitates is this a trick question

                           gideon

                           frost

               im interested in the antigens here 
               the agglutination reaction 

     gideon stammers as frost rises in the blink of an eye frost lifts
     gideon from the floor dangling the officer over the deep end of the
     pool by his throat 

                           frost
               im going to guess ab positive

     gideon gurgles as frosts fingernails pierce his flesh drawing
     blood then frost releases him 

     gideon plunges into the pool mercury is on him in a heartbeat
     tearing him apart like a great white consuming a piece of chum the
     water churns violently around them clouding with red

     when its over mercury rises from the pool dripping wet covered
     from head to toe in a crimson sheen 

     she kisses frost hungrily letting gideons blood flow from her mouth
     to his frost flicks a tongue over his lips

                           frost
               ab positive give the man a prize

     below them gideons lifeless body sinks towards the pool bottom his
     police badge twinkling like sunken treasure

     district  junky heaven blade climbs out pulling an automatic
     rifle from the back seat then heading into an alleyway 

     ext back alley  night

     blade makes his way down the alley cautious  he sees mountains of
     trash boardedup windows overlapping layers of gang graffiti  a
     rat crouching on a trash dumpster gnawing on a dead pigeon 

      then a sound behind blade the scuffle of feet  

     blade whirls drawing his sword charging at an approaching shadow
     stopping mere millimeters from decapitating 

     karen

     whos been backed up against the wall her eyes wide with fright
     blades sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm having drawn
     just the slightest taste of blood

                           blade
               what the hell are you doing i could 
               have killed you

     blade lowers his sword karen remembers to breathe she slumps
     tracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with
     her body

                           karen

               just stupid

     karen pushes away from the wall angry 

                           karen

     blade indicates a design amongst the various gangbanger tags that
     looks something like a postmodern hieroglyphic

                           blade
               this isnt a gang tag its a vampire 
               marking it means theres a safehouse

     blade pins tanakas head to the wall turning it to the side 
     revealing the mans glyph its different than gideons looking more
     like a japanese kanji character

                           blade

     back hallway blade pushes towards the rear of the club karen
     follows 

     on the stripper

     we see tanaka behind him pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer
     swinging it up 

     blade unholsters one of his casulls faster than any gunslinger in
     history he fires over his own shoulder blowing tanaka back against

     blade puts his sunglasses back on motions to the elevator then nods

     indecipherable vampire glyphs

                           blade
               this must be where they keep their 
               records 

     he pauses hearing a distant whisper blade signals quiet silently
     leading karen through the stacks towards  

     pearls lair

     a vestibule of sorts leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of
     rice paper shoji screens and tatami mats candles glow within
     illuminating a monstrously obese shadow beyond the translucent rice
     paper walls

     the shadow speaks in a tremulous birdlike voice  the secret
     tongue as blade draws his sword the massive shadow freezes

     a ninehundredpound androgynous vampire of asian origin lounging
     amidst pillowed rice mats wearing a communications headset think of
     a cross between divine and jabba the hutt skin the complexion of
     buttermilk so corpulent he can barely move so engorged with blood
     that hes actually sweating it from the pores of his skin 

     pearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have
     been affixed to counterbalanced arms  this way pearl can access
     information without leaving bed

     lying next to pearl dwarfed by the vampires massive size is the
     chalkwhite body of a recentlydrained naked boy 

     at the sight of blade pearls eyes widen in fear

     it inside is a handheld uv lamp hooked up to a ninevolt battery
     pearl eyes the device fearful  

                           pearl

               questions depending on your answers 
               you might get to have yourself a 
               tanning session 

     blade looks to pearls monitor and sees a digitized image the same
     manuscript deacon had been studying earlier 

                           blade
               what were you in such a big hurry to 
               delete just now

     pearl hesitates blade turns on the lamp pearl howls as the harsh
     light falls upon him blade flicks the light off

     pearl cringes growling his face smoking profusely exposure to the
     uv rays even for one short second has made his face blister like a
     plague victims

                           pearl
                    relenting
               its an epistle a letter frost has

                           blade
               and who is lamagra

     pearl hesitates again  blade turns on the lamp for a longer time
     pearl thrashes covering his face his hands blacken the skin
     sizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath karen has to avert
     her gaze 

     blade turns off the lamp pearl snarls his body quivering with
     poisonous rage

                           pearl
               lamagra is the sleeper 

     blade leans in close so hes eye to eye with pearl

                           blade
               wheres the original pearl you must 
               have it around here somewhere

     pearl sweats blood his flaking sluglike lips quivering 

                           pearl
               the vault 

     blade follows pearls eyes to an armored door then he stands back
     handing the uv rig to karen

                           blade
               if he moves cook him

     blade approaches the vault door sizing up its locking mechanism he
     pulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the
     door arming it with a beep

                           pearl
               please ill give you the combination 
                youll damage the documents 

                           blade
               thats the point

     enraged pearl lunges from his bed karen triggers the uv rig flash
     frying him to a blackened crisp pearl quivers his enormous body
     smoking like a piece of charred meat 

     blade looks back at karen with newfound respect she shrugs

                           karen
               he moved

     blade turns back to the vault setting off the charge boom blade
     kicks the damaged door in knocking it clear off its hinges 

     inside the vault

     ancient papers flutter through the smoky air like windborne leaves
     blade and karen see a luciteencased document  fragments of an
     ancient calligraphied papyrus 

                           karen
               what are these

                           quinn os
               curiosity killed the cat

     blade and karen spin 

      quinn

     mercury and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the
     vault

                           quinn
                    grins
               hola amigo remember me

     karen triggers the uv light but mercury ducks under it ripping it
     from her hands crushing it in a splitsecond the shedemon has her
     claws around karens throat

     as blade reaches for his rifle the vampires converge on him like
     quicksilver they drag karen and blade out 

     pearls bedchamber

     the vampires fling blade against the wall pinning him 

                           quinn
               you took my arm blade but thats 
               okay im growing a new one 

     quinn lifts up his arm a skeletal forearm has grown from the
     stump its got cartilage sinew and muscle but no flesh yet 

                           quinn
               nice huh think ill ever play the 
               piano again
                    shrugging
               you can slice him you can dice him 
               and the man just keeps on coming 

     blade struggles violently but quinn is upon him pounding his fist
     into blade again and again and again  giving him payback with
     compounded interest when its over quinn steps back winded  

     blades head hangs down he gasps wincing every breath sending a
     red hot poker to his gut quinn grabs a hold of blades jaw forcing
     his head up 

                           quinn
               stay with me sweetness im not 
               through with you yet

     quinn pulls blades jacket open sees the bandoleer of mahogany
     stakes he tugs one out admiring it

                           quinn
               teak nice craftsmanship 
                    to the others
               now heres a man who takes his job 
               just a little too seriously dont you 
               think
                    back to blade
               which reminds me blade think i owe 
               you one 

     quinn stabs the stake into blades shoulder blade cries out tries
     to pull free karen whos being held by mercury averts her gaze

                           quinn
               actually if you want to get 
               technical i owe you two

     as quinn reaches for another stake blade starts to laugh

                           quinn
               whats so funny bright eyes

                           blade
               im expecting some company

     its then that quinn notices the micro earcoil radio receiver in
     blades ear as we move in on it we hear a tiny voice squawking from
     it

                           voice
                    filtered
               get down

     blade kicks his feet out sending quinn flying backwards he tears
     free of the vamps holding him and dives forward knocking karen to
     the ground just as 

     boom the wall of pearls bedchamber explodes inward knocking
     quinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet 

     whistler

     stands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be brandishing his
     cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other he balances the
     rifle against his hip like an overthehill gunslinger and opens fire
     on the vampires

     blade rolls snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown
     free from the vault seconds later he and karen are fleeing after
     whistler retreating back through his newly created exit

     int tunnel  night

     the three of them find themselves ankledeep in a flooded sewer
     tunnel running parallel to the archives whistler pauses wheezing
     from overexertion 

                           whistler
               christ im too old for this somebody 
               get me a goddamn wheelchair

     blade leans against the tunnel wall grunting as he yanks the stake
     from his shoulder he then pulls out a lightstick snapping it
     illuminating the area in a green glow  disturbing waves of
     glittering cockroaches 

     meanwhile whistler pulls another explosive device from his backpack
     and sets it against the tunnel wall arming it

                           karen
               how did you find us

     whistler taps a tiny radio headset curled around his ear

                           whistler
               we keep in radio contact 

                           karen
                    incredulous
               youve been listening in the whole 
               time

                           whistler
               you think id let him run loose 
               without a chaperone blade ferrets 
               their ratholes out i map them then 
               we blow them all to kingdom come

     whistler finishes arming the explosive device it beeps he turns
     back to blade and karen referring to a handheld navigation device

                           whistler
               theres a subway line due east of 
               here wed best make tracks 

     int pearls bedchamber archives  night

     an explosion rips through the bedchamber mushrooming outward 

     int black pearl  night

     the explosion continues expanding sending tables drinks and
     zaibatsu clientele flying

     int tunnel  night

     as the group splashes through the water a fireball chases them down
     the tunnel they duck into an alcove narrowly avoiding the flames
     whistler whoops with excitement loving every minute of it but his
     triumph is shortlived for now we hear 

      a deafening chorus of highpitched vampire war cries coming from
     behind karen hazards a look back 

     the vampires

     surge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on highoctane
     there must be a dozen of them now and quinn is right in the lead

     our trio hustles along but whistler stumbles tumbling and sliding
     down a washout the steep incline of the washout makes it virtually
     impossible for whistler to climb back up to the main tunnel

                           karen
               whistler

                           whistler
               go on ill be fine

     karen hesitates but blade yanks her down the tunnel 

                           blade
               he can take care of himself go

     they race through the twisting warren of tunnels taking one turn
     after another the vampires hot on their heels 

     int subway tunnel  night

     blade and karen stumble out into a larger subway tunnel which widens
     into a station stop up ahead we can see the red taillights of a
     train just pulling away from the platform  blade and karen re
     double their efforts lungs burning legs pumping like mad just as
     the train enters the next tunnel 

      they leap dragging themselves up onto the back of the rear
     passenger car blade smashes his fist through the emergency exit
     window then lifts karen up helping her climb through into the
     car  

      but the vampires are still coming crawling along the tunnel walls
     on all fours limbs a blur claws striking the concrete and spewing
     out sparks closing fast too fast 

     quinn

     springs forward snagging blades ankle with his good hand the
     vampires weight threatens to haul blade down blade reaches to his
     backscabbard unsheathes his sword 

     thunk blade brings the sword down on quinns good arm cutting it
     off at the wrist quinn falls to the tracks tumbling head over heels
     back into the darkness 

     the amputated hand

     which continues to clutch at blades ankle starts to melt with a
     cry of disgust blade kicks the thing away he turns and climbs
     through the window 

     int subway car  night 

     karen helps blade inside he sinks to the floor of the otherwise
     deserted car exhausted hes looking ashen now the whites of his
     eyes are shot through with red

     karen gets a good look at blades wounds  the front of his jacket
     is soaked in blood she reaches for him 

                           karen
               youre hurt 

                           blade
               nothing that wont heal by dawn

     blade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small gaspowered
     pistolinjector we saw whistler inject him with earlier he tries to
     load one of the ampoules into it but because of his wounds hes not
     having much luck  

                           blade
                    frustrated
               i need help with this 

     karen nods inserting the ampoule into the gun blade shrugs off his
     jacket holds out his arm karen pauses 

                           karen
               what am i injecting you with

                           blade
                    weakly
               serum  its a human hemoglobin 
               substitute

     karen locates a vein presses the injector against it  blade
     tenses grits his teeth fights to keep his body thrashing as the
     serum enters his bloodstream he grips the wall behind him 
     actually digs his nails into the metal surface  the agony hes
     going through is excruciating like nothing we could imagine 

     when its over he slumps forward spent vulnerable flushed with
     sweat karen stares at him 

                           karen
               youre one of them arent you

     blade turns away from karen filled with selfloathing 

                           blade

     blade throws his sword aside then moves off into the shadows
     disappearing beyond the curtains karen looks to whistler 

                           karen
               why didnt you tell me the truth

               centuries from one hunter to the 
               next 

     whistler extends the sword sighting down the length of it he takes
     a few practice parries  its obvious he used to be quite skilled in
     the art of swordsmanship

                           karen
               why do you hunt them

                           whistler
               habit mostly just like this 

     whistler gestures with his cigarette he finally stubs it out his
     wistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke

                           whistler
               i had a family once  a wife three 
               daughters then a drifter named deacon 
               frost came calling one evening 

                           karen
               he killed them

                           whistler
               eventually he toyed with them first 
               he made me choose do you understand 
               which order they would die in 

     karen stares at whistler horrified

                           karen
               how did you escape

                           whistler
               i didnt he was cruel enough to let 
               me live
                    slapping his brace
               even gave me a souvenir to remember 
               him by

     karen nods  its all falling into place for her now

                           karen
               and now youre using blade to exact 
               your revenge

                           whistler
                    pointedly
               frosts bodycount keeps rising and 
               im not getting any younger am i

     just then we hear a scream come from blades room sounding more
     like the cry of a beast than a man karen takes a step towards
     blades room 

                           whistler
               i wouldnt go in there if i were you 
               its best to leave him alone when hes 
               like this

                           karen
               ill take my chances

     int blades room  night

     karen enters its dark just a trace of moonlight

                           karen
               blade

     no answer then karen sees him  crouched in the corner of the room
     like some kind of nocturnal animal

                           karen
               its dark in here

                           blade
               you get used to the darkness

     karen takes a step towards him

                           karen
               whistler told me about your mother 

     blade clutches the silver locket in his hand it swings back and
     forth like a pendulum

                           blade
               i cant close my eyes without hearing 
               her scream

                           karen
               those arent real memories no one has 
               that kind of recall

                           blade
               i do i remember from day one people 
               staring at me sensing i was 
               different watching the fear grow in 
               their eyes knowing in their hearts i 
               wasnt human

                           karen
               if youre not human then why do you 
               bleed like us 
               ive seen vampire blood you dont 
               have it running through your veins

     blade looks at karen his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight

                           blade
               just get out of here

                           karen
               blade 

     blade turns his eyes glowing with preternatural fury 

                           blade
               i said get out

     karen backs away startled by blades vehemence she exits leaving
     him alone with his demons he holds up one of his empty serum
     ampoules crushing it in his fist

                           frosts voice
               rise and shine little wing

     ext the burning grounds  just before dawn

     fade in on dragonetti his face covered with a black condemned mans
     hood 

     frost stands before him grinning like the cheshire cat hes dressed
     from head to toe in a black motorcycle suit  boots gloves a
     visored helmet tucked under one arm mercury and quinn are standing
     nearby similarly attired 

     were on a stretch of rocky coastline tucked away in a secluded
     cove dragonetti has been stripped bare chained like prometheus to
     an ancient standing stone 

                           dragonetti
                    straining
               what is this where am i

     frost steps forward pulling dragonettis hood off dragonetti stares
     at his surroundings horrified

                           frost
               when was the last time you stopped to 
               appreciate a sunrise dragonetti 
               three four hundred years 

     frost checks his watch then looks to the ocean on the horizon a
     sliver of gold appears 

                           frost
               how do you like that right on time

                           dragonetti
                    snarling
               the other elders will never let you 
               get away with this

     just then the twelve vampire elders emerge behind frost forming a
     circle around dragonetti all wear business suits gloves along with
     hightech sun masks to protect their faces from the lights lethal
     rays 

     they stare at dragonetti like a silent jury his face darkens anger
     rising  but theres a desperation in his eyes now too he speaks in
     the secret tongue

                           dragonetti
                    subtitled
               dont you see you fools hell 
               betray you too hes planning on 
               invoking lamagra himself

     the vampires just smile and shake their heads

                           frost
               the wheel turns old fang guess you 
               just got a little too long in the 
               tooth

     dragonettis cries are cut short as frost forces the aging vampires
     mouth open ripping out his fangs with his bare hands dragonetti
     gurgles and shrieks sounding like a dying animal

     frost turns to face the twelve now his eyes bright with victory he
     pulls on his motorcycle helmet as do mercury and quinn 

     behind them dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no
     avail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him channeled
     inward by the natural formation of the cove  

     dragonetti howls his skin beginning sizzle and smoke then he
     catches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass he thrashes about
     as his flesh starts to run from his body

     the vampire elders

     watch impassive protected by their masks 

      when suddenly twelve figures rise up behind them clad in bike
     helmets and black leather just like frost the intruders grip each
     of the elders in a strangle hold ripping their masks off 

                           frost
               dragonetti was right you were fools 
               to trust me

     frost flips down the visor of his helmet even as 

     the red sun

     rises in all its fiery glory

     one by one the vampire elders heads catch fire skullflesh sizzling
     away  burning down the line of them in successively building
     intensity until all twelve explode in a conflagration of blinding
     white light

     frost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer
     intensity of the occult blast  a blast which sends the skeletal
     bodies of the elders slamming into the rock wall

     when its over frost picks himself back up we see that the only
     thing left of dragonetti and the others are 

     thirteen shadow silhouettes

     permanently etched onto the rocks surface just like the bombing
     victims of hiroshima 

     int whistlers workshop  day

     karen stands at a lab table with whistler preparing a number of
     blood sample vials they are surrounded by host of new medical
     equipment  from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond

     blade emerges from his room looks to karen as if by silent
     agreement last nights words go unacknowledged he straps on his
     bandoleer of stakes secures his scabbard

                           whistler
               going somewhere

                           blade

                           karen
               i made a trip to the hospital last 
               night borrowed some equipment

                           blade
                    sarcastic
               for your miracle cure 

                           whistler
               shes been making real progress 
               blade
                    to karen
               show him 

     karen looks to blade who shrugs she opens a refrigerator removing
     a syringe filled with blue fluid

                           karen
               this is sodium citrate its an 
               anticoagulant we use it to treat 
               bloodclots sometimes vampire blood 
               is thinner than humans though watch 
               what happens when i introduce some 
               into a sample 

     karen gestures to the microscope blade takes a look 

     blades pov

     vampire blood cells swirling about

     karen injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells 
     the reaction is immediate the vampire blood turns black then begins
     violently bubbling

     blade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time  the
     blood on the slide atomizes exploding outward in a fine mist which
     bursts apart the glass lens of the scope 

     whistler laughs thrilled with the results

                           whistler
               can you imagine what a dash of that 
               would do on your sword 

     whistler claps his hand on karens shoulder in approval then limps
     away quickly busying himself with another project blade moves to
     follow but karen stops him 

                           karen
               before you go id like to take a 
               sample of your blood

     blade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve as karen takes her sample
     blade looks to whistler the older man brings a handkerchief to his
     lips coughing into it 

                           karen
               is he sick

                           blade
               cancer

     karen watches as blades blood flows into the vacutainer she fills
     the first then inserts another 

                           karen
               you care about him dont you 

                           blade
               weve got a good arrangement thats 
               all whistler makes the weapons i use 
               them the vampires die  end of 
               story

     karen finishes blade rolls up his sleeve

                           karen
                    pointedly
               my mother used to say that a cold 
               heart is a dead heart

                           blade
               your mother sounds like a hallmark 
               greeting card 

     blade slips his casulls into a shoulder holster then shrugs into his
     leather jacket donning his sunglasses

                           blade
               id wish you luck doc but i never 
               put much stock in optimism

     he heads towards the elevator

     ext chinatown streets  day

     blade makes his way down a street lined with vending stalls 
     passing merchants peddling exotic vegetables and cheap curios
     butcher shops with rows of roast ducks in the window tyro gang
     bangers lounging at the entrance to a video arcade

     blades pov

     even though the streets are crowded the people seem to make way for
     him avoiding eyecontact 

     blade turns into a dark alley ducking into the doorway of a holein
     thewall herbalist shop

     int herbalist shop  day 

     a bell atop the door jingles announcing blades arrival were in a
     dusty cavelike room filled with baskets and bottlelined shelves
     featuring things like toad spleen extract and barking deer wine
     joss sticks burn sending wispy tendrils of incense into the air 

     at the back of the shop an elderly chinese man in a cardigan sits in
     front of a battered television watching a boxing match hes eating
     a bowl of litchi fruit on the counter nearby a spider monkey
     watches attentively 

                           blade
               hows it going kam

                           kam

     kam sets his fruit bowl aside leads blade through a curtain into a
     back room

     int herbalist shop back room  day

     kam hands blade a leather valise he opens it  its lined with tiny
     ampoules of scarletcolored serum blade pulls one out holds it up
     to the light

                           blade
               whistler says im building up a 
               resistance to it

                           kam
               i was afraid that might happen

                           blade
               maybe its time to start exploring 
               other alternatives

                           kam
               theres only one alternative to the 
               serum

     blade nods they both know what that alternative is 

                           blade
               yeah i know

     blade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket 

                           blade
               thanks kam
                    thinking
               one other thing have you ever heard 
               of a vampire called the sleeper

     kam shakes his head blade pulls out the parchment he took from
     pearl

                           blade
               i found this in there archives i need 
               to find someone who can read their 
               language 

     kam studies the parchment

                           kam
               ive heard about a woman named 
               miracia some say shes a mayombero a 
               santeria witch supposedly she lives 
               in that tent community down by the 
               city dump im told she only sees 
               people at night 

     blade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains

     ext chinatown street  day

     blade emerges from the alley into the sunlight then hears his name
     whispered on the wind

                           voice os
               blade

     blade spins scanning his surroundings  did he really hear his
     name or was it just the wind

                           voice os
               blade

     again the taunting voice calls him blades gaze finally settles
     on 

     a man

     sitting on a bench in the deep shade his face obscured by the
     chinese newspaper hes reading theres a little girl sitting stiffly
     beside the man  a look of pure terror written on her face 

                           man
               afternoon blade

     the man lowers his newspaper its deacon frost hes wearing
     sunglasses but otherwise hes seemingly unprotected by the sun 

     blade reaches for his 454  

                           frost
               easy

     frosts hand rests on the back of the girls neck we see his claws
     extend caressing the flesh beneath her chin

                           frost
               wouldnt want our little friend here 
               to wind up on the back of a milk 
               carton would we 

     blade reluctantly lowers his hand frost smiles he takes in a deep
     breath of air savoring it 

                           frost
               beautiful day isnt it 

                           blade
                    confused
               how can you be out here

                           frost
               i dabble in pharmaceuticals medical 
               research weve developed a type of 
               sunblocker using octyl salicylate a 
               few others things 

     on closer examination we see that frost is wearing a translucent
     lotion on his face he touches a finger to his cheek rubs some of
     the lotion between his fingers

                           frost
               its not very effective in direct 
               sunlight but its a start the goal 
               of course is to be like you the 
               daywalker 

                           blade
               i dont buy it

                           frost
               why not the future of our race runs 
               through your bloodstream youve got 
               the best of both worlds blade all of 
               our strengths and none of our 
               weaknesses

                           blade
               maybe i dont see it that way

                           frost

               human again is it spare me the uncle

               cant theyre afraid of you 
                    pointedly
               the humans fear us because were 
               superior they fear us because in 
               their hearts they know their race has 
               become obsolete

     frost watches the marketers stream past sneering in contempt 

                           frost
               look at them just an endless stream 
               of cattle in a mad race to the 
               slaughterhouse 

     frost lifts a silver flask to his mouth taking a swig of blood he
     smacks his lips sighs contentedly 

                           frost
               the pause that refreshes 
                    offering it to blade
               care for some smells good doesnt 
               it pungent with just an 
               irrepressible hint of iron 

                           blade
               pass

                           frost
               you sure now i bled a newborn for 
               this you wont find a drink thats 
               sweeter 

     it takes every ounce of blades selfcontrol to keep from attacking
     frost  and frost senses this pressing his sharp thumbnail against
     the childs jugular

                           frost
               tell me honestly do you really get 
               the same rush from that pasteurized 
               pissserum of yours
                    off blades look
               youre surprised i know about your 
               serum you shouldnt be i know 
               everything about you 

     frost leans forward grinning

                           frost
               you cant keep walking the razors 
               edge blade the day will come  and 
               soon when youll have to choose 
               between our kind and theirs if i 
               were you id take care not to wind up 
               on the wrong end of the fang

     a bead of sweat runs down frosts neck washing away a minute amount
     of the sunblocking cream the patch of exposed skin instantly
     blackens frost gazes upwards at the sun

                           frost
               love to continue this chat but it 
               appears im melting

     frost rises taking the little girl by the hand blade follows his
     hand resting on the butt of his casull

                           blade
               youre not going anywhere

                           frost
                    growling
               watch me

     frosts eyes flicker towards the street  a city bus is rumbling by
     in a heartbeat frost hurls the little girl forward 

      out into the path of the oncoming bus 

     blade has a splitsecond to act its frost or the girl  and for a
     moment we actually think hes going to go for frost 

      but then he dives forward scooping the girl into his arms
     throwing themselves out of the bus path the bus misses them by a
     hair by the time blade looks up again 

      frost is gone blade rises cursing scanning the street as
     marketgoers gather around him

     whip pan to 

     someone sitting astride a motorcycle watching blade from the roof of
     an elevated parking garage the rider is clad from head to toe in a

     blade enters through the loading elevator finding karen and whistler
     hard at work she turns as he approaches  sees him backlit by the
     sun she looks pale the whites of her eyes are streaked with red

                           blade
               any progress

                           karen
               some its been slow 

                           blade
               you dont look so good 

                           karen
               im just tired thats all weve been 
               up all night

     blade nods not buying her explanation he shoots a glance to
     whistler which doesnt go unnoticed by karen

                           karen
               excuse me

     karen turns heading for the back of the workshop

     int workshop  bathroom  night

     karen enters a dingy bathroom turning on the overhead bulb she
     studies her reflection in the mirror above the sink then grimaces as
     she peels the dressing from her wound  the wound is clearly
     infected gangrenous 

                           blade os
               its started

     karen spins startled blade stands behind her he grips her jaw
     turning her head so he can better view the wound

                           blade
               youve got another day or two at most

     karen nods shaken as she moves to leave blade reaches for her arm
     stopping her

                           blade
               for what its worth im sorry

                           karen
               you make it sound like im already 
               dead

     blade just stares at her finally she pulls away

     ext whistlers workshop  dusk

     close on karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows watching the
     sun go down an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her

     cut to

     ext landfill ghetto  dusk

     windy urban desolation blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling
     cardboard and plywood squatters ghetto which has sprung up around
     the city dump children and dogs forage for salvageable items while
     in the distance dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse

     moments later

     blade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and
     ashcan fires a crowd quickly closes in around him suspicious a
     brutish man steps forward challenging him 

                           man
               extranjero ¿quien es

                           blade
               im here to see miracia kam sent me

     the man turns to his fellow squatters whispering after a heated
     debate a gaunt woman steps forward motioning 

                           woman
               this way

     cut to

     int whistlers workshop  night

     whistler and karen sit at a work table karen is looking at a blood
     smear slide through a microscope 

                           karen
               all right lets start with the basics 
                why do vampires need to drink 
               blood

                           whistler
               their own blood cant sustain 
               hemoglobin 

                           karen
               then vampirism is a genetic defect 
               just like hemolytic anemia

     whistler nods

                           karen
               so what about gene therapy

     whistler looks intrigued karen continues

                           karen
               basically youd have to rewrite the 
               victims dna alter it so that the dna 
               will produce proteins capable of 
               generating hemoglobin 

                           whistler
               how

                           karen
               with a retrovirus its injected into 
               the bone marrow cells it causes the 
               hosts dna to mutate theyve been 
               using them to treat sicklecell 
               anemia 

     whistler can hardly believe what hes hearing

                           whistler
               youre serious you actually think 
               this could work

     karen pauses  we can see in her expression that theres something
     shes been holding back

                           karen
               on me yes on blade im not so 
               sure  
                    gravely
               the problem is blade didnt contract 
               the vampire virus from a bite like i 
               did he was born with it the irony 
               is i could probably cure every 
               vampire but him

                           whistler
               then were back to square one arent 
               we sooner or later the thirst always 
               wins

     at that moment the lights in the workshop flicker then go out
     karen looks around the room alarmed 

                           karen
               what happened to the power

                           whistler
                    concerned
               i dont know but the backup 
               generator shouldve kicked in

     a few seconds pass the backup generator still hasnt activated
     whistler moves to the window 

                           whistler
               uv floodlights are down too

     as whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of glass
     shattering coming from the other end of the workshop whistler shines
     the flashlight in that direction we hear more sounds now  water
     draining glass tinkling

     whistler raises a finger to his lips signaling silence he edges
     towards the blackout curtains karen falling in behind him

     int whistlers workshop  tank room  night

     whistler and karen enter cautious 

     the tank

     containing the vampire child has been smashed open its empty now
     with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a
     widening pool  and a trail of tiny bloody footprints leading back
     out into the main workshop

     int whistlers workshop  night

     karen scans the shadows eyes alert we hear a whisper then a
     teasing childish giggle

     whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle shining the beam over
     every inch of the room and just as hes about to complete his
     circuit 

     the child

     leaps from where it had been hiding overhead karen screams
     whistler is knocked to the floor the flashlight spinning from his
     hand 

     the feral child lands atop whistler hissing like a cobra its
     macrocephalic head seems to morph twisting into grotesque
     proportions and just as its about to strike 

     zzzzing whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden
     inside his cane he lunges forward 

     whoosh the child takes off like a blue streak sending test tubes
     and medical equipment crashing to the floor it zips past karen 

                           whistler
               get it

     karen snatches up the flashlight chasing after it as whistler
     struggles to his feet 

     karen sweeps the flashlight around catching only fleeting glimpses
     of the child as it darts through the workshop she reaches a shelving
     unit where whistlers weapons are stored grabs one of the modified
     pistols 

     karen tries to draw a bead on the creature she fires misses fires
     again  shes getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the
     creature is moving closer and 

      suddenly its right in front of her flying through the air fangs
     bared 

     the child knocks karen back against the wall its at her throat
     sinking its claws into her neck karen chokes forcing whistlers
     pistol under the monstrositys chin 

      but then the creature morphs again transforming into a beatific
     little cherubim of a child  and karen hesitates because the child
     seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous pulsing and
     hypnotic and 

      suddenly whistler reaches in from behind yanking the vampire
     childs head back firing a pistol into its skull the creature
     slumps 

     karen cries out disgusted flinging the corpse away from her as it
     continues to writhe 

     thunk whistler swings his canerapier down on the creature brutally
     decapitating it finishing the job then he looks to karen winded

                           whistler
               understand this  they are monsters 
               hesitate for even a moment and youve 
               lost

                           frost os
               words to live by whistler

     whistler spins eyes wide he knows that voice

     deacon frost

     steps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight
     followed by mercury and quinn 

                           frost
               its been a long time hasnt it old 
               friend 

     ext landfill ghetto  miracias cabin  night

     blade is led to a plywood cabin crowded with candlelit altars 
     garish pictures of saints and demons abound alongside bottles of
     roots and herbs steeped in alcohol human bones voodoo dolls 

     miracia 

     sits on a sagging couch outside clutching a deck of wellthumbed
     bicycle playing cards shes ancient with a mouthful of goldcapped
     teeth and cataractclouded eyes blind

                           miracia
               is something wrong my friend

                           blade
               youre blind 

                           miracia
               there are other ways to see sit

     blade approaches uneasy miracia deals out the playing cards on a
     rickety table setting them in nine piles which take on a cross
     formation 

                           miracia
               perhaps you have brought me something 
                an offering for the orishas

     blade tosses a handful of bills on the table miracia nods then
     flips over the first card in the center pile  a oneeyed jack she
     sighs grave 

                           miracia
               hold out your hands

                           blade
               i didnt come here to get my palms 
               read i need something translated

                           miracia
               show me

     blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the
     table miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper touching
     her fingertips to her lips

                           miracia
               sangre written in blood 

     she runs her hands over each line as if it were written in braille
     some of the candles gutter then extinguish themselves as the wind
     around them rises

                           miracia
               this is an old tongue from an old 
               world it concerns lamagra

                           blade
               who is lamagra

                           miracia
               the vampire god this speaks of his 
               return

     miracias fingers search the parchment again

                           miracia
                there will come a day walker
                    reading
               his blood will call the sleeper from 
               beyond the veil of tears

     blade stares at miracia shaken

                           blade
               his blood  

     the old woman nods reaching for a smoldering cigarette

                           miracia
               the day walkers blood is a disparador 
                a trigger you see for lamagras 
               return one need only consume it and 
               the spirit of his ancestors will 
               settle upon him
                    reading
               and the sleeper will rise from the 
               shadows anew cleansing the world in a 
               tide of blood

                           blade
                    recalling the phrase
               the blood tide

                           miracia
                    nodding
               yes the vampire apocalypse it is 
               said that all who feel its taint will 
               succumb to the thirst 

                           blade
               how do i stop it

     miracia shrugs spreading her hands

                           miracia
               the great wheel turns my friend the 
               dark is rising how would you fight a 
               shadow 

     miracia sits back slumping into her chair the candles have burnt
     themselves down to nothing 

                           miracia
               i am tired dawn is coming 

                           blade
               but i just got here 

                           miracia
               youve been here longer than you 
               think 

     blade rises looking to the horizon incredibly dawn is coming as
     he stands there mystified the wind picks up sweeping the parchment
     fragment out of his hand he tries to snatch it back but the
     fragment is quickly borne away he watches it disappear into the sky
     then turns back 

     miracia is gone blade glances around him but shes nowhere to be
     found 

     camera pulls back

     isolating blade amidst the ghostly squalor from our vantage point
     he looks like any other homeless phantom

     int whistlers workshop  dawn

     blade steps out from the elevator into the workshop 

     the place has been trashed it looks like a tornado touched down in
     his absence blade pulls out one of his 454s cautious 

                           blade
               whistler

      and then he stops dead in his tracks

     whistler

     has been strung up by his arms against the far wall tortured and
     left for dead in response to blades voice a moan escapes the dying
     mans lips

     blade rushes to the wall cutting whistler down with his sword
     gently lowering him to the floor as he cradles the old man in his
     arms blade sees the primary wound  two ragged puncture marks along
     whistlers throat

                           blade
               jesus whistler what did they do to 
               you

     whistler opens his eyes struggling to speak 

                           whistler
               frost took her 

     whistler spasms and coughs wincing from the pain

                           blade
               dont try to talk 

                           whistler
               listen you have to  finish me off 
               you dont want me coming back

                           blade
               no we can treat the wounds 

     but whistler is shaking his hand

                           whistler
               too far gone you know that

     blades at a complete loss

                           blade
               whistler i cant

     whistler clutches at blades arm his eyes burning with conviction

                           whistler
               yes you can now get on with it 

     as much as hed like to deny it blade knows that whistler is right
     he pulls a stake from his bandoleer hesitates

                           blade
               whistler i 

                           whistler
                    cutting him off more gentle now
               i know 
                    forcing a smile
               just be quick about it will you do 
               it right

     blade fights back tears with a wretched moan he turns his head and
     drives the stake into whistlers chest whistler gasps blade wraps
     his arms around the older man holding him tight as the life runs out
     of him rocking back and forth 

     after a while the rocking stops and blade lays whistler on the
     floor then something catches his eye 

     a sharp viewcamcorder

     resting nearby labeled play me blade reaches for the camcorder
     cues the tape  frosts face appears on the tiny builtin screen

                           frost
               hello blade by the time you watch 
               this whistler will no doubt be 
               winging his way to heaven thanks to 
               your capable hands if it makes any 
               difference to you he put up quite a 
               fight

     frost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek

                           frost
               now im sure youre wondering about 
               ms jansens wellbeing shes alive 
               and kicking  ambulatory as they 
               like to say in the trade whether or 
               not she remains so is entirely up to

               edgewood towers well be waiting with 
               baited breath

     the tape cuts to static blade throws the camcorder against the wall
     it shatters into a dozen pieces

     blade turns now his eyes falling on the medical equipment karen
     brought from the hospital he moves to the refrigerator removing a
     canister labeled sodium citrate then he draws his sword we can
     practically see the wheels turning within his mind 

     moments later

     blade stands before the open flames of one of the furnaces heating
     his sword in the fire he withdraws it  its molten red

     blade turns dousing the molten hot sword into the sodium citrate
     canister the refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat causing the
     sword to steam and hiss

     when blade withdraws the smoking sword we see that the gleaming
     steel has changed colors taking on a bluish tinge just like the
     sodium citrate it was immersed in blade smiles to himself
     satisfied

     karen is escorted into the room by mercury she gestures to a chair
     at the end of a long table karen sits 

     frost 

     leans forward out of the shadows resting his elbows on the table
     hands steepled together 

                           frost
               well here we are doctor

     a cigarette appears in frosts hand in the blink of an eye the
     cigarette is lit burning the movements are so quick we barely have
     time to register them

               a few thousand scattered about the 
               globe in the past weve had to 
               restrict our numbers for fear of 
               discovery that wont be necessary 
               after tonight 

                           karen
               what happens then

                           frost
               the blood tide our longprophesied 
               holy war against the humans theres a 
               force you see  a spirit that exists 
               in our blood ive discovered a way to 
               invoke it

                           karen

                           frost
               thats right the answers were there 
               all along of course scribbled down 
               in the forgotten languages of my kind 
               waiting for someone with the patience 
               to decipher them 
               my elders were foolish enough to 
               dismiss them as wives tales but i 
               knew better 
                    beat
               imagine my surprise when blade turned 
               out to be the key which would set that 
               force free 

     frost sits forward now impassioned

                           frost
               lamagra isnt a physical being hes a 
               spirit requiring a flesh and blood 
               host in order to manifest himself

                           karen
               you

                           frost
               who better to usher in the blood tide 

     karen shakes her head protesting 

                           karen
               theres no need for any of this your 
               condition can be treated whistler and 
               i were working on a cure when 

                           frost
               what makes you think we want to be 
               cured blood is only part of the 
               equation the hunt the killing 
               thats what the thirst is really 
               about

                           karen
               but you use blood banks 

                           frost
               only as a last resort preserved blood 
               is inferior theres no flavor left to 
               it no life 
                    rising from his seat
               fortunately ive found a way around 
               that particular obstacle 

     frost moves to the end of the room he pushes a button with a hum
     the wall slides open revealing something karen wishes shed never
     seen  living blood banks

     three sedated humans

     have been hooked up to iv feeds which replenish various nutrients as
     their blood is drained from them shunts have been implanted in their
     forearms which serve as taps 

                           frost
               under these conditions i can keep a 
               donor alive for years producing 
               anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints 
               of blood
                    admiring his charges
               of course this is just a pilot 
               program really once the tide comes 
               well need to expand production so 
               many more mouths to feed  

     karen turns away overwhelmed by revulsion 

                           karen
               youre a monster

                           frost
               why because we live at another 
               species expense your people farm 
               cattle and veal dont they fattening 
               them up with steroids its called 
               evolution doctor survival of the 
               fittest 

     frost stares at karen with an intense uncompromising gaze 

                           frost
               i have a wakeup call for the human 
               race youre no longer at the top of

     a telephoto view of frosts penthouse the windows are polarized
     blocking out the suns harsh rays

     blade lowers a pair of binoculars hes standing on the roof of a
     building across the street he hefts an airlauncher rifle up into
     firing position 

     bang an iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air
     between the two buildings sinking into the concrete facade of
     frosts penthouse blade secures his end of the rope he slips a
     pulley over the rope grabs hold of two handles and leaps off the
     roof ledge

     whoosh blade slides towards frosts penthouse a good twenty stories
     above street level a second before he reaches the windows blade
     lets go momentum sends him crashing through in a shower of glass

     int frosts penthouse  day

     an alarm is ringing sunlight streams in through the broken window
     two vampire guards who have been caught in the sudden swath of light
     are burning up before our eyes blade climbs to his feet 

     a third vampire

     leaps at him blade spins flipping the vampire over his shoulder
     sending him straight through one of the other windows 

     ext frosts penthouse  day

     the vampire tumbles earthward screaming as the suns rays ignite his
     body falling like a human comet

     int frosts penthouse  day

     blade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall 

     int frosts penthouse hallway  day

     to blades right is the inner chamber with the waterfall walls as
     another vampire approaches blade readies his sword 

                           vampire
               you think im afraid of that toothpick 
               of yours

               you should be ive made some 
               improvements

     and with that blade thrusts his blackened sword forward right
     through the vampires chest 

     the creature shrieks and atomizes fwoosh flying apart in a fine
     beaded spray of blood mist 

     up ahead are a set of steel doors with a timelock mechanism blade
     draws a casull blasts away at the lock then shoulders the doors
     open 

     int frosts sleeping chamber  day

     we are in a windowless vaultlike room dominated by a series of
     hightech stainless steel sarcophagi think of a hyperbaric coffin 
     each unit possessing a small faceplate window through which the 
     sleeping subject can be viewed

     blade unsheathes his sword he grabs the lid of the first
     sarcophagus heaving upward with a pneumatic hiss the lid rises
     belching out a cloud of condensation mist 

     as the mist clears revealing the occupant within blade raises his
     sword ready to plunge it downward  only its not deacon frost who
     rests beneath him its 

     vanessa

     blades mother although some thirty years have passed since the
     events of our prologue vanessa looks exactly the same  vibrant
     beautiful full of life her eyes open

                           vanessa
               jason

                           blade
               mother  

     vanessa rises from the sarcophagus tears staining her cheeks

                           vanessa
               ive missed you so much jason 
                    drawing closer

               through how much ive wanted to see 
               you  

     blade falters his mind reeling what hes seeing is incomprehensible
      his mother is dead yet here she is in the flesh reaching out to
     him and 

      flashing a mouthful of viperlike fangs she snarls and strikes
     brutally raking her claws across blades face knocking the sword
     from his grasp 

     a trio of blackclad vampires

     led by mercury step from the shadows where theyd been waiting all
     along theyre armed with tasers which they fire en masse 

     blade is hit by the taser darts from all sides he writhes as
     electricity courses through him then collapses in a heap he labors
     to lift his head looking up at vanessa  

                           blade
               but you  died 

                           vanessa
                    a hellish smile
               deacon brought me back 

                           blade
               fight him 

     as if on cue frost appears at vanessas side wrapping a proprietary
     arm about her waist kissing the nape of her neck she leans into him
      an act of practiced intimacy

                           frost
               she cant shes one of my thralls 
               now she has about as much free will 
               as a puppet on a string
                    looking at vanessa
               you love me dont you vanessa 

                           vanessa
               yes

     frost kisses vanessa hungrily then he kneels and reaches into
     blades jacket retrieving a vial of blades serum

                           frost
               what do we have here your precious 
               serum i dont think youll be needing 
               this anymore

     frost crushes the vial in his fist blade struggles to reach frost
     stretching a palsied hand upwards 

                           blade
               please  

                           vanessa
               listen to your father jason its 
               going to be a better world

     blade stares at vanessa uncomprehending 

                           frost
               dont look so surprised blade youve 
               spent your life looking for the 
               vampire who fathered you well you can

                    gripping blades chin

     blades eyes widen in shock frost simply laughs

               its true blade youve got my blood 
               running through your veins

               woman on her way home alone you were 
               conceived the night i tore my fangs 
               into your mothers flesh 

     frost swings his fist into blades skull everything goes black 

     cut to

     int armored truck  night

     fade in as blade opens his eyes still groggy his face beaded with
     sweat feverish his hands have been bound tightly behind his back
     with manacles and chains 

     karen

     sits nearby watching him from the steady rocking motion and the
     sounds of traffic outside its evident that they are in the back of
     a moving truck

                           karen
               are you all right

                           blade
                    weakly

                           blade
               how long have we been driving

                           karen
                    shaking her head
               i dont know i woke up just before 
               you did 

     as he struggles to sit up she crosses over to him blade shuts his
     eyes for a moment fighting a wave of pain

                           karen
               is it bad

                           blade
                    nodding
               we get out of this alive maybe ill 
               take that miracle cure of yours

     karen doesnt respond instead she looks away how in the world is
     she supposed to tell him this

                           karen
                    quietly
               it wont work on you

                           blade
               what are you talking about

     karen forces herself to meet his gaze

                           karen
               your conditions congenital the 
               genetic mutations occurred in utero 
               all the other victims contracted 
               vampirism after birth 

     blade stares at karen disbelieving who could imagine a more
     horrifying irony shes crying now she cant help it

                           karen
               i cant cure you blade i can cure 
               myself but i cant cure you
                    beat
               im so sorry

     blades head sinks the last vestiges of hope draining out of him

     and then as if the final stake were being pounded in the truck
     lurches to a stop we hear the engine being killed then footsteps
     approaching and then a series of bolts being shifted as 

      the back of the truck is thrown open frost stands there
     grinning flanked by mercury quinn vanessa and a halfdozen other
     vampire associates 

                           frost
               welcome home children

     ext the bank of erebus  night

     blade and karen are dragged from the back of the truck which is
     revealed now to be an armored car 

     the bank of erebus

     rises up before them a towering beauxarts edifice situated in the
     heart of the citys highpriced financial district  one of the many
     institutions owned and operated by the vampire enclave

     frost starts up the marble steps towards a grand triplearched
     entrance flanked by corinthian columns karen and blade are dragged
     along after him 

     int bank of erebus  atrium  night

     frost leads his vampires into a highceilinged atrium moving towards
     a bank of elevators  one of the doors of which is outfitted with a
     hightech handkey id system

     frost places his palm on the id screen the screen glows green
     acknowledging his identity in response the doors hiss open

     int security elevator  night

     blade and karen are pulled inside the elevator the control panel
     buttons have vampire glyphs rather than numbers frost presses the
     bottom one the doors close with a whoosh and the car descends 
     down down down

     frost glances over at karen smiling amiably

                           frost
               on its surface this building houses 
               one of the citys oldest financial 
               institutions  and for over 
               twohundred years its served our 
               corporate needs look beneath the 
               surface however and youll discover 
               another truth entirely 

     the elevator chimes having arrived at its destination the doors
     hiss open revealing 

     int the temple of night 

     a vast barrelvaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches
     out before us  an underground cathedral of sorts wrought from
     alabaster and marble restrained elegant replete with dark
     splendor

                           frost
               as above so below

     torches burn in wall sconces casting everything in a warm amber
     glow frost takes in the beauty of the place

                           frost
               welcome to our hall of ancients 
               doctor we call it the temple of 
               night

     blade and karen are led to the middle of the room where a stone
     altar rises up from a dais blade is roughly thrown to the ground he
     kneels there eyes cast downward broken his system being assaulted
     by the devastating effects of the thirst 

     quinn and mercury pick their way through blades discarded gear
     quinn picks up the punching dagger admiring it 

     frost turns to mercury whos been holding blades scabbarded sword

                           frost
               lets see this sword of his

     mercury draws the sword handing it to frost he sights down the
     length of it testing its weight with a flick of his wrist he
     lashes out slashing blades cheek open 

                           frost
               still quite sharp i see

     blade feebly struggles to rise frost clubs him on the back of the
     neck with the sword pommel blade crumples karen tries to pull free
     but quinn holds her tight

                           karen
               blade 

                           frost

               cant hear you now its the thirst 
               you see it already has him in its 
               grip

     frost reaches down dragging blades head up by his hair karen
     watches on as frost continues to taunt him

                           frost
               how long has it been since you had 
               your serum twelve hours more you 
               must be quite thirsty by now

     he crouches down so hes eye to eye with blade

                           frost
               what does it feel like is your blood 
               on fire are you burning up inside 
               give in to the thirst blade embrace 
               your true nature

     blade shivers grits his teeth its like hes going through heroin
     withdrawal 

                           blade
                go to hell 

     frost smiles his eyes burning with an infernal glow

                           frost
               ive got news for you blade were 
               already here

     frost turns to the others motioning

                           frost
               take him to the sanctuary its time 
               he was bled

     the other vampires retreat dragging blade along with them karen is
     left alone with frost and quinn

                           frost
               id let you watch the proceedings 
               doctor but im afraid that privilege 
               is reserved for members of my own 
               race dont worry though ive made 
               alternate arrangements for you

     frost motions and quinn drags karen towards 

     the mouth of a pit

     some forty feet deep its lichenencrusted stone walls worn smooth
     over time as frost gestures to the yawning darkness beneath them
     quinn forces karen towards the edge 

                           frost
               we call this the bone pit its where 
               we keep our mistakes the ones who 
               couldnt successfully make the 
               transition from human to vampire 

     frost reaches out caressing karens neck puncturing the soft flesh
     beneath her chin with a razored fingernail

                           frost
               theyll feed on anything given the 
               chance  animals corpses even other 
               vampires

     frost nods karen struggles against quinn but its no good in a
     manner of seconds shes falling 

     int bone pit  night

      making a decidedly rough landing on a heap of bones far below she
     groans taking stock of her battered body

     up above

     deacon watches from the lip of the pit amused 

                           frost
               of course a strapping young woman 
               like yourself  well i think you just 
               might be considered finger food

     and with that hes gone stepping away from the pit

     int temple of night  bleeding chamber  night

     we are in a small elevated antechamber which is situated above the
     main vampire sanctuary

     blade 

     now weakened to the point of collapse is being lashed to a racklike
     device by iron chains 

     mercury and her cohorts move efficiently quickly securing him when
     they are through the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of
     winchdriven chains 

     with every turn of the winch crank the chains are drawn tighter
     causing blade to cry out until at last he is suspended in midair
     spreadeagle 

     frost

     approaches still carrying blades sword

                           frost
               its been a long road hasnt it such 
               a pity whistler led you so far astray 

     frost cocks his head to the side studying blades face

                           frost
               i dont blame you though i want you 
               to know that even after all youve 
               done i understand blade i really 
               do its the human side of you which 
               has corrupted your reasoning made you 
               weak but well take care of that 
               wont we

     blade struggles to lift his head forcing himself to match frosts
     gaze shaking with hatred

                           blade
               id kill myself  before i turned 
               into something like you

     frost just smiles and shakes his head

                           frost
               no you wouldnt im going to bleed 
               you dry blade all the poison that 
               makes you human 
                    drawing closer
               when the tide comes youll be begging 
               me put you through the change 

     frost lifts up blades sword methodically slitting blades wrists
     one by one he makes the cuts lengthwise opening up the cephalic and
     basilic veins with surgical precision

     blood wells up from the fresh wounds running down blades forearms
     collecting in a cistern beneath his feet 

     frost watches the steady inexorable process then nods satisfied
     he looks to the others who are gathered behind him watching on with
     silent reverence

                           frost
               its done we should ready ourselves 
               for the ritual of invocation

     frost leads mercury quinn and the others from the sanctuary

     blade struggles futilely against his bonds crying out in
     frustration his body eventually sagging from exhaustion 

                           vanessa os
               theres no use fighting us jason 

     blade looks up focusing now on 

     vanessa 

     who has remained behind blade stares at her as terrible as his
     physical torment is his mothers betrayal is infinitely worse

                           blade
               how could you be a part of this

                           vanessa
               these are my people now im one of 
               them

                           blade
               you dont have to be 

                           vanessa
               you dont understand ive killed 
               ive hunted and ive enjoyed it 

     she draws closer caressing her sons face theres just a hint of
     creepy eroticism in her action a dash of incest 

                           vanessa
               i wish you could see the world as i 
               do deacon opened my eyes theres no 
               turning back from that

                           blade
               i dont believe that

                           vanessa
               you will time is on our side sooner 
               or later the thirst always wins

     vanessa turns away now blade cries after her 

                           blade
               mother

     vanessa pauses looking back smiling cruelly

                           vanessa
               your mother died the night you
               were born 

     and with that shes gone melting into the shadows 

     cut to

     int the bone pit  night 

     karen rises wary taking in her shadowed surroundings 

     heaps of human bones

     are piled against the pit walls  skulls ribcages femurs tibias
      all picked clean of flesh some of the skulls have large canine
     like fangs  the remnants no doubt of longdeceased vampires

     suddenly we hear a whisper of sorts the soft clinking of bone
     fragments grinding together 

     karen spins trying to place the source of the sound then she hears
     the sound again behind her now closer

                           revenant os
               karennnnn 

     karen looks up with a growing sense of dread

     a face

     emerges from the darkness pallid cadaverous shedding its
     desiccated flesh lidless eyes like black marbles slick with
     vaseline a mouth like a raw wound 

                           revenant
               karreennnnnn i never thought id see 
               you againnnnn

     karen backs away realizing who shes standing before

                           karen
               curtis

     what used to be curtis snarls knocking karen back into the drift
     pile of bones it pins her to the ground kneeling above her
     gurgling through its gutted trachea

                           curtis revenant
               tell me karennn  ever have second 
               thoughts  about us

     karen screams trying to force the revenant away from her but it
     lunges closer lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a
     pathetic approximation of a french kiss

     she fumbles behind her choking grabbing hold of a human femur
     blindly swinging it upward 

     crack the blow shatters the curtisthings jaw it rears back
     falling to the side 

     karen crawls out from under its weight swinging the femur again and
     again 

     crack crack crack karen pummels the howling horror driving it
     back until the femur actually splinters in half the creatures head
     hangs at an awkward angle now its neck broken  but still it
     advances dragging itself back up

     sobbing karen retreats clutching the splintered femur like a
     makeshift dagger

     curtis charges at her a blur of slashing claws at the last moment
     karen ducks thrusting the bone dagger up into curtis chest 

     curtis impales himself right through the heart for one split
     second his eyes widen in surprise 

      and then he goes into a deathspasm vomiting up a spray of
     caustic vampire bloodbile spattering karen she sinks to her knees
     gasping as the thing that used to be curtis shrivels up melting
     away into burbling puddle

     after a beat karen rises and moves to the pit wall running her
     hands over the lichenslick surface searching for a way out the
     mortar between the brickwork is ancient crumbling 

     karen looks to the ground reaching for one of the splintered femurs
     she pounds it into the mortar between two bricks  and it holds
     working as a makeshift piton

     karen reaches for another broken femur lodging it a foot above the
     first she hauls her body up now suspending her weight from the two
     makeshift pitons again they hold

     trembling from exertion karen pulls the right piton free hanging
     solely from her left hand now though her handhold is precarious she
     manages to swing the right hand up again pounding that piton another
     foot above the left

     in this slow torturous manner karen begins to climb her way up out
     of the pit

     int temple of night  bleeding chamber  night

     blade hangs from his chains head slack eyes halflidded and
     lusterless his skin has grown ashen as his lifes blood has been
     bled away

     mercury appears before him accompanied by quinn she bends in close
     to kiss blade lightly on the lips

                           mercury
               it wont be long now lover 

     quinn draws alongside her hefting blades punching dagger he places
     it against blades throat slowly applying pressure at this point
     blades too weak to even resist

                           quinn
               we should finish him off

                           mercury
                    shaking her head
               no deacon wants him turned

     quinn releases blade disgusted 

                           quinn
               fucking waste if you ask me

     as mercury and quinn exit the camera drops down to the cistern
     beneath blades feet we follow the blood which has collected there
     as it flows into a crude drain and 

     int sanctuary  night 

      emerges from the ceiling of the sanctuary below the stream of
     blood is directed down the channels of a spiral column where it
     finally pools into a waiting chalice

     pull back to reveal

     the sanctuary in full a large circular chamber the perimeter of
     which is lined with recessed alcoves housing the remains of the
     vampire ancients set into the sanctuary walls like cells in a hive

     deacon frost

     stands in the center of the chamber allowing vanessa to clothe him
     in ceremonial regalia  gleaming centuriesold armor he pauses
     kissing her hungrily

     having finished suiting up he turns to face the vampires who have
     been faithful to his cause  mercury quinn a host of others a
     hush settles upon them theres an excitement in the air a sense
     that something remarkable is about to happen

                           frost
               tonight is the night weve waited our 
               entire lives for tonight the

               world tonight the age of man comes 
               to an end 

     the vampires bellow out a chorus of cheers their voices resonating
     off the stone walls like thunder

     karens hands appear over the lip of the bone pit she heaves herself
     up collapsing onto the floor 

      but theres no time to rest even now she can hear the vampires
     cheering she drags herself to her feet letting the voices guide

     karen slips around a corner guarded searching she sees blade
     strung up before her seemingly lifeless

     karen studies the chains which bind blade following them back to
     their source at the winch she releases the brake on the winch crank
     sending the chains rattling down through the overhead pulleys which
     suspend them 

     blade crumples to the floor lying still karen is at his side in an
     instant 

                           karen
                    whispering urgent
               blade

     blades eyes flicker open fixing on her inhuman hes shaking
     like an alcoholic going into delirium tremens

     int temple sanctuary  night

     vanessa hands frost the chalice containing blades blood he lifts it
     up for all to see the vampires begin to chant en masse some long
     forgotten invocation in the vampire tongue

                           frost
                    grinning to himself
               and what rough beast its hour come 
               round at last slouches towards

                           karen

     he clutches his stomach experiencing phenomenal pain

                           blade
                    gasping
                tearing me  apart

               well never get out of here alive if 
               you dont

     blade suppresses a shudder simply keeping himself from attacking her
     takes every ounce of his resolve

                           blade
               i cant  i wont be able to stop

               stronger i know it is

     karen matches blades gaze steeling herself the truth is shes
     terrified 

     blade stares back at her at this moment he wants what karen is
     offering more than anything hes ever desired and so he rises

     int temple of night  sanctuary  night

     frost continues drinking down the blood when suddenly a force
     seizes his body he throws his head back eyes rolling to white
     flinging the chalice aside

     and as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch we see the
     stone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder 
     as if some force within were trying to break free

     int antechamber  night

     karen turns her head to the side baring her neck offering herself
     to blade blade opens his mouth his canines elongate he lowers his

     frost shakes possessed by an unseen force a wind picks up from
     nowhere swirling about the chamber accompanied by a strange
     humming 

     suddenly one of the tombs bursts open a wraithlike spirit rushes
     outward in a fountain of light penetrating frosts body

     then another tomb splits apart then another and another  until a
     torrent of spiritwraiths are surging into frost buffeting him about
     like a scarecrow in a cyclone

     mercury vanessa and the other vampires back away apprehensive
     humbled by what theyre witnessing

     blade moans sinking his teeth deeper karens head rolls back her
     eyes open  glassy unseeing  as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her 

     she shudders her breath quickening falling into a synchronous
     rhythm with blades her fingers dig deep into his back clawing
     downward tearing into him  

     shes not karen anymore  shes a red blood cell an erythrocyte
     spinning in a river of plasma roaring up blades femoral artery
     racing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the
     deafening breath of god which blots all other sounds out of
     existence and were 

     cutting back and forth now

     between frosts transformation and blades each of them growing
     stronger by the second caught in an everincreasing feedback loop of
     expanding energy until

     blade rises to his full height his strength has more than returned
     its been doubled by the infusion of real blood and theres
     something else in his gaze now too  an animal fury that was missing
     before blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness 

                           karen
                    hesitant
               are you  all right

     blade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists snapping them apart
     like toys he flexes his hands  fingernails lengthening to tapered
     points and he smiles offering us a view of his canines which have
     elongated into fangs

     somersaulting down to the floor below landing on his feet like a
     predatory cat

                           blade
               who dies first

                           frost
                    growling to the others
               take him

     quinn growls stepping forward armed with blades punching dagger
     he offers his second new hand up for view 

                           quinn
               grew another hand for you sweetmeat 
                    tossing the dagger to his new hand
                and now im gonna kill you with it

     quinn charges blade meets the vampire headon dropping into a low
     kick and sweeping the vampires legs out from under him he spins
     behind quinn  

                           blade
               lets see if you can grow a new one
               of these

     blade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket
     sleeve pulling out a retractable stranglewire which he twists
     around quinns throat 

     blade tightens the wire decapitating quinn the headless body
     staggers about then drops to the cavern floor blade scoops up his
     punching dagger 

                           blade
               next

     mercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse blade
     launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamps face snapping
     its neck 

     mercury has blades 454 casulls she aims them at him 

                           mercury
               have a taste of your own medicine

     as she fires blade tucks and rolls knocking one of the guns from
     her hand the guns spins across the floor where its scooped up
     by 

     karen

     who takes aim at an approaching vamp blowing it away

     meanwhile blade traps mercurys other hand disarming her flipping
     her over his shoulder he hefts his casull blasting her into
     eternity 

     a bloodbath ensues blade moves like speedpersonified firing off
     one two three headshots with brainnumbing accuracy cutting down
     the vampires where they stand 

     its an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and
     clickcachingclick blade and karen have spent their bullets
     and 

                           frost os
               enough

     blade turns to face 

     frost 

     whos advancing clutching blades own sword in his hand he thrusts
     the sword forward 

     blade presses the griptrigger on his punching dagger ching the
     two side blades spread out we hear the rasp and clang of metal on
     metal as blade manages to trap the swordpoint between two of the
     dagger blades 

     for a moment both men are eye to eye their weapons locked together
     then frost forces blade backwards 

     what happens next is the most blindinglyfast sword fight ever
     exposed to celluloid both men fueled by superhuman speed lunge
     and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves

     frost lands a powerful blow on blades shoulder the swordedge
     biting deep into the flesh blade screams frost withdraws the sword
     for another strike 

      until blade sees an opening and takes it slicing frosts left arm
     off at the shoulder 

     the severed arm releases blades sword but the arm doesnt fall to
     frost and blades mutual surprise the arm floats in midair bleeding
     red quivering like zerog liquid then slurping back to frosts arm
     stump to reattach itself

     undaunted blade slices the punching dagger into frosts midsection
     meeting only liquidlike resistance the moment blade withdraws his
     dagger frosts flesh seals itself up again

     blade hesitates now uncertain  and frost laughs understanding
     what has happened

                           frost
               youre too late blade im already 
               changing dont you see the sleeper 
               has awakened im not just frost 
               anymore im becoming a god now 
               blood incarnate

     even as frost utters the words his body begins to ripple and morph
     bleeding red taking on the characteristics of liquid he doesnt
     walk so much now as flow hes become a threedimensional creature of
     animated blood a blood demon

     on karen

     as she watches frosts transformation wideeyed she sees blades
     discarded sword reaches for it  suddenly a shadow moves on the
     periphery of her vision 

     vanessa

     rushes at karen in a nearblur the snarling hellion is upon karen in
     an eyeblink slamming her down against the temple floor pinning
     her 

                           vanessa
               did you think id forgotten you you 
               little whore

     back to frost

     who towers above blade swaying back and forth in his new liquid
     like form

                           frost
               you cant hurt me anymore 

     whoosh frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood howling
     with laughter then just as suddenly 

      splashes back to earth spreading out in a widening pool in the
     blink of an eye he streams through blades feet resolidifying
     behind blade blade spins swings his dagger 

     once again frost morphs into bloodform he races around blade in a
     series of spouting arcs turning from bloodform to solid and back
     again in a series of splitsecond transformations

     blade whirls striking with his dagger and missing every time 

     whoosh frost suddenly dissipates splashing away into a million
     zerog blood bubbles vanishing blade spins unnerved trying to
     pinpoint his foes next manifestation

                           blade
               where are you

     frosts voice answers from all directions

                           frost
               everywhere

     a droplet of blood

     spatters the floor at blades feet blade looks up 

     a shower of blood

     rains from above coalescing into frost as he sweeps down on blade
     like a giant bird of prey crushing him against the temple floor 

                           frost
               you want my blood so much take it

     frosts arms elongate and liquefy flowing into two snakelike spouts
     of blood  the rest of frost remains solid the bloodspouts twist
     around blades neck melding together completely encasing blades
     head in a bubble of blood

     blade claws at the bloodbubble as if it were a solid object that he
     could dislodge but his fingers just pass through it

     back to vanessa

     as she wraps a hand around karens throat choking her

     as karen struggles she frees a hand sliding it down to her hip
     pocket digging something out  whistlers vampire mace canister

     she forces it up between them triggering a jet of toxic mist into
     vanessas face 

     vanessa recoils howling her head smoking as if it were doused with
     formic acid skin sloughing off from her skull karen lunges for
     blades sword 

     back to frost and blade

     blade is drowning in frosts blood his eyes bulge oxygen bubbles
     stream from his mouth frost leans in close his face a twisted mask
     of insanity

                           frost
               i was wrong about you blade you were 
               never one of us youre a traitor to 
               your race 

                           karen os
               get away from him

     frost looks up  karen is wielding blades sword she brings it down
     on frost severing the bloodtendrils which envelope blade the
     bloodbubble dissolves instantly flowing away from blades face he
     gasps chokes in air 

     frost backs away horrified his bloodtendrils dont reform
     instead the lay where they fell solidifying into crystalline
     powder

                           karen
               blade

     karen flings the sword at blade 

     the sword 

     spins end over end its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating
     pinwheels of candlelight as blade catches the weapon by its hilt

     blade rises advancing on frost sword outstretched and frost
     retreats uncertain now

                           blade
               guess youre not quite as invulnerable 
               as you thought

                           frost
               youre wrong  a few minutes more and 
               my transition will be complete even 
               your sword wont be able to affect me 
               then

                           blade
               you dont have a few minutes frost

     frost eyes blade warily then lunges towards vanessa sweeping behind
     her blade follows but even as he raises his sword to strike frost
     spins vanessa around using her body as a shield

     blade hesitates stopping the sword in midstrike catching his
     mothers gaze  her face is monstrous now scarred by karens
     poisonous mace piteous really 

     frost smiles for hes found a final weakness of blades to exploit

                           frost
                    laughing cruelly
               just as i thought still chained to 
               your mothers breast after all these 
               years

     in the same instant vanessas features morph taking on the angelic
     youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo

                           frost
                    gloating
               youre too human blade 

                           blade
                    steeling himself
               its because im human that i can do 
               this

     frosts eyes widen in shock but he has no time to react for 

     blade is already lunging forward driving the swordpoint through
     vanessas chest on into frosts heart it strikes the stone behind
     them shattering and 

     frost and vanessa howl as one their screams rising to an unendurable
     intensity as the two vampires go nova exploding into an expanding
     ball of light and atomizing blood

     blade is thrown back off his feet having to shield his eyes from the
     backlash of occult energy as a near tidal wave of blood surges over
     him  

     ext bank of erebus  city street  night

     every door and window of the bank is blown outward from the force of
     the explosion while along the street manhole covers flip from their
     moorings spinning up into the air like dimes being buoyed by
     geysers of blood

     int temple sanctuary  night

     silence just the steady dripdrip of liquid draining the underworld
     temple gleams with a crimson sheen now 

     on blade 

     as he stirs hes been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force
     of the blast soaked to the quick by blood he rises to his feet
     retrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon at his feet  

     the swordblade 

     lies in pieces amidst them we find the singed remains of the locket
      vanessas face barely recognizable beneath the grime blade stoops
     to pick it up

                           karen os
               blade

     blade turns karen moves to him searching his eyes which side of
     blades soul has won out human or vampire

     then she sees the tears rimming blades eyes the first hes shed in
     a lifetime human 

     they embrace holding each other that way for a long long time and
     we 

     dissolve to

     ext rooftop bank of erebus  dawn

     blade and karen stand on the rooftop watching as dawn slowly creeps
     across the silent city

                           karen
               i never imagined id be so happy to 
               see the sun rise 
                    turning to him
               its over isnt it

                           blade
               for them but for me 

     he lifts his face towards the rising sun letting its warmth wash
     over his upturned face

                           blade
               i feel like its finally beginning

     and on that note we leave them  two figures silhouetted against
     the new day

     fade to black
