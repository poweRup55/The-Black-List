                                nurse contd
                      hi  were ready for you now

            int community blood bank  hallway  night

            nomak follows the nurse into a dimlylit hallway  we track
            their progress in a convex safety mirror suspended from the
            hallway ceiling as they pass all manner of medical supplies 
            centrifuges an apheresis device etc

                                nurse
                          referring to her clipboard
                      i see from your questionnaire that you
                      dont have any immediate next of kin

                                nomak
                      no 
                          apprehensive
                      does that mean i cant be a donor

                                nurse
                      it depends  we came up with some
                      unusual results on your blood test

            nomak follows the nurse to a steel door were two security
            guards await them  both look bored paying little attention
            to the monitor which offers a view of the examining room
            beyond  there is also a small window with safety glass
            guard 1 opens the door following nomak and the nurse
            inside  guard 2 remains behind manning the hallway

            int community blood bank  examining room  night

            the nurse ushers nomak into the room indicating he should
            sit in a kind of reclining dental chair with arm and
            headrests  nomak notices a security camera mounted above

                                nomak
                          anxious
                      how unusual

            beat  the nurse sets aside nomaks file looking
            uncomfortable

                                nurse
                      your blood has a very rare phenotype
                      one thats quite valuable to people like
                      us

                                nomak
                      us  what are you talking about

            a kindfaced doctor enters nodding to guard 1

                                doctor
                      its a good newsbad news scenario
                      jared  good news for us bad for you

            the doctor and nurse smile baring fangs  we realize now
            that they are both vampires  the guard too  he grips nomak
            by the throat forcing him back into the restraint chair  as
            the vampire guard does so his hand brushes against nomaks
            jaw  the flesh on nomaks chin briefly separates along the
            scar  almost as if it were a seam

            the guard pauses  and nomak laughs  definitely not the
            reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim
            nomak starts to shake and twitch like hes going into some
            kind of seizure  the whites of his eyes bleed red  he
            throws his head back opening his mouth as a pair of razor
            sharp canines extrude from his gums  these are longer much
            more lethallooking than the fangs of the vampires and 

            nomak lashes out knocking the guard backwards  the nurse
            screams  nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat slamming
            her back against the wall

            the vampire doctor rushes to the door scrambling to unbolt
            it  nomak reaches for him howling with blooddrunk laughter
            as he lifts the doctor up  nomak flings the doctor about
            like a toy using his body to smash the lights then the
            security camera above

            int community blood bank  hallway  night

            we hear screams and horrible noises coming from the examining
            room  guard 2 draws a gun and looks to the security monitor
            with alarm  the screen goes black  he looks to the small
            window trying to peer into the nowdarkened room beyond 

            splash  a wave of blood smears across a window  a hand
            wipes a patch of blood away revealing nomaks baleful
            distorted eyes  guard 2 starts to back away when 

            bang  nomak slams against the other side of the steel door
            bangbangbang  the door begins to bend handshaped
            impressions bulging outward as nomak starts to peel the door
            apart like it was an aluminum can

            guard 2 has seen enough  he turns and runs even as the door
            caves inward off its hinges  forward momentum sends the door
            sliding across the hallway floor where it trips up the guard

            on the doorway

            as nomak steps into the hallway  because of the lights
            above there are alternating pools of light and shadow in the
            hall  nomak advances towards us his face coming in and out
            of darkness

                                nomak
                      vampires 

            with each pool of light his awful smile seems to distort
            further and further until his mouth seems to be widening all
            the way back to his ears

                                nomak contd
                      i fucking hate vampires

            on the floor the vampire guard cries out in fear helplessly
            raising his hands to defend himself  nomak howls and leaps
            towards himus blacking out the screen with his hurtling
            form as we 

                                                                 cut to

            vaulting over the railing  he unholsters his mach pistol as
            he drops firing it as he lands in a catlike stance on the
            snowy ground below 

            babang  a silvertipped bullet punches through tbags
            chest  he turns to ash even as his fellow vamps dash through
            the disintegrating cloud that used to be his body  the
            embers melt the snow where they land

            a supercharged foot chase ensues with hunter and prey

            hour

            running like a bull condensed vapor streaming from his mouth
            and nostrils  splashing through puddles of icy water
            storming through barriers of plywood and razor wire leaping
            over mountains of garbage bags

            on the vampires

            as they flatten a length of cyclone fencing like it was crepe
            paper  they scramble up an obstacle of waste bins leaping
            into the air 

            back to blade

            pulling out his twinbladed boomerang as he runs  he flings
            the weapon  it twirls around catching 

            st cloud in midleap

            and cutting the vampire completely in half  as the
            disintegrating halves of st cloud fall to the side blade
            storms over the waste bin

            ext innercity  second alley  night

            the remaining vampires stumble into a narrower alley where a
            group of bums are warming themselves over a series of oil
            drum fires

            jigsaw slips tripping over one of the burning oil drums
            catching himself ablaze  he doesnt give a shit  he keeps
            on running barreling his way into

             the back entrance of a cramped sweatshop  some kind of
            noodle factory filled with steam and equipment and yammering
            foreigners and 

             here comes blade hot on the vampires heels shouldering
            workers aside and

            with apehanger handlebars

            rush and segura leap atop their bmws  jigsaw rolls into a
            puddle of water dousing himself then jumps onto his

            blade

            bursts from the factory  segura revs his bmw trying to run
            him down  at the last second blade pivots aside like a
            matador  segura circles around for another try

            blade leaps somersaulting through the air then lands on the
            back of the bike behind segura  shinggg  blade pulls a
            retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and
            wraps it around seguras throat

            with a violent twist blade decapitates segura  as the
            vampires headless body turns to ash before him blade leans
            forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle

            whoosh  blade speeds after the other vamps

            ext street  night

            rush and jigsaw gun their bikes for all theyre worth  up
            ahead a line of construction barricades are blocking the
            way  the vampires power on through the barricades then
            abruptly brake 

            the overpass

            before them is under construction  theres a twentyfoot gap
            in the road where a portion is missing pieces of rebar
            poking out from the ends of the prefabricated sections

            rush and jigsaw consider their options but then they hear
            the roar of blades engine as he comes screaming over the
            rise in the road

            fuck it  rush powers his chopper forward making the jump
            burning rubber as he lands on the far side  jigsaw torques
            his handle and follows rocketing towards the gap

            on blade

            as he snaps his hand up  a trio of japanese throwing stars
            appearing between his fingers like a magicians cards  he
            flings the stars at jigsaws bike 

            the throwing stars hit jigsaws back tire and the bike goes
            down vomiting sparks as it slides forward  jigsaw is flung
            forward like a ragdoll out over the gap in the overpass and

             whunk  jigsaw is impaled on the protruding rebar  he
            howls instantly disintegrating as blade makes the jump

            blade is nearly upon him unsheathing his sword from his back
            scabbard

            bike locks up flips over bursts into flames  the whole
            screaming wreck slews forward showering sparks 

            rush

            goes flying onto the road rolling over and over one of his
            legs snapping at a bonebreaking angle  as he lies there
            moaning blade circles around sweeping past rushs decimated
            bike retrieving his sward from the burning wreckage

            blade kills the engine on his own bike and dismounts  rush
            is pathetically trying to drag his broken body to safety
            blade approaches placing his boot heel on the back of rushs
            neck forcing his face against the asphalt  he unholsters

            heaving an equipment sack onto his shoulder

            int warehouse  night

            three laconic vampire toughs are playing poker at a card
            table dealing out novelty nudie cards  we hear a noise
            one of the vampires approaches a reinforced door  he slides
            open a viewing slot and peers through  nobody outside  the
            vampire turns back to his poker buddies shrugging

            sword punches straight through the door into his chest  he
            gasps and turns to ash as the sword disengages back out
            through the door and 

            crash  the door explodes open sending clouds of burning
            vampire embers every which way  in walks blade grinning
            wickedly mach ready 

            as the other two vampires rise  pow  a silver hollowpoint
            hits the first one in the neck  pow  another hollowpoint
            takes out the second  the vampires drop turning to ash

            blade holsters his mach striding through vampire ash piles
            the place is eerily quiet here in stark contrast to the
            mayhem of the last few minutes  just the steady lowpitched
            hum of machinery

            blade starts forward  up ahead a faint glow is emitting
            from behind an area thats been sectioned off with canvas
            tarps  blade sweeps one of the tarps aside 

            three large tanks

            are hidden inside  the first two are empty  a man is
            suspended within the third bobbing weightlessly in a sea of
            red plasma  his long gray hair floats about his face
            shrouding his weathered features  were not sure if hes
            sleeping or dead

                                blade
                      old man old man whatve they done to
                      you 

            whistlers ace drifts around into view  blade shakes his
            head in sadness  he looks about for a way to extract
            whistler doesnt see any obvious means then 

            crash  blade kicks through the glass  blood and fluids
            flood out around him as whistlers limp body tumbles partly
            down but hes still suspended by the wires and medical
            leads  blade unsheathes his sword severing the wires 

            whistler falls into his arms  blade cradles him then  the
            gunsmiths eyes abruptly snap open flooding with rage

            blade staggers back as the howling horror that used to be his
            mentor wraps his hands around blades throat forcing him to
            the ground  whistler roars revealing a set of jagged fangs

                                whistler
                      why didnt you finish me off  i told
                      you 

            whistler slams the back of blades head against the concrete
            floor again and again punctuating his words with each slam 

                                whistler contd
                       to  fucking  finish  me  off

            blade knees whistler in the balls  whistler lets go cupping
            his groin as blade heaves him aside
            blade strips off his gauntlets  whistler springs at him
            again  blade sinks his fist deep in whistlers stomach  as
            whistler doubles over blade twists whistlers hands behind
            his back cuffing his wrists together with a pair of titanium
            manacles

            blade pulls a restraint hood from his equipment bag and
            quickly slips it over whistlers head cinching it tight

            another beat  whistler doesnt stir  hes down for the
            count  blade pauses a moment catching his breath as he
            leans on whistlers still form  hes exhausted

                                blade
                      come on whistler

            he rises heaving whistlers body over his shoulder

            ext the city  night

            blades battered charger knifes through the snowdusted urban
            blight like a shadow  boarded up businesses tent cities
            doorways bombed with graffiti throwups  wherever this
            godforsaken gomorrah is its definitely a notch down on the
            misery scale from the city blade used to call home

            up ahead the sprawl levels out giving way to an icebound
            harbor wreathed in fog

            int blades charger  night

            blade drives on inured to the sqaulor  he made peace with
            the darkness a long time ago

            ext shipyard  night

            the charger weaves its way through a maze of scrap metal and
            rusty shipping containers homing in on a sprawling warehouse
            thats been cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire
            utlraviolent floodlights illuminate the area while security
            cameras keep a watchful eye

            int warehouse  industrial elevator  night

            more uv lights flicker on  were in a massive loading
            elevatorplatform which hums as it ascends eventually
            reaching its destination with a booming clang  the doors at
            the rear glide open  blade guides the charger out

            int scuds workshop  night

            santas workshop by way of soldier of fortune  industrial
            equipment is strewn everywhere  mills old furnaces gutted
            vehicles an ad hoc surgical theater  we also notice the big
            rig which scud had been piloting  because of various leaking
            overhead pipes the floor is slick with a sheen of water
            blade kills his charger looking around as he climbs out

                                blade
                      scud

            blades voice echoes throughout the cavernous room

                      the dark knight returns

            scud is lowering himself down from the ceiling on a rope and
            pulley system where hed been suspended in a safety harness
            doing some kind of electrical wiring job  he reaches the
            floor and unclips himself  we notice hes wearing a surfers
            charm around his neck thats been strung with vampire fangs

            scud pulls a halfsmoked roach from behind his ear using a
            lighter in the shape of a womans torso to fire up  the
            flame jets from a hole in one of her tits  he takes a
            spicolisized hit and offers the roach to blade

                                scud contd

            blade opens the trunk  scud joins him

            whistler

            is inside  blade unfastens the hood slipping it off
            immediately whistler sits up lunging at blade

                                scud
                      fuck me

            blade gets whistler in a headlock choking him as he drags
            him out of the trunk  its like trying to wrestle a rabid
            pit bull  he looks to scud annoyed

                                blade
                      you going to stand there crapping your
                      pants or are you going to help me

            scud steps forward tentative  together he and blade drag
            whistler kicking and screaming across the workshop forcing
            him into a small celllike room

            int scuds workshop  cell  night

            whap  blade throws whistler onto the concrete floor pinning
            him as scud quickly slips a series of chains around him which
            have been secured to the wall  the opposite wall is covered
            by a series of steel shutters  as whistler continues to
            thrash blade affixes a muzzle to the older mans mouth

                                scud
                      you got something in mind blade

                      in one night

            blade pulls out a pneumatic syringe plunging an ampoule of
            ambercolored fluid into the bottle mount

                                blade contd

                      i dont know about this man 

            blade injects whistler with the syringe  whistler howls in
            pain nearly throwing blade and scud off him

                                blade
                          to scud
                      get back

            scud scurries away  whistlers struggles have taken an even
            more violent turn  blade beats him back down

            finally blade steps on whistlers neck pinning his head as
            he draws a shotgun from a holster beneath his armpit  he
            shoves it in whistlers snarling face

                                blade contd
                      if theres anything of you left in

                      morning those shutters are going up
                      either youll be cured or youll fry

            blade raises his foot from whistlers neck quickly backing
            out the door  whistler throws himself at blade nearly
            tearing the chains from the wall as 

            int scuds workshop  night

            boom  blade slams the cell door closed  the door is heavy
            steel  nevertheless whistler kicks against it threatening
            to tear it off its hinges  blade throws a heavy crossbar
            over the door  then he steps back joining scud

            whumpwhumpwhump  whistler hammers the door again and again
            and again  but the crossbar holds  blade glances at scud
            whos looking winded and shaken by the ordeal

                                blade
                      its going to be a long night

            scud nods and exits  blade drags a chair across the floor
            setting it in front of the door  he sits down shotgun
            resting across his knees holding vigil  and off that grim
            stoic image we 

                                                                 cut to


            ext city dump  day 20 years ago

            daylight bleaches the image almost whiting it out  a wino
            sifts through refuse collecting bottles  three mutts are
            tethered to his side with rope  he reaches for a bottle
            cuts himself on a piece of glass  as he inspects his wound
            his dogs growl  the wino looks up 

            a black kid 14 is standing atop a mountain of refuse 
            wiry and intense perched there like a predator  the wino
            glances at his wrist again the blood then back up at the
            black kid  unnerved the wino starts to back away then
            turns  bumping right into the black kid who has moved
            beside him with uncanny speed  note this all happens
            within a single continuous shot

            the boy slams the wino against the trestle wall and snarls
            baring fangs  and just as hes about to tear the mans
            throat out 

            a hand reaches in from offscreen pulling the boy back
            its whistler twenty years younger and spryer with a head
            full of raven black hair

            whistler throws the boy into the light forcing him onto the
            ground  he shoves a 45 against the boys face and is just
            about to pull the trigger when he stops noticing overhead
            sun reflected in the boys eyes  whistler looks up and sees
            the sun at high noon then glances back at the boy in
            understanding  he smiles

                                whistler
                      daylight  son of a bitch

                                                                 cut to

            int scuds workshop  dawn

            blade wakes up lifts his head  a shaft of sunlight shines
            directly down onto him reflecting back at us from his now
            adult eyes  blade hasnt moved  he sits in the chair in
            front of the cell door which is now silent  he stands
            unlocking the cell door  he heaves the crossbar away  the
            door groans as he opens it

            int scuds workshop  cell  dawn

            blade enters  its dark  we can just make out whistlers
            figure huddled in the corner like some kind of caged animal
            his lanky gray hair obscuring his face

            whistler doesnt stir  blade crosses over to the steel
            shutters  for the briefest moments he hesitates  then he
            hits the switch readying his shotgun  with a hum the
            shutters rise throwing a shaft of blinding sunlight over
            whistler

            nothing happens  blade lowers his shotgun  whistler slowly
            raises his head fixing blade with a bloodshot eye

                                blade
                      how do you feel

                                whistler
                      like a fucking heifer took a dump in my
                      mouth

            int scuds workshop  bathroom area  later

            whistler stands barechested before a corroded mirror
            splashing water from a sink over his face rinsing off
            shaving cream residue  he inspects his features  hes
            cleaned himself up a bit trimmed his beard etc

            he pulls on a fresh shirt then turns to face blade who
            stands behind him

                                whistler
                      you came back for me

                                blade
                      did you think i wouldnt

                                whistler
                      took you long enough

            blade smiles  that was as close to a thankyou as this old
            junkyard dog is ever going to give

            int scuds workshop  backstorage area  day

            whistler has fired up a lucky strike  hes moving through
            the storage area where much of his old equipment has been
            shelved pulling tarps off checking things  blade follows

                                blade
                      lets just hope youve kicked the thirst
                      for good  ill be watching you close
                      you start to backslide 

                                whistler
                      you put a bullet in my brain  wouldnt
                      expect anything else

            whistler takes a long drag expelling the smoke slowly
            studying the cigarette in his hand

                                whistler contd
                      ill say one thing for doing time as a
                      suckhead  seems to have knocked that
                      cancer of mine back into remission

            blade nods  then whistler stops obviously frustrated

                                whistler contd
                      where the hells my lathe

            just then we hear the sound of an industrial lathe firing up
            curious whistler exits into 

            int scuds workshop  day

            the workshop proper  scud is working at whistlers old
            lathe bopping his head along to music which is playing on a
            nearby tv  the them song to speed racer  now hes wearing a
            ron jeremy tshirt that says daddy

                                tv os

                      revving up the powerful mach five 

            whistler cocks an incredulous eyebrow at blade who has
            fallen in beside him  scud kills the lathe and approaches

                                scud
                      whistler  cool beans  nice to meet

                      though  thats what most people do

            scud offers his hand  whistler doesnt take it  scud shoots
            an uneasy glance at blade raising an eyebrow in question
            is whistler okay or not  blade nods  whistler moves over
            to the charger which has its hood up

                                whistler
                      tell me something skid

                      profile ramping

                      and youll burn the damn thing out
                      before your next fucking oil change

            whistler just looks to blade and shakes his head

                      look whats your problem

            whistler gets in scuds face  scud looks to blade for help
            but he just watches letting the two of them sort things out

                                whistler
                      my problem shitbird is that i tried to
                      blow my fucking head off and wound up

                      and a half  now youre standing there
                      choking your chicken like were all
                      walking around some fucking candyass
                      vampire sitcom

            scud attempts to show some balls but stammers all the same

                                scud

                                whistler

            just then however an alarm starts beeping  scud checks a
            display as blade readies his mach

                                scud

                      head

            scud looks to a bank of security monitors  the views break
            into static as a figure rushes past them  he tries a few
            keyboard commands

                                scud contd
                      i dont understand im not getting
                      anything on the surveillance cams

            whistler makes a few adjustments on the nearest monitor

                      theyre fried  whoevers out there is
                      using magnesium flares  seems like
                      theyve got your security system stopped
                      out pretty well

            whistler moves to a rack of weaponry  as he reaches for car
            15 scud moves to stop him

                                scud
                      whoa whoa easy cowboy  im not
                      trusting you with a weapon just yet

            whistler smacks scud in the face with the butt of the car15
            and pushes past him  we hear a crash

            angle on

            two black latexclad ninja like intruders

            running on all fours racing upside down across the ceiling
            at breakneck speed  then they drop somersaulting down
            fifty feet landing in a catlike stance

                                blade
                      hit the godlights

            scud with his nose now bleeding activates a series of
            stadiumstyle lights secured to the ceiling  the entire
            place goes white with uv light the image nearly blowing out

            close on figures faces

            they are wearing metal goggles with iris shut to mere pin
            prick openings

            whistler trains the car15 on 

            the first latex clad figure

            who is now removing something from a satchel  whistler
            fires  the intruder drops the object and cartwheels away

            in the blink of an eye the second intruder has launched
            himself at whistler handspringing off the floor then
            kicking him in the midsection  as whistler falls back the
            second intruder presses forward

            on blade

            unsheathing his sword rushing at the first intruder

            whap  the intruder traps blades forearm pivoting planting
            a boot in blades ribcage  obviously the intruder is a
            serious martial arts student

            whapwhapwhap  the two of them go at it unleashing a
            flurry of kicks blocks and punches  the intruder gets
            blade in a backchoke  he twists out of it throwing the
            intruder over his shoulder who neatly cartwheels springing
            back off the wall at blade again 

            blade ducks beneath one of the intruders kicks then traps
            the intruders foot giving it a savage twist  crack  blade
            backhands the intruder with a blow so strong that it knocks
            the intruder to his knees  then the intruder reaches for a
            short sword  in a heartbeat the sword is out and against
            blades throat  just as blades sword is not against the
            intruders  its a stalemate

                                second intruder
                      stop

            blade and the first intruder freeze  the second intruder
            steps away from whistler whom he clearly had the drop on
            and tosses the car15 to the ground

                                second intruder contd
                      we didnt come here to fight  we came
                      to deliver a message

            blade looks back to the first intruder  then slowly
            withdraws his sword  the intruder does the same  blade
            turns off the godlights  the uvs fade and normal lighting
            returns  scud and whistler pick themselves up off the floor

                                blade
                      take off your masks

            the intruders remove their masks  the first is asad a
            cautious sufi muslim possessing a restrained nobility

            the second is a woman nyssa  20something with emerald
            eyes and strong darkly exotic features  both are vampire

                                asad
                      my name is asad  this is nyssa  we
                      represent the shadow cabinet  the
                      ruling body of vampire nation  theyre
                      offering you a truce  they want to meet
                      with you

                                scud
                          wiping blood from his nose
                      bullshit

            blade holds up his hand silencing scuds outburst  he nods
            for nyssa and asad to continue

            nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped
             a cd  she tosses it to blade  still keeping an eye on
            them blade slips the cd into a reader  we see a slideshow
            of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera
            nomak tearing into the blood bank staff etc

                                nyssa
                      for decades youve been the thing weve
                      feared the most  but theres something
                      else loose on the streets now 

            close on

            the final still  a blurry horrific shot of nomaks half
            turned face and back  we get a sense of distorted inhuman
            physiognomy

                                nyssa contd
                      something worse than you

                                                                 cut to


            ext blade and scuds warehouse  rooftop  night

            blade whistler and scud stand near the ledge while asad
            stands a few yards off talking on a phone  nyssa stands
            even further away watching them with distrust

                                scud
                      this whole deals giving me a serious
                      case of the buttwillies

                                whistler
                      look kid they obviously found your
                      base of operations  if it was a trap
                      why flip their dicks by announcing
                      themselves

                                blade
                      i agree  we play along for now we
                      might wind up learning something about
                      how their world ticks

                                whistler
                          grinning at scud
                      either that or feeding the worms

            asad finishes his call and approaches them

                                asad
                      theyre ready to see you now

            as if on cue we hear the thrum of helicopters  seconds
            later two bell jet rangers appear above them illuminating
            them in their searchlight

                                                                 cut to

            ext sky  night

            we track the helicopters across the night sky  we see
            whistler and asad in one blade scud and nyssa in another

            int jet ranger  night

            blade and nyssa sit in the rear of the first helicopter
            nyssa is studying blade

                                blade
                      what

                                nyssa
                      they tell bedtime stories about you
                      blade the big bad boogieman  frankly
                      im disappointed
                          blade raises an eyebrow
                      that you were willing to come along so
                      easily i mean  without any assurances

            blade smiles and opens his coat gesturing to a bandolier of
            plastic explosives secured to his chest

                                blade
                      semtex explosive  enough to level a
                      city block  hows that for assurance

            the helicopter abruptly banks right dropping down low

            ext helicopter  night

            the bell jet rangers touch down outside a terraced frank
            lloyd wright structure overlooking the ocean  as nyssa and
            asad lead blade whistler and scud towards the facility we
            see a circular crimson logo encircling a doublehelix

            scud notices a series of red light dots on his arms and
            chest  he looks up to see dozens of vampire marksmen on the
            roofs above training their weapons on them

            int elevator cab  night

            the group rides down  the elevator stops  the doors open

            int damaskinos stronghold  4way intersection  night

            nyssa and asad lead them into a hub out of which multiple
            corridors project  they take the central corridor

            int steel corridor  night

            the corridor ends at a pair of steel security doors  nyssa
            stands before a biometric scanner allowing a beam of light
            to play over her face  the scanner acknowledges her identity
            and the doors hiss open revealing a series of security doors
            beyond these which successively open into 

            a final door

            oak set into a stainless steel wall  incalculably ancient
            elaborately carved  brought over from the old world

                                nyssa
                      the house of erebus you encountered
                      before were nothing but feudal lords
                      the true power of the vampire nation
                      lies here 

            as they move towards the final door whistler shivers  scud
            watches as his breath escapes from his mouth in a frosty
            plume  asad takes notice

                                asad
                      few warmbloods have seen whats beyond

            a crescentshaped room filled with antiquities quarry

            columns from middle kingdom egypt stacks of arcane volumes
            medieval frontispieces  a borgiaesque renaissance portrait
            staring down at us with a severe gaze  towering over all of
            these is a massive greek cross carved from stone  music

            damaskinos holds up his hand  he waits for the music to
            crescendo then turns his face still hidden in shadow

                                damaskinos
                      i hope you dont mind the cold  when

                      for quite some time

            damaskinos draws closer now stepping into the light  bright
            eyed with smile like moonlight gleaming off a knife blade
            his skin is impossibly pale almost marblelike with
            traceries of blue blood pulsing underneath

            whistler glares at damaskinos  the two men stare at each
            other a moment sizing one another up

                                damaskinos contd
                          smiling knowingly
                      it has been said you may have enemies

                      despise  be proud of your enemy then

                      as you may know vampirism is an
                      arbovirus one thats spread through the
                      saliva of parasitic organisms 
                          motioning to the hologram
                      in this case vampires are the vector
                      the virus replicates within the human
                      bloodstream evolving its host into an
                      entirely new lifeform
                          beat
                      unfortunately viruses evolve too 

            as nyssa talks one of the viral nucleocapsids changes
            mutating from its original elegant design into a harsher
            more menacing form
            the mutated nucleocapsid begins feeding on the original
            vampire capsids causing a chainreaction of mutation  in
            seconds the holoimage is filled with throbbing microscopic
            horrors which then mutate into

                      weve dubbed this new virus the reaper
                      strain  and like any good pathogen it
                      appears to have found a carrier  a

            int scuds workshop  dawn

            blade whistler and scud enter through the loading elevator
            blade turns to whistler

                                blade
                      what do you think

                                whistler
                      sounds like a plan

                                blade
                      what do you really think

                                whistler
                          lighting a cigarette
                      these guys are shitting bricks cause
                      theyre no longer on the top of the food
                      chain  theyre going to fuck us the
                      first chance they get

            whistler moves away  blade shrugs off his jacket begins
            putting away his weapons  scud lingers apprehensive

                                scud
                      so youre going to do this

                                blade
                      keep your friends close and your enemies
                      closer  isnt that how the saying goes

            scud follows blades gaze watching whistler who has
            collapsed into a chair at the far end of the workshop  the
            grizzled hunter pulls off his leg brace then massages his
            bum knee  scud nods in whistlers direction

                                scud
                      im worried about him
                          off blades look
                      look i know hes your friend but just
                      watch him okay  nobody goes cold
                      turkey from the thirst in a night

            back on whistler

            surrounded by the salvaged parts and massive gears of long
            discarded machinery halfhidden in shadow  a shaft of
            morning sunlight cuts in through one of the windows slowly
            moving across the floor towards his position  he shifts in
            his chair moving slightly 

            away from the light

                                                                 cut to

            ext gas station  night

            its late  an iceencased streetlight hums and flickers
            the pumps are vacant  a heavy blanket of sooty snow covers
            the grounds of the station  the fluorescents of the mini
            mart are the only beacon of light in an otherwise fogbound
            night

            int minimart  night

            a korean woman 30s mans the counter  her toddler sits in a
            circular safety walker nearby  the kind that rolls and is
            affixed with toys to keep a baby occupied  the woman glances
            at two surveillance monitors  on the first monitor we see 

            a car

            pull up to the pumps outside  a man gets out slides his
            credit card through the reader starts pumping gas

            on the second monitor

            we see a figure standing at the back by the slurpee machine
            the figure turns approaching  its nomak  he sets a
            package of gum on the counter looks to the baby  he smiles
            wriggles his finger  the child coos and smiles back

            unnerved by nomak the korean woman quickly rings the
            transaction gives him his change  he removes a stick of gum
            from the pack carefully unwraps it slides it into his
            mouth watching the child all the while  finally he nods to
            the woman and leaves  the door chimes as he exits

            beat  the woman looks to the surveillance monitors again

            the first monitor

            the car is still there but the man pumping gas is gone

            puzzled the woman steps from behind the counter and moves to
            the glass doors looking out 

            her pov

            the cars driver side door hangs open  even more disturbing
            the hose for the gas pump lies untended on the icy ground
            spilling fuel from its nozzle

            ext gas station  night

            the korean woman cautiously exits the minimart  no one is
            in sight  she hurries to the abandoned car disengaging the
            lock on the pump handle then setting it back in its cradle
            she looks to the open drivers door  a few droplets of blood
            have stained the snow just outside it  then she sees 

            a ghostly figure

            standing off in the fogbound shadows  the woman looks back
            to the minimart then back again to where the figure was
            standing  but the figure is gone  growing increasingly
            anxious the woman hurries back

            int gas station  night

            the woman shuts the door locks it  but shes still just a
            target standing inside a welllit glass box  she moves to
            the safety walker scoops up her child

            after another moments indecision she slides the accordion
            style gate down over the doors and windows  then she turns
            off the lights  feeling somewhat more secure the woman
            moves back around the counter and sees 

            an unwrapped stick of gum resting on the tray of the baby
            walker  it wasnt there before  with a rising sense of
            dread the woman backs away bumping right into 

            nomak

            he smiles cruelly the scarseam in his chin just beginning
            to part  the woman gasps turns to run 

            and bumps into three more reapers  gaunt and ferallooking
            all three with shaved heads
            no eyebrows and hairline scarseams running down their
            chins  as one the reapers descend on her  we hear the
            childs terrified wail and we 

                                                                 cut to

            ext the city  night

            a sulfurcolored moon shines its baleful light down upon the
            icy cityscape as nomaks roar echoes through the canyon of
            buildings

            int scuds workshop  blades sleeping area  night

            blade is just finishing injecting himself with serum  he
            sighs falling back into the chair hes sitting in waiting
            for the shakes to subside  he unwraps a piece of rubbing
            tubing which hed been using as a tourniquet flexes his
            hand

            the door to his room opens  scud stands there in silhouette

                                scud
                      um weve got company

            int scuds workshop  night

            blade emerges into the workshop proper with whistler and
            scud

            nyssa and bloodpack

            stand before us  they represent an assortment of ages and
            races their one unifying characteristic being a callous
            almost fanatical disregard for human life  in short these
            guys are the most stonecold motherfuckers weve ever seen

                                whistler
                      well if it isnt snow white and the
                      seven suckheads

            albino lighthammer a massive blackfoot indian and priest
            a baldheaded modern primitive with copious piercings and
            facial tattoos  rounding out the bunch is chupa a blunt
            featured puerto rican and verlaine a familiarlooking
            curvaceous beauty with beestung lips that exudes a predatory
            sexuality

            note verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister
            of raquel the bodacious vamp played by traci lords that
            blade killed in the opening scene of the first film

                                reinhardt

            reinhardt advances until he and blade are nose to nose

                                reinhardt
                      tell me something chief  can you
                      blush

            a tense beat  then blade flashes a broad smile

                                blade
                      alright you want to play this game

            blade pulls out one of his silver stakes  in response the
            vampires reach for their weapons  but blade merely twirls it
            around his fingers  then tosses it to reinhardt

                                blade contd

                      so lets get it over with  ill give
                      you a free shot reinhardt

            reinhardt looks to nyssa uncomfortable

            blade grabs reinhardts wrist pulling the stake against his
            chest fixing the vampire with the deadliest of poker gazes

                                blade
                      whats wrong reinhardt  you need a

                                verlaine
                      do it reinhardt  do it

            reinhardt tenses thrusting the stake forward  but blade
            has already whirled out of the way trapping his hand then
            violently twisting it backwards

            before reinhardt even knows whats happening blade swings
            him around into a headlock  in his free hand hes got a
            tiny barbed flechette  the barbs spring open like a ticks
            gripping mandibles as blade drives the flechette into the
            base of reinhardts skull  reinhardt howls in pain but
            blade just tightens his grip choking off reinhardts air

                                blade
                      listen up adolph i just popped an
                      explosive charge in the back of your

                      neck stump  got it

            reinhardt lets loose a choked grunt  blade releases him
            dropping the gasping austrian to the floor

                                blade contd
                      any questions

            no one says a word

                                                                 cut to

            whistler

            hefting a heavy ordnance case on the table  blade and
            company sit on one side the bloodpack on the other

                                whistler
                          opening a case of bullets
                      glaser safety rounds in 38 45 and
                      9mm caliber  foil capsules at the tip
                      filled with silver nitrate grains  they
                      pack a major kinetic energy dump  and
                      since you suckheads dont like sunlight
                      weve modified the entry lights with uv
                      filters 

            whistler flicks on the entry light  then notices that chupa
            isnt paying attention  the vampire is looking at snowman
            who is saying something in signlanguage  chupa snickers
            whistler picks up a massive gun with a modified cmag
            hundred round cylindrical mag  it has a strange electromag
            assembly barrel with shockwave ports running along it

                                whistler contd

                      core needles at six thousand butt
                      humping feet per second  like this 

            whistler fires  babang  a sonic boom rocks the workshop
            shattering a number of windows and computer monitor screens
            as a wad of needle rushes just millimeters past chupas face
            embedding in the wall behind him

                                chupa
                      hey hey  the fuck you doing

                      the fuck are you gonna do with it

            blade clears his throat and stands

                                blade
                      if you girls are finished flirting id
                      like to get started

            moments later

            blade whistler and the bloodpack are silently suiting up
            for war  strapping on body armor securing stakes and
            knives clicking ammo cartridges into their various weapons

            we see them lacing up combat boots checking rifle sights
            entry lights  blade dons one of his edta pneumatic
            gauntlets  whistler loads custom rounds into a shotgun
            then he reaches to clip on an ammo vest  but his hands are
            shaking slightly and he cant seem to clip the locking
            mechanism together  after a beat blade reaches over and
            does it for whistler  like a son helping his father  a beat
            passes between them whistler and blade looking at one
            another  then whistler nods satisfied

            as blade crosses towards asad and nyssa he stops by
            verlaine sizing her up

                                blade
                      this the part where you beat your chest
                      and vow revenge

                                verlaine
                      something like that

                                blade
                      save it for the directors cut

             and we are below blade looking up at him through the
            grate  we are in a bloodencrusted drainage area just
            beneath the ballroom that slopes inward towards a large
            octagonal iron culvert  as we watch a section of the
            culvert rises a pair of red eyes peering out from the
            darkness within

            blade follows nyssa up a narrow staircase into a corridor
            lined with gangrenous peeling wallpaper  some of the room
            doors are shut some open  clearly many are occupied

            like his namesake

            blade checks more doorways catching halfglimpses of flesh
            leather and steel  he hears sobbing moans whispers
            then a distinctly human whimper catches his attention

            nyssa opens a door onto an empty room  a vacant stainless
            steel examination table gleams in the center waiting

            blade pushes open another door  we see a fearful young woman
            crouching in the corner of a soiled room  a corpulent
            vampire in a leather apron is hosing down the floor

            across the floor blown by a breeze  reinhardt pauses
            notices another walkin freezer door ajar moves in that
            direction

            unseen behind them a door behind them slowly swings open

            int house of pain  ballroom  night

            chupa asad snowman and priest  three shadowed figures are
            lurking near one of the exits  skinhead types each with a
            hairline scar running down their chin
            asad silently motions to snowman and the others indicating
            figures  snowman signs something back  the vampire trio
            starts towards them

            bored to shit scud plucks a joint from behind his ear  as
            he fires up his woman torso lighter we hear something just
            outside the van  scud kills the barry white listening
            silence  then a faint skittering

                                scud
                      um whistler you out there

            still no response  scud reaches for a handgun and creeps
            into the front of the van  he looks out the windshield 
            nothing  he looks left then right  nothing

            unnerved scud returns to the back of the van  he reaches
            for the handle of the rear door and abruptly jerks the door
            open aiming the gun out 

            theres nothing outside the van  but then scud hears the
            skittering again  his eyes shift apprehensively to the floor
            of the van below him

            int house of pain  first corridor  night

            as they near the end of the hall blade notices a dropdown
            attic door in the ceiling above  he unsheathes his sword and
            uses the tip to unlatch the trapdoor  the counterweighted
            door creaks and lowers unfolding a sectioned ladder  we see
            darkness beyond  as blade cautiously mounts the stairs 

            nyssas attention is drawn to a billowing piece of vinyl  a
            blurry figure is visible behind it  then it moves away
            nyssa ducks past the vinyl

            int house of pain  ballroom  night

            as the music reaches a crescendo asad notices more shadowy
            figures by another exit  and even more by a third  snowman
            signs to asad again more urgently this time as the first
            potential reaper begins to turn and we are 

            int operations van  night

             back with scud  he ducks his head outside looking
            beneath the van  nothing there  relieved scud shuts the
            rear door laughs to himself

            a pair of clawed hands

            suddenly rip down through the ceiling of the van peeling it
            up and back like it was tinfoil  a reaper with a bloody
            bandage covering his eye snarls down at us

            int house of pain  ballroom  night

            the first skinhead figure spins towards us  its a reaper
            all three of them are eyes wide with bloodlust as they leap
            at asad and the others

            suddenly the reapers are everywhere blocking the exits
            ripping into their vampire victims tossing them aside like
            toys  vampires scream and run some taking to the walls as a
            means of escape some racing across the ceiling

            int house of pain  first corridor  night

            blade stops halfway up the ladder as he hears gunfire  he
            drops back to the floor then notices that nyssa is gone  he
            pushes through the vinyl curtain and finds  nyssa forced
            back against the wall wrestling with

            fires his mach pistol pointblank into nomaks face blasting
            the reaper backwards 

            but nomak is back on his feet in a splitsecond smashing
            through a window onto the fire escape beyond  blade rushes
            to the window looks out 

            blades pov

            nomak is scaling his way straight up the neon hotel sign
            jumping from one letter to the next with lightning speed

            int house of pain  kitchen  night

            a reaper explodes out from the walkin rather than the door
            behind them  he leaps atop reinhardt slamming him to the
            floor  lighthammer swings his hammer missing the reaper
            taking out a chunk of the wall instead
            lighthammer swings and misses again taking a chunk out of
            the floor  verlaine empties her automatic rifle into the
            reaper even as 

            the reaper turns on lighthammer catching the war hammer
            reapers lower jaw disengages and splits open revealing a
            freakishly enlarged esophagus lined with serrated sharklike
            teeth

            all of this takes a splitsecond  no time for lighthammer to
            react as the reaper latches its grossly expanded mouth onto
            his throat and begins draining him before our eyes  the
            reaper shudders and the whites of his eyes bleed red as an
            ecstatic wave washes over him  his pale flesh pulsing with
            engorged veinwork becomes flushed turning crimson as

            begins caving inward shrinking as every millimeter of blood
            is vacuumed out of him

            blood vessels

            are popping up beneath the reapers briefly translucent skin
            becoming engorged and dilated  the veins continue to swell
            racing up his neck then branching out over his face chest
            and arms  like an instant network of varicose veins

            verlaine retreats horrified  reinhardt scurries backwards
            then scrambles to his feet running for his life into

            reaper should turn to ash but it doesnt  scud flees
            diving into the front of the van ducking behind the wheel
            he keys the ignition 

            wham  now the reaper is atop the hood smashing his feet
            through the windshield  scud screams as he slams the van
            into the drive and floors the pedal 

            wkkrunch  scud crashes the van against the side of a
            building pinning the reaper between the vans front bumper
            and the crumbling wall  he keeps his foot on the gas pedal
            grinding the vans wheels

            this gambit should cut the reaper in half or at the very
            least fatally wound it  but it only enrages it further
            the reaper stretches forward across the vans crumpled hood
            and resumes battering away at the cracked windshield

            the reaper nearest priest turns in his direction  we
            recognize her as the nurse from the bloodbank  she leaps at
            priest 

            priest fires a glaser round through the shereapers head
            the reaper twists in midleap falls to the floor then picks
            herself up again  like scuds reaper she seems unaffected
            by the custommade ammo

            on the other members of the bloodpack

            having similarly disastrous results  the reapers are
            shrugging off their firepower  asad leaps snapping a
            reapers neck with a spinning heel kick but the reaper keeps
            coming

            back to the priest

            alarmed reaching for a specialized shotgun instead  the
            reaper continues forward moving so fast she almost seems a
            blur as baboom baboom  priest pumps his shotgun
            repeatedly  two projectiles fire out chained together by a
            length of titanium cable  the cable catches the reaper in
            the midsection cutting it clean in half

            the upper half of the reaper falls then rights itself
            landing on its clawed hands
            impossibly the shereaper keeps coming  she skitters
            towards priest on his hands like the halfman from todd
            brownings freaks

            the halfreaper launches itself at priest hitting him in the
            chest knocking him back to the floor  priest panics as he
            struggles with the thing trying to fend off its claws and
            fangs as it locks its mouth into his arm  he screams

                                                                 cut to

            as scud continues to fiddle with the faulty headlight wiring
            the windshield finally shatters beneath the reapers pounding
            fists  it latches onto scuds collar and pulls him forward
            over the wheel even as the seamscar in its chin splits apart
            and the reapers enlarged maw flowers open  scud is just
            centimeters away from having his face being bitten off when 

             the wires spark and the headlights come on illuminating
            the reaper in a wash of uv light  the effect is
            instantaneous  the reaper howls and lets go then promptly
            bursts into flames

            scud cups his ear shouting via the comm system

                                scud

            asad hears scuds message as he continues fending off a
            reapers attack  then he manages to get hold of his rifle
            he flicks on the uv entry light aiming it at the reapers
            face  the reapers head catches fire  asad shouts to the
            others

            outside followed by nyssa who hesitates when she sees 

            the sun

            beginning to rise beyond the cityscape horizon  nomak is
            already at the opposite side of the building moving fast

            nyssa falls back into the shadows as blade continues onward
            unsheathing his sword

            whistlers sniper rifle and binoculars have been abandoned
            and 

            ext house of pain  rooftop  dawn

            were back with blade as he chases nomak across the roof

            up ahead

            nomak abruptly stops having reached the end of the roof
            the nearest neighboring rooftop is too far away and the drop
            from this last ledge looks unsurvivable even for someone
            like nomak

            as blade cautiously advances nomak turns around and smiles 
            a wolfish grin unnaturally wide  the reapers face is
            beginning to smoke beneath the rising suns rays  in
            response a polarized nictomembrane slides down over nomaks
            irises  like something youd see on a crocodile to protect
            its eyes from harsh light

                                nomak
                      is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my
                      enemy  what do you think blade  what
                      am i to you

            nomak laughs then lunges scooping up a rusty iron bar that
            lies nearby  he swings it at blade  blade parries and steps
            backward taking a blow to the head in the process then
            another to the side

            the two of them exchange a flurry of blows back and forth
            until their weapons lock and they are face to face  nomaks
            back is to the rising sun now  his whole body is beginning
            to lightly smoke

            both men are trembling straining against their weapons
            using every ounce of strength to keep the other at bay  and
            just when it looks like nomak is gaining the upper hand

             blade pivots the flat edge of his sword upwards catching
            the light of the rising sun reflecting it directly into
            nomaks eyes

            nomak screams and rears back his face catching fire  then
            he stumbles backwards and falls  right off the ledge of the
            roof  blade hurries to the roofs ledge and looks down 

            but the reaper is nowhere in sight  dumbfounded blade
            retreats haunted by the conviction that nomak is still
            alive

            int house of pain  ballroom  dawn

            blade has returned to the scene of the melee  the reapers
            have fled leaving nyssa and the others to lick their wounds
            and survey the carnage  quite a few fullbody ash outlines
            marking the passing of various vampires  blade approaches
            nyssa  she notices his wounds

                                nyssa

            just then we hear an unearthly scream

            angle on

            priest being held down by chupa and snowman  hes thrashing
            about clutching his wounded infected arm

                                priest
                      oh god oh god it hurts  it hurts it
                      hurts fuck it hurts  ugh

            priest lets loose an agonized scream as blade and the others
            gather around him  hes undergoing a horrific change taking
            on the gaunt veinengorged features of a proper reaper  he
            snarls and wails gnashing his teeth like a rabid animal

            reinhardt and his team look uneasy  shaken by their
            teammates downward progression

            blade draws closer  already the flesh on priests chin is
            splitting as a seam begins to form


                                blade
                      its already changing him 

            reinhardt paces annoyed by priests wailing

                      jesus cant you get him to shut the

                      his blood cells arent producing oxygen
                      anymore  his own body is suffocating
                      him  these things are like crack
                      addicts  if they dont feed every few
                      hours theyll feed on themselves

            as if in response priest starts convulsing  his flesh
            tightens drawing taut around his increasingly skeletal form
            his screams become unbearable twisting into a highpitched
            ululation thats making the bloodpacks skin crawl

                                reinhardt
                      somebody put him out of his misery for

            asad pulls out his handgun and empties the clip into priests
            body  but priest keeps shrieking

            unnerved reinhardt unsheathes a machete decapitating priest
            even as the others protest

            the headless body continues thrashing still making noise
            from its open throat  if anything it seems to be
            redoubling its efforts  it lurches forward jerking itself
            free from chupa and snowmans restraining arms

                                chupa
                      mierda

            the juddering horror that used to be priest staggers to its
            feet  reinhardt and his men panic stumbling backwards  the
            headless monstrosity lunges straight at 

            blade

            without batting an eye he draws his mach pistol briefly
            aiming at the onrushing creatures chest then adjusting his
            aim to one of the blackedout windows above and behind it

            bambambam  blade shoots out the window and blazing shaft
            of sunlight slices down through the darkness spotlighting
            priest like an ant beneath a magnifying glass

            fwash  the headless body is incinerated in midstep  it
            collapses to the floor just inches before blade  one of its
            blackened claws feebly grabs blades boot then grows still

            beat  you could hear the pin drop in the silence that
            follows every one of the bloodpack thinking some variation
            of there but for the grace of god go i  asad lays a hand
            on nyssas shoulder steadying her

            blade shifts his foot causing the cinderlike hand gripping
            his boot to crumble to dust

            moves over to him angry  chupa follows equally pissed

                      down a few notches paco

            chupa flushes with anger and flicks his knife across
            whistlers shoulder opening a gash  whistler goes ballistic
            and punches chupa in the face  a brief tussle ensues before
            blade and the others can separate them  as chupa is pulled
            away by asad he looks back at whistler

            are now gathered around the octagonal iron culvert just
            beneath the ballroom  whistler turns on a flashlight  we
            hear something moving in the darkness  the group tenses
            then whistlers flashlight beam reveals 

            a reaper

            cowering by the culvert  one we recognize  the other
            vampire guard from the bloodbank now transformed  hes
            shrunken and emaciated pale  and although hes obviously
            dying he still hisses his fanged mouth snapping
            ineffectually at them  his arm has been trapped  pinned
            under one of the sectional culvert coverings  it looks like
            hes been trying to gnaw it off in order to escape

                      trying to crawl back into that culvert

            blade looks to the culvert in question  he pulls back one of
            the sectioned covers  the opening is about two feet wide
            just large enough for a man to gain access

            int seweroutflow area  continuous

            blade drops into the sewer line  the area is claustrophobic
            damp  there are torn pieces of insulation hanging from the

            blade retreats back to the drainpipe pulling himself back
            up  we hold for a beat then drift up to the bloodsaturated
            strips of insulation  someone is crouched in the shadows

                      two so far

            unconcerned damaskinos slices into a piece of raw meat

                                damaskinos
                          reverting to english
                      an inevitability i suppose  nyssa was
                      not among them i trust

                                stevens
                      no  this is a dangerous game youre
                      playing damaskinos

                                damaskinos
                      any game worthy of being played is  one
                      must be patient  in this way i have
                      outlived my enemies  all of them

            damaskinos steps beyond the screens now into the pool area 
            and although we cant see the water from this angle we can
            see patterns of ruby light flickering off the tiled walls
            stevens follows uncomfortable

                                stevens
                      blades too volatile  youre not going
                      to be able to keep manipulating him 

            damaskinos steps into the steaming liquid which we now see
            is blood  his robe spreads out floating on the surface

                                damaskinos
                      you worry too much stevens  i have
                      assurance from our friend inside that
                      events are unfolding as scripted

                                stevens
                      as scripted  youve already lost two of
                      your own  how many more are you willing
                      to sacrifice

            damaskinos sinks until hes waistdeep in the crimson fluid

                                damaskinos
                      as many as it takes
                          pointing
                      do you see that jar over there

            stevens looks to a shelf where a gold and crystal coptic jar
            rests  a human heart floats within

                                damaskinos contd
                      it contains my human heart 
                          touching a pale scar on his
                           chest
                      something i relinquished a long time
                      ago  only a fool would appeal to it
                      now

                                                                 cut to

            int scuds workshop  cell  night

            the dying reaper has now been chained inside the cell  it
            wheezes and moans clearly in agony  blade and nyssa stand
            watch  blade grips the reaper beneath its jaw turning its
            face towards us

                                blade
                      recognize him

                                nyssa
                          nodding
                      from the surveillance footage in the
                      bloodbank  he was one of the guards
                      nomak attacked

                                blade
                      which means he turned about seventytwo
                      hours ago

                                nyssa
                      right  so why is he dying  he doesnt
                      appear to have any broken bones no
                      entry wounds of any kind  whats
                      killing him

                                blade
                      time

            blade nicks the reapers carotid artery with a knife  clear
            serum oozes out no red blood cells at all

                                blade contd
                      no hemoglobin left
                      their metabolisms are too fast  they
                      burn out  thats why theyre having to
                      feed so often  their systems are self
                      destructing

                                nyssa
                      if thats true what about nomak  hes
                      been alive longer than the others

                                blade
                      nomaks different  hes the carrier
                          shaking his head
                      theres something driving him beyond the
                      thirst  something were missing

            as they watch the reaper shakes through its final death
            throes then grows still the nictomembranes over its eyes
            slowly sliding down

            moments later  a series of isolated closeups

            a pair of gloved hands spreads apart the reapers eyelids
            in response the protective nictomembrane slides mechanically
            down over the pupil

                                nyssa os
                      they appear to have a nictating membrane
                      here like youd see on a crocodile or
                      camel  shields the eyes from sunlight

            the hands now part the reapers mouth probing the seam in
            the chin then splitting the mandible apart to reveal the
            enlarged esophagus  the fingers push back on the gums and
            the pressuresensitive fangs extend even further in response

                                nyssa os contd
                      a bifurcated mandible  more developed
                      masseter muscles and zygomatic bones
                      around the mouth allowing for a much
                      larger stronger bite 

            pull back to reveal

            blade nyssa and scud are gathered around the autopsy table
            the rest of the crew linger further back

                                nyssa contd
                      epidermal layers are thicker tougher 

            nyssa begins the yincision along the chest  once again
            clear serum oozes out  she cracks open the thoracic cavity

                                scud
                      holee shit

            we see inside the abdominal cavity  a complex pinkishgray
            parasitic organism has taken over every organ visible

                                nyssa
                      ive never seen anything like this  the
                      reapers are as different from us as we
                      are from you
                          probing the organism
                      its almost as if the virus is rewiring
                      their bodies creating new parasitic
                      organs which consume the old ones

                                blade
                      like cancer with a purpose

                                nyssa
                      exactly  look at the digestive system
                      its been drastically simplified  super
                      charged  and this 

            she pulls back the lungs  a calcified structure encasing a
            fibrous mass rests where the heart would normally be  she
            taps the calcified structure with a scalpel

                                nyssa contd
                      the heart is completely encased in bone

            she tries to cut into the bony shell and the scalpel snaps
            scud whistles impressed

                                scud
                      good luck getting a stake through that

            blade studies the reaper corpse then looks to the bloodpack

                                blade
                      weve got six hours till sunrise  be

                                blade
                      we take up the hunt again

                                chupa
                      you gotta be fucking joking

                                blade

                      daylights the only advantage weve got
                      theyll be more vulnerable then

                                reinhardt
                          pointedly
                      and so will we

                                blade

                      dying not you got it

                                reinhardt

                      going out into the sun  its too risky

                                blade
                      you dont have a choice  youre just
                      going to have to protect yourselves as
                      best you can

            blade spins and leaves  whistler follows  nyssa watches
            them disappear into blades room  reinhardt and the other
            vampires approach her

                                reinhardt

                      bullshit

            nyssa just stares him down obviously conflicted

                                chupa

                                asad
                          pointedly
                      i dont think  i follow orders

            asad looks to nyssa once more  perhaps hes even concerned
            now  shes still staring in the direction blade left


            int scuds workshop  blades sleeping area  night

            blade sits in the shadows wrapping a piece of rubber tubing
            around his arm injecting himself with pneumatic syringe of
            serum  he shivers convulses violently then throws back his
            head in relief  when he does so he sees 

            whistler standing in the doorway  they eye each other a
            moment as blade unwraps the tubing from his arm puts away
            his syringe and serum  whistler lights a cigarette then
            nods through a window towards nyssa and the others

                                whistler
                      you ask me you and miss muffet are
                      getting a mite too cozy for my taste

                                blade
                      i wouldnt worry about it

            blade moves to walk away but whistler stops him

                                whistler
                      i am worrying  seems to me youre
                      starting to get confused as to which
                      side of the line youre standing on

                                blade
                      pretty hollow words coming from a man
                      who spent the last year running with the
                      enemy

                                whistler
                      what the hell is that supposed to mean

                                blade
                      it means im starting to wonder if the
                      vampires still have their hooks in you
                      youve been acting strange ever since i
                      gave you the cure  reckless quick to
                      anger 
                          beat
                      you said it yourself whistler  those
                      vampires knew our defense system
                      backwards and forwards  whered they
                      get their intel

            whistler steps closer his voice dropping to a lethal
            whisper

                                whistler
                      im compromised  me  im not the one
                      playing stinkfinger with vampirella out
                      there

            blade stares back at whistler calm as a viper

                                blade
                      youre out of line old man

            the two comrades in arms stare each other down  then
            finally whistler backs away

                                whistler
                          quietly
                      well see

            whistler turns and strides exits  we hold on blade torn
            conflicted watching whistler retreat

            ext blades warehouseshipyard  night

            we see a figure emerge from the shadows  chupa

            ext city slum  night

            chupa walks the night scanning shadows

            chupas pov vampire vision

            like heatvision only tinged with crimson  there are drug
            dealers and bottom feeding whores trolling for tricks out
            here beating hearts and branching arteries highlighted on
            their ghostly silhouettes

            chupa moves to the mouth of an alley nodding to a dealer

                                dealer
                      lookin to get hooked up

                                chupa
                      what you got

            as the dealer glances around to see if anyones watching

                      horse hawaiian ice  whatever you want

            chupa sniffs the air glancing at a pulsating vein on the
            dealers neck and smiles

                                chupa
                      whatever huh  well im all off the
                      hook on that bitch

            chupa steps into the alley with the dealer

                      so whats it gonna be

                                chupa
                      fear

            chupa is at the dealers throat before he can finish
            flashing his fangs shoving him backwards  then 

                                chupa contd
                      i like a little adrenaline chaser

            the dealer takes off as blade swings chupa around  they
            exchange a couple of blows then blade knees him in the
            balls twisting him around by his arm dislocating it

            blade releases chupa shoving him forward  chupas broken
            arm dangles awkwardly  furious chupa reaches for his 45
            with his good hand  only to hear the click of another gun
            as its placed against the back of his head

            angle on nyssa

            standing behind him looking grim and determined

            chupa reholsters his gun then jams his dislocated arm up
            against the wall and resets it  he backs away  nyssa
            watches him leave looks to blade

                                nyssa

                                whistler
                      going on twenty years now

                                scud
                      blade doesnt talk about the old days
                      much

                                whistler
                      blade doesnt talk about anything much
                          nodding to scud
                      what about you though

            scud pulls up his tshirt  his abdomen is covered in a
            network of horrific scars  like something youd see on the
            survivor of a shark attack

                      thought this would happen to me but 

            scud takes a phillip and adjust some screws on the laser

                                scud contd
                      anyway halfway through our threes

                      staked those mamacitas a new honeyhole
                          shrugging
                      things kinda fell in place after that

            scud jiggles the necklace of fangs around his neck

                                scud contd
                      took myself a few souvenirs though

            scud triggers the modified entry light  the light pulses
            like a series of flashbulbs going off creating a
            stroboscopic effect as a waferthin superconcentrated blue
            beam of light slices through the shadows  scud looks to
            whistler and smiles

                                scud contd
                      mmmmmm  poppas got a brand new bag

            ext cityscape  predawn

            beyond the shadowed skyline of monolithic buildings the
            night is beginning to give way to dawn

            int scuds workshop  predawn

            scud stands before the others  he looks blearyeyed but
            pleased with the nights work  the fruit of their efforts
            are laid on a work table before them  a halfdozen uv laser
            guns along with a collection of uv flashbang grenades and a
            much bigger explosive device secured into a backpack carrier

            blade picks up one of the uv lasers  he sights down the
            length of it  scud takes a power pack and slaps into the
            base of blades gun

                                scud
                      the powerpacks have a limited charge
                      maybe ten minutes of continuous use at
                      most

            nyssa gestures to the flashbang grenades

                                nyssa
                      what are these

                      pop your load  might end up frying
                      yourselves in the process

                                whistler
                      what about you  youre not coming

                      how

            blade looks to nyssa who tosses reinhardt an aerosol
            cannister  he sprays a little then wrinkles his nose in
            disgust gagging

                                reinhardt contd
                      this is fucking foul

                      that reapers adrenal glands  all
                      mammals use them to mark their
                      territory  even vampires

                      if we use this well draw them out

                                                                 cut to

            int house of pain  drainage area  dawn

            beneath the ballroom gratings  a highangle shot looking
            down at the octagonal iron culvert around which blade
            whistler and the remainder of the bloodpack are gathered
            the mechanized sectional portions of the culvert covering
            are grinding upward flowering open and apart like some blood
            and rustencrusted gateway to hell

            int seweroutflow area  dawn

            one by one the group of hunters descend into the
            claustrophobic chamber  verlaine is lugs the uv bomb on her
            back  blade leads them to the clawedopen portion of the
            brick wall then on through

            int sewer line  continuous

            blade leads the group along a grimeencrusted line which
            slopes gradually downward sloshing through ankledeep run
            off water collected from the city above them  tendrils of
            mist drift about cutting their field of vision even further
            here and there thin shafts of sunlight cut down through
            cracks in the street above requiring the vampires to
            cautiously circumvent them

            they reach a fourway intersection of tunnels  blade pauses

                                blade
                      time for nyssas pheromones

            blade opens a statchel  inside are a dozen distinctive
            aluminum atomizers  he hands them out to the others
            whistler triggers a can spraying a thin mist over his face
            wrinkling his noses in disgust

                                whistler
                      eau de suckhead  tasty

                      well split into three units  first
                      team that makes contact wins the prize
                      try to maintain radio silence from here
                      on out

            blade points to chupa and whistler indicating the eastern
            tunnel  they head off  next blade directs nyssa asad
            snowman and verlaine down the western tunnel  blade nods to
            reinhardt and starts down the northern branch

            int eastern tunnel  day

            its darker here no shafts of sunlight slicing down from
            above  whistler turns on his uv entry light  chupa reaches
            out with his hand partially blocking the beam

                                chupa
                      turn it off

            as the shifting patterns of light and shadow play across
            chupas face we see his pupils contract and dilate
            unnaturally large in response

                                chupa contd
                      we want to attract them not scare them
                      off

                                whistler
                      yeah but you fangs can see in the dark
                      what am i supposed to do

            chupa tosses whistler a pair of nightvision goggles

                                chupa
                      bifocals grandpa  and try to keep up

            chupa heads into the darkness moving with uncanny speed

            int tunnels  various

            we intercut between the three teams now back and forth as
            they progress deeper into the citys bowels

            int northern tunnel  day

            blade and reinhardt trudge along  the tunnel slopes inward
            forming a vshaped channel where a trickle of water flows
            blade notices something bobbing in the water  he nudges it
            with his foot and knocks it free  its a broken human tibia
            which twirls around then flows past their legs

            a few steps later on reinhardt notices something else  he
            stoops into waistdeep water picking up what he thinks is an
            isolated human rib  but ends up snagging a tangled mass of
            hair mud and bones

            int eastern tunnel  day

            whistler and chupa move side by side  chupa is anxious eyes
            darting about  occasionally they come upon a transection
            with smaller conduits leading off to the right and the left
            then they reach a stooped narrower tunnel and have to move
            single file

            suddenly a blast of light and thunderous sound explodes
            above them  they look up 

                                whistler
                          startled
                      shit

            a subway train rockets by on a track just above them
            pummeling them with soot and dust

            unseen by them briefly illuminated by the flashing subway
            lights we see three reaper faces pale and haunting hanging
            upside down

            int northern tunnel  day

            blade and reinhardt reach a deadend where the tunnel has
            caved in  a berm of human bones slopes upward from the water
             skulls and ribs vertebrae tibias metatarsi  blade
            kneels inspecting them  there are gnaw marks on them

                                blade
                      must be hundreds of these skeletons
                      here

                                reinhardt
                      so

                                blade
                      so i think you people may have
                      underestimated how many reapers youre
                      dealing with

            int western tunnel  day

            as nyssa snowman verlaine and asad cautiously move
            forward nyssa gasps startled by 

            half a dozen reapers laying on the tunnel floor before them
            in a stagnant pool of sewage water  dead

            int eastern tunnel  day

            back with whistler and chupa whistler is in the lead

                                chupa os
                      heyhillbilly

            as whistler turns around chupa slams whistler in the side of
            the head swiping his nightvision goggles off  as whistler
            vainly searches for his goggles

                                whistler
                      what the fuck you doing

                                chupa
                      aint nobody here but you and me
                      chicken wing  id say this is as good a
                      time as any to settle up

            chupa moves stealthily in darkness violently kicking the
            older man  whistler tries to crawl away then reaches for
            his pheromone atomizer and locks it in the onposition  as
            chupa continues to lay into whistler we see the atomizer roll

            int western tunnel  day

            nyssa nods to asad and verlaine  they train their uv lasers
            on the area where the reaper corpses were  but the reaper
            bodies are gone  and so is snowman for that matter

                                asad
                      what  where did they go

                                verlaine
                      screw that where did snowman go

            just then we hear a noise from above  nyssa and the others
            whip their uv lasers in that direction

                                nyssa
                      jesus they were playing possum

            their pov

            a horde of reapers skitter away from the lights

            int eastern tunnel  day

            close on the pheromone atomizer the spray petering out
            whistler is beat to shit bleeding from his mouth  chupa
            reaches for his handgun whipping it out just as 

            whistlers hands brush the damaged night vision goggles  he
            swings them upward

            whistlers pov through goggles

            whistler has just enough time to register chupa the handgun
            pointed directly at himus before noticing something else
            just beyond chupa

            a dozen reapers

            clinging to the ceiling above  they drop down on chupa like
            a pack of rabid dogs literally tearing him in half

            int northern tunnel  day 20 years ago

            hearing gunfire and screams blade charges back in whistlers
            direction as 

            the berm of human bones

            explode apart  reapers charge towards them hitting blade in
            the chest driving him backwards  as blade falls his entry
            light swings upward illuminating

            another reaper

            drops down atop reinhardt knocking his uv gun into the
            water  we see even more reapers converging in on them from
            the side tunnels in a cacophony of shadow and noise

            int western tunnel  day 20 years ago

            verlaine nyssa and asad are firing their uv lasers  the
            pumping flashes of their guns throw crazy shadows in every
            direction  adding to the unbridled chaos of strobing light
            and noise  more and more reapers are swarming towards them
            moving towards us at an unearthly clip  nyssa and her
            compatriots retreat running for their lives

            a reaper

            leaps landing on verlaines back  it grabs her head and
            deftly snaps her spine in half with a sickening crunch

            int eastern tunnel  day 20 years ago

            whistler panics backing away from the sounds of the reapers
            slaughtering chupa  he finds his gun flicks on the uv entry
            light 

            and just like that the attacking reapers have vanished
            whistler whirls about sweeping the uv beam around but all
            he sees is darkness

            then a bonechilling whisper cuts through the shadows

                                nomak os
                      whistler

            whistler spins  nomak right behind him  as whistler whips
            the uv gun up nomak stops it  the beam is mere millimeters
            from the reapers face  close enough to illuminate his
            nightmarish features but not close enough to burn

                                nomak contd
                      if you survive this tell your master
                      my end is my beginning

            in an eyeblink nomak is gone  whistler spins shining the
            uv this way and that  alone in the dark

            int northern tunnel  day

            blade fires his uv into a reapers torso  as the reaper
            incinerates blade spins firing at a second reaper 

            on reinhardt

            firing his nonuv weapon  two reapers are closing in on him

                                blade
                      take mine

            blade throws reinhardt his uv laser and unsheathes his sword
            reinhardt sweeps the lethal beam over the two reapers

            blade retreats back into the water calm letting the
            creatures comes to him  as they close in on him he slips
            the tip of the sword beneath the surface of the water
            waiting 

            as one the reapers converge on blade  he swings his sword
            up from the water hacking away at them using their own
            momentum against them

            reinhardt considers his options  he decides to run for it 

                                blade contd
                      reinhardt

            reinhardt races away abandoning blade  blade reaches for
            one of the uv flashbangs clipped to his harness  he pulls
            the pin with his teeth and shoves it into an onrushing
            reapers mouth as 

            reinhardt slips on the wet concrete and 

            bang  searing light fills the tunnel instantly incinerating
            the reaper

            reinhardts unprotected face catches fire   he screams
            falling back into the water trying to douse the flames
            another reaper lands atop him dragging him down as 

            int northern and western tunnels  continuous

            we hear gunfire and screams coming from all directions
            blade retreats  a reaper fully on fire from the uv
            explosion races towards him  as blade decapitates it

                                blade
                          shouting into radio
                      regroup  regroup

            asad and nyssa also retreat  nyssa pulls a pin on a uv
            flashbang throws it behind her  babang  uv light fills
            the tunnels and 

            int sewer line  fourway intersection  day

            blade nyssa whistler and asad abruptly find themselves back
            in the fourway juncture kneedeep in water  they quickly
            regroup out of breath riding adrenaline highs

                                nyssa
                      wheres chupa

                                whistler
                      forget him hes chunkstyle

                                asad
                      same with snowman and verlaine

                                whistler
                      guess that perfume of yours did the
                      trick after all

                                blade
                          quietly
                      a little too well id say

            the others turn to look in blades direction

            dozens of red eyes

            are staring out at them from the darkness of the eastern
            tunnel  then we hear a hissing sound coming from the
            opposite direction  blade and the others spin around 

            more redeyed reapers

            are closing in on them from the west  and the north  and
            the south  there must be forty of them in all

                                whistler
                      perfect  we got the whole fucking
                      partridge family here

            they retreat until they are back to back each one of them
            covering their respective tunnel opening

            a reaper

            lunges at them from the north  asad triggers his uv laser
            scorching the creature  it howls and slinks backwards

            two more reapers

            attack from the east and the west  blade and nyssa respond
            in kind burning their assailants in midair  but even as
            they fire their uv beams weaken the flashes of light coming
            from their barrels pulsing less frequently

                                whistler contd
                      unless anybody has any bright ideas id
                      say were about half a battery away from
                      a reaper gangbang

            the foursome are managing to keep the reapers at bay but
            just barely  blade motions to nyssa

                                blade
                      give me the rest of the pheromones

            nyssa reaches inside her harness handing blade the remaining
            atomizers  he crushes them in his fist letting the fluid
            within spill over his face and chest

                                asad
                      what are you doing

            the reapers become even more agitated hissing loudly
            pressing in on them closer and closer  blade nods his head
            back down the western tunnel

                                blade
                      verlaines body is back there somewhere
                      with the uv bomb  if you train your
                      guns in that direction youll drive an
                      opening in their ranks  ill run for
                      it  when the reapers come after me you
                      make a break for it the other way

            asad studies blade with newfound respect

                                asad
                      you wont make it

                                blade
                          hefting his uv gun
                      then ill die trying wont i

                                nyssa
                      blade

                                blade
                      save it  i dont want to hear your
                      words  lets do this now

            the foursome spin firing their uv lasers down the western
            tunnel  the reapers shriek falling to either side their
            bodies burning 

            blade charges forward firing his dying uv laser  as he
            makes it past the line of reapers they start after him
            driven into a frenzy by the pheromones  the reapers in the
            northern and eastern tunnels flood after blade too leaving 

            nyssa whistler and asad to contend with the reapers in the
            southern tunnel  they discharge their weapons shouldering
            reapers aside making a mad dash for freedom

            int western tunnel  day

            blade runs splashing and stumbling through the water just a
            hairs breadth ahead of the howling reaper horde  suddenly
            the tunnel widens out into a larger chamber

            int southern tunnel  day

            whistler and the others fire back at the small group of
            reapers which have followed them rather than blade

            on whistler

            cut off from nyssa and asad  he spots a maintenance ladder
            and runs for it dragging himself up the rungs  a reaper
            leaps up the ladder after him 

            whistler reaches the top of the ladder but his exit is
            blocked by a manhole cover  its stuck  whistler swings up
            his shotgun firing into the cover

            the cover is blown upwards sending a shaft of blinding
            sunlight down on the reaper below him  as the reaper
            incinerates whistler scurries upwards to safety

            int western tunnelchamber  day

            blade reaches verlaines halfsubmerged body  he tears the
            backpack carrier off the dead vampire and hefts it onto his
            shoulder charging up an elevated concrete embankment as 

            int southern tunnel  day

            nyssa and asad find themselves cornered  their uv lasers are
            shot  the reapers are closing in and were 


            int western tunnelchamber  day

            back with blade the reapers overrunning him  they pile atop
            one another in a frenzied effort to get to him  dozens and
            dozens of them  and still blade struggles upward lifting
            the uv cluster bomb triumphantly above his head triggering
            the device

            the world goes white

            no explosions  just blinding purifying light leaving us
            with a retinaburn image of blades silhouette surrounded by
            reapers  in that brief instant the reapers are frozen
            revealed as wraithlike xray images of bone and muscle

            int southern tunnel  day

            a blastwave of light fills the tunnel chasing its way
            towards nyssa and asad overtaking the reapers before them
            asad throws himself at nyssa knocking her into the kneedeep
            water shielding her body with his own

            beneath the water

            asad still burns flaring up and disintegrating from the
            surface on downward like a piece of liquiddrenched
            magnesium bubbles streaming from his writing body

            int western tunnel  day

            darkness then patterns of subtle shadow and light as our
            vision slowly returns  fwash  blade strikes a flare  in
            the sputtering aureole the aftermath is slowly revealed

            blade crouches unscathed as if he were standing ground zero
            in the aftermath of hiroshima  scores of reaper ashoutlines
            radiate out from him some of them flashseared into the
            surrounding brickwork walls like permanent shadows

            int southern tunnel  day

            blade slowly makes his way down the tunnel using the
            sputtering flare to guide him  as before he sees nothing
            but reaper ash outlines  but then blade sees 

            nyssa

            bleeding and horribly burned despite asads sacrifice  blade
            crouches scooping her up into his arms

                                                                 cut to

            int hospital  innercity trauma ward  day

            bang  blade kicks open a pair of doors hurrying nyssa
            inside  hes carrying her limp form in his arms having
            wrapped her in a blanket  blade himself looks like hell
            warmed over  covered in blood ash and grime

            he rushes her towards the er navigating through a maze of
            patients and visitors  an er nurse approaches

                                er nurse
                      sir you cant just 

            wham  blade shoulders the er nurse aside barreling into the
            triage where bewildered doctors and orderlies wait

                                doctor
                      what

                                blade
                      she needs a hypertransfusion  now

            blade sets nyssa down on an operating table pulling off the
            blanket  shes badly burned and shes lost an enormous
            amount of blood  as we watch she groans revealing her
            fangs

                                doctor
                          aghast
                      god in heaven

            just then a policeman enters gun drawn

                                policeman
                      alright buddy step away if 

            whap  blade slaps the cops gun away and kicks him in the
            chest  the cop flies backwards slams into a bank of
            equipment falls  a nurse screams  in a near blur blade
            has his mach out and pressed against the doctors forehead

                                blade
                      do you want to die

                                doctor
                      not particularly

                                blade
                          holstering his mach
                      then get your fucking team in gear

            blade unsheathes his sword deftly drawing the edge across
            his wrist opening a vein  he cradles nyssas head pulling
            her mouth to the wound on his wrist  and as she starts to
            feed we pull back and 

                                                                 cut to

            ext the city  dusk

            the sun dips towards the horizon  the shadows of the urban
            landscape lengthen and darken in timelapse

            int scuds workshop  showers  dusk

            blade stands beneath the showerhead turning his face up into
            the scalding spray rinsing the blood from his chiseled
            physique  crimson water circles the drain

            int scuds workshop  blades sleeping area  dusk

            nyssa now rests on a cot  peaceful the color having
            somewhat returned to her features  after a moment her eyes
            flutter open and she takes in her surroundings  she is in
            blades austere bedroom  there are tatami mats a basin for
            water a wellthumbed volume of zen koans

            a shaft of sunlight

            cuts through an icy window pane above angling down near
            nyssas cot  dust motes swirl about it

            nyssa focuses on it  longingly  then she raises her arm and
            reaches towards it  closer closer  just barely extending
            her hand into the light  her fingertips blacken and smoke
            yet nyssa endures the pain for another moment  finally she
            withdraws her hand inspecting the damage  then notices
            blade watching her from the doorway

                                nyssa
                      each day is a little life

                                blade

                      each day is a little life  every
                      waking and rising a little birth every
                      fresh morning a little youth every
                      going to rest and sleep a little death

            she looks back to the sunlight wistful sits herself up

                                nyssa contd
                      anyone else make it

                                blade
                      i dont think so

            blade enters kneeling by the edge of the cot inspecting her
            wounds  studiously avoiding her gaze

                                nyssa
                      thank you

                                blade
                      for what

                                nyssa
                      it wouldve been easy for you to let me
                      die back there today but you didnt

                                blade
                          shrugging
                      i wouldnt read too much into it

            she reaches for his face  blade stops her hand

                                blade contd
                      you dont want to go there

                                nyssa
                      why

                                blade
                      because one of us is going to kill the
                      other before this ends

                                nyssa
                      it doesnt have to be like that  we
                      dont have to be enemies

                                blade
                      get real  i was useful to damaskinos as
                      long as the hunt was still on  now that
                      its over all bets are off

                                nyssa
                          pointedly
                      if thats true then whyd you save me

            blade stands now moving to the icecovered window troubled
            by the question  damned if he knows the answer  after a
            beat nyssa rises too keeping to the shadows

                                nyssa contd
                      why do you hate us so much

                                blade

                          beat
                      what about a wolf  what about any
                      predator

            nyssa pursues blade circling around in front of him so he
            has to face her again

                                nyssa contd
                      the only difference between you and me
                      is that i made peace with who i was a
                      long time ago  im not ashamed of what
                      i am
                          beat
                      you havent been hunting us all these
                      years  youve been hunting yourself

            blade moves away  she reaches for his shoulder  he whirls
            on her angry traps her hand  she tires to pull it free but
            he grips her wrist tightly pulling her closer 

                                nyssa contd
                      youre hurting me

                                blade
                      pain cuts the deepest isnt that what
                      you said

            and closer their faces are just inches apart now 

                                blade contd
                      reminds you youre alive

            and blade kisses her hungrily  nyssa responds in kind  her
            head drops low her mouth finding the cords of his neck 
            sucking at his flesh then sinking her teeth in deep and 

            wham  blade clamps a hand around her throat slamming her
            head back  a droplet of blood dribbles from her lips as she
            lets loose a breathless shudder  shes in the ecstatic
            throes of the thirst now all reason gone

            blade reaches his other hand to her shirt ripping it open as
            he runs his fingers across her breasts then over her exposed
            rib cage  he turns her around forcing her against the wall
            sinking his own fangs into the back of her neck  she groans
            as we 

                                                                 cut to

            the two of them

            naked on the tatami mats upon which blade sleeps  skin
            beaded with sweat  breath steaming in the chill air  hes
            atop her moving inside her with measured thrusts

            nyssas limbs are wrapped around him  she claws at the
            expanse of his back with her fingernails  her mouth is
            locked on blades throat then his is locked on hers
            together they drink leeching blood from one another

            pulling back again

            nyssa clutching greedily at blade like she never wants to let
            go  her soul is gone  transported to that place we drift
            to when the euphoria overtake us and were somehow able to
            transcend the horror of our fleeting lives

            finally nyssa gasps climaxing as she retracts her fangs
            from blade  her head rolls to the side as her pupil 
            focused on nothing short of eternity  dilate unnaturally
            large

            later

            blade and nyssa lie in each others arms awash in moonlight
            blissfully dead to the world until 

            something makes blade stir

            he sits up listening  nyssa stirs beside him  she moves to
            speak but blade holds up a hand silencing her  together
            they slowly creep towards a nearby window where 

            jared nomaks nightmare face

            is pressed up against the icy glass staring back at them
            nyssa gasps  blade draws back with a start  but in the time
            it takes to blink nomak is gone  just then we hear a
            noise  scud appears in a doorway groggy

                                scud
                      whats going on

                                blade
                      he was here  watching us

                                scud
                      nomak

                                blade
                      he wants us to know hes hunting us now

            moments later

            blade is at the computer workstation  he activates the
            footage of nomak he was viewing earlier  he fastforwards to
            a specific moment then plays it back at normal speed

                                blade contd
                      nomak said something to me before he
                      disappeared the first time 

            blade points to the screen saying the words as nomak
            silently mouths them

                                blade contd
                      athelfiki singenia ex amato  at first i
                      thought he mightve been using one of
                      the vampire dialects  but it turns out
                      its greek  do you know what it means

            nyssa shakes her head

                                blade contd
                      it means bloodbrother

                                nyssa
                      i dont understand

                                whistler os
                      well maybe i do

            blade spins his mach pistol up and ready to fire  whistler
            sits on the opposite side of the room watching them as he
            smokes

                                whistler contd
                          to scud

                                whistler
                      just out connecting a few dots

            whistler rises from his chair  he flicks his cigarette butt
            into the shadows and fixes blade with a heavy stares

                                whistler contd
                      bangin some vampire chick  kind of a
                      faux pas in our line of work wouldnt
                      you say  hope you double bagged it at
                      least

            blade is still guarded not yet ready to lower his mach

                                blade
                      whats your problem whistler

                                whistler
                      why dont you ask your girlfriend

            blade looks to nyssa but she seems equally perplexed

                                whistler contd
                      i did some checking on that carter
                      stevens character  that familiar of
                      theirs who claimed he was with the nih
                      turns out he used to work for them but
                      he doesnt anymore

                                blade
                      then who does he work for

            whistler gives nyssa a rueful stare then tosses blade a
            research folder  on the cover is the same red doublehelix
            logo we saw at damaskinos facility

                                whistler
                      some biotech outfit called caliban
                      industries  theyve been lying to us
                      since day one  this nomak fucker didnt
                      evolve  he was designed

            nyssa look to blade imploring

                                nyssa
                      i dont know what hes talking about

                                whistler
                      you expect us to believe that
                          to blade
                      who you going to trust blade  me or
                      her

            ext caliban industries  night

            a hightech heavily guarded industrial complex nestled
            within an expanse of unassuming wooded acreage overlooking
            the ocean

            int damaskinos lair  night

            carter stevens shuts down his computer workstation then
            moves to the heavy oak door glancing at a medical chart as
            he opens it  when he looks up 

                                stevens
                      you

            a fist punches stevens in the face

            blade

            stands in the entry way  whistler is behind him holding a
            gun to nyssa  scud is there too

                                blade
                          mobing in on stevens
                      start talking bitch

                                stevens
                      i dont know what you 

            blade spins stevens around shoving his face against a glass
            case crushing the mans nose spiderwebbing the glass

                                blade
                      nomak  you created him

            blade clamps his fingers around stevens broken nose and
            twists it with a sickening crunch  stevens screams caving

                                stevens
                      ohgodohgodohgod
                          in agony
                      alright alright  yes we did
                          gasping
                      please  please

            blade releases him  stevens sinks to the floor cradling his
            brutalized face

                                blade
                      keep talking stevens  tell me why

                                stevens
                          sputtering
                      the shadow cabinet  for decades theyve
                      been trying to find a way to rid
                      themselves of their hereditary
                      weaknesses  viral epidemiology
                      immunochemistry  recombinant dna was
                      the next logical step

                                nyssa
                          genuinely horrified
                      no thats not possible  they wouldnt
                      keep something like this from me

                                stevens
                      your father didnt want you to know
                          haltingly
                      something went wrong  the reaper strain
                      was too aggressive  then nomak escaped

                                whistler
                      and were supposed to clean up your
                      mess  fucking perfect

                                stevens
                          defensive
                      look the fact that nomak was
                      artificially created didnt make the
                      threat any less urgent  he was still
                      out there spreading the reaper virus

            but blades not concerned about that now  hes got something
            more pressing on his mind

                                blade
                      the genetic material you spliced into
                      nomak 
                          beat almost fearful
                      where did you get it

                                damaskinos os
                      i should think that would be obvious at
                      this point

            angle on damaskinos

            standing behind them

                                damaskinos contd
                      we took the genetic material from you

            int caliban industries  elevated corridor  night

            damaskinos leads them down a corridor

                                damaskinos
                      jared nomak is your genetic brother
                      and i suppose if you follow that line of
                      reasoning to its logical conclusion
                      then these are your offspring

            damaskinos reaches to a nearby control panel pressing a
            button  a pair of massive doors slide apart revealing

            the eugenics chamber

            we are in a vast multitiered temperaturecontrolled chamber
             equal parts 21st century medical facility and hammer house
            of horror

            a network of catwalks look down upon the circular chamber
            the center of which is dominated by a massive steel cask
            which is in turn ringed by a safety railing  the operation
            looks not unlike a smallscale water purification plant or
            perhaps a futuristic distillery  only in this instance the
            liquid churning within the cask is human blood

            tiny embryos

            each no bigger than a thumbnail line the walls of the
            chamber preserved in credit card sized cryocases  there
            are thousands of them resting atop one another in racks with
            stretch from the floor on upwards

            as damaskinos removes an embryo from the rack we see another
            embryo behind it  that cryocase now slides forward with a
            whir taking the place of the one which damaskinos removed
            like some kind of perverse vending machine  god knows how
            deep theyre stacked  if thousands are visible there could
            be tens of thousands in total

            damaskinos holds the translucent cryocase up to the light
            the embryo within shudders its tiny heart beating

                                damaskinos contd
                          proudly
                      a new breed begotten from your own
                      flesh  immune to silver even sunlight
                          stepping towards blade
                      the wolves have lain with the sheep long
                      enough  no more compromises  no more
                      deals  only closure

            boom  we hear the tread of heavy footsteps approaching  all
            eyes turn towards a side corridor

            reinhardt

            enters from the shadows holding scuds railgun  much of
            his face has been burnt away leaving him with a ghastly
            deaths head mask of blackened muscle and exposed bone

                                reinhardt
                      put it back in park blade

                                blade
                      thought you were dead

                                reinhardt
                      seems like theres a lot of that going
                      around these days

            as reinhardt aims the rail gun at blade a dozen vampire
            guards appear on the catwalks above also taking aim

                                reinhardt contd
                      sixthousand feet per second isnt that
                      what whistler said  lets see you dodge
                      this one 

            blade does his level best pulling his mach squeezing off a
            shot even as reinhardt fires  babang  blade is hit in the
            side spun clear around  his shot goes wild hitting one of
            the guards in the head turning him to ash as blade himself
            falls to the floor

                                nyssa
                      blade

            blade gasps in shock  the railgun needles have ripped a
            brutal hole through the side of his chestplate  he clutches
            at his flank trying to staunch the blood thats seeping
            between his fingers  as he sits forward we see more
            flechettes have embedded in the wall behind him having torn
            completely through him

            whistler steps forward  one of the vampire sentries lashes
            out striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle
            whistler sinks to his knees stunned  the guard disarms him

            on blade

            gritting his teeth against the pain  he reaches inside his
            combat harness pulling out the remote detonator for the
            explosive flechette in reinhardts skull

                                blade
                      kiss your ass goodbye reinhardt

                                scud
                      youre wasting your time blade  the
                      flechettes a dud

            scud crosses over to reinhardts side  whistler stares at
            him in disbelief

                                scud contd
                      it was never supposed to explode  all
                      it was supposed to do was make you feel
                      like you were in control

            blades eyes darken with hatred  reinhardt laughs

                                reinhardt
                      thought you had me on a short leash
                      didnt you chief  only it turns out
                      youre the one thats been on the leash

            reinhardt digs his claws into his scalp and tugs the barbed
            flechette from his skull  as he does so blades remote
            detonator beeps to indicate its being tempered with
            reinhardt finishes removing it and sighs contentedly

                                reinhardt contd
                      thats better

            reinhardt tosses the fletchette to scud who grins flipping
            down his lower lip to reveal a vampire glyph tattooed on it

                                scud
                      see im one of damaskinos familiars

            scud shakes his hand which is smarting from the blow  he

                      so thats down and dirty  got anything

                      moment they turned you  and two

                      i switched that dud of yours back with
                      the real one

            scud has a splitsecond of terrified wideeyed realization
            before blade pushes the button and boom  the flechette in
            scuds hand explodes blowing his body apart spraying those
            nearest him with blood  primarily reinhardt

                                reinhardt
                      son of a bitch

            as the others react with varying degrees of surprise and
            horror reinhardt savagely kicks blade across the face  he
            hits blade again and again driving him down to the floor
            then he bends and tugs the sword from blades backscabbard
            preparing to cut his throat

                                damaskinos

            reinhardt hesitates  nyssa takes a step towards blade but
            damaskinos stops her  damaskinos gestures to his guards
            they haul blade up and drag him from the lab  reinhardt
            gestures to whistler

                                reinhardt
                      what about him then
                          crossing to whistler
                           handcuffing him

                      unfinished business

            guards lay him on a steel autopsy table  he struggles
            against them but hes just too weak from loss of blood
            eventually they get him secured clamping his wrists and
            ankles into steel manacles which are affixed to the table

                                damaskinos
                      from his father of course

                      you experimented on your own son

            damaskinos slowly tightens his hand around nyssas throat

                                damaskinos
                      i have fathered thousands of children in
                      centuries since i first walked this
                      earth  make no mistake nyssa  those
                      bloodties mean nothing to me when
                      measured against the ascendancy of our
                      race  nothing
                          giving her an extra squeeze
                      if you have any interest in remaining
                      alive you would do well to remember
                      that

            damaskinos releases nyssa  she falls gasping for breath
            he stares down at her with disdain then exits

                                                                 cut to

            remain posted at the main entrance of the room  damaskinos
            approaches looking down at blade

            blade stares back at him still defiant but fighting a
            losing battle  hes dying and he knows it  his breathing is
            shallow  its an effort just to keep his eyes open

                                damaskinos
                      with every century humans become more
                      repulsive to me  once you were souls
                      to be taken corrupted  but you have
                      disgraced yourselves to being nothing
                      more than blood and meat

            two surgeons snap on surgical gloves  stevens is enjoying
            seeing blade helpless

                                stevens
                      were going to harvest you blade
                          injecting fluid into blade
                      bone marrow organs everything  your
                      tissues too valuable to let go to
                      waste

                                blade
                          weakly
                      nomak is still out there

                                damaskinos
                      true but thanks to you we know his
                      weakness  we can keep him contained
                      its just a matter of time before we
                      hunt him down

                                blade
                      too bad youre out of it

            damaskinos is amused by blades seeming lack of concern

                                damaskinos
                      and why is that

                                blade
                      revenge  thats what nomak wanted all
                      along  to pay back the people who
                      created him

                                stevens
                      you may be right  fortunately for us
                      he has no idea where this facility is
                      located

            blade smiles laughing tiredly

                                blade
                      he does now
                          off their concerned looks
                      hes been watching me since the tunnels
                      following me  i led him right to you

            blade lifts up his hand unfurling his previously closed
            fist  there is a deep gash in his palms

                                blade contd
                      just like a trail of bread crumbs

            damaskinos stares at blades hand then looks to the floor
            a line of blood droplets lead back to the doors through which
            he entered

                                                                 cut to

            a series of quick shots

            various hallways the helipad outside caliban industries
            etc  in rapid succession we see more trails of blood
            droplets  then just as quickly we are back

            with damaskinos and company  suddenly the lights above them
            flicker then go out  as emergency lights kick on 

            bang  bangbangbang  all eyes turn towards a steel
            security door which is shuddering  bulging and bending
            inwards as nomak throws himself against it

            damaskinos looks to a bank of security monitors which are
            flickering back to life now  we see nomaks blurred
            silhouette from various angles pummeling the door  then 

            ripppppp  a portion of the door is clawed open and we see
            a glimpse of nomaks snarling face

                                nomak
                          roaring
                      father

            damaskinos eyes widen in terror as he stumbles backwards
            activating an alarm  he looks to the guards screaming

                                damaskinos
                      stop him

            damaskinos runs for his life rushing out the opposite door
            quickly followed by stevens as we 

                                                                 cut to

            int caliban industries  corridor  night

            nyssa hears the alarms and moves into a corridor lit by red
            strobing emergency lights  vampire guards are rushing past

            int caliban industries  security room  night

            reinhardt also hears the alarms  he looks to the
            surveillance monitors where he sees nomak

                                reinhardt
                      shit

            behind him we see whistler taking advantage of the
            distraction  he folds his legs up under him working his
            cuffed hands over his feet  when reinhardt spins back away
            from the security monitors 

            whistler is gone  a steel grating in the floor lies half
            open  the obvious means of exit

                                                                 cut to

            int caliban industries  autopsy room  night

            as nomak continues tearing down the autopsy door bullets
            hammer into his back  he turns sees a dozen guards firing
            at him their gunfire chewing the shit out of the concrete
            walls around him  nomak staggers but doesnt go down as
            clear blood sprays from the body hits

            int caliban industries  maintenance conduit  night

            whistler shuffles forward through the narrow conduit on his
            elbows  we hear footsteps  through the metal gratings
            above we glimpse two figures rushing past 

            int caliban industries  another corridor  night

            damaskinos and stevens round a corner spilling into several
            guards  he shoves his fellow vampires aside

                                damaskinos
                      get out of the way

                                                                 cut to

            int caliban industries  autopsy room  night

            close on a grate moving up from the floor  whistler emerges
            rushing to blades side  as he starts frantically releasing
            blade from his bonds he looks to the ravaged door 

            whistlers pov through the vshaped gap in door

            nomak savages the guards flinging them into the air  a
            guards body hits the vgap in the door and obscures our view
            as 

            whistler redoubles his efforts finally freeing blade  he
            helps him from the autopsy table  blade is sinking starting
            to fade  whistler slaps his face shaking him

                                whistler
                      come on blade  talk to me

                                blade
                          weakly
                      blood

            int caliban industries  autopsy room hallway  night

            carnage  a frazetta painting come to life  nomak atop dead
            guards draining the last of his victims blood  he whips
            his face in our direction and roars charging the door 

            int caliban industries  autopsy room  night

            wham  the door gives way and nomak enters  to the right he
            sees whistler and blade exiting  to the left he sees the
            security monitors  damaskinos and stevens can be glimpsed in
            one of these monitors

            nomak moves to the left

            int caliban industries  third corridor  night

            blade clutches his bleeding side staggering down the
            corridor towards a door marked eugenics with whistlers
            help  by all rights blade should be dead  but he continues
            on moving towards the door with determination

            int caliban industries  4way intersection  night

            close on a hand twisting a safety lever on the floor  pull
            back to reveal stevens manually activating a series of
            hydraulic lockdown latches

            chinkchinkchink  the doors of the eastern northern and
            western corridors are sealing lockdown latches clamping
            down for extra security  even as the western door seals we
            glimpse nomak rushing towards it with inhuman speed

            on stevens

            panicked turning towards the open elevator cab where 

            damaskinos

            is waiting  but even as stevens starts towards the elevator
            damaskinos dispassionately presses the close door button

                                stevens
                      what are you doing

            stevens rushes towards the closing elevator doors but its
            too late  he pounds his fist against them  behind him we
            hear a terrible rending of metal as the western door gives
            stevens looks in that direction 

            in an eyeblink nomak is upon him slamming his hand over
            stevens face crushing it

            int caliban industries  elevator cab  night

            as damaskinos slides a security card through a reader and
            punches in a code a thin spray of blood jets across his pale
            forearm  he looks to the elevator doors  the spray of blood
            is coming through the vertical door seal  the metal doors
            shudder violently and then the cab begins to ascend
            damaskinos retreats to the far corner of the elevator
            breathing a sigh of relief

                                                                 cut to

            int caliban industries  eugenics chamber  night

            whoosh  a pneumatic door slides open  blade and whistler
            enter  they are on the second level now up amongst the
            catwalks  below them is the churning cask of purified blood
            they have almost reached the end of the catwalk when 

            reinhardt and his men

            converge on the lab from two directions at once  some of the
            vampires spill through the door on the second level with
            reinhardt while others enter on the ground floor

                                reinhardt
                      stop him

            as reinhardt takes aim at blade with the shotgun the other
            vampires fire  whistler is hit in the leg  he goes down
            crying out then grips blades arm shoving him onward 

                                whistler
                      go

            on blade

            gripping the guard rail for support dragging himself along
            reinhardt fires  a shotgun blast hits blade grazing him but
            otherwise missing him  as reinhardt curses and prepares to
            fire again 

            blade makes it to the end of the catwalk pitching himself
            out into open space  time slows to a crawl as blade tumbles
            downward plummeting into 

            the blood cask below

            blade sinks from view disappearing beneath the churning
            slurry of crimson  a beat passes as reinhardt and his men
            draw closer apprehensive  then an explosion of blood
            gushes over reinhardt and the others  they fall backwards
            blinded slipping 

            blade

            surfaces from the cask in morbidly glorious slowmotion
            think of sheen in the endsequence of apocalypse now only
            instead of a river of mud blade is covered headtotoe in
            crimson  majestic and glistening  a primordial god  he
            rears back his head letting loose a triumphal roar

            reinhardts men hesitate  one look at blades eyes and we
            can see hes tapped into a wellspring of fury even he never
            knew he had  the man is supercharged and ready for war

            blade tears into the vampires unleashing a blizzard of
            martial arts moves  he powers a right hook into the first
            vampires face then pivots launching a devastating spinning
            backfist into the face of a second  at the same time he
            rips the second guards security belt from his waist
            twirling it around nanchadkustyle to blind a third guard and
            capture the wrist of a fourth

            some vampires fire their guns but blade is a whirlwind
            shifting and dodging  bullets go wild hitting circuitry
            exploding apart cannisters of combustible chemicals  in
            seconds flames are licking across the laboratory floor

            blade drops causing a pair of vampires to fire their guns at
            one another

            then blade knocks two more vampires onto their asses with a
            foot sweep  then hes up again  slamming the bridge of a
            fifth vampires nose into his brain with a palm heel strike

            a snap kick an overhand elbow strike a knee stamp that
            shatters the vampires knee cap  an upward block a jab a
            cross a shin kick aimed at a vamps quadriceps

            overhand punches rising punches parallel punches spinning
            rear elbows deep kicks on and on and on and on in an orgy
            of superhero violence until 

            wham  blade cuts the last of the vampire soldiers down
            turning from the creatures disintegrating body to face 

            reinhardt

            the vampire mercenary clutches blades sword in his hand but
            the weapon provides him with little sense of security given
            that hes just seen a dozen of his men slaughtered  the
            automatic sprinkler system is on now spraying water down
            upon blade and reinhardt alike  blade advances

            reinhardts been cornered  theres nowhere else for him to
            run  refusing to be cowed reinhardt screams and brings the
            sword down at blades head when whoosh 

            but blade swings his hands upward slapping them on either
            side of the blade trapping the sword on its downward arc

            reinhardt strains trying to tear the sword away from blades
            grip  the vampires eyes widen in fear  and during that
            splitsecond in which the two men are frozen connected by
            the weapon which vibrates between them blade says

                                blade
                      tell me something chief  can you
                      blush

            twhish  the sword twists free from reinhardts grasp
            spinning upward into the air  reinhardt stumbles backwards
            against the blood cask railing as 

            blade catches the sword on its way down swinging it around
            in one fluid motion slicing reinhardts torso in half along
            with a diagonal axis  reinhardt sinks to his knees as the
            two halves split apart turning to ash before they hit floor

            beat  blade stands beneath the spray of the overhead
            sprinklers rinsing the blood from his body  he turns
            towards the exit sword in hand

                                                                 cut to

            int caliban industries  lobby  night

            a set of elevator doors open disgorging damaskinos  beyond
            the lobby windows we can see a waiting helicopter vampire
            soldiers readying it for takeoff  damaskinos rushes across
            the lobby and is almost at the exit when 

            chunkchunkchunk a series of steel shutters slam down over
            the doors and windows  damaskinos tries to tug one of the
            shutters upwards then moves to a keypad nearby  he starts
            hurriedly tapping in a numeric sequence when we hear

                                nyssa os
                      i overrode the security codes

            damaskinos spins around  nyssa stands behind him  shes got
            whistlers railgun in her hands

                                nyssa contd
                      were locked in

                                damaskinos

                                nyssa
                      maybe its better that way

            as if in response a grinding shudder comes from the elevator
            doors  damaskinos spins in wideeyed horror then 

                                blade os
                      whats it going to be damaskinos
                      thiavolos  the devil you know 

            blade

            enters the lobby from a mezzanine above sword in hand

                                blade contd
                       or the devil you dont

            damaskinos turns back to his daughter making a last appeal

                                damaskinos
                          vampire dialect subtitled
                      for gods sake nyssa  let us out of
                      here

            whamwhamwham  nomak pounds away  the elevator doors are
            starting to buckle then they tear apart completely 

            nomak

            bursts into the lobby roaring  if anything he is even more
            animalistic now his features having become grossly
            distorted

                                nomak
                          in vampire dialect
                      why are you frightened father  the
                      prodigal son has returned

            damaskinos scurries backwards but theres nowhere left to
            run  nomak descends on him lifting the vampire into a rib
            crushing embrace chomping his elongated canines into
            damaskinos throat

            damaskinos squeals like a child as his lifeblood is sucked
            out of him  his body begins to cave inward shrinking and
            twisting until theres nothing left but shriveled husk

            nyssa hefts the railgun and fires at nomaks back  nomak
            howls releasing damaskinos body then turns focusing his
            blooddrunk gaze on nomak

                                blade
                          alarmed
                      get out of here

            but nyssa stands her ground rachetting back the slide on the
            railgun readying to unleash another barrage of needles
            nomak charges moving at unbelievable speed  she fires
            again aiming at nomaks chest 

            but then nomak is upon her  he slaps the railgun from her
            hands smashing it to pieces
            then he wraps his hand around her throat pulling her
            forward sinking his teeth into her neck  nyssa screams

                                blade contd
                      nyssa

            on blade

            as he leaps from the mezzanine level sword extended like
            beowulf diving to slay grendel  he plunges the sword deep
            into nomaks upper torso  then drives it in even further 

            nomak releases nyssa and backhands blade across the face
            sending him sailing through the air  he lands skids across
            the floor 

            on nomak

            stumbling backwards into the wall  the sword has sunk so
            deep that the tip is actually protruding out his back
            scraping a gash across the wall as nomak slides towards the
            floor

            nomak grunts then reaches for the pomeel with his ruined
            hand  he grips the pommel and snaps the swordblade in half
            then he slams against the wall forcing the half of the
            broken blade thats still embedded in him out back through
            the front of his chest  as nomak rises to his feet 

            blade is on him again snapkicking the reaper in the chest
            nomak retaliates  blade somersaults out of the way then
            springs back again kicking nomak in the face breaking
            nomaks neck  nomaks head lolls unnaturally sideways for a
            heartbeat and then nomak swings his head around somehow
            righting his neck vertebrae with a snap of his head

            they trade blows a brutal deathmatch that seems to defy
            gravity  blade moves in for a roundhouse punch but nomak
            catches his fist holding it for a splitsecond then bending
            blades hand at an unnatural angle snapping his wrist bones
            the pain is enormous

            nomak starts beating the living shit out of blade pummeling
            him with his fists gripped by an uncontrollable rage  he
            smashes blade against a marble column cracking it  then he
            flings blade against one of the brushed steel walls  so hard
            that blades body actually leaves an indentation

            before blade can recover nomak is in front of him launching
            another kick  blade rolls his head out of the way barely
            avoiding nomaks boot heel which dents the wall  nomak kicks
            a second time  blade avoids nomak but third times the
            charm and nomak lands one squarely in blades gut
            blade falls beneath a flurry of blows unable to defend
            himself any longer  blood stains his eyes obscuring his
            vision  he strikes out blindly but nomak has forced him to
            the ground pinning him there  as blade struggles to free
            himself 

            nomak

            lowers his head towards blades face  the scarseam in
            nomaks chin splits open and nomaks lower jaw flares apart
            distending and widening to reveal the awful glistening hell
            maw  the hollow inner fangs and striated cartilage which
            are closing about blades face  blade twists his head
            violently to the right then glimpses the broken tip of his
            sword resting a few feet away  he reaches for it in
            desperation plunging it up into nomaks chest  nomak howls
            because the hilt has been broken off blade is forced to grip
            the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands  it
            slices into his fingers 

            but blade just grips the broken sword tighter ignoring the
            pain driving it deeper and deeper  until suddenly it
            penetrates the cartilaginous shell around nomaks heart and 

                                nomak
                          in vampire dialect
                      blood brother

            nomak smiles covering blades hands with his own  he looks
            blade in the eye then drives the broken sword home

            nomaks body stiffens his eyes grow unseeing an oddly
            serene look spreading across his tortured face  a patch of
            blackness begins radiating outward from his chest moving
            over his body carbonizing him from within  as his blackened
            flesh begins to crack blue flames flicker out from the
            fissures  in seconds nomak is gone

            beat  blade stands exhausted  then he looks to where nyssa
            rests  he moves to her side kneeling beside her  she
            smiles up at him bravely but frightened all the same
            blade inspects the wound on her neck  its clearly fatal

                                nyssa
                      how does it look

                                blade
                          with genuine sadness
                      not good

            nyssa nods  blade has only confirmed her existing fears

                                nyssa
                      it wont be long now  i can already
                      feel it burning inside me 

            she grips blades arm her eyes welling with tears

                                nyssa contd
                      i dont want to become what nomak was 
                          beat straining
                      i cant  i want to die while im still
                      vampire

            blade sighs  the burden is all to familiar to him

                                blade
                      what do you want me to do

                                nyssa
                      i want to see the sun rise

            on blade

            his face a mask of sad resignation  he lifts nyssa into his
            arms  she closes her eyes resting her head on his chest

            ext caliban industries  just before dawn

            the shutters over the doors and windows slowly rise  blade
            shoulders open the front door moving across the lawn towards
            a bluff overlooking the ocean  a moment later whistler
            emerges into the light watching as blade sets nysa down on
            the grass  her eyes flutter open and she looks into 

            the horizon

            where the faintest glimmer of predawn light brightens the
            cloudswept sky  its peaceful  we can hear the surf
            crashing on the shore below

            together they wait

            a glimmer of light emerges over the earths curvature
            spreading its dazzling radiance out across the skyline
            nyssas eyes widen in expectation her breath catching  she
            looks up at blade stroking his face smiling

                                nyssa
                      each day is a little life  remember

            blade nods hes strong for her  despite his best efforts a
            tear slides down his cheek  they kiss then as the sun rises
            in full glory flooding the world with its brilliance

            blade holds nyssa tightly to his chest refusing to
            relinquish his grip as her body catches fire  the end is
            blessedly quick  not a slowburn of blazing agony but a
            nearly seamless transition from life 

            to ash  nyssa collapses apart in blades arms billowing
            out around him in a cloud of glowing embers  one moment
            shes there the next shes gone  blade remains where he is
            kneeling on the bluff the wind carrying the last traces of
            nyssa aloft into the sky  he shuts his eyes  turns his face
            to the warmth of the sun surrendering himself to acceptance

            we rise up

            isolating blade alone on the windswept bluff  after a
            moment whistler moves to blades side  he rests a hand on
            blades shoulder but doesnt say a word  we keep moving up
            and up until the two of them are just a pair of tiny figures
            on the rolling coastline  then we 

                                                            dissolve to

            a series of closeups

            images of a weapon being forged all filtered through
            shimmering convection waves of intense heat  we see a hammer
            clanging down  the fires of a roaring furnace  sparks
            showering up from titanium slowly being given shape  molten
            silver  acid etching  and then we pull back to reveal 

            int blades workshop  night

            blade works before a forge by moonlight his body dripping
            with sweat  he slips his hand in a protective glove and
            grips the redhot weapon dousing it in a quench bucket  as
            a cloud of steam envelops blade he lifts it up for view

            a new sword

            perfect  lethal  wrought from titanium plated in sliver
            as blade inspects the sword we hear his earlier words again

                                blade vo
                      i am a hunter  a weapon  its what i
                      do  its in my blood

            satisfied with his work blade smiles
