        fade in

        ext hades  dusk

        we are moving toward the tyrell corporation across a
        vast plain of industrialization menacing shapes on the
        horizon stacks belching flames five hundred feet into
        the sky the color of cigar ash  the camera moves into
        a window in the large pyramidshaped building  a man
        is sitting at a table  another man enters the room and
        sits down  the following scene is reflected in the eye
        until holden is seated


        int tyrell corporation interrogation room  dusk

        the eye is magnified and deeply revealed  flecks of
        green and yellow in a field of milky blue  icy fila
        ments surround the undulating center

        the eye is brown in a tiny screen  on the metallic
        surface below the words voightkampff are finely
        etched  theres a touchlight panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen a dial that registers
        fluctuation of the iris

        the instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men  the man talking is big
        looks like an overstuffed kid  leon it says on his
        breast pocket  hes dressed in a warehousemans uni
        form and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his
        lap  despite the obvious heat he looks very cool

        the man facing him is lean hollowcheeked and dressed
        in grey  detached and efficient he looks like a cop
        or an accountant  his name is holden and hes all
        business except for the sweat on his face

        the room is large and humid  rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls  two large fans
        whirr above their heads

                                leon
                  okay if i talk

        holden doesnt answer  hes centering leons eye on
        the machine

                                leon
                  i kinda get nervous when i take

                                leon
                  sorry

        he tries not to move but finally his lips cant help
        a sheepish smile

                                leon

                  warming you up thats all

                                leon

                  youre in a desert walking along
                  in the sand when

                  is this the test now 

                                holden
                  yes   youre in a desert walking
                  along in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you lookdown and see a

                                leon

                                holden
                  doesnt make any difference what
                  desert its completely hypothetical

                                leon
                  but how come id be there

                                holden

                  to be by yourself who knows
                  so you look down and see a 
                  tortoise  its crawling toward
                  you

                                leon
                  a tortoise  whats that

                                leon

                                holden
                  same thing

                                leon
                  i never seen a turtle

        he sees holdens patience is wearing thin

                                leon
                  but i understand what you mean

                                holden
                  you reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back leon

        keeping an eye on his subject holden notes the dials
        in the voightkampff  one of the needles quivers
        slightly

                                leon
                  you make these questions mr
                  holden or they write em down
                  for you

        disregarding the question holden continues picking
        up the pace

                                holden
                  the tortoise lays on its back
                  its belly baking in the hot sun
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over  but it cant  not
                  without your help  but youre not
                  helping

        leons upper lip is quivering

                                leon
                  whatya mean im not helping

                                holden
                  i mean youre not helping  why is
                  that leon

        holden looks hard at leon piercing look

        leon is flushed with anger breathing hard its a
        bad moment he might erupt

        suddenly holden grins disarmingly

                                holden
                  theyre just questions leon
                  in answer to your query theyre
                  written down for me  its a 
                  test designed to provoke an
                  emotional response

        leon is glaring now the blush subsides his anger
        slightly defused

        holden smiles cheerfully very smooth

                                holden
                  shall we continue

        leon nods still frowning suspiciously

                                holden
                  describe in single words  only
                  the good things that come into
                  your mind  about your mother

                                leon
                  my

        leon looks shocked surprised  but the needles in
        the computer barely move  holden goes for the in
        side of his coat  but big leon is faster  his
        laser burns a hole the size of a nickel through
        holdens stomach  unlike a bullet a laser causes
        no impact  it goes through holdens shoulder and
        comes out his back clean as a whistle  like a
        rag doll he falls back into the seat  big slow leon
        is already walking away but he stops turns and
        with a little smile of satisfaction fires through
        the back of the seat

        as leon walks out of the room the voightkampff
        begins to blink faint but steady

        ext city street  night

        lights from the blimp flash along the street and wipe
        across the crowds of pedestrians as the voice track
        continues to blare from above

        a portable noodle bar is crowded with customers sit
        ting on stools slurping their food out of bowls

        deckard is standing near the noodle bar waiting for a
        seat  hes in his thirties wiry athletic rumpled
        used unshaven  hes holding a newspaper made of
        tissue paper open while he glances at the blimp
        passing noisily overhead  then he notices the
        counterman

        the counterman is beckoning to him to a newly vacated
        seat

        deckard sits down at the noodle bar and the counterman
        an elderly japanese slaps a menu in front of him

        no words on the menu just pictures of sliced fish
        parts

        deckard points to a particular item and holds up four
        fingers

        the counterman looks at the item on the menu confirms
        the order by holding up two fingers

        deckard shakes his head no and repeats his four
        fingers

        the counterman nods corrected and hurries off

        deckard glances overhead

        the blimp drifts off among the buildings like a fish
        disappearing in seaweed the noisy voice doing a
        diminuendo

        whap  the counterman slaps a bowl of rice and a pot
        of tea in front of deckard  then he puts the little
        bowl with the two slices of fish on the counter

        deckard looks at the fish  two slices of fish

        he looks at the counterman and holds up four fingers

        the counterman looks down at the two slices of fish
        looks like two to him  he looks at deckard as though
        deckard was a fool and holds up two fingers  he can
        count

        deckard stares bleakly at the fish  cant win

        he starts to eat and thats when he feels a tap on his
        shoulder  he glances over his right shoulder

        a huge cop in uniform is looming behind him

        deckard feels funny looks left

        another cop is looming over his left shoulder

        deckard is tapped again from the right

        turning again he realizes that it isnt the cop tapping
        him its the short japanese guy next to the cop  the
        guys got beady eyes and lots of energy  his name is
        gaff

                                gaff
                         in japanese
                  you will be required toaccompany me sir 

        deckard doesnt understand japanese thinks the man
        wants a seat

                                deckard
                  wait your turn pal

        deckard turns back to his food

                                gaff
                         in japanese
                  if you do not comply with anofficial request i will beobliged to exert my authority 

        deckard is ignoring gaff but the counterman leans in
        deckards face and translates

                                the counterman
                  he say you go with him

        deckard turns and finds gaff waving a badge in his face

                                gaff
                         in japanese
                  to defy duly constitutedauthority is to flaunt the publicgood 

        deckard doesnt understand a word

                                the counterman
                  he say youre under arrest deckard

        deckard turns back to his food

                                deckard
                  tell him hes got the wrong guy
                         turning to gaff
                          loudly
                  you got the wrong guy pal

                                gaff

        deckard flinches at the word boogeyman but goes on
        eating  but now we know and he knows its not a
        mistake

        passes the amber tumbler to deckard who takes it and
        holds it to the light

        int white tiled room day

        we are looking at the bright image of a naked man in a
        white tiled room with a white floor an abbatoir
        without blood the naked man is very athletic his
        face reveals nothing as he executes one physical demon
        stration after another one handed pushups gymnastic
        contortions etc an accompanying soundtrack drones
        boringly and while we might pick up a few key words
        such as emigration incentive and man made
        that we absorb the words they are the music to which
        the image exercises

        after a moment a series of lines cross the screen and
        the image diminishes and we realise we are looking at
        a monitor


        int bryants office day

        deckard and bryant are sitting in the dark looking
        at a series of flickering monitors deckard has a
        bored expression on his face

                                bryant
                  we had an escape from the off world
                  colonies two weeks ago six repli
                  cants three male three female
                  slaughtered twenty three people and
                  jumped a shuttle an aerial patrol
                  found the ship in the desert no
                  crew

                                deckard
                  these are old slave tapes show me
                  something new

        the naked man continues to exercise as bryant
        continues

                                bryant
                  no sign of them then three nights ago
                  they tried to break into the tyrell
                  corporation one got fried going through
                  an electrofield but we lost the others
                  going on the possibibility they might
                  try to infiltrate as employees we sent
                  holden in to run voight kampff tests on
                  new workers  guess he found himself one

        the screen changes roy batty in a loin cloth is battering
        a metal post with his fists  the smile on his face
        indicates a total lack of pain  he continues to pummel
        the post mercilessly his hands becoming bloody
        the only sound is batty humming beethovens 9th

        deckard begins to look interested

                  they coulda hid out

                  here for

                                deckard
                  they must want something pretty important
                  to risk coming back here what do the
                  rest look like 

        bryant pushes a button and a series of revolving still
        shots of leon pris mary and zhora appear on the screen

                                deckard
                  why the tyrell corporation why would
                  they return to the place of their
                  manufacture

                                bryant
                  maybe they want to find out when
                  they were made 

                                deckard
                  why would they bother

                                bryant
                  the nexus 6 was designed to copy human
                  beings in every way except their emotions
                  but the makers reckoned that after a few
                  years they might develop their own
                  emotional responses  hate love fear
                  anger envy  so they built in
                  a fail safe device

                                deckard
                  whats that

                                bryant
                  the nexus 6 has only four years
                  to live

        the screens go blank the lights go on  bryant pours
        two more drinks and hands one to deckard

                                bryant
                  you got one more problem pal

        deckard downs the glass

                                bryant continuing
                  looks like holden found out that

        gaff is terse and silent at the controls  suddenly the
        spinner rocks urgently from side to side and the sound
        of a hot ferrari spinner dopplers off

        now we see for the first time rachael a beautiful
        woman in her late twenties dressed with taste and
        dignity

                                deckard
                  replicants are like any other
                  machine they can be a benefit
                  or a hazard if its a benefit
                  its not my problem

                                rachael
                  may i ask a personal question

                                deckard
                  go ahead

                                rachael
                  have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake 

        deckard blinks hesitates before answering the
        question

                                deckard
                  no

                                rachael
                  but in your position that is a risk

        an owl flaps around the huge marble office

                                tyrell os

                  we call it voight kampff for short

        deckard turns to see an older man very distinguished
        very well tailored has entered the huge marble office
        tyrell

                                rachael

                                tyrell
                  try her

        deckard looks at rachael  shes a beauty alright  he
        shrugs

                                deckard
                  its too bright in here

        tyrell hits a button

        the windows darken a polaroid effect that seems to
        give tyrell the power to turn off the sun

        deckard is placing the voight kampff case on the table

        the voight kampff opens like a butterfly as the room
        darkens


        int tyrells office  a little later

        rachaels eye fills the screen the iris brilliant
        shot with light the pupil contracting  we hear
        deckards voice and we have the impression the test
        has been going on for a while

                                deckard os
                  you are given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday

        tyrell stands silhouetted behind deckard who sits in
        front of rachael

        the needles in both gauges swing violently past green
        to red then subside

                                rachael
                  i wouldnt accept it also id
                  report the person who gave it to me
                  to the police

                                deckard
                  you have a little boy  he shows
                  you his butterfly collection plus
                  the killing jar

        again the gauges register but not so far

                                rachael
                  id take him to the doctor

                                deckard
                  youre watching tv and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on
                  your wrist

                                rachael
                  id kill it

        both needles go red  deckard makes a note takes a
        sip of coffee and continues

                                deckard
                  in a magazine you come across a
                  fullpage photo of a nude girl

                                rachael
                  is this testing whether im a
                  replicant or a lesbian

                                deckard
                  you show the pciture to your
                  husband  he likes it and hangs
                  it on the wall  the girl is lying
                  on a bearskin rug

                                rachael
                  i wouldnt let him

                                deckard
                  why not

                                rachael
                  i should be enough for him

        deckard frowns then smiles  his smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around

                                deckard
                  last question  youre watching
                  an old movie  it shows a banquet
                  in progress the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters

                                rachael
                  ugh

        both needles swing swiftly

                                deckard
                  the entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice

        needles move less

                                deckard
                         continuing
                  the raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog

        deckard switches off his beam

                                tyrell
                  well mr deckard

        deckard is looking at tyrell and wincing indecisively

        he doesnt get it  are they playing with him

                                tyrell
                         continuing
                  perhaps some privacy will loosen
                  your tongue mr deckard

        he turns to rachael

                                tyrell
                  would you step out for a few moments
                  rachael

        rachael exits looking a little shaken  whats going
        on

        deckard stares at tyrell

        tyrell meets his look

                                tyrell
                  im impressed  how many questions
                  does it usually take to spot one

                                deckard
                  i dont get it

                                tyrell
                  how many questions 

                                deckard
                  in columns of four cross referenced
                  twenty or thirty

                                tyrell
                  it took more than a hundred for
                  rachael didnt it 

                                deckard
                  she really doesnt know 

                                tyrell
                  shes beginning to suspect i think

                                deckard
                  suspect  how can she not know
                  she is

                                tyrell
                  well we began to notice in them
                  a strange obsession

        tyrell is pacing now lecturing

                                tyrell
                  after all they are emotionally
                  inexperienced with only a few
                  years inwhich to store up the
                  experiences which you and i take
                  for granted  if we gift them
                  with a past we create a
                  cushion or pillow for their
                       emotions and we can
                  control them better

                  memories

                  copied and regenerated cells from
                  the brain of my sixteenyear
                  old niece  rachael remembers
                  what my little niece remembers

                  i saw an old movie once  the
                  guy had  bolts in his head

        ext angle on deckard  night

        deckard and gaff are standing in front of the hotel
        looking it over

        deckard glances at a crumpled piece of paper in his
        hand with an address scrawled on it

        he glances at the hotel  the address is correct

        deckard and gaff enter the hotel leaving frame

        an old man leads deckard and gaff to a door  the old
        man is wearing an oxygen tank taking occasional hits
        of air from a mask  he unlocks the door

        deckard and gaff enter wearily hands inside their
        coats on their weapons

        int hotel room  night

        the room is dark and ominous full of danger

        deckard studies the shadows weapon ready

        satisfied the room is empty he hits the wall switch

        a fourtube fluorescent light overhead flutters weakly
        to halflife two tubes

        deckard studies the room

        its clean in contrast to the littered hallway  a bed
        a wardrobe a small desk a chair  spartan almost
        military

        gaff has seated himself on the windowsill  except for
        his eyes he is motionless like a statue

        deckard reaches into his pocket and takes out infrared
        goggles which he puts on  he looks strange wearing the
        goggles

        the room from his pov is seen in high contrast
        every speck of dust in bright white the fingerprints
        on the wall standing out like paintings gaff appear
        ing eerie and ominous

        deckard starts to inspect the room with great care
        feeling the moulding inspecting the mattress on the
        bed studying the fingerprints on the wall

        gaff watches motionless

        hes inspecting the suit neatly hung there  he feels

        deckard is peering at her from the doorway a peeping
        tom  he sees the shaking hands  he doesnt like this
        shit

        he turns his attention to getting the drink  the
        kitchen is a disaster area dirty dishes overflowing
        from the sink the way a plant grows out of a pot

        deckard opens the refrigerator  the contents arent
        messy so much as unusual  he opens the freezer com
        partment and pulls out a bottle of tsing tao vodka
        and eyes it  halfempty

        he rummages among the dirty dishes for a glass that
        doesnt actually have fungus growing in it  he finds
        one thats only greasy wipes it with a dirty towel
        making it greasier and pours vodka into it

        he heads back into the living room


        int living room  night

        deckard stops in the doorwaysurprised

        the room is empty rachael is gone

        deckard stares at the empty room for a long moment  then
        he chugalugs the vodka as he brings his head back and
        winces from the fiery booze he sees something

        something crumpled on the floor

        he goes over and picks it up

        its the picture of rachael with her parents he studies
        it

        on the other side is a phone number

        deckard walks over to the window and stares out

        a spinner flashes by smearing light on his face

        she crosses the street past a window full of wedding dresses
        as the spinner zips off in the distance

        pris walks under the art deco marquee between the twisted
        corduroy columns and into the foyer

        she picks a spot near the entrance and is covering herself with
        old newspapers and trash for warmth when she hears a strange
        noise

        a weird street cleaning machine grinds past

        pris watches the machine with interest then huddles
        under the trash

        a battered old truck sebastians sputter and farts
        to a halt in front

        sebastian gets out a young man with skin that is yel
        lowing into old parchment  hes wearing a world war
        two leather pilots cap and dark goggles and carrying
        a pack

        in spite of his youth he carries himself like old
        china as he walks toward the entrance with the gait
        of an old man

        sebastian stumbles over the trash covered body of pris
        and pris leaps to her feet and start to run like a
        frightened gazelle

                                sebastian
                  hey

        he reaches down and picks up the bag she left in the
        trash

                  you forgot your bag

        hes holding it up

        she eyes him from a distance unsure of him  then
        she moves toward him tentatively

        int deckards apartment  night

        a blurry photograph unclear fills the screen

        the photograph intensified  the foreground blurs and
        sharpens  its the man in leons room with the
        wardrobe behind him  the head is turned away and
        downward the face unreadable

        another change  a dramatic one  the picture is
        suddenly three dimensional

        now we see that deckard is studying the picture in a
        viewer controlling the effects with punch controls

        the ashtray next to him is full of butts  the bottle
        of vodka is nearly empty

        he sucks on his cigarette and empties the vodka bottle
        into his glass and goes back to peering into the
        viewer

        he punches up

        a transparent grid with vectors is superimposed over
        the photo

        deckards eyes move over it carefully

                                deckard
                  sharpen line fortyeight between
                  twenty point twentyseven

        the edge of the man sharpens

                                deckard
                  profile trace

        slowly the view tracks the periphery of the mans
        shoulder up and around the skull down the other
        side and as it approaches the bottom of the picture
        passes a miniscule sparkle

                                deckard
                  stop  back up

        the line is retraced

                                deckard
                  stop

        the faintest little sparkle  static  almost nothing
        deckard leans forward

                                deckard
                  enhance

        the view squeezes in  the spark seems to be coming
        from about fifteen feet behind the figure  from
        within the wardrobe

                                deckard
                  seesaw

        after a short pause as if the command causes the
        machine to strain it emits a thin highpitched
        frequency sound and the picture begins a horizontal
        yawing motion  as it swings back and forth glimpses
        of things previously obscured by the foreground
        figure are revealed  slightly at first but the
        opening grows as the process picks up momentum

        deckards right down there hands on his knees like
        a man watching his favorite team make a crucial play

                                deckard
                  stop

        the picture freezes

                                deckard
                  enhance

        the view pushes in to the wardrobe  in its gloomy
        recesses hangs a dress

                                deckard
                  enhance

        in closer on the dress  an exotic shimmering gown
        made of sequins  deckard ponders it smiles slightly

                                deckard
                  i dont suppose one of those males
                  has a transvestite problem

                  those males has a transvestite

        deckard considers the situation for a few moments
        then frowns thoughtfully and fishes his wallet out of
        his pocket  he produces the flakes he found in the
        hotel room

        deckard lights a cigarette

        the flake

        hes holding it on the tip of his finger under the
        light of the console screen  he sits down studying
        it like hamlet contemplating yoricks skull  but
        for the hum of the machine a long silence

                                esper
                  youre gonna have a fire if you
                  dont turn off the machine

        absently deckard reaches out and flips it off  he
        sits a while in the silent dark  then goes into the
        bathroom

        it might be 200 am but the joint is still crowded
        as noisy taxi drivers jostle each other for seats and
        jabber in kangaroo a crude lingual mix of chinese
        japanese french and tagalog

        deckard is hunched over his bowl of noodles slurping
        hungrily from his busy chopstickswhap  the counterman slaps a serving of fish heads on
        the counter in front of a chinese sitting next to
        deckard

        startled by the sound deckard glances at the bowl of
        fish heads then turns his attention back to his
        noodles

        but after two bites he frowns and turns to look at
        the fish heads again

        the chinese is eating the flesh hungrily from a head
        he cleans the skull and drops it on the plate

        deckard stares at the heads with their blank stares
        that seem to gaze at eternity

        deckard is thinking

        the chinese is eating

        deckard frowns lost in furious thought  suddenly he
        reaches out and grabs a fish head

        deckard is peeling scales off the fish head  he grabs
        his wallet produces the flake and compares it to the
        scales from the head  he ignores the ranting of the
        chinese as he stares at the flake next to the scales

        we see the egyptian for the first time as he takes
        his eye from the viewer and points to a snake in one
        of the many tanks that writhe with groggy reptiles

                                egyptian
                         continuing
                   such as that one there with
                  the black and white ring on tail

                                deckard
                  what helps you to remember 

        the egyptian pushes a hand out in front of him revolving
        the thumb slowly against the next two fingers

        deckard slips a card out of his pocket and into the
        mans fingers  its a police card  it gets a super
        cilious smile a sigh and a shrug  and thats all
        it gets  the man knows his rights  the card is
        handed back  the smile remains

                                deckard

        pause  the egyptian smiles smugly  it pays to have
        things covered  deckard pushes closer

                                deckard

        the egyptian works on an uncertain shiteating grin
        hoping to charm his way out of a hole

        deckard lets him sweat for a beat or two looking hard

                                deckard
                  who do you sell your junk to

        the eygptian looks nervously at deckardsees he
        means business and hastily begins to shuffle through a
        wad of receipts from a cigar box

        behind him the stage show is progressing  a beautiful
        woman named salome is emerging from the large egg very
        scantily clad an erotic birth scene

        rachael appears on the telephone vidscreen

        something on the stage catches deckards eye he frowns

        on stage a snake has emerged from the second egg

        deckard is suddenly preoccupied with the stage show as
        he absently gives the address over the phone

        int backstage a little later

        you can hear applause and catcalls from the audience
        as salome flounces backstage  she starts toward the
        dressing room

        deckard emerges from the shadow

                                deckard
                  excuse me miss  salome

        she turns  deckards posture and attitude suggest humble
        sleazy persistence  he comes closer with his shiteating
        grin

                                deckard
                  id like to have a word with you
                  if i could

        salome stands almost six feet tall in her high heels and
        looks down on him with haughty suspicion a girl who
        knows how to handle cheap hits

                                salome
                  yeah

                  dont worry im not here to

                  committee on moral  abuses

        she nods taking it a little more seriously

                  theres been reports of the

        contact theres an electric snap  he jerks his hand
        back from the shock

        salome is taking off her costume  theres not much to

        which now hangs on the wall next to the shower  she didnt
        look like nexus designated zhora to begin with but even less

        to get back to its mistress  caught up in the sensu
        ousness of the moment absently she reaches out to
        stroke the snake

        deckard works his way down her back over her buns and
        as he reaches her thighs sits on the cot  concen
        trating on her buns he leans back for a handier per

        ringtailed diamondback rattler  its lethal looking
        spadeshaped head elevated out of its coiled body
        tail erect and whirring madly

        deckard rolls off the cot going for his blaster as he
        hits the floor  salomezhora has her hand around the
        head of the python and using it like a club she
        brings it down with all her might

        deckard rolls out of the way as the snake whistles
        through the air with such force it ruptures as it
        hits the floor

        if deckards fast zhoras a blur  as he fires her
        foot kicks into his groin and he doubles up with the

        dressing room in time to see her go through the door at
        the other end of the hall

        it hurts to move so fast but he jacklegs after her
        arrives at the door and flings it open  blackness

        brightly lit stands  zhora in just a translucent
        raincoat is not out of place in this flea market at
        mosphere  trying not to run she slices through the
        mob as quickly as she can  deckard is not far behind
        dodging and sidestepping trying to move against the
        tide of people scurrying for shelter

        she comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street  she glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians  all three go down

        deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get
        ting to her feet  she sees him and runs  the two
        pedestrians are in his line of fire  he runs past
        them and drops to one knee leveling his blaster

                                deckard
                  stop or youre dead

        she doesnt

        deckard opens up squeezing off two quick misses

        whap  the corner of the building disintegrates 
        bricks imploding dust in the air

        fwaaap  another miss  a lamppost wrenched with a
        tight air implosion  twisted metal a breath of smoke

        deckard fires again

        whump  zhora takes a hit in the back of the head and
        thats it for her except her motor reflexes which keep
        her going right into a showcase window

        crash  zhora explodes through a series of plate glass
        windows in adjoining shops

        deckard is trying to pour fire through the tunnel of her
        jagged wake but after two misses his blaster clicks
        empty clicks empty clicks empty and he watches her
        go

        zhora breaks through one window after another getting
        sliced already shot running on reflexes  glass
        sprays like fireworks as she smashes through the last
        two windows and into the street  shes going too fast
        to stop

        she hits a passing bus so hard shes smeared all over the
        side like a mural and the bus squeals to a halt

        the rain has stopped and turned into a quiet drizzle
        water gurgling down the gutters

        hunched over breathing hard deckard comes slowly
        forward  the crowd starting to gather  something here
        for everybody as theyre coming from all directions
        deckard moves through them ending up to the side of
        the bus

        zhora is wedged on her side torn bloody and broken
        all she can move is her eyes  they dart about like
        a wounded animal doomed in a trap and stop on
        deckard

        hes kneeled in the street stooped low head cocked at
        an awkward angle looking back at her

        in the cramped and dripping darkness her eyes are turn
        ing glassy  the intervals between the falling drops of
        water accentuate the silence until there is no dripping
        and even the gurgling gutters have receded into silence
        as the life drains out of zhoras face until its
        frozen dead

        deckards eyes slowly follow the rivulets of blood that
        lead over the slope of a blacktop to his shoes  deckard
        tries to repress his wince  his eyes reveal that its
        getting to him  hes aware of the spectators around
        him

        looking up he sees them moving nervously away from
        him with frightened looks

        then he sees her  rachael is standing in the crowd
        staring at the dead zhora

        rachaels face reveals her horror  she looks from zhora
        to deckard

        deckard feels her eyes burn into him   he clicks his empty
        pistol stupidly  click click

        lights from a spinner smear over the crowd sirens whine

        deckard sees rachael disappear into the crowd

        deckard starts to say something but anything he said would
        be drowned in siren noise

        rachael is swallowed up into the crowd near abig signor some other distinctive landmark

        cops points to zhora gives a couple of instructions and
        hurries off passing under thebig sign leaving the cops

                  hey what the hell buddy

        the samoans faces are blank  they stick by the fire and
        express no feelings anout the events in the alley

        deckard is swept off his feet and twirled around in
        leons beartrap embrace

        leon lets go and deckard hits the pavement skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin but he
        rolls out of it and comes up with gun in hand but leon
        is so fast hes already there and kicks it out of his
        hand

        leon moves towards him backing deckard against the

                  painful to live in fear isnt it

        but leons got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley

        deckard hurls forward knocking him off balance and
        scrambles to get away  leon grabs him by the foot
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground

        deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles
        protecting his head with his arms waiting for the
        next one

                                deckard

        satisfaction  its the bullet that went through his
        neck  he hits the ground hard his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog  dead

        deckard has slumped to the ground where he sits propped
        into a sitting position by the wall staring up in
        amazement at his deliverer

        he sees rachael standing there with his blaster
        rachael is staring at the body of leon stunned and
        shaken at what she has done

        and he glances

        indicating the vehicle at the curb

        dry blood and swollen splits again and blood gushes
        into the clear liquid in the glass

        deckard stares at the bloodstained drink ruefully then
        takes a thirsty gulp and licks his bleeding lip

        the ice in  rachaels glass is rattling  shes standing
        only a few feet away half eaten by shadows her eyes
        blank with shock

        the reason the ice is rattling is because her hand is
        shaking

        deckard is unaware of her eyes on the back of his neck

        shes looking at the ripple of muscle around his
        shoulders

        deckard is standing in front of the mirror  hes
        staunched the bleeding lip and now hes studying it

        the rustle of silk

        rachael appears in the doorway of the bathroom drink
        in hand

        deckard doesnt acknowledge her presence

        there is a long silence she sees the muscle ripple in
        his naked back  hard body  scars of old wounds

                                rachael

        rachael waits a long tense moment for an answer

                                deckard
                  no

        deckard waits before he lets it out

                                deckard
                  i guess i owe you

        deckard turns and brushes past her so she has to
        step back

                                deckard
                  but somebody will


        int bedroom night

        deckard is sitting on the bed wasted still in his
        towel clean white bandages on his face  he touches his
        lip gently

        he can hear the clock ticking and then the whisper of her
        stockings as she approaches the bedroom from the hallway
        he hears her stop lost in the shadows beyond the door
        a pause then her voice

                                rachael os
                  the file on me the incept date
                  the longevity the psychoprogram
                  those things

        her voice hesitates stops  deckard sits there as the
        clock ticks for a long moment

        in the corridor lost in shadows rachael is working up
        the nerve to ask

                                deckard
                  yeah 

        in the shadows rachael takes a deep breath

                                rachael
                  you saw them

        deckard exhausted stares absently into space

                                deckard
                  theyre classified

        in the corridor rachael persists with effort

                                rachael
                  youre a policeman

        deckard touches a spot on his forehead looks at the
        wall

                                deckard
                  i didnt look at them

        in the hallway rachael is hardly breathing

                                deckard os
                  i didnt want to

        it must come as a tremendous relief to her  she stands
        in the shadows grateful for the smallest favours  she
        waits a moment hearing the clock ticking  hearing the
        distant noises of an apartment house then she speaks
        again

                                rachael
                  that test of yours the voight
                  kampff test

        she pauses before completing the question its a
        biggie

                                rachael
                            continuing
                    did you ever take it yourself 

        rachael waits for a long moment in the shadows

        the clock ticks

        no answer

        she moves into the light from the bedroom door and
        peers in

        deckard is lying on the bed snoring gently

        int living room night 

        the clock is louder in the living room

        rachael walks through the shadowy room lit by a single
        lamp

        she sees a picture of deckards wife and son on a
        table

        she looks at it for a long moment as though she might
        be jealous

        she sees a picture on top of the piano

        a picture of a little boy and his father in fishing
        clothes each holding a pole the boy proudly display
        ing a single undersized fish the hint of a smile on
        the fathers face

        she looks at the sheet music on the piano chopin

        she stands close to the keys and starts to play  she
        makes a mistake almost immedaitely  she sits and
        starts again and she is just a hair tentative but
        theres no mistake the feeling the rhythm the
        beauty of the music  it fills the whole apartment

        he sits up tries to remember  was she here   were they
        talking   he must have dozed off  he gets up laboriously
        painfully and limps out of the bedroom still in yesterdays
        clothes

                  am i very different

                                deckard
                  yeah

                                rachael
                  how

        her voice is small  something very young about her
        she looks up at him for the first time

                                deckard
                  stand up

        she does  shes looking up at him with those big mer
        maid eyes and he kisses her mouth  and then again
        she doesnt respond  his voice is a whisper

                                deckard
                  now you kiss me

        she does  but its self conscious

                                rachael
                  i cant rely on my memory to

        he stops her with another kiss

                                deckard
                  say what i say

        she nods  his voice intimate low

                                deckard
                  kiss me

                                rachael
                  kiss me

        he does soft wet tender  he backs off  magnetic
        palpable energy growing up between them

                                deckard
                  my eyes

                                rachael
                  kiss my eyes

        she closes them  he kisses each fluttering lid

        shes catching on quick  her lips are right there

                                deckard
                  i want you

                                rachael
                  i want you

                                deckard
                  again

                                rachael
                  i want you

        her face is flushed  his fingers go to her mouth 
        slowly over her lips and inside into the wetness  her
        head is leaning back eyes shut

                                rachael
                  bite me

        his mouth goes to her neck her ear  his teeth evoke
        a shiver and a gasp as they take her flesh  her breath
        is coming faster

                                rachael
                  put your hands on me

        he rakes his fingers through her hair and pulls her
        into him  his other hand molding and pressing her
        working around her body and under into the privacy
        of her dress

                                rachael
                  shall i take off my clothes

                                deckard
                  oh yeah

        hes kissing her hard deep soft shes hardly able to
        talk shes so excited

                                rachael
                  do whatever you want to me

        he is and her legs can no longer hold her and shes
        sinking to the floor in his arms moaning their words
        obscured by kisses

                                                   cut to


        int sebastians apartment  night

        pris is staring out the window watching

        batty lies quietly on the couch rubbing one of his hands

        sounds emanate from the kitchen

        batty gets up and goes to a chess set in the corner of the
        room a game is obviously in progress  batty studies it for
        a moment then moves the white queen to the bishop

        pris walks over to him her tone muted but demanding

                                pris
                  well

        batty finds her attitude amusing which makes her even more
        pugnacious

                                pris
                  i want to know whats going on 

                                batty
                  theres only two of us left

        pris is shocked her whisper comes out a hiss

                                pris
                  then were stupid and well die

                                batty
                  not if everybody is doing their job
                  here at home  how are things at home 

        pris doesnt answer as they hear sebastian coming out of
        the kitchen

                                pris
                  what if he wont cooperate 

                                batty
                  mr sebastian is a host who wants to
                  be appreciated well appreciate him
                  and hell cooperate

        sebastian walks into the room with a tray  he takes some
        eggs and puts them into a glass flask full of bubbling
        water that is standing on a retort stand over a bunsen
        burner on his work bench
        he notices the move on the chess set

                                sebastian
                  no  the knight takes the queen see 
                  it wont do

        he takes the white queen with the black knight

        batty smiles a smile totally without feeling or interest

        sebastian stares at batty for a long moment then at pris

                                batty
                  why are you staring at us 

                                sebastian
                  youre just so so different

        batty nods his head smiling sending home the fact and
        sebastian is certainly getting it

                                batty
                  what sebastian 

        a long pause

                                pris
                  what makes you think so sebastian

                                sebastian

        sebastian is grinning from ear to ear

                                batty

        sebastian whistles

        to the couch batty couldnt be more pleased

                                sebastian

                  but we dont want to die quite yet

                                sebastian

        his voice is trembling

        without a moments hesitation pris walks over to the
        flask sticks her hands into the boiling water and pulls
        out one of the eggs and hands it to sebastian

        sebastian is riveted his eyes wide and astounded like
        hes just seen the devil he laughs nervously glad that
        the devil is a friend   then drops the egg which is
        suddenly burning his hand

        pris gives sebastian a big kiss


        int hospital day

        a horrid image  tight on holden very tight  his eyes
        are bulging almost out of his head  tears streaming
        down his face spittle spraying from his mouth as he
        wheezes and grimace in horrid convulsions haw haw haw
        were going to figure out that hes laughing but only
        after a moment after we pull back wide enough to see
        hes still engulfed in the breather and necklaced with
        blinking lights one of which blinks particularly
        violently with every wheeze

                                holden

                  about the big guy leon

        holdens eyes change mood immediately at the thought
        of leon but the laughter has to continue like a wind
        up toy running down  finally he can talk again

        deckard is smug sure of himself  he knows the score
        as he pontificates we cut and suddenly we are seeing
        him on a tv screen

                                                   cut to


        int bryants office  day

        a tv monitor fills the screen  holden is continuing to
        lecture deckard on the tv screen

                  out at night

        now we see bryant  hes sitting in a chair chewing a
        big cigar and glaring at the screen

                                bryant
                  its pitiful is what it is  a
                  couple of old blade runners trying

                  hands

        bryant interrupts the display unimpressed

                                bryant

        tyrell looks alarmed

        batty is standing in the shadows

        tyrell is reaching for a tasseled bell pull that hangs
        over his bed

        battys eyes are like little coals glowing

        warned by the look tyrell abandons the bell pull and
        reaches under the sheets for something

                                batty
                  to act without understanding
                  could lead to the very thing
                  the act seeks to avoid

        whats in battys eyes completes the warning

        tyrell decides to heed it  if hes scared though he
        does a good job of concealing it

                                tyrell
                  im surprised you didnt come
                  here sooner

                  its not an easy thing to meet

                  and what can he do for you

        batty sits on the end of tyrells bed

                                batty
                  can the maker repair what he makes

                                tyrell
                  would you like to be modified

                                batty
                  had mind something a little more
                  radical

        batty leans close across the sheets and cuts in in an
        urgent whisper

                                batty
                  i want more life fucker

        sebastain looks alarmed

        tyrell faces batty with admirable cool  after a tense
        pause the old man slides away from batty and out of
        bed  hes wearing a long night shirt and he looks a
        little silly  he looks down at batty whos still sit
        ting on the bed and addresses him as a professor add
        resses a pupil

                                tyrell
                  the facts of life  ill be blunt
                  to make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system at least by men makers
                  or not is fatal  a coding
                  sequence cant be revised once
                  its established

                                batty
                  why

                                tyrell
                  because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation
                  give rise to revertant colonies 
                  like rats leaving a sinking ship
                  the ship sinks

                                batty
                  what about ems recombination

                                tyrell
                  weve already tried it  ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen  it
                  created a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table

        tyrell doesnt notice the subtle flicker of suspicion
        on battys face likemaybebattys not buying all
        this

                                batty
                  then a repressor protein that
                  blocks the operating cells

                                tyrell
                  wouldnt obstruct replication
                  but it does give rise to an error
                  in replication so that the newly
                  formed dna strand carries a
                  mutation and youve got a virus
                  again but all this is academic
                  you are made as well as we could
                  make you

                                batty
                  but not to last

        battys expression doesnt reveal whether tyrell has
        allayed his suspicions as tyrell approaches batty
        sitting on the edge of the bed and puts a fatherly
        hand on battys shoulder

        batty looks down in a sudden uncharacteristically
        humble posture and speaks with guilt in his voice

        after all roy batty that swell replicant is about
        to embrace him  everythings gonna be okay after all
        batty gets up from the bed and puts his hands around
        tyrells face

        crack  tyrells skull cracks like dry wood

        sebastian stares in horror

        squish   batty squashes the head in a gruesome moment

        tyrell slumps to the floor like empty clothes

        batty looks at the remains with disgust

        no answer his voice echoes in the emptiness

        deckard walks across the dark lobby stepping around the

        deckard is at the foot of the gloomy stairwell looking
        up he can hear faint noises very eerie

        cautiously he begins to climb blaster ready

        the noises continue

        footsteps


        int stairwell  night

        deckard is several flights up now listening to the eerie
        noises

        he starts up stumbles on a piece of masonry

        the masonry clatters noisily down the stairwell

        deckard freezes blaster ready

        pris is alert listening to the clattering echo die
        she frowns  is it batty


        int stairwell  night

        deckard cautiously starts to climb again tiptoeing
        blaster ready


        int sebastians apartment  night

        a shadowy hallway cluttered with debris spooky

        nothing moves

        then we catch the sight of something deckard   he enters
        the hallway pressed flat against a wall  weapon up

        very carefully he slides along the wall

        we can see a doorway ahead of him the door to sebastians
        apartment

        he moves to the door its open a crack he peeks in

        the apartment seems empty


        int sebastians apartment  night

        deckard inches the door open blaster ready  he looks
        around warily studying the apartment  he sees nothing
        moving

        he levels his blaster arm extended full out copstyle
        as he ventures deeper into the apartment

        suddenly a noise behind him makes him spin blaster pointed

        a mouse runs across the floor

        deep breath

        whump  pris drops on deckard from above and wraps her
        bare thighs around his neck as she takes him down

        deckard finds himself choking ot death in bare thighs
        as she applies a brutal scissors grip with her legs
        all he can do is bite at the flesh near her crotch as
        he fights for air and life

        pris might look like a punk waif but shes a powerful
        replicant and deckard is
        falls from his hand as he writhes and
        his body

        finally he gets his head loose and gasps for air but
        she is immediately sitting on his chest and he looks up
        into her furious face and flailing fists

        deckard grabs at her trying to fight her off tears
        her tank top loose exposing one breast but a lot of
        good that does him

        pris starts to choke deckard with one hand and deckards
        only hope is to grasp blindly for his blaster on the floor

        his hand paws wildly he cant look in the general
        area and when he feels it he grabs it  he struggles
        to point it at her

                                deckard
                  please  i dont want

        she catches his gun wrist and he fires a shot widly

        bow  masonry erupts on the ceiling

        dekcard struggles to point the weapon but she has his
        wrist in her replicant grip

                                deckard
                  please  i dontwantto kill you

        fat chance  it doesnt look like he could if he wanted
        to  shes choking him with one hand squeezing the
        weapon loose with the other

        deckard fighting for breath and life gives a violent
        wrench and manages to bring the weapon to bear just
        long enough to squeeze off one shot

        bow  priss left arm is torn away at the shoulder

        priss face erupts in fury as she clutches at the
        empty socket

        deckard rolls free and tries to cover her

                                deckard
                  please  i

        whap  she kicks him in the chest and he flies back
        into a wall

        shes advancing on him kicking like some martial arts
        master whap whap whap

        deckard has to shoot or be kicked to death hes already
        badly battered by her furious feet

        bow  bow  pris is blown away
        hits

        bow  the third hit catches her in the back of the neck
        as she spins away from deckard and thats it she
        goes down in a limp heap leaving deckard standing there
        bloody and stupified

        hes still staring when he hears it the drone of the
        elevator ascending

        deckard frowns  he starts toward the door reaching in his
        pocket as he goes and pulling out a cassette


        int corridor  night

        deckard slams the cassette into his blaster as he steps
        intop the corridor and looks toward the sound

        he sees the elevator coming up glowing

        deckard doesnt like this  he glances quickly as the
        various possible routes for escpe

        not the stairs

        nothing else

        the lift is almost to sebastians floor

        deckard retreats hastily into sebastians apartment

        int sebastians apartment  night

        deckard steps into the room with pris body in it

        he hears the elevator stop  then footsteps

        deckard considers

        the footsteps are getting closer

        deckard walks silently toward the other door leading into the
        next room and steps through it

        the footsteps keep coming

        and the breathing has started asthmatic rasping

                                                   cut to


        int billiard room  night

        deckard slides around the door and puts his back to the wall
        blaster ready

        deckard comes running into the lobby hand heldthrough
        the billiard room and into the darkened area the other
        side of the billiard room and stands breathing heavily
        gun aimed towards the lobby


        int lobby  night 

        battys shadow appears in the doorway deckards pov he
        stares at pris dead body

        his body walks into the shadow

        deckard fires but batty is faster he ducks back and
        disappears

        deckards bullet smashes into the dresser in the bedroom
        the mirror explodes

        deckard runs into the billiard room


        int billiard room  night

        he ducks back behind the wall

        suddenly a hand comes tearing through the wall and pulls
        deckards hand through

        systematically batty breaks two of deckards fingers

                                batty
                  for pris for zhora
                  proud of yourself little man

        as deckard screams batty puts the gun back in deckards
        broken hand and pushes it back through the hole

        battys head peers through the hole and deckards fires at
        him grazing the side of his face and blowing off his ear

        deckard starts running hand held through the rooms
        looking for an escape

                                battyos
                  not very sporting to fire on
                  an unarmed opponent i thought

                  arent you the man

        batty in semi darkness is
        streaming down in his from his wounds  he starts to daub
        his face with his own blood like a commanche warrior
        then he starts to strip down  a tribal ritual


        int darkened room redressed lobby armoire  night

        deckard runs into the darkened room rats scuttle across
        the floor

        he hears footsteps coming  there are no other exits

        he looks at the armoire  his only escape

        he runs to a table and with great pain bends his fingers back
        then runs to the armoire and starts to climb it

        batty walks into the room looks up at deckard and starts
        to laugh

                                batty
                  where are you going 

        deckard continues towards the ceiling the armoire
        starts to tilt water drips on his head

        thunder and lightning erupt


        int floor b  toilet  night

        deckards head pops up through the floor next to an
        overflowing toilet

        all of a sudden he too starts to laugh as he lays down
        on the floor his laughter becoming hysterical

        he looks around for some tape and starts to wrap his broken
        fingers

        suddenly with a resounding crash battys head comes through
        the marble above the basin

        deckard gets up and makes a run for the door at the end of
        the room as batty animal like starts slurping the water
        out of the basin

        deckard pulls and tugs at the door frantic with fear

        the other door opens and batty walks in as deckard manages
        to open his door


        int closet  night

        two hundred objects pigeons burst out of the room into
        deckards face as he runs into the closed off room

        there is no way out except by the
        proceeds to tear down

                                batty
                  now where are you going

        deckard climbs out the window as batty watches


        ext roof  window ledge  night

        deckard slowly eases himself around the window ledge
        and edges his way around to a cornice

        batty appears at another window as deckard scrambles
        up the cornice and on to the roof wind and rain hindering
        his climb


        ext roof  night

        wind and rain deckard dashes onto the roof and looks
        frantically over his shoulder batty isnt in sight yet
        he looks around desperately the roof is a desert no
        shelter deckard looks across at the next building

        suddenly a rooftop door opens and batty steps out

        deckard looks back at the next building is it possible 
        a long jump but what choice

        decision time  deckard decides to go  he runs directly
        towards batty turns pumping like crazy going for the gap

        looking up from way below two buildings loom into the
        dark with a gap between them and a tiny figure running
        like hell and jumping

        deckard leaps across the gap flies through the air
        almost makes it catches a cornice on the second
        building hangs many stories up over the street and we

        ext the second roof  night

        deckard hangs onto the cornice in the wind and rain
        one hand is almost useless the others strained to
        the limit  he looks down  a long long fall to the
        ground

        deckard looks behind him over his shoulder

        he can see batty twenty feet away on the edge of the
        first roof watching him

        deckard is almost sobbing holding on with everything
        hes got as we

        batty stands there watching deckard hang

        batty grins

        then one of his hands cramps badly  he has to work the
        fingers open with effort

        he looks at deckard again

        batty walks back five yards sprints quickly and
        leaps as we

        ext second roof  night

        deckard is hanging there as batty lands not far from
        deckards desperate hands

        batty looks down at deckard

        batty grins and takes a seat only a couple of feet
        from deckard

        deckards bad hand lets go  hes hanging by one hand

        the street looms way below

        deckard looks desperately into battys cold eyes

        batty grins and shakes his head at the absurdity of it

        deckard looks into that awful smile and sees no hope
        there

        batty glances down at his own hand  spasms again

        deckards hand is going  he knows its over now he
        bites the bullet of his anger  he glares at batty as
        his grip gives way

                                deckard
                  asshole

        batty meets deckards angry eyes

        deckards hand continues to slip

        batty is still looking at deckards rage  it moves the
        warrior in himyou can seebatty change his opinion

        too late  deckards hand goes

        battys hand is like lightning  he catches deckards
        hand and holds deckard

        deckard is suspended above the awesome drop not sure
        why hes not falling  he opens his tightly closed eyes
        and looks up

        he looks up into the stern warrior face of batty the
        cold eyes

        deckard hangs there and for a moment he has to consider
        whether this is the continuation of a cruel game

        the batty is hauling him up onehanded and with that
        scary strength he has

        deckard is pulled onto the roof where he lies on his
        stomach gasping for breath not moving just feeling
        something solid under him

        batty looks at the man gasping next to him with the
        cold eyes of a man looking at a fish  it is as though
        deckard is some species far below batty on the evolu
        tionary scale

        battys hand cramps again

        batty looks at it almost with curiosity

                                                   jump cut to


        ext the second roof later

        deckard is looking at batty

        batty is partly crumpled frozen in an unnatural posi
        tion as though he had been writhing and stopped mid
        writhe  he looks back at deckard with eyes full of
        life and intensity

        they stare at each other for a long time in silence
        communicating something with their eyes without
        expression  finally batty breaks the silence

                                batty
                  ive seen things
                         long pause

                  watched cbeams glitter in the dark
                  near the tanhauser gate
                         pause
                  all those moments theyll be gone

        batty holds deckards eyes like a hypnotist

        batty is crumpled in a different position  its light
        er now and battys eyes are staring into infinity
        almost lifelessly  a pigeon flutters down and perches
        on his shoulder  batty doesnt stir

        deckard is watching motionless

        the pigeon flies off

        batty doesnt move  alive or dead

        looking down at the dead body of batty

                  fought it all the way  he never
                  whimpered and he never quit  he
                  took all the time he had as
                  though he loved life very much
                  every second of it even the
                  pain  then he was dead


        ext roof  dawn

        the city is down there  endless and gray in the first
        light

        deckards at the edge of the roof

        maybe someday hell be better  but right now he hasnt
        even got the energy to be sick

        the mexicans voice doesnt surprise him it comes through
        the silence like the rasping of ravens wings

                                gaff
                  how do you rate yourself now deckard 

        he is standing 20 feet away on the edge of the roof like
        a captain looking at the sea  smarts as a roosterhe places
        a foot on the buttress

                                gaff
                  you put on quite a show  no doubt
                  about it

        with a flourish he brings a dirty rag out of his pocket and
        starts polishing the pointed tip of his long black shoe

                                gaff
                  you think im a wimp  dont you

        he waits for the answer  but deckard doesnt bother

        gaff moistens the rag with his tongue and applies it to
        the toe

                                gaff
                  i could kill you right now 
                  so you better say something

        deckard is unarmed gaffs got all the aces seems to be
        bristling with concealed weapons  deckards eyes level on
        him  his voice comes out low and raw

                                deckard
                  yeah i think youre a wimp

        gaff nods like he knew it all along  it seems to please
        him

                                gaff
                  i admire you more and more

        deckard exhales fatigue  his eyes close the bullshit
        is endless  gaff smiles like a beaver puts the rag back
        in his pocket

                                gaff
                  i guess youre through huh

        deckard doesnt answer

                                gaff
                  washed up wiped out   finished

        he cocks his head like a bluejay waiting for the answer

                                gaff
                  what about it

                                deckard
                  yeah im through

        somewhere far away a whistle blows then silence deckard
        turns  he is moving away  his back to the mexican gaffs
        voice follows him taunting

                                gaff
                  you did
                  sure you are man

        he snickers his hand comes out of his pocket with a gun

                                gaff
                  its hard to be sure whos who around
                  here

        deckard keeps walking

                                gaff
                  carnall

        deckard slowly turns

        gaff shows him the gun but it doesnt make any difference

                                gaff
                  oye la agua

        deckard stares he doesnt know the words

        ever the dandy gaff swaggers closer stops

                                gaff
                  here

        he throws the gun across the gap to deckard

        deckard doesnt try to catch it it lands at his feet

        gaff dismisses the rejection with a suck on his teeth

                                gaff
                  i wouldnt wait too long i wouldnt
                  fool around id get my little panocha
                  and get the hell outta here

        they just stare at each other gaff smiles

                                gaff
                  its too bad she dont last eh

        the smile is real and a little sad

                                gaff
                  but who does

        everybody knows the answer to that one

        the mexican shrugs

        the light is brighter

        the gun gleams on the wet

        deckard turns and walks

        int deckards corridor  day

        deckards feet click along the corridor as he
        approaches his door

        near the door on the floor is a little tinfoil uni
        corn the kind of sculpture gaff has been crafting on
        previous occasions

        deckard comes to the door unlocks it opens it

        he doesnt see the piece of sculpture on the floor

        int deckards living room  day

        the room is dark and quiet as deckard enters  you can
        hear the sound of a baby crying somewhere

        deckard frowns looks around

        the clock ticks  the baby cries  nothing moves

                                deckard
                  rachael

        int bedroom  day

        the bedroom is dark

        deckard opens the door

        he sees something on the bed  motionless  a body

        deckard enters

        the clock ticks  the baby squalls in the distance

        deckard goes close

        rachael is on the bed  completely motionless

        deckard leans over her very close to see if shes
        breathing

        a long moment

        then the tension goes out of him  shes alive  he
        turns away from her with a new urgency

        he pulls the blaster from his holster and goes to the
        dresser  he opens a drawer and pulls out a box of
        ammo  opens it

        kachuk  he slams a cartridge in the gun

        kachuk  another

        on the bed rachael stirs opens her eyes  kachuk

        she sees an ominous sight  deckard is loading his gun
        in the shadows near the dresser his back to her

        kachuk  he slams the last cartridge in

                                deckard
                  do you love me

        he is looking at her in the mirror on the dresser  he
        has the gun in his hand

        she is looking at his back

                                rachael
                  i love you

        deckard holsters the gun without turning and pulls
        open another drawer

                                deckard
                  do you trust me

        deckard is pulling clothes out of the drawer stuff
        ing them hastily into a parachute bag

                                rachael
                  i trust you

        deckard turns and looks at her one hand full of
        clothes the other hand holding the parachute bag

        the door opens and deckard and rachael step out  they
        are carrying a couple of overnight cases

        rachael starts toward the elevator

        deckard locks the door and turns to follow her

        he spots something on the floor something small

        he reaches down and picks it up

        its the tiny unicorn made of tinfoil gaffs
        gauntlet

        deckard looks at it for a moment

        ext moving trees  day

        birch trees whip past at 160 miles per hour urged on
        by big nasty music

        we have the feeling we are going to see a unicorn

        instead we see deckards car rocketing through the
        woods

        deckard glances back at the road then at the vid
        screen

        a little blip flashes on the screen

        deckard notices it his eyes narrow just a little  he
        reaches in his pocket pulls out the unicorn

        deckard puts the tinfoil unicorn on the dash

        a flicker of a smile crosses his face

        ext woods  day

        deckards car bullets through the woods in a fury of
        speed and music

        we back off it and up past whizzing branches over
        the treetops losing the car as we soar over what is
        suddenly a vast forest spreading to infinity

        enormous music

        deckards voice over

                                deckard vo
                  i knew it on the roof that night
                  we were brothers roy batty and i
                  combat models of the highest order
                  we had fought in wars not yet
                  dreamed of in vast nightmares
                  still unnamed  we were the new
                  people roy and me and rachael
                  we were made for this world  it
                  was ours

        trees explode past us in a rage of branches as we dip
        and swerve and thats when the spinner looms into view
        zooming right at us then tilting and yawing off in
        hot pursuit with gaff at the controls

        credits are rolling god help us all
