as they dance in the light

pan down now to the green grass traveling along the grass 

the music becomes fainter as we move suddenly under the grass now as 
if in a dark forest 

slowly moving through 

the grass is like great timbers

it is getting darker and ominous sounds come up as we discover black 
insects crawling and scratching in the darkness

moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth jutting out his chin 
in the process  hes thinking about who knows what

clouds of dust as he walks  he has some time to think about things he 
sees a green bottle in the distance he gathers up a few more rocks and 
pitches them one by one at the bottle  he misses

he looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some
tall grass and weeds he sees something strange

he looks closer  it is a human ear covered with crawling ants

jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around  all he sees are houses 
 some laundry drying  a very peaceful scene  no one seems to be around 
no one seems to be watching him

he looks again at the ear

we are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it
there is dried blood on part of it

jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig he pushes the ear onto 
it  again he stands up and looks around

in the distance a man goes into the back door of a house  nothing more

jeffery hurries off carrying the bag with the ear in it

white bread and a coke have just arrived along with sandys coke

					sandy
			alright now tell me what is it

					jeffrey
			there are opportunities in life for gaining
			knowledge and experience sometimes in
			some cases its necessary to take a risk
			i got to thinking ill bet a person could
			learn a lot by getting into that womans 
			apartment you know sneak in and hide
			and observe

					sandy
			you said it was a strange world 
			and youre the strangest part of it are 
			you crazyshe is possibly involved in 
			murder this gives me the creeps

					jeffrey
			settle down i have a plan which i think
			will work there is very little for you
			to do but i do need your help
			arent you curious about my plan

					sandy
			  thinking and intrigued plus she 
  			   is beginning to like jeffrey
			it wouldnt hurt to hear the plan i guess

					jeffrey
				  getting excited
			alright the first thing is to get into her
			apartment and open a window that i could 
			crawl into later

					sandy
			now how are you going to do that

					jeffrey
			right out in the car i happen to have some
			old overalls and a bug spraying rig i will
			go to her apartment and be the pest control
			man i will spray her apartment after a 
			few minutes you will knock on her door 
			drawing her attention away from me and i 
			will then jimmy a window

					sandy
			what will i say when she comes to the door

					jeffrey
			you will be a jehovahs witness i have a 
			few awake magazines for you you dont 
			have to keep her very long a few seconds 
			is all ill need whatiya think

					sandy
			i dont know it sounds like a good 
			daydream  but actually doing it is too
			weird too dangerous

					jeffrey
			lets just try the first part if that
			goes well well see about the rest no one
			will suspect us because no one would 
			believe two people like us would be crazy
			enough to do something like this

					sandy

someone comes out of an apartment just as jeffrey gets to the seventh floor

he goes up another flight of stairs to the eighth floor and waits until 
the man goes downstairs

jeffrey then goes back to the seventh floor and goes to door 710  
he takes out the key and looks around no one  he inserts the key  
it fits  he turns it  the door opens

82 int dorothys apartment  night

he quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door  it takes a 
moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness  soon he finds his way 
around  he decides on the closet to hide in  however before he goes in 
to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the 
darkness  he goes down the hallway to the back bedroom  

across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty 
childs room  in the childs room he sees a small pointed hat with a 
propeller on top  the kind that plays music when the propeller turns  
the hat is sitting silently on the bed post  he quietly closes the door  
he returns to the closet  once inside he checks out how much he can see 
through the slats he has a view of half the apartment  this is where he 
will stay  he moves around some to relax  he takes several deep breaths 
he looks at his watch  it says 1017

83 int beaumonts carlincoln street  night

sandy sits in the car carefully watching the apartment building and 
street

84 int dorothys apartment  night

in the closet jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to 
stretch his muscles which are getting tired  again he takes several 
deep breaths  he looks at his watch  it says 1245

					jeffrey
				    to himself
			oh no hurry up dorothy come on and i
			gotta pee great its now or never

unable to hear the warning horn jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom 
as the tank is still filling

suddenly he hears something a key going in the door  he bolts toward 
the closet  he flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front 
door opens

just as suddenly the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off  
silence except for dorothy vallens at the front door

the front door shuts and the living room lights go on  jeffrey can see 
dorothy come toward him  she walks right up almost to his face when 
the phone rings

she turns immediately and goes to answer it  jeffrey almost passes out 
he thought hed had it  he overhears


					dorothy

					dorothy
				    to herself
			frank you son of a bitch

she goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail  she nervously 
gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides 
the photograph under a pillow on the couch  she puts on a record for 
your precious love  she sits back down and chews her nail again 
listening to the music she starts to cry  she stops herself and takes 
the record off  she starts taking off her stocking  she then takes off 
her dress

underneath she has on a bra and panties  she crosses the living room 
goes down the hallway into the bathroom

jeffrey cant see her too well now  she takes off her panties in the

we hear her start a shower

he quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can

she opens the door reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe  she doesnt 
see jeffrey even though he isnt well hidden  she closes the door  it 
clicks shut

jeffrey is in almost total darkness  he listens  he can hear walking 
around then silence  he hears the kitchen sink water running

he hears her walking again  now he can see her  she sits down on her 
bed  she looks up  just as jeffrey shifts his weight  she looks at the
closet strangely but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it  
she slowly gets up

jeffrey doesnt know what is up  he looks but she walks out of view

suddenly he hears a drawer open and just as suddenly the closet door 
flies open and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him  when 
she realizes that someone is really there she screams once very loud

adjusts her robe

dorothy slowly spreads her legs  she can see jeffrey staring out of the 
darkness of the closet at her

					frank
			wider

she opens her legs wider  frank looks at her crotch and drinks his 
bourbon  he stares at the floor for a moment then slowly looks back at 
dorothy her body  her crotch

dorothy looks up at the ceiling waiting  frank suddenly reaches to his 
belt where he has a small canister and a mask  he opens a valve on the 
canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth  the canister is 
filled with helium which makes franks voice very high and strange 
sounding  the result is frightening

					frank
				   high voice
			 mommy

dorothy jumps  she keeps looking at the ceiling

					frank
			   continuing with high voice
			 mommy

					dorothy
				    frightened
			 mommys here

					frank
				  high voice
			baby wants to fuck

then franks voice goes to normal

					frank
			normal voice but loud  like
    			 an army order to himself
			get ready to fuck

frank goes to dorothy and kneels down in front of her  he takes one more 
gasp of helium

					frank
				   high voice
			baby wants blue velvet

dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to frank

					dorothy
				   whispering
			okay

frank slowly moves

frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the 
texture of the velvet  his hands rub the velvet and feel dorothys body 
underneath  his hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the 
velvet robe

dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear  
then frank in a sort of sickening way pulls dorothy down to rug  he 
warns her

					frank
			dont look at me

he begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth  then he pushes her 
arms back and she keeps them back letting frank have his way  frank 
sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth while he pinches and 
feels her breasts in a strange compulsive timidly sickening way  
dorothy is moaning  frank is breathing very heavily he feels her crotch

					frank
			dont look at me
			     heavy breathing
			daddys home

he starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of dorothy
he starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him  faster 
and faster then he has a climax in his pants  dorothys head is falling 
back  she can see jeffrey blurred in the distance  in the closet  
cautiously she looks sideways at frank

					frank
				    screaming
			dont look at me

he slugs her in the face  his nose is running and hes stifling sobs from 
deep within him  on his hands and knees he moves away  the robe pulls 
out of his mouth  his breathing is even heavier now  he stands and 
begins to move around the apartment  he goes to a wall turns off the 
lights then turns and walks into the bathroom all the while breathing 
big heavy breaths trying to stop the crying  dorothy moans softly

it gets very quiet and still for a moment  then jeffrey hears frank 
with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom  the high 
strange sound reverberates in the distance  jeffrey cant make it out  
soon he hears franks high laughing  frank comes back into the living 
room  the mask is around his face  all his breathing  every sound is 
high  he laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door

					frank
			stay alive baby see you next christmas

frank leaves and shuts the door  the apartment is silent except for 
dorothys moans  

jeffrey is stunned  he doesnt move  he watches dorothy in the 
halflight  she rolls over and starts crying  the crying is deep and 
genuine

slowly jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her  he bends down 
and touches her  she flinches and turns to see him  she turns back 
sobbing  he tries to get her up

					jeffrey
			why dont you come lie down come on ill
			help you

she struggles up with jeffreys help and he takes her over to the bed  
she falls down on her side turned toward the wall  he covers her with 
the sheet

					dorothy
			dont
			    referring to the sheet
			i dont like that what do you want

					jeffrey
			nothing are you alright

					dorothy

them around

					dorothy

					dorothy
			don hold me im scared hold me

jeffrey turns to her  he studies her  he reaches out and takes her 
shoulders  he moves down and holds her

					dorothy
				    whispering

					jeffrey
				    whispering
			its okay its okay

they lie together for a long silent moment

jeffrey cant help himself  he licks and sucks her nipples and feels her 
breasts  they both are getting very hot

					dorothy
			feel me

jeffrey is all over her now  dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him

					dorothy
			you can hit me if you want to

					jeffrey

dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the 
wall

she moves and wont let him feel her anymore  she holds his hands away

					dorothy
				    whispering

					jeffrey
				    whispering

					dorothy
				    whispering

			put that in me

they start making love  suddenly dorothy starts crying

					jeffrey
			whats the matter

suddenly dorothy slaps jeffrey in the face very hard

					dorothy
			get off me

jeffrey gets off her pressing his hand to his face  dorothy goes into 
the bathroom crying all the way  jeffrey sits confused

suddenly jeffrey hears a horrible scream from dorothy  a true scream of 
horror  he rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong

92 int dorothys bathroom  night

she is just flushing something down the toilet  the water sound rushes  
he turns to her  she is trembling and in a state of shock

					dorothy
			i made it go down the toilet

					jeffrey
			what

he looks in the swirling water it looks like an ear revolving around and 
around then whatever it is disappears

					dorothy
			i made it go down the toilet

jeffrey looks up he sees written with a bar of soap the words look down 
on the mirror

he looks down into the sink  at the bottom he sees a small clot of blood 
and a smear of fresher blood

jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally franks high helium voice reverberating
in the bathroom

door suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the

96 int dorothys apartment  night

sees the empty bourbon glass of franks  suddenly he remembers the 
photograph that dorothy hid  he picks up the pillow and sees a picture 
of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed 
hat with a propeller he turns the photo over and finds an old marriage 
license  it reads dorothy vallens to don

					jeffrey vo

smoky inside  he has trouble seeing but suddenly he spots frank sitting 
with some other guys watching dorothy sing  they are sitting two tables 
away

frank is totally captivated by dorothys singing and is very serious
looking  he looks right up to her eyes  in his hand he works a small 
piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers  again her first number 
blue moon segues into blue velvet  this song she sings mainly to 
frank  when it is over frank continues watching dorothy and everyone else 
applauds loudly

he waits at a light right behind them  inside they are lighting 
cigarettes  the light turns green and frank takes off  jeffrey follows 
them through a dark area down by the docks  he follows them up a narrow 
street through dark factories

lights and engine  he watches frank and his friends enter an old apartment
building next to a bookbinding factory  they disappear within  the 
electric lines above buzz loudly

jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street  he reaches 
franks car which is making popping and clicking noises as it cools down  
he looks at the license plates  walks a few paces ahead and then writes it
down in his notebook  he continues on to the apartment building

109 	int lobby  franks building  night

the storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full 
moon  the wind continues to moan  they move to the roof top and dorothy 
leads jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building  a very 
sad forlorn version of somewhere over the rainbow  creeps through the 
wind

					dorothy

					dorothy
			continuing to look down her
    			 eyes widening  she whispers

        			 again and again

she reaches up and clutches jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish

fade to white

fade down to

121 ext lincoln street  night

jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into 
darkness  he continues down the sidewalk  he looks up at the starry sky
the stars are so far away  the feeling is cold and lonely

									dissolve to

121a 

darkness there are bell tones sounding and as each one sounds pin points
of light appear on mr beaumonts distorted dream face  he is trying to 
speak  hes trying to say jeffrey

121b 

another dark image appears  a robin sits in a tree at night  very close
there is a slow low reverberating chirping sound

121c

now dorothys apartment building at night  a very low angle looking up 
to the roof  suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from 
the roof  it flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is 
a red highheeled shoe  as it fills the screen it becomes red lips of 
dorothys which open into a scream

121d

jeffrey wakes in his room  terrified

122 int beaumonts living room  night

jeffrey leaves and aunt barbara moves about tapping on the walls  she 
moves into a dark area and taps  something falls  she reaches down

in extreme closeup we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick 
carpet  then in extreme closeup we see aunt barbaras fingers pinch the 
termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look  she 
looks at the termite then looks back at the walls

we glide along the dark walls of the house

									cut to

he arrives at the seventh floor and stops  a highpitched whine can be 
heard faintly  it gets louder as jeffrey crosses to dorothys apartment 
door  he gets his key out and inserts it  turns it  with a loud click 
the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing  he sees 
something and jumps back

211 int dorothys apartment  night

it is detective gordon the yellow man standing in the center of the room

flashback

he plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again

closer on detective gordon

something is wrong with him  he is bleeding from the head  he stands 
almost motionless in shock

jeffrey peers into the room again  he enters carefully and lets the door 
close behind him  he very cautiously moves forward into the room  slowly
he moves closer to a hideous sight  standing in the middle of dorothys 
apartment is tr gordon the yellow man  he is in an extreme state of 
shock  he is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head  his eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see  sitting in one of dorothys chairs is a dead man with no ears only halfhealed bloody wounds at each side of his head  a bullet hole in the center of his forehead  the tv is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine  jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall  the high whine stops instantly  silence except for the yellow mans labored breathing

suddenly there is a loud radio voice coming from the yellow mans police
radio which is turned on in his jacket pocket  jeffreys heart leaps 
and just as suddenly the yellow man throws his arms out wildly knocking a 
floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light  jeffreys heart goes
wild at this sight and he jumps back but the yellow man is silent and 
motionless again  the radio talks again

					radio voice 1
			get back and stay down

					radio voice 2
			 its apartment eight

music love letters straight from my heart begins to play  
jeffrey watches the yellow man and listens to the radio

enters  jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet  frank 
is smiling

					frank
			 calling pleasantly in the direction 
  of the back bedroom

he starts down the hall to the back bedroom  the police radio which 
jeffrey planted under the bed and franks radio both start broadcasting 
frank turns his radio off  now only the one under the bed plays

					frank
			hey fuck i can hear you radio hey

			second to live

jeffrey watches frank reach inside his coat for his gun  he watches frank
sneak to the back bedroom area  jeffrey turns and looks at the yellow 
man  he gets an idea he quickly rushes out of the closet  feels inside 
the yellow mans coat for his police gun  its there  he gets it but it 
causes the yellow man to moan and leap some in another almost deathspasm  jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath  just then he hears frank in the back room

					frank vo
			           helium voice
			hey pretty pretty

jeffrey then hears three or four shots  deadly sounding coming from a 
pistol with a silencer attached

					frank vo
			hey fuck where are you

jeffrey sees a furious frank come storming out of the back room and come 
slowly up the hall  directly toward him

jeffrey raises his pistol  very slowly  frank enters the living room  
he looks around  the yellow man moans  frank makes a face and blasts the 
remainder of the yellow mans head away and this time the yellow man falls
dead to the floor  jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air  frank looks to the kitchen all around the living room  he looks at the closet  he smiles  he slowly goes right toward jeffrey  smiling  jeffrey points the pistol  his finger moves to the trigger  he squints his eyes  he doesnt want to kill a man any man  frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open when jeffrey hears sandy scream

225 ext beaumonts back yard  day

a huge low roaring sound comes in

slowly we come up out of a huge dark hole we see we are rising out of an 
ear but still among the crevices  they look enormous  we move up and 
float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye  jeffreys eye 
his face is bathed in light

williams is with mr beaumont working in the garden in the distance  
the sprinkler is turning  sandy comes out on the back porch and calls

sandy

			okay ill be right in

sandy goes back inside  suddenly a big red robin chirps loudly above  
jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree  the robin and jeffrey 
seems to exchange a special look

jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird

he gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of 
the house  as he passes his father and detective williams

dancing slowly toward dorothy  she is laughing  when the boy gets within
arms reach they embrace  we move close to dorothys smiling face  tears
of happiness come into her eyes but there is still a distant look as we 
hear bobby vinton sing the last lines of his song

and i still can see blue velvet through
 my tears
