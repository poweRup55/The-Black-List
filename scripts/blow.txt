				prosecutor
		let the record state the witness has

	the following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage
	style

				prosecutor contd
		mr jung can you describe the
		circumstances of how you began talking
		about cocaine with mr delgado

				george
		shortly after i arrived at danbury
		federal correctional institute i related
		to diego that the crime i was in for was
		smuggling marijuana
		diego told me he had high level
		connections in colombia and they needed
		to find someone to help them transport
		cocaine into america

				george contd
		the first run was fifteen kilos which
		we smuggled into logan airport in hard
		shelled suitcases

				george contd
		we wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
		cabinet paper and duct tape that way
		if there were any dogs in customs

				george contd
		i introduced diego to a pilot named jack
		stevens who helped us fly 300 kilos of
		cocaine per week into the united states
		via twinengine cessnas  jack would fly
		into north carolina wed meet him there
		and drive it down to different
		distribution points

				george contd
		i never met pablo escobar  diego
		delgado was my only connection to
		cocaine from colombia

				george contd
		diego convinced me to keep most of my
		money in a panamanian bank  diego had a
		close relationship with manuel noriega
		in exchange for allowing us to keep our
		money there we paid him a percentage

				george contd
		there was an 85 chance that if you
		snorted cocaine between 19771984 it
		was ours initially with my la
		connections we invented the
		marketplace  in 1977 there was no
		other real competition

				george contd
		the first year we made about 100 million
		dollars between us  it was an expensive
		operation  eventually we built up to
		three different pilots doing multiple
		runs per week connections on both
		coasts everything was running smooth
		we were like a corporation

				george contd
		he was very antigovernment  he talked
		about revolution forming his own
		country or island he was looking for
		power as well as money  i was just
		looking for money

				george contd
		he disliked the united states thought
		it was a police state  he hoped that by
		flooding the country with cocaine it
		would disrupt the political system and
		tear down the morality of the country

				george contd
		well yes derek foreal was my
		connection i met him back in 1968 when
		i first moved to manhattan beach  it
		was foreals marijuana connections that
		kicked off our cocaine market

				george contd
		yes it was my idea to bring the kilos
		to los angeles  when diego finally got
		derek foreals name from me it was only
		a matter of months before hed cut me
		out

				george contd
		im not sure how my relationship with my
		daughter and exwife have anything to do
		with this trial  i mean were here to
		talk about diego delgado arent we
