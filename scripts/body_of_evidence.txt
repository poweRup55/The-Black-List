body of evidence
by brad mirman
second draft



over the black we hear the sounds of two people making love  a
mans voice moans passionately


fade in


int  bedroom  night

andrew marsh lies on his back in bed  he is a fraillooking
man in his early sixties with thinning gray hair  on top of
him is a much younger woman  although her back is to us we
catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
to side  we see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman

she moves wildly grinding her hips into him her head arched
back her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts  she reaches
down grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards forcing him
deeper inside her  they move together  faster  and faster

the camera slowly begins to pull back  as it does we see what
we are watching is on a television

further back still  we see two uniformed police officers
standing before the television watching the act

the camera begins to pan around the room  rain streaks down
the windows of the room  lightning flashes outside  a video
camera is set up on a tripod  more plain clothes police
looking dusting talking

we continue to pan  we can now see it is the same room on the
tape  on the bed lies the naked body of andrew marsh a sheet
covering his lower torso  his face is ashen mouth open his
dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare  the last instant of
his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain


ext  residential street  night

lightning fills the night sky  thunder booms overhead  the
wind whips the rain furiously against anything in its path
the camera moves slowly along rows of beautiful homes  at the
end is a culdesac  several police cars are in the driveway
their red lights flashing

a fourdoor sedan pulls into the driveway  john cardenas steps
out into the rain  he is a handsome latin in his thirties
with hard chiseled features and black slickedbacked hair
he does not run through the rain  he walks

detective reese a man who looks more like an accountant than a
homicide detective runs out to meet him

                                                            2


                    cardenas
          is it marsh
          
                    reese
          yeah
          
just a hint of sadness shows on cardenas face  it lasts an
instant then its gone

                    reese
          sir do you mind if we get out of the
          rain
          
cardenas doesnt move  he ignores the question

                    cardenas
          who found him
          
                    reese
          his secretary  joanne braslow
               
                    cardenas
          she was here
          
                    reese
          no  she stopped by to pick up some
          papers
          
                    cardenas
          show me
          
reese starts for the house  cardenas looks up into the night
sky  a flash of lightning fills the screen


int  house bedroom  close on camera  night

pull back to reveal a police photographer snapping pictures of
marsh in bed

cardenas enters followed by reese  he moves through the
forensic and medical teams  anything cardenas feels about the
gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
indifference

standing by the bed is assistant district attorney roger
troxell a short babyfaced man  cardenas looks down at the
body then over at the medical examiner dr henry mccurdy a
portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes

                    cardenas
          how long
          

                                                            3

                    mccurdy
          about three hours
          
                    cardenas
          cause
          
                    mccurdy
          not sure  ill have everything you
          need tomorrow
          
                    reese
          take a look at this
          
reese points to the nightstand drawer and troxell opens it  on
top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
spray  inside are ropes handcuffs and an assortment of sexual
aides

                    troxell
          this guy was into some kinky shit
          
cardenas looks at the various sexual devices then walks out of
the room


int  hallway  night

joanne braslow sits on chair  her eyes are tired  red from
crying  she is mid thirties  attractive but her looks come
more from effort than nature  expensive hair cut  the right
cosmetics  she has a corporate look to her

cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her

                    cardenas
          miss braslow  im district attorney
          john cardenas  you arrived at what
          time tonight
          
                    joanne
          a little after eleven
          
                    cardenas
          why did you come by
          
                    joanne
          i had some papers to pick up
          
                    cardenas
          do you know who mr marsh was with
          
                    joanne
          i assume his girlfriend
          

                                                            4

                    cardenas
          her name
          
                    joanne
          rebecca lawson
          
                    cardenas
          you wouldnt know her address would

                    joanne
          no  but i can get it for you
                    
                    cardenas
          thank you
          
          
int  hallway city hall building  day

cardenas walks down the corridor with mccurdy

                    mccurdy
          marsh wasnt alone  we found traces
          of sperm on the sheets  the
          toxicology report says there were
          high levels of cocaine in his blood
          
                    cardenas
          whatd he die of
          
                    mccurdy
          the official cause of death was a
          cardiac arrest
          
                    cardenas
          the official cause
          
                    mccurdy
          thats what my report will read
          
                    cardenas
          but theres more
          
they reach a door and stop
          
                    mccurdy
          its speculative at this point
          marsh had advanced arterial disease
          his heart attack was induced by
          excessive aerobic activity  in
          conjunction with the drug
          
mccurdy enters the room  cardenas thinks for a moment then
follows


                                                            5

          
int  cardenas office  day

spacious and sparsely furnished  the walls are empty  no
commendations plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
office  cardenas steps into the room and looks at mccurdy who
is already seated next to reese and troxell

                    cardenas
               to mccurdy
          what are you saying henry  that his
          girlfriend fucked him to death
          
                    mccurdy
          yes
          
a trace of a grin shows on cardenas face  he walks over to
the window and stares outside  reese troxell and mccurdy wait
as he thinks  a beat  cardenas turns back to the room

                    cardenas
          what can we prove
          
                    mccurdy
          we know marsh had a head cold   we
          found cocaine mixed with water in a
          nasal spray container on the
          nightstand  the coke would contract
          the nasal membrane the same as any
          decongestant but for a much shorter
          time  hed keep using more and more
           never knowing what he was taking
          
                    cardenas
          any prints on the nasal spray
          
                    reese
          marshs and rebecca lawsons
          
                    troxell
          what if he did know what was in it
          a lot of users put it in nasal spray
          bottles so they can use it in public
          
                    mccurdy
          cocaine is the last thing a man in
          his condition would want
          
                    cardenas
          can we put rebecca lawson at the
          scene

                                                            6

                    
                    reese
          a man across the street from marsh
          saw her drive up about four thirty
          sunday afternoon  and her prints are
          all over the place
          
cardenas stands and walks to a dart board on the wall  he
gathers the darts moves back and tosses one

                    troxell
          marshs cardiologist told me that
          after marsh was diagnosed with heart
          disease he quit smoking quit
          drinking and started exercising every
          day  does that sound like a guy
          whod start shoveling cocaine up his
          nose
          
                    cardenas
          what did he say about miss lawson
          
                    troxell
          he can remember at least one occasion
           and the receptionist can recall
          two times when she accompanied marsh
          to the office
          
cardenas throws another dart at the board
          
                    cardenas
          so she knew about his heart
          
                    troxell
          had to  i also interviewed three
          women who were in past relationships
          with marsh  theres no evidence that
          he had anything but straight sex
          prior to meeting miss lawson
          
                    cardenas
          what about the will
          
                    troxell
          thats the best part  she gets it
          all  everything
          

ext  cemetery  morning

gray clouds hang over head  a light drizzle falls  a group of
mourners hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave

in the bg the press is visible held back my private security
guards

                                                            7


a woman dressed in black stands in the front of the mouners
her face hidden behind a hat and veil  raymond sattler a
tall distinguishedlooking man in his sixties stands beside
her  he supports his weight with the aid of a cane  the
service concludes  sattler along with several other people
offer her their condolences  joanne braslow is there  she
does not go over to rebecca

cardenas and reese stand off to the side by a large oak tree
cardenas watches and waits  he steps forward as sattler leads
the woman by

                    cardenas
          miss lawson
          
the woman stops  her back is to cardenas

                    cardenas
          im district attorney john cardenas
          
rebecca lawson removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
around  she is in her late twenties  a deep pain fills her
face  controlled but evident  her eyes are tired  heavy
from crying  but no tears show now  this is a woman whose
grief is private and not displayed for others  although
emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful  so
beautiful that even cardenas usually cool demeanor cannot hide
how impressed he is
          
                    sattler
          i dont think that this is the time
          or the place
          
                    cardenas
          i just wanted to introduce myself and
          inform miss lawson that there will be
          an inquiry
          
                    sattler
          an inquiry into what
          
                    cardenas
          for starters id like to know why she
          left the house and didnt report the
          death
          
                    sattler
          because he wasnt dead when she left
          and even if he was not reporting a
          natural death in a timely fashion
          isnt a crime
          
                    cardenas
          did i say it was a natural death

                                                            8

          
cardenas and rebecca lock eyes  rebecca stares at him
genuinely shocked by his accusation  cardenas nods and walks
away  in the bg we see joanne staring at rebecca with
hostility
          

int  house living room  night

large and homey  a fire roars in the fireplace  frank dulaney
sits on his couch as he goes over some paperwork  he is mid
thirties powerful selfassured

sharon dulaney enters  she is an attractive woman in her early
thirties  she kisses him on the cheek then pushes his
paperwork aside and sits down on his lap

          i know  but she wants you to
          represent her if cardenas files
          
                    dulaney
          why
          
                    sattler
          because i told her you were the best
          criminal attorney we have
          
                    dulaney
          raymond im the only criminal
          attorney you have
          
                    sattler
               jokingly
          well i guess that makes you the
          best
               candidly
          look frank  she stands to inherit
          three million dollars  as executors
          of the estate and her attorneys that
          could generate a lot of legal fees
          for us  all im asking you to do is
          talk to her
          
dulaney thinks about it for a moment
                    
                    dulaney
          alright ill talk to her
                    
                    sattler
          shes waiting in the conference room
          
dulaney stands and walks towards the door

                    sattler
               continuing
          you know i knew andrew marsh for
          almost twenty years  or thought i
          did  what do you think would make a
          man in his condition do the things he
          did
          
dulaney stops at the door and looks back
          
                    dulaney
          i think the question is  what is it
          about her that made him want to do
          it
          
          

                                                            12

int  conference room  day

rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a
cigarette  sunlight flows through a window and highlights her
hair  she is dressed in a fashionable business suit that
clings to every curve of her body
          
dulaney enters the room  when he sees her he cant help but
stare  rebecca notes his gaze

                    dulaney
          miss lawson im frank dulaney
          
she raises the cigarette to her lips  dulaney notices despite
her outward composure her hand is shaking

                    rebecca
               nervously
          are you going to represent me
          
                    dulaney
          there are no charges against you im
          here to decide if im going to
          represent you should that occur
               beat
          did you kill him
          
rebecca appears hurt by the question

                    rebecca
          you dont waste any time do you
          
dulaney doesnt answer  he studies her  his eyes probing
hers
          
                    rebecca
               continuing
          do you think i did it
          
                    dulaney
          i dont know  thats why im asking
          you
          
                    rebecca
          you must have some feeling  some
          immediate impression  a young
          attractive woman involved with an
          older man who leaves her everything
          in his will  and the things that
          went on in that house  such wild
          sex  what kind of picture does that
          paint
          
                    dulaney
          not a very good one im afraid

                                                            13

          
                    rebecca
          and thats exactly what the jury will
          see when they look at me  thats why
          i need a very good lawyer mr
          dulaney
          
                    dulaney
          youre assuming the district attorney
          is going to file charges
          
rebeccas anxiety begins to surface  she feigns a weak smile
          
                    rebecca
          hell file  hes an ambitious man
          ambitious men build their careers on
          the bodies of others
          
                    dulaney
          you still havent answered my
          question
          
she takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering  she
looks at dulaney  displaying emotions is not something that
comes easily  tears well up in her eyes

                    rebecca
               emotionally
          i loved him  a big part of my life
          has been torn away from me mr
          dulaney  a part i can never get back
           and on top of that people are
          saying that i am somehow responsible
          for it  theyve taken everything
          that is good and caring about two
          people in love and made it dirty

a single tear streams down her check  she knows what he wants
to hear her say  and she resents having to say it
          
                    rebecca
          no  i didnt kill him
          
          
int  hallway das office  day

cardenas walks down the hall sipping a cup of coffee  troxell
walks towards him excitedly  they walk together

                    troxell
          i think im going to make your day
          
                    cardenas

                                                            14

troxell points to an office  through the glass partition we
can see a man sitting at a table  alan paley is a wellgroomed
man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good
          
                    troxell
          ive got this guy in my office
          doctor alan paley  wait until you
          hear what he has to say
          
cardenas and troxell enters the room  cardenas shakes hands
with paley and listens with great interest as he starts to
talk
          
          
int  dulaneys bedroom  night

dulaney and sharon are in bed  dulaney reads some papers
sharon finishes reading her magazine  she puts it on the
nightstand and looks at dulaney

                    sharon
          how can cardenas possibly think he
          can build a case against two
          consenting adults
          
                    dulaney
          he must have something or he wouldnt
          be pressing so hard
          
                    sharon
          if he files are you going to take the
          case
          
                    dulaney
          i dont know yet  i want to hear
          what she says at her statement
          tomorrow
          
                    sharon
          whats she like
          
                    dulaney
          attractive  bright  distant
          charming when she wants to be
          
dulaneys description seems to bother her
          
                    sharon
          she sounds like quite a woman
          
                    dulaney
               joking
          yeah  but can she cook
          
sharon hits him on the arm playfully

                                                            15


                    sharon
          the whole thing gives me the creeps
          i mean  what if she really humped
          him to death
          
dulaney grins at her choice of words
          
                    dulaney
          humped
          
                    sharon
               grinning
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          i can think of worse ways to go
          
dulaney rolls over gathering her up in his arms

                    dulaney
               continuing
          and speaking of humping
          
he reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the lights


ext  city hall building morning

as dulaney and rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by
a crowd of reporters  dulaney puts his arm around rebecca and
ushers her through the crowd
          
          
int  cardenas office  morning

dulaney and rebecca sit on one side of a table  reese stands
cardenas sits at his desk

                    rebecca
          i didnt know that andrew was dead
          until mr sattler called me at home
          that night
          
                    reese
          we have a witness who saw you go into
          the house at four thirty
          
                    dulaney
          shes not denying she was there
          
                    reese
          did you have sex
          

                                                            16

                    rebecca
          yes
          
                    reese
          what time did you leave
          
                    rebecca
          six thirty  and he was very much
          alive
          
                    cardenas
          miss lawson do you use cocaine
          
                    rebecca
          i have
          
                    cardenas
          did you use it the night marsh died
          
                    rebecca
          no  i havent done it in years
          
                    reese
          did marsh use it
          
                    rebecca
          no  never
          
                    reese
          it had to get there somehow
          
                    rebecca
          it didnt get there from me
          
                    cardenas
          were you aware of mr marshs heart
          condition
          
                    rebecca
          no
          
                    cardenas
          mr marshs cardiologist and his
          nurse have told us that you
          accompanied mr marsh to their office
          on at least two occasions
          
                    rebecca
          thats correct  but andrew never
          told me he had a heart condition  he
          said he had a heart arrhythmia and it
          was nothing serious
          
                    reese
          he never mentioned his heart disease

                                                            17

          
                    dulaney
          she just said that
          
                    reese
          why do you think he lied to you
          
                    dulaney
          thats something only marsh would
          know
          
                    reese
          i think miss lawson knew it too  i
          think she slipped him the coke and he
          popped his cork giving her the high
          hardone
          
dulaneys anger shows  he stands

                    dulaney
          thats it  my client doesnt have to
          take this crap from you
          
                    cardenas
          sit down frank
          
                    dulaney
          no  miss lawson came in here
          voluntarily to answer your questions
          she doesnt have to sit here and be
          insulted  so either you charge her
          now or were leaving
          
a beat  dulaney and cardenas lock eyes  cardenas shrugs his
shoulders

                    cardenas
          fine
          
dulaney motions for rebecca to get up  she stands and they
walk to the door  reese looks at cardenas  cardenas nods

                    reese
          rebecca lawson youre under arrest
          for the murder of andrew marsh
          
rebecca is stunned  frightened  she looks at dulaney in
disbelief  dulaney looks at cardenas angrily  reese removes
his handcuffs as he moves towards rebecca

                    reese
          you have the right to remain silent
          if you give up


                                                            18

                    cardenas
               to reese
          i dont think the handcuffs will be
          necessary  you can finish giving
          miss lawson her rights outside
          
reese grabs rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door  she
looks back at frank her face filled with fear  her eyes
welling with tears
          
                    rebecca
               frightened
          frank
          
                    dulaney
          ill have you out in a few hours
          
reese ushers her through the door  a beat  dulaney and
cardenas are left alone  cardenas starts fishing through a can
of nuts carefully extracting the cashews  dulaney continues
to stand

                    dulaney
          lookin to make the papers john

                    cardenas
          marsh left her close to three million
          dollars in his will  thats motive
          she admits to being there the night
          of his death  thats opportunity 
          and her fingerprints are on the nasal
          spray bottle
          
                    dulaney
               continuing
          you cant show intent
          
cardenas looks at dulaney wryly  he knows that dulaney is
trying to discover his game plan  cardenas looks into his can
of nuts and fishes for another cashew

                    dulaney
               continuing
          can you
          
                    cardenas
          take your pole out of the water
          frank  the fish aint biting today

                    dulaney
          youre bluffing  john its me
          remember  ive known you since your
          name was juan carlos
          
cardenas doesnt appreciate dulaney mentioning his real name

                                                            19


                    dulaney
               continuing
          cmon  think about it  if she was
          going to kill marsh why leave the
          nasal spray bottle there for the
          police to find
          
                    cardenas
          she planned this  she wanted us to
          find the nasal spray
          
                    dulaney
          why would she want that
                    
                    cardenas
          because shes clever  because she
          knows that even if we didnt find it
          wed have suspicions as to why a man
          in marshs condition would use
          cocaine
          
                    dulaney
          suspicions maybe  but suspicions
          arent enough for a conviction
          
                    cardenas
          the mes report stated that marshs
          nasal membranes showed no sign of
          prior cocaine use  without the nasal
          spray we would have still treated it
          as a poisoning  we would have looked
          for motive and the trail would have
          still led back to her
          
                    dulaney
          i dont buy it and neither will a
          jury
          
                    cardenas
          were going all the way on this one
          frank  tell your client she has
          until the prelim to cop a plea for
          murder two  fifteen to twenty five
          
                    dulaney
          ill tell her but she wont take it
          
                    cardenas
          then shes not as smart as i thought
          she was  youve seen her in the
          depositions  tell me you dont have
          any doubts

          shes innocent
          
                    cardenas
          arent they all
          
                    dulaney
          yeah  well  well let the
          blindfolded lady with the scales
          decide that
          
dulaney gets up slowly and leaves

          
int  city jail booking counter  afternoon

dulaney waits at the counter  a barred door slides open and
rebecca is led out by a woman jailer  even in these
surroundings she maintains her composure  she walks to the
counter and waits silently


ext  city hall building  afternoon

as dulaney and rebecca leave they are once again encircled by
reporters screaming questions asking them to verify rebeccas
arrest  dulaney plows through the crowd with rebecca in tow


ext  river  afternoon

gray clouds hang overhead threatening rain  tall birch trees
line the river the color of their leaves hinting that autumn
is approaching  dulaney and rebecca walk along a jogging path
cut along the bank

                    dulaney
          i want you to know right now that the
          trials going to be nasty  your sex
          life is going to be dragged through
          the mud  theyre going to say that
          you enticed marsh  led him down a
          dark path
          
                    rebecca
          andrew hardly needed leading  he was
          a very passionate man  he was eager
          to explore  i gave him what he
          wanted  we fulfilled each others
          needs
          
                    dulaney
          this is a very small town  people
          here have very straight views on sex
          

                                                            21

                    rebecca
          im used to being on the outside
          looking in  the same men who will
          publicly profess their moral outrage
          for my sexual tastes are the same
          ones who privately rest their sweaty
          little hands on my legs and talk
          about weekend trips together
          
                    dulaney
          those same men will be sitting on the
          jury
          
                    rebecca
          i am who i am  i cant deny it
          anymore than you can deny who you
          are  i like sex different  i like
          it wild  thats not a crime
               emotional
          i loved andrew  we made love
          together  we made it differently
          but we still made love  it was our
          way  it was private  and now the
          whole world wants to look in through
          the pretense of justice  if i was
          some middleaged divorcee who screwed
          him once a week do you think this
          would be happening to me
          
she stops walking and stares out over the river
          
                    rebecca
          have you ever seen animals make love
          mr dulaney  they have such passion
           such savage emotion  they
          struggle and snarl and claw but
          neither hurts the other  not really
          
                    dulaney
          no pain no gain
          
                    rebecca
          something like that
          
                    dulaney
          were not animals
          
as rebecca speaks dulaney seems captivated
          

                                                            22

                    rebecca
          of course we are  our primal urges
          are still there  but weve taken
          sex and intellectualized it refined
          it down to its most essential
          components  its bland easy
          mechanical  theres great passion in
          the struggle  such craving in
          denial  do you know what its like
          to yearn for something  im not
          talking about wanting or needing
          im talking about an urge so deep
          that your skin burns and every cell
          in your body pulses with desire
          
dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words  but hes
uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside

                    dulaney
               awkwardly
          i think were getting a little off
          the subject here
          
                    rebecca
          i thought the subject was sex
          
                    dulaney
          as it pertains to you  not me
               beat
          did you always know you had
          different tastes
          
                    rebecca
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          how
          
                    rebecca
          i dont know if its something i can
          explain to you
          
                    dulaney
          why not
          
                    rebecca
          because  its beyond intellect
          its emotion  its passion  it has
          to be experienced  it cant be
          imagined
          
                    dulaney
          try
          
rebecca thinks for a moment

                                                            23

          
                    rebecca
          when i was growing up we had a
          strawberry patch in our backyard so
          did this family down the road  i
          used to sneak in their yard and steal
          their strawberries  it wasnt easy
          the stone walls were high and id
          scrape my knees as i climbed over
          on the other side were wild rose
          bushes  the thorns would dig into my
          legs and cut my thighs as i lowered
          myself down
          
                    dulaney
          if you had what you wanted at home
          why did you sneak into their yard

                    rebecca
          because  somehow the fruit always
          tasted that much sweeter because of
          the pain it took to get to it
          
dulaney appears lost in her words  this isnt lost on rebecca
she walks off  dulaney stares after her intrigued


int  dulaneys house dining room  evening

a light rain falls outside  dulaney picks at his food  he
stares out the window  he seems oblivious to the conversation
between sharon and michael

                    michael
          alberts got the stomach flu
          
                    sharon

                    sharon
          not even if theyre a dork  you
          should go by and see how hes
          feeling
          

                                                            24

                    michael
          no way  jerry milner stopped by and
          albert puked right in front of him
          
sharon tries to suppress a grin

                    sharon
          dont use language like that at the
          dinner table
          
                    michael
          sorry
          
sharon looks at dulaney  he is still staring out the window
deep in thought
          

int  den  evening

dulaney is at his desk looking at photographs of marsh and the
bedroom  sharon enters

                    sharon
          frank  i know youre busy but
          michael asked me after dinner if you
          were angry with him  he wanted to

                    dulaney

                    sharon
          why dont you talk to him now
          
                    dulaney

int  michaels bedroom  evening
          
michael lies on his bed doing his homework  the door opens
and dulaney enters and sits beside him

                    dulaney
          im sorry if it looks like im not
          paying attention to you lately
          

                                                            25

michael looks at dulaney somewhat confused  dulaney tries to
explain it another way
          
                    dulaney
               continuing
          you know how it is sometimes when
          youre out playing ball with your
          friends  how youre really
          concentrating on what youre doing 
          and you lose track of time and you
          come home late and mom yells at you
          
                    michael

int  dulaneys office  morning
          
charlie biggs is a tall wiry black man  streetwise but
basically good humored  he is tossing a nerf ball through a
basketball hoop mounted on the wall as dulaney enters

                    biggs

          im sorry man  but i aint ever
          heard of no brother dying from
          gettin too much pussy

dulaney grins in spite of himself

                    dulaney
          we have to find out who else would
          profit from marshs death  and who
          knew enough about his personal life
          to know that putting cocaine in the
          nasal spray would be fatal
          
                    biggs
          so  where do we start
          
                    dulaney

          town  give them a list of people
          close to marsh and see if any of them

          doctor alan paley  he lives up in
          roseburg

biggs tosses the ball to dulaney then raises his hands
indicating he is backing off  he leaves  dulaney shoots from
his desk  swoosh


int  restaurant  day

dimly lit  dark wood and leather  dulaney sits at a table
with rebecca  she removes a cigarette and holds it waiting
for dulaney to light it  dulaney fumbles through his pockets
and removes a book of matches  he lights one  rebecca doesnt
lean forward to meet him  he must go to her  she looks into
his eyes as she cups her hand over his  a beat  she lights
the cigarette and takes a drag then arches her neck back and
blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling  she does not blow
out the match or remove her hand from dulaneys  she watches
him as it burns down towards his fingers  after a long moment
she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his
hand

                    dulaney
          howd you meet marsh

                    rebecca

          business  he had broken his wrist
          the week before and was wearing it in
          a sling  he looked so helpless
          
a foursome a few tables away are staring at her  rebecca sees
them

                    dulaney
           and then
          
                    rebecca
          we started talking  in fact we
          talked until four in the morning  we
          discovered we shared a lot of the
          same interests  after that we were
          together all the time until he left
          he used to call me every night after
          he came back  then after a few weeks
          he invited me to come visit him
          ive never left
          
                    dulaney

                    rebecca
          andrew was worried about how it would
          look
          
a couple in a booth are looking at rebecca and whispering
rebecca and dulaney notice them

                    rebecca

dulaney follows her as she walks to the door

                    dulaney

rebecca stops and turns towards him
          
                    rebecca
          why not
          
                    dulaney

                    dulaney
          no  it just doesnt look right
          
rebecca stares at him for a moment then looks down the street
to her left and back to her right then back at dulaney

                    rebecca
          no ones looking

                                                            29

looks around the room  he stares at a group of photographs on
the wall  on the other wall is a giant television screen

dulaneys pov  of the wall

filled with erotic paintings and photographs  sensual but not
vulgar

rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies
the artwork

                    rebecca
          what do you think
          
                    dulaney

                    dulaney
          its not my taste
          
                    rebecca
               seductively
          tastes can change
          
rebecca looks up to the top of a high cabinet  sitting on top
of the cabinet is a white persian cat

                    rebecca
          there you are
          
she stands on her tip toes as she reaches up  dulaney watches
her  the arch of her back  the hem of her skirt rising up
her legs  she lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and
sits down  the slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs
dulaneys eyes trace along them  rebecca notes his gaze


                                                            30

                    rebecca
          what are you thinking
          
dulaney looks up quickly

                    dulaney
          nothing
          
                    rebecca
          not true  shall i tell you what you
          were thinking  you were wondering if
          i was wearing anything under my
          skirt
          
the fact that he doesnt protest confirms that she is right
she runs her finger lightly along her thighs

                    rebecca
          i am
                    
dulaney walks to the window and stares out  rebecca seems
amused  she puts the cat down and walks over to him
                    
                    rebecca
          sorry  i wasnt trying to embarrass
          you
          
he slowly turns towards her
          
                    dulaney
          yes you were
          
dulaney stares at her for a moment then places his briefcase
on the table and opens it
          
          
int  restaurant  close on strawberries  night

a fork digs into a large strawberry  pull back as we follow
the strawberry into sharons mouth
          
dulaney sits across from sharon  his eyes are on the
strawberries  his mind is someplace else  and it isnt hard
to guess where

                    sharon
          he said it might be too expensive
          to add another room  he suggested we
          might convert the garage into a guest
          room  hes going to check with the
          contractor and let me know  ill let
          you know how much and we can decide
          alright
          

                                                            31

dulaney looks up slowly  it is not so much that he has heard
the question  it is more that he is aware that sharon has
stopped talking  a beat  sharon isnt sure he has heard her

                    sharon
          is that alright frank
          
                    dulaney
          yeah  fine  excuse me  ill be
          right back
          
he stands and leaves the table


int  restaurant hallway  night

dulaney walks to a pay phone near the bathrooms  he thinks for
a moment then dials a number  rebecca answers

                    rebecca vo
          hello
          
                    dulaney

          better idea
          
          
ext  cabin klamath lake  afternoon

an old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake  dulaney and
rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it

                    rebecca
          i figured if we have to talk all day
          we might as well do it someplace
          nice

                                                            32

               looks at the cabin
          isnt it beautiful
          
                    dulaney
          yeah
          
                    rebecca
               sadly
          andrew loved this old cabin
               fondly remembering
          he always dreamed about moving to
          tahiti  living in a hut and
          becoming a beachbum
               a sad smile
          i could never imagine myself doing
          that  but somehow when he talked
          about it he made it sound so alive 
           so wonderful  soft ocean breezes
          and beautiful sunsets  leaving the
          world and its problems behind  i
          wish hed had a chance to do it
          
her mind drifts away for a moment locked on some distant
memory

                    rebecca
               snapping out of it
          sorry
          
                    dulaney
          its okay
          
          
ext  lake further  dusk

dulaney and rebecca walk along the shore  a soft wind blows
through her hair

                    dulaney
          tell me about doctor paley
          
                    rebecca
          i hardly know him  he wanted me and
          he couldnt have me
          
                    dulaney
          its going to be hard to convince a
          jury that hes testifying against you
          in a murder trial because you blew
          him off
          
                    rebecca
               confidently
          it wont be that hard
          

                                                            33

dulaney and rebecca sit on an old porch swing

                    rebecca
          did you always want to be a lawyer
          
                    dulaney
          no  i wanted to be a professional
          hockey player
          
                    rebecca
          really
          
                    dulaney
          yeah
          
                    rebecca
          that seems so far away from who you
          are now  what happened
          
                    dulaney
          i broke my ankle skating  that ended
          that dream
          
                    rebecca
          its hard to let go of a dream isnt
          it  to let go of what you want
          
dulaney stares at her  she looks beautiful in the warm light
of the setting sun  their eyes meet  he starts to lean in
towards her  then stops  he gets up and walks away


ext  rebeccas house  evening

rebeccas car pulls up in front  dulaney gets out

          im going to put the car away  you
          can let yourself in  theres a key
          under the flower pot

rebecca drives to the rear of the building  dulaney walks to
the door  he lifts the flower pot  removes a key  opens
the door and goes inside

angle  down the street

detective reese is parked in his car watching the house  he
glances at his watch then makes a note in his note pad


                                                            34


int  rebeccas living room  evening

rebecca walks over to the stereo and turns on the cassette
player  the room fills with soft sexy music  dulaney stands
in the middle of the room  his eyes following her every move

                    rebecca
          yes  it would be nice
          
                    dulaney
          what would
          
                    rebecca
          you and me  making love
          
                    dulaney
          is that what you think i was
          thinking
          
                    rebecca
          no  thats what i know you were
          thinking
          
before dulaney can start to protest she continues  she slowly
walks behind him  dulaney stares straight ahead

                    rebecca
          how often do you make love to your
          wife frank  once a week  sometimes
          twice  there once was passion
          wasnt there  but now its bland
          predictable  tell me when you do it
           do you always think of her  or do
          you wonder what it would be like to
          be with someone else  someone wild
          someone who would force you to lose
          control
          
her words strip his thoughts bare  he is vulnerable
          
                    rebecca
               continuing
          theres nothing wrong in admitting
          that you want me frank
          
                    dulaney
          you take a lot for granted
          
dulaney starts for the door  rebeccas cool exterior fades
giving way to her vulnerable side


                                                            35

                    rebecca
          please stay frank  i dont want to
          be alone  i dont expect anything
          from you  no demands  no
          complications  i just need to feel
          close to someone
          
dulaney turns back towards her  a beat  he thinks for a
moment then walks back into the room  rebecca smiles warmly
invitingly

                    rebecca
          ill be back in a minute  help
          yourself to a drink
          
she disappears down the hall  dulaney stands were he is
wondering what he is doing there  he walks over to the bar and
pours a scotch  he looks down the hall

his pov  rebeccas bedroom

the bedroom door is open  the room is dark  lit only by the
moon  rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head
moonlight washes over her body silhouetting her  she runs her
hands lightly over her stomach  working her way up to her
round full breasts  she stops for a moment  and we sense
she knows dulaney is watching her

dulaney stares at her  mesmerized  he knows he should turn
away but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look

one by one rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans revealing
her sheer white panties  she bends forward slightly and
slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles  then steps out of
them

we can see the desire on dulaneys face  he looks away  the
conflict inside him grows  he looks back

rebecca walks into the hall  she is barefoot   wearing a
long slinky dress  her eyes catch dulaneys  if she wasnt
aware he was watching her before  she is now  it doesnt
seem to bother her  she moves towards him slowly  her eyes
inviting his

dulaney moves towards her  they meet in the middle of the
room  she waits  he moves closer  so close that he can
smell her  she cranes her neck back subtly tempting him to
bring his lips to hers  the longing overcomes him  he kisses
her lightly  the kiss lingers for a moment then she grabs
him forcefully by the hair arching his head back  she bites
his lip


                                                            36

                    rebecca
               whispering
          my way
          
dulaney ignores her  he tries to kiss her again  she turns
her head away
          
she walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door
dulaney follows  he tries the door  its locked  he starts
to knock  stops  turns and walks back into the living room
he starts to leave  stops  he looks at the bedroom door
his passion builds  his hunger for her devours him  he moves
quickly down the hall  eyes filled with determination  he
breaks the door open with his shoulder

rebecca is standing in the center of the room  as if waiting
for him  he moves to her  she can see the fire in his eyes
he takes her in his arms  kisses her neck feverishly 
feeding his craving for her

                    rebecca
          my way
          
he is lost within her now and doesnt hear her  she pulls his
hair jerking his head back  her eyes command him to follow
her demand

something in him snaps  a new door opens  he pushes her back
onto the dressing cabinet  he kisses her running his hand up
her thighs hiking up her dress  she wraps her legs around his
waist  they move along the cabinet  knocking jars and
bottles to the floor  he lifts her  carries her to the bed 
 lays her down and rips her dress from her body  their
passion is unleased  they grope and claw for one another
hungrily  she pulls his shirt off and bites him on the
shoulder  his face tenses from the pain but he moans with
pleasure

dark  sharon is asleep  the door opens and dulaney enters
quietly  he walks towards the bathroom


int  dulaneys bathroom  night

dulaney splashes a handful of water across his face  he
unbuttons his shirt and takes it off  wincing as he does  he
turns his back to the mirror  several deep fingernail scrapes
are dug into his back  he looks at himself in the mirror

          along

          what changed

          he did  look i know you can lead a
          horse to water but you cant make him
          drink  but you hold a pail of water
          in front of an old horse for long
          enough   and well
          
joanne stops as emotion fills her  her eyes well with tears
          
                    dulaney
          you dont really believe what the
          district attorney is saying about

                    joanne
          i dont know  its incredible to
          think that anyone could be capable of
          doing that  but if anyone could it
          would be rebecca
          
                    dulaney
          i take it you dont like miss lawson
          very much

          was about it
          
                    dulaney
          if you dont know her that well what
          makes you think shes capable of

          he was thirty years older than her
          wheres the attraction to sleep with

          of sex they had

          your time

int  rebeccas house  day

rebecca opens the front door and dulaney barges into the room

                                                            40


                    dulaney

          jury has to believe you and answers
          like hes lying or shes mistaken

                    rebecca

          this is rebecca lawson  im not in

staring up at the ceiling  a beat  she rolls over and
carefully lifts up dulaneys tee shirt  she sees the scratches
on his back  she does not wake him  she just lays there deep
in thought


int  hallway courthouse  morning

rebecca walks down the hall  in the bg we see dulaney
walking quickly to join her

                    dulaney
          i called you all weekend  where were
          you

          alone

          of course
          
          
int  courtroom  morning

the gallery is crowded with reporters and spectators  dulaney
sits beside rebecca at the defense table  cardenas stands
before the jury

dulaney and cardenas are seated at their respective tables
rebecca sits beside dulaney  she is wearing a beautiful well
tailored dress  she looks beautiful and has surprisingly made
no attempt to downplay her looks

judge burnham a confident black man in his fifties sits behind
the bench  he is strongwilled  tough but fair  there is a
rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets


                    judge burnham
          this trial by its very nature is
          explosive  the press is going to
          have a field day and i will not
          tolerate any activity in my courtroom
          that will fuel it
               to dulaney and
                cardenas
          both of you are going to be delving
          into very personal aspects of peoples
          lives  i warn you now  when you do
          so  if you cannot establish a clear
          line of relevancy early on in your
          examinations i will stop you  is
          that clear

dulaney and cardenas both nod

                    judge burnham
          mr cardenas
          
cardenas stands and walks towards the jury

                    cardenas
               points to rebecca
          you all can see the defendant
          rebecca lawson  but as this trial
          proceeds you will see that she is not
          only the defendant  she is the
          murder weapon itself

                                                            43

               stops and thinks for
                a moment
          is that possible  can a person
          actually be a weapon  the answer is
          yes  if i hit you and you die  i
          am the cause of your death  but can
          sex be called a weapon  yes  and
          what a deadly weapon rebecca lawson
          made of it  the state will prove
          that miss lawson seduced andrew marsh
           that she put increasing sexual
          demands on him while she secretly
          administered cocaine  all the while
          knowing that he had a severe heart
          condition
               beat
          she is a beautiful woman  but when
          this trial is over you will see her
          no differently than a gun or a knife
          or any other instrument used as a
          weapon  she is a killer  and the
          worst kind  one who disguised
          herself as a loving partner
          
cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down

                    judge burnham
          mr dulaney
          
dulaney stands up and approaches the jury

                    dulaney
          i know what youre thinking  and
          its a mistake  you look at miss
          lawson and you see a beautiful woman
          who was involved with an older man 
          and you think she looks like the
          type  she couldve done it  and
          thats exactly what the district
          attorney wants you to think  yes
          she is beautiful  so what  does
          that make her a killer  of course
          not  this case is not about
          appearances  its about facts
               beat
          as mr cardenas presents his case you
          will see that there are very few
          facts  that the bulk of the states
          evidence is circumstantial  im
          confident that by the conclusion of
          this trial you will not just have a
          reasonable doubt  you will have no
          doubt at all   that rebecca lawson
          is innocent of the charges against
          her

                                                            44

          
          
int  courtroom  later  day

mccurdy is on the witness stand  cardenas stands before him

                    cardenas
          doctor mccurdy what was the cause of
          death

                    mccurdy
          a massive cardiac arrest
          
                    cardenas
          what was mr marshs physical
          condition prior to his death
          
                    mccurdy
          very poor  he was suffering from
          severe arterial disease
          
                    cardenas
          was the heart attack the result of
          natural causes
          
                    mccurdy
          no
          
                    cardenas
          what induced it
          
                    mccurdy
          we found a high concentration of
          cocaine in his blood
          
                    cardenas
          so mr marsh used cocaine
          
                    mccurdy
          i dont think so  the membrane in
          his nasal passage didnt show any
          sign of long time usage
          
                    cardenas
          then how did it get into his body
          
                    mccurdy
          we found a bottle of dristan nasal
          spray on the nightstand  it was
          filled with water and cocaine  mr
          marsh had a head cold at the time of
          his death  i believe he wasnt aware
          that he was ingesting cocaine
          

                                                            45

cardenas holds up a bottle of nasal spray in a plastic bag  he
brings it over to mccurdy

                    cardenas
          is this the bottle that was found on
          the nightstand
          
                    mccurdy
               examines it
          yes
          
                    cardenas
          your honor the state enters this
          evidence as exhibit a
               to mccurdy
          were any fingerprints found on the
          bottle
          
                    mccurdy
          yes  those of mr marsh and a thumb
          print of miss lawsons
          
                    cardenas
          dr mccurdy what would cocaine do to
          someone in mr marshs condition
          
                    mccurdy
          increase his heart rate
          
                    cardenas
           and if he were in the midst of
          making love while under the influence
          of cocaine
          
                    mccurdy
          it would be an added stress to his
          heart
          
                    cardenas
          what would be the effect if someone
          secretly administered cocaine to mr
          marsh and then induced him to make
          love
          
                    mccurdy
          it would be the same as shooting a
          gun at him
          
                    cardenas
          thank you doctor mccurdy
               to dulaney
          your witness
          

                                                            46

rebecca looks at dulaney for his opinion of mccurdys
testimony  dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he
stands up and approaches mccurdy

                    dulaney
          can you say with any certainty that
          mr marsh didnt ingest the cocaine
          himself
          
                    mccurdy
          no  but it seems highly unlikely
          that a man in his condition would use
          cocaine
          
                    dulaney
          thats your opinion doctor  but
          im asking you if there is any
          scientific test that can tell who
          actually put the cocaine into the
          dristan bottle
          
                    mccurdy
          no
          
                    dulaney
          thank you
          
          
int  courtroom  later  day

cardenas stands before doctor trammel a thin pastyfaced man
in his fifties

                    cardenas
          doctor trammel when did you first
          diagnose that mr marsh had heart
          disease
          
                    dr trammel
          about a year and half ago
          
                    cardenas
          did mr marsh change his lifestyle
          after that
          
                    dr trammel
          yes  he stopped smoking and
          drinking and exercised regularly
          
                    cardenas
          he did everything he could to take
          care of his heart
          
                    dr trammel
          yes

                                                            47

          
                    cardenas
          did miss lawson ever accompany mr
          marsh to your office
          
                    dr trammel
          yes
          
                    cardenas
          just one last question  what does
          the sign on your office door say
          
                    dr trammel
          doctor steven trammel  cardiologist
          
cardenas walks back to his seat signaling his examination of
the witness is over  dulaney stands

                    dulaney
          dr trammel did you ever speak to
          miss lawson about mr marshs
          condition
          
                    dr trammel
          no
          
                    dulaney
          did mr marsh ever tell you that he
          had spoken to miss lawson about his
          illness
          
                    dr trammel
          no
          
                    dulaney
          did miss lawson ever accompany mr
          marsh inside during his examinations
          
                    dr trammel
          no
          
                    dulaney
          then you have no way of knowing what
          mr marsh told miss lawson were the
          reasons for his visits
          
                    dr trammel
          no  no i dont

business suit and largeframed glasses  her hair is pulled
back tight  cardenas stands before her

                    cardenas
          what did mr marsh say
          

                                                            49

                    joanne
          he was worried  he said that she was
          acting stranger and stranger  he
          said that if this kept up she was
          going to kill him  that his heart
          couldnt take it
          
there is an audible buzz from the crowd  for the first time
rebeccas confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with
genuine concern

                    cardenas
          thank you
               to dulaney
          your witness
          
cardenas sits down  dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards
joanne
          
                    dulaney
          how do you know it was cocaine that
          miss lawson had in the bathroom
          
                    joanne
          what other kind of white powder do
          people keep in a vial
          
                    dulaney
          do you remember the date when you saw
          miss lawson in the bathroom
          
                    joanne
          yes
               thinks a moment
          it was on a friday  i remember
          because i was going to visit my
          sister for her birthday  it would be
          october twentyeighth
          
                    dulaney
          could you repeat the last part of
          what mr marsh said to you the day
          before his death
          
                    joanne
          he said that if it kept up she was
          going to kill him  that his heart
          couldnt take it
          
                    dulaney
          didnt mr marsh also tell you that
          miss lawson felt bored here and was
          thinking about going back to chicago
          for awhile
          

                                                            50

                    joanne
          yes  he mentioned it
          
                    dulaney
          so the woman he loved passionately
          was thinking about leaving  that
          must cause tremendous anxiety
          sleepless nights  incredible stress
          
                    joanne
          i suppose
          
                    dulaney
          so isnt it possible that he was
          confiding in you about the pain he
          was feeling about losing what might
          be his last chance for love  that
          what he really was saying was that
          the uncertainty of her leaving was
          driving him crazy and if it didnt
          stop it was going to kill him  that
          if she did leave his heart couldnt
          take it
          
the jury waits anxiously for her answer

joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks  she appears
confused
          
                    joanne
          i dont know  im not sure
          
                    dulaney
          well think about it  isnt it
          possible
          
                    joanne
               begrudgingly
          yes  i suppose its possible
          
cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated  rebecca breathes a
sigh of relief

          
int  underground parking lot  late afternoon

quiet and desolate  most of the city employees have left for
the day  dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with
rebecca

                    rebecca
          you were brilliant today
          
                    dulaney
          its only the beginning

                                                            51


                    rebecca
          strong endings start with strong
          beginnings
               growing excitement
          i love the way you twist what people
          say around   manipulating their own
          words against them
          
they reach rebeccas car

                    dulaney
          can i see you later

                    rebecca
          you can see me now
          
rebecca presses against him raising her knee gently into his
groin  as she kisses him passionately  dulaney is lost in
her kiss for a moment then breaks it off and looks around
               
rebecca smiles  takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of
her car  she takes one of the shoes and hits the parking lot
overhead light fixture  the bulb breaks sending the area in
darkness

                    dulaney
          what are you doing
          
she steps down and kisses him again  for a moment he tries to
resist

                    rebecca
          i want you inside me

his desire fills him  he pushes her back onto the hood of her
car hiking up her dress with his hands as she reaches down
and unbuttons his pants


int  rebeccas bedroom  night

the room is dimly lit  dulaney is in bed  he appears to be
deep in thought  rebecca enters wearing a sheer silk bathrobe
and carrying a tea service on a tray  he places it on the bed
and sits beside him

                    rebecca
          something wrong
          
                    dulaney
          paley could be a problem tomorrow
          

                                                            52

                    rebecca
          im sure youll be able to handle
          him
          
                    dulaney
          im glad you have such confidence in
          me
          
                    rebecca
          dont worry about paley  he cant
          touch me  no one can  ive thought
          it all out
          
                    dulaney
               sits up very
                concerned
          what does that mean  youve been
          thinking about the case  or you
          thought everything out before you
          killed marsh
          
the question hurts rebecca  it shows on her face  she looks
away from him  a beat  dulaney thinks  he feels bad for
asking such a question

                    dulaney
          im sorry
               she doesnt look at
                him
          rebecca  im sorry  really

he takes her hand  she slowly looks at him and smiles  she
points to the tea service

                    rebecca
          sugar or honey
          
                    dulaney
          honey
          
she lifts a plastic bottle of honey and starts to pour it into
a cup  she stops and smiles seductively at dulaney then parts
her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her
thigh  she reaches out  grabs him by the hair and gently
pulls him forward  he kisses her knee and slowly runs his
tongue along her thigh following the trail upwards  she
arches her back  closes her eyes  breathes deeply from the
pleasure of his touch


int  dulaneys bedroom  night

dark  the door opens  light from the hall streaks into the
room  sharon is asleep  dulaney enters quietly  he watches
her  he looks over at the nightstand

                                                            53


his pov

a photograph of dulaney and sharon on vacation  dulaney is
carrying her on a beach  he is wearing a large sombrero  they
are both laughing
dulaney looks back at sharon  he is a man lost within himself
he walks to the bathroom  sharon opens her eyes and stares at
him


int  courtroom  morning

court is in session  cardenas stands

                    cardenas
          the state calls doctor alan paley
          
doctor paley stands and walks towards the witness stand

cardenas and paley  moments later

paley has been sworn in  cardenas examines him

                    cardenas
          where did you meet miss lawson
          
                    dr paley
          at a dinner party  about eight
          months ago
          
                    cardenas
          did you ever see her again after
          that
          
                    dr paley
          yes  several times
          
                    cardenas
          what eventually happened to your
          relationship with miss lawson
          
                    dr paley
          we stopped seeing each other
          
                    cardenas
          why
          
                    dr paley
          well  i realized that she wasnt
          interested in me  she was just
          trying to get information out of me
          

                                                            54

                    cardenas
          what kind of information
          
                    dr paley
          she said that she was working on a
          novel and she wanted to know what
          kinds of drugs would be harmful to
          someone with a bad heart
          
whispers from the crowd fill the room

                    cardenas
          did you suggest any
          
                    dr paley
          yes  insulin and others
          
                    cardenas
          what did she say
          
                    dr paley
          she said that those werent any good
           because their use would be
          detected and the police would know
          the victim had been poisoned  she
          wanted to know if there was a drug
          that would induce a heart attack but
          could also be used to enhance a
          sexual high
          
                    cardenas
           and what did you suggest
          
                    dr paley
          cocaine
          
more gasps from the crowd  rebeccas remains calm but her
eyes glare at paley hatefully

                    cardenas
               to dulaney
          your witness
          
cardenas sits down  dulaney approaches paley with a smile

                    dulaney
          dr paley where were you the last
          time you saw miss lawson
          
                    dr paley
          we had dinner at a restaurant
          

                                                            55

                    dulaney
          isnt it true that later that night
          you tried to force yourself on miss
          lawson in the parking lot
          
                    dr paley
          no
          
                    dulaney
          you didnt grab her and try to kiss
          her
          
                    dr paley
          no
          
                    dulaney
          if necessary i can bring in the valet
          parking attendant and two customers
          who witnessed the occurrence
          
paley thinks for a moment  he is nervous
          
                    dr paley
          well  as i remember it we had an
          argument
          
                    dulaney
          and the argument was about the fact
          that you wanted to be romantically
          involved and she did not
          
                    dr paley
               hesitantly
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          and after that didnt you
          continuously harass miss lawson
          
                    dr paley
          no
          
dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a tape player from a
cardboard box

                    dulaney
          your honor this is a tape from miss
          lawsons answering machine  i would
          like to play it now
          
                    cardenas
          objection  your honor we dont know
          where this tape is from  who made it
           or under what circumstances it was
          made

                                                            56

          
dulaney takes out two pieces of paper and approaches the bench

                    dulaney
          these are reports from two
          independent audio labs  they each
          state that the voices were recorded
          over the phone and that no
          alterations have been made
          
judge burnham studies the paper

                    judge burnham
          ill allow it
          
dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the play button  we
hear a beep then

                    dr paleys voice
          rebecca  i know youre there
          godammit  answer the phone you
          bitch  you cant treat me like this
          
we hear a phone slam down  another beep

                    dr paleys voice
          you want to play games with me  who
          the fuck do you think you are okay 
           well play  youll be sorry
          
dulaney stops the machine  he takes a dramatic pause letting
the words on the tape sink in

cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration
dulaney approaches paley who is now very nervous

                    dulaney
               quoting
          youll be sorry
          
                    dr paley
          i was angry
          
                    dulaney
          youre still angry arent you
          isnt it true that your whole story
          is nothing more than a vindictive
          attempt on your behalf to get back at
          miss lawson
          
                    dr paley
          no  she asked me about cocaine
          
                    dulaney
          i suggest it never happened

                                                            57

          
                    dr paley
               angrily
          you can suggest anything you want
          it happened
          
                    dulaney
          no further questions
          
dr paleys temper explodes  he is a loose cannon
          
                    dr paley
          i may have been infatuated with her 
           but i wouldnt perjure myself
          
                    dulaney
          thats all dr paley
          
          
int  rebeccas bedroom  evening

rain falls streaking along the bedroom windows  candles light
the room  dulaney and rebecca are on the bed  she sits on top
of him writhing back and forth  lost in the rhythm of their
love making

close on dulaney  later

he is asleep laying on his back  the sheets pulled up to his
waist  lightning flashes outside  a clap of thunder follows
he stirs and wakes up

his pov

another flash of lightning illuminates rebecca who is standing
over him in a sexy silk robe  dulaney starts to sit up but
something restrains him  he is handcuffed to the brass head
board

                    dulaney
          what the  what are you doing
          
she sits next to him  looks at him fondly  gently strokes
his face with her hand
          
                    dulaney
               nervously
          rebecca  take these off
          
                    rebecca
          tonight we open new doors
          

                                                            58

she slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach  to his
chest  dulaney follows it with his eyes  rebecca picks up a
large candle on the nightstand and moves it slowly  back and
forth over his chest

                    dulaney
          what are you going you doing
          
                    rebecca
          are you scared
          
he doesnt answer  he doesnt have to  she can see the fear
in his eyes  she tilts the candle  a stream of wax pours out
on his chest  dulaney winces with pain his body arching on
the bed his hands straining against his restraints

she smiles  a wicked smile then pours more wax making a
thin trail of little beads that moves down his chest towards
his stomach  dulaneys face cringes  he stares at her through
eyes filled with fear

                    rebecca
               whispering
          i love you frank  i love your
          strength  be strong for me now
          
she continues to pour the wax in little beads filling his
navel and working her way towards his groin

                    dulaney
               pleading
          rebecca  please  no more
          
rebecca stares at him warmly  fondly

                    rebecca
          i told you in the beginning that it
          was my way  my way can be many
          things  pleasure or pain
          
she lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn
he tenses as she pours it on his chest   then relaxes when
he realizes its water  he breathes a sigh of relief

                    rebecca
          you see how life is frank  we judge
          things  we look at things from the
          outside and assume we know whats on
          the inside
          
she takes a sip from the bottle


                                                            59

                    rebecca
          water  but you assumed it was
          vinegar  because you were only
          looking at the outside

her meaning isnt lost on dulaney  she watches him  as if
studying him  then slowly  very slowly  she pulls on the
belt of her robe  the robe parts revealing the beauty of her
body  she gently lowers herself on top of him  pressing her
breasts against him  dulaneys breathing quickens in
excitement  rebecca moves her head to his chest  kissing his
burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach
she gradually moves her head down  lower  and lower

close on dulaney

he stares at the ceiling  his mind a maze of confusion  soon
the power of her touch fills him  overpowering him  his eyes
close  the pain that only moments ago filled his body is
replaced with pleasure


int  dulaneys house  night

its late  dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs  a
light comes on  sharon is sitting on the couch waiting

                    sharon
          late night
          
her voice startles dulaney

                    dulaney
          yeah  what are you doing up
          
                    sharon
          we have to talk
          
                    dulaney
          whats wrong
          
                    sharon
          thats what i was hoping youd tell
          me
          
dulaney enters the living room

                    dulaney
          sharon its late  can we get to the
          point
          
                    sharon
          where have you been
          

                                                            60

                    dulaney
          working  charlie and i were going
          over some statements
          
                    sharon
          charlie called at eleven thirty
          looking for you
               beat
          you were with her werent you
          
                    dulaney
          yes
          
                    sharon
          why did you lie to me
          
                    dulaney
          because i knew youd think exactly
          what youre thinking
          
sharon springs off the couch

                    sharon
          this isnt a courtroom  dont try to
          turn this around on me
          
                    dulaney
          im not
          
                    sharon
          youre sleeping with her arent you
          
                    dulaney
          no
          
                    sharon
          its bad enough that you are  its
          even worse that you can stand here
          and lie to me
          
she starts to walks out of the room  dulaney grabs her by the
arm

                    dulaney
          sharon
          
she swings around and slaps him across the face then stares at
him angrily her eyes filled with tears

                    sharon
          you bastard  do you think im some
          kind of idiot  that i dont have
          fuckin eyes  i see  i feel  i
          hurt
          

                                                            61

she walks out of the room leaving dulaney alone with his
thoughts
          
          
int  courtroom  day

ester crawford is on the stand  she is a black woman in her
thirties  thin and tiredlooking although we get the
impression she once was pretty  she is dressed in what is
obviously her sunday dress  cardenas questions her

                    cardenas
          mrs crawford you were mr marshs
          maid for nine years
          
                    ester
          yes

                    cardenas
          did miss lawson and mr marsh ever
          argue
          
                    ester
          like cats and dogs
          
                    cardenas
          what did they argue about
          
                    ester
          you name it  they argued about it
          mr marsh tried his best to keep her
          happy  but it seemed that no matter
          what he did it was never enough for
          her
          
                    cardenas
          did they argue the day before he
          died
          
                    ester
          well  he died on a sunday and i
          have the weekends off  but they
          were ripping at each other with both
          barrels friday afternoon
          
                    cardenas
          what was the nature of the argument
          
                    ester
          sex
          
                    cardenas
          could you be more specific
          

                                                            62

                    ester
          she was calling mr marsh an old man
           making discourteous insinuations
          about his sexual abilities  she said
          that she had needs and that if he
          couldnt fulfill them shed find
          someone who could
          
dulaney jots down a note  cardenas continues

                    cardenas
          did you ever see mr marsh use
          cocaine
          
                    ester
          no  never
          
                    cardenas
               to dulaney
          your witness
          
cardenas sits down  dulaney approaches ester with a smile
          
                    dulaney
          did you go to college mrs crawford
          
                    ester
          no
          
                    dulaney
          high school
          
                    ester
          no
          
                    cardenas
          your honor i fail to see what mrs
          crawfords educational background has
          to do with this case
          
                    dulaney
          i was just about to make my point
          your honor
          
                    judge burnham
          do it quickly mr dulaney
          
                    dulaney
               reading from note
                pad
          discourteous insinuations about his
          sexual abilities  who told you to
          say that
          

                                                            63

ester doesnt answer but her eyes drift past dulaney and focus
on troxell  dulaney follows her stare

                    dulaney
          did mr troxell help you with that
          phrase
          
troxell and cardenas squirm a little

                    ester
          i heard him say it
          
                    dulaney
          then  those are not your own words
          
                    ester
          no
          
                    dulaney
          what else did the district attorneys
          office tell you to say
          
                    cardenas
          objection your honor  the fact that
          mrs crawford heard mr troxell
          reconstruct her sentence and decided
          to rephrase her words in a more
          intelligent manner for the court
          doesnt mean the incident never
          happened
          
                    dulaney
               to cardenas
          im just curious to see if mr
          troxell reconstructed anything else
          
                    cardenas
          your honor  please
          
                    judge burnham
          ill see both of you in my chambers
          right now
          
          
int  judge burnhams chambers  moments later

judge burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his
desk  dulaney and cardenas stand before him


                                                            64

                    judge burnham
          mr dulaney before you cast
          aspersions on the district attorneys
          office by suggesting theyve coaxed
          this witness to say things that
          arent true  you better have more
          than a hunch  do you
          
                    dulaney
          no your honor
          
                    judge burnham
          maybe you dont know what its like
          where mrs crawford comes from  but
          i do  i came from a neighborhood
          just like hers  this is a whole
          other world for her  shes a poor
          working woman who has been thrust
          into a room full of highly educated
          and mostly unsympathetic people  so
          she puts on her best dress fixes her
          hair and tries to present herself as
          intelligently as possible
               beat
          being poor and having pride is not a
          crime mr dulaney  and before you
          attempt to impeach another witness
          testimony in my courtroom  your
          foundations better be based on
          something other than semantics
          
          
ext  courthouse  afternoon

dulaney walks down the steps  cardenas joins him

                    cardenas
          im surprised you can walk after the
          way burnham chewed your ass out this
          afternoon
          
cardenas grins  his comment was meant as a friendly jab
between old friends  dulaney doesnt see it that way

                    dulaney
               coldly
          ive got work to do
          
                    cardenas
          hey  the bells sounded  its
          between rounds
          
                    dulaney
          i didnt hear it
          

                                                            65

                    cardenas
          whats happening to you frank
          youre acting like youre on trial
          here  this has become personal to
          you
          
                    dulaney
          back off john
          
cardenas studies him for a moment
          
                    cardenas
          youre sleeping with her arent you
          
dulaney forces a laugh  its not a very convincing one

                    dulaney
          thats ridiculous
          
                    cardenas
          im talking to you as a friend now
          dont ruin your life your career for
          her  shell spit you out when this
          is over
          
                    dulaney
          you dont know what youre talking
          about
          
                    cardenas
          really  what does an attorney speak
          to his client about at her house
          until three oclock in the morning
          
                    dulaney
          youve been following me
          
                    cardenas
          her  its an obvious move  im
          building a case against her
          remember
          
something in dulaney snaps  he grabs cardenas and pushes him
up against the wall  cardenas pushes back
          
                    cardenas
          if your head wasnt up your ass you
          would have thought of it too  youre
          losing perspective  get out while
          you can  before she takes you down
          with her
          
          

                                                            66

int  hallway  afternoon

dulaney walks towards his office  biggs walks quickly down the
hall and joins him

                    biggs
          ive been waiting for you to get
          back
          
                    dulaney
          you got something on the coke
          
                    biggs
          no  but i got something
          
biggs steps into dulaneys office  dulaney follows
          
          
int  dulaneys office  morning

biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the
couch  dulaney sits at his desk

                    biggs
          during lunch i was watching some of
          marshs home videos
          
biggs clicks the control  on the tv we see rebecca on top of
marsh in the bedroom

                    biggs
          he was really into recording this
          stuff  the das office found a box
          full of tapes
          
watching rebecca with marsh bothers dulaney

                    biggs
          this girl has really got some moves
          huh
          
dulaney stands up and turns off the television

                    dulaney
          if you want to get your kicks go to a
          video store and rent a porno movie
          
biggs studies dulaney for a moment  dulaneys reaction bothers
him  he turns the tv back on and fast forwards the tape  the
screen turns to snow where the tape has been recorded over

                    biggs
          this tape was recorded over an
          existing recording
          

                                                            67

                    dulaney
          over what
          
biggs raises a hand signaling patience  snow still fills the
tv screen

                    biggs
          i would have missed it  but the
          phone rang and i let it play while i
          talked  it looks like blank tape 
          but it isnt  its been erased
          without any input signal coming in
          
                    dulaney
          so what good is it to us if its
          been erased
          
                    biggs
          its very good  because when the
          das office saw it they assumed it
          was the end of the tape otherwise
          they would have buried it
          
                    dulaney
          why
          
                    biggs
          because it hasnt all been erased
          
biggs looks at the screen  a beat  the snow dissolves and a
picture fades in  the picture lasts only about five seconds
we see rebecca from the back as she straddles marsh grinding
up and down on the bed  her hair flowing down her back
marsh raises his hand  his wrist is in a cast  she turns her
head to the side and as she does we see that it is not rebecca
 but joanne braslow  the tape clicks off

dulaney stares at the blank screen

                    dulaney
               quoting joanne
          wheres the attraction to sleep with
          someone like that
          
          
ext  parking lot  dusk

joanne braslow walks to her bmw 325i  she is about to open the
door when dulaney approaches her

                    dulaney
          i need to speak with you
          

                                                            68

                    joanne
          i dont think we have anything more
          to talk about mr dulaney
          
she starts to get in the car

                    dulaney
          you were sleeping with marsh
          
she stops  appears shocked that he knows this  there is now
a different quality to her  an edge

                    joanne
          who told you that
          
                    dulaney
          he video taped you
          
                    joanne
          that bastard
          
                    dulaney
          i thought he was a kind gentle man
          
joanne doesnt appreciate dulaney throwing her words back in
her face

                    joanne
          yes i slept with him but that was a
          long time ago
          
                    dulaney
          youre lying  marsh was wearing a
          cast on the tape  it was right
          before he went to chicago and met
          miss lawson  he dumped you for her
          didnt he
          
joanne cant hold back the emotion that is building

                    joanne
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          it must have been horrible  having
          to go there  seeing them together 
           knowing he was sleeping with her in
          the same bed he did with you
          
                    joanne
          i was jealous  of course i was hurt
          he switched me off like a little toy
          he was finished playing with  but i
          didnt kill him
          

                                                            69

dulaney studies her
          
                    joanne
               continuing
          im a practical woman mr dulaney
          killing andrew wasnt in my best
          interest  as it is im out of a job
          and im not in his will
          
                    dulaney
          money isnt the only reason people
          commit murder miss braslow
          
dulaney walks off  joanne stares after him  her face is cold
showing no sign of emotion

          
int  courtroom  day

dulaney sits beside rebecca but he seems distant  cardenas
stands up

                    cardenas
          the state calls jeffery roston
          
as soon as she hears the name rebeccas face becomes tense
nervous  dulaney notices it  he checks a list

                    dulaney
          your honor i dont see a mr roston
          listed as a prosecution witness
          
                    cardenas
          the states investigation just
          uncovered mr roston yesterday
          afternoon in chicago
          
judge burnham motions for dulaney and cardenas to approach the
bench
          
                    cardenas
          your honor mr roston is an exlover
          of miss lawsons
          
                    judge burnham
          why didnt the states investigation
          uncover mr roston earlier
          
                    cardenas
          he was away on an extended vacation
          and just returned two days ago
          
                    judge burnham
          alright  im going to allow his
          testimony

                                                            70

          
                    dulaney
          but your honor
          
                    judge burnham
          thats it mr dulaney  take a seat
          
dulaney walks back to his chair  rebecca appears genuinely
nervous

          
int  courtroom  later

cardenas stands before roston a handsome man with salt and
pepper hair in his late fifties

                    cardenas
          mr roston what was your
          relationship with miss lawson
          
                    roston
          we were lovers
          
                    cardenas
          how long were you together
          
                    roston
          for about one year

                    cardenas
          how would you describe your sex life
          with miss lawson
          
                    roston
          intense
          
                    cardenas
          i know this is a very personal
          subject but could you be a little
          more specific
          
                    roston
          it was wild  she was constantly
          trying to get me more and more worked
          up  kinky things  i tried to
          satisfy her the best i could but it
          was difficult in my condition
          
                    cardenas
          what kind of condition are you
          referring to
          
                    roston
          i had a bad heart
          

                                                            71

there is an audible gasp from the crowd  cardenas waits
giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of
rostons last statement

dulaney looks at rebecca dumbfounded  he tries to control his
surprise from the eyes of the jury but he cant  he stares
ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the
testimony

                    cardenas
          what happened next

                    roston
          i had bypass surgery
          
                    cardenas
          and how are you now
          
                    roston
          fine  the doctors say if i keep
          taking care of myself i can live to
          be a very old man

                    cardenas
          how did your relationship with miss
          lawson progress after the surgery
          
                    roston
          it didnt
          
                    cardenas
          why not
          
                    roston
          she left me
          
dulaney slowly turns and looks at rebecca  the anger and his
sense of betrayal show on his face
          
                    cardenas
          why did she say she was leaving
          
                    roston
          she didnt  she just left
          
                    cardenas
          why do you think she left you
          
                    roston
          well  i think that after the
          operation she realized that
          
it takes dulaney a few seconds to object to the question  he
is clearly preoccupied with the implications of rostons
testimony

                                                            72

          
                    dulaney
          objection  the question calls for a
          conclusion on the part of the
          witness
          
                    cardenas
          your honor mr roston lived with the
          defendant for many months  i feel
          that his opinion is valid in
          substantiating the character of the
          miss lawson
          
                    dulaney
          the opinion of a scorned lover is
          hardly an objective view

                    judge burnham
          objection sustained
          
                    cardenas
          did miss lawson ever give you any
          indication why she was leaving
          
                    dulaney
          objection  the witness has already
          stated that miss lawson left without
          an explanation
          
                    judge burnham
          mr cardenas i suggest you move on
          to another line of questioning
          
                    cardenas
          when you say your sexual relations
          with miss lawson were intense what
          exactly do you mean
          
                    roston
          it was like she was trying to push me
          as far as she could  she called it
          opening new doors
          
                    cardenas
          can you give the court an example
          
                    roston
          it was like sex was a game to her
          she got off on the control  she
          always used to tell me it had to be
          her way
          
this strikes a chord with dulaney


                                                            73

                    roston
               continuing
          its hard to resist a woman as
          beautiful as she is
          
                    cardenas
          what would she do that made it hard
          to resist
          
                    roston
          shes a woman who is very much aware
          of her own sexuality  sometimes i
          felt she could read my mind  it was
          uncanny how she knew exactly what i
          wanted  a few nights before my heart
          surgery rebecca woke me  she had
          handcuffed me to the bed
          
there are a few snickers from the crowd  dulaney is thinking
about the familiarity of rostons testimony  judge burnham
bangs his gavel  the crowd becomes silent
          
                    roston
          she told me that tonight we were
          going to open new doors  i asked her
          to stop  to take off the handcuffs
          but she wouldnt listen
          
                    cardenas
          what did she say
          
roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of
his life

                    cardenas
          mr roston i know this is difficult
          for you but its important you tell
          the court what she did
          
                    roston
          she said she was going to fuck me
          like ive never been fucked before
          
more noise from the crowd  judge burnham is annoyed  he bangs
his gavel again

                    judge burnham
          due to the sensitive nature of this
          witness testimony and the inability
          of the spectators to allow him to
          complete it i am clearing the
          courtroom
          
sounds of protest fill the room as the bailiffs start to usher
out the crowd

                                                            74



int  courtroom later

the gallery is empty  only dulaney rebecca cardenas
troxell roston judge burnham the jury and court officials
remain

                    cardenas
          what did she do next mr roston
          
                    roston
          she started touching herself and
          telling me how much she wanted me
          she reached down and put me inside
          her  my doctor had warned me about
          exerting myself  but you really
          dont think of those things at a
          moment like that  you just think
          about how beautiful this woman is 
          how much you want her  how deeply
          you want to please her
               beat
          at first it started off slowly  but
          the rhythm built and built    every
          time i got close to an orgasm she
          would stop  eventually i started to
          have trouble breathing  rebecca just
          kept going  faster and faster  no
          matter what i said she wouldnt stop
          i really thought for a moment i was
          going to die
          
                    cardenas
          if you knew it was bad for you why
          did you do it
          
                    roston
          i couldnt help myself  you get lost
          inside a women like her  it was like
          a drug  it was the best sex i ever
          had
          
                    cardenas
          what happened after that
          
                    roston
          i woke up the next morning and she
          was gone
          
                    cardenas
          did you change your will while you
          were with miss lawson
          

                                                            75

                    roston
          yes
          
                    cardenas
          who was your primary beneficiary
          
                    roston
          she was
          
                    cardenas
          thank you  the state rests

                    judge burnham
          mister dulaney
          
dulaney is stunned  deep in thought  he doesnt appear to
hear the question

                    judge burnham
          mister dulaney
          
dulaney looks at the jury  what he sees isnt good  he thinks
for a moment  he leans over and quickly speaks with rebecca
we cannot hear them  but their conversation is heated
rebecca says something  dulaney looks at roston  a beat
dulaney stands

                    dulaney
          mr roston you said it was the best
          sex you ever had  is that the best
          sex with a woman or a man
          
cardenas bolts from his seat
          
                    cardenas
          objection
          
                    dulaney
          ill rephrase the question  mr
          roston isnt it true you are
          bisexual
          
                    cardenas
          objection  mr rostons sexual
          preferences are not at issue in this
          trial
          
                    dulaney
          your honor im trying to establish
          the sense of betrayal miss lawson
          felt when she discovered the man she
          lived with was a different person
          than she thought he was
          
judge burnham thinks for a moment

                                                            76


                    judge burnham
          the witness will answer the question
                    
                    dulaney
          mr roston
          
                    roston
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          and your sexual tastes were something
          that you hid from miss lawson
          
                    roston
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          and didnt miss lawson come home one
          day and find you in bed with your
          male lover
          
                    roston
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          and she left shortly after that
          
a pause  roston thinks struggling to make a decision

                    roston
          no  we worked things out  it was
          three weeks later when i told her
          about the heart surgery that she
          left
          
roston looks around the court room  he is embarrassed filled
with emotion

                    dulaney
          would it be fair to say that when she
          did find out it was a shock to her
          
                    roston
               very upset
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          no further questions
          
roston looks at the jury  their disapproving stares  he is
on the verge of tears



                                                            77

int  rebeccas house  late afternoon

rebecca opens the door  a tiredlooking dulaney enters  they
walk to the couch together in silence  dulaney sits  rebecca
lifts a bottle of champagne out of an ice bucket

                    dulaney
          whats that for
          
                    rebecca
          to celebrate how masterfully you
          destroyed roston today

                    dulaney
          rebecca  we shattered a mans life
          in open court
          
                    rebecca
               suddenly ice cold
          fuck him  he tried to shatter mine
          
                    dulaney
          he was only doing what he thought was
          right
          
                    rebecca
          youre too weak frank  when you
          want something you have to do what
          ever it takes to get it  if
          something gets in your way you remove
          it
          
dulaney stares at her  the person he sees has no feelings 
no empathy for anyone

                    dulaney
          you killed him  didnt you
          
                    rebecca

          could see it in your eyes today in
          the courtroom  youre wrong frank

                    dulaney

                    rebecca

          think of me  i didnt do it

                                                            78

               beat

          faces  to the men i represent what
          they can never have  im a cold
          heartless bitch  and this is their
          chance for payback for every woman

          to the old women im a vulgar whore
          and to the young ones i remind them
          of what theyll never be  it doesnt
          matter to them that im innocent

                    dulaney

                    rebecca
               matter of factly
          no  youre not
          
rebecca picks up a remote control from the coffee table and
pushes a button

close on television

a tape of dulaney making love to rebecca fills the screen  it
is wild passionate

close on dulaney

he is dumbfounded as he watches  the implications of what this
tape could do to him run through his mind

something in dulaney snaps  he grabs rebecca  they struggle
falling down onto the coffee table  the champagne bottle
crashes to the floor  rebecca rolls off the table to the
floor  she sits up and moves away from dulaney by pushing
herself backwards  dulaney lunges at her  his hand grabbing
her ankle  rebecca kicks  breaks free  stands up  dulaney
gets to his feet  runs after her  he grabs her by the throat
and smashes her into the wall  he slaps her across the face
a thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth  she
smiles

                    rebecca
          it gets easier doesnt it  once you
          open the door it never closes
          
dulaney realizes what he is doing  he stares at her in horror
then walks towards the door he stops  goes back to the vhs
machine  he pushes the eject button on the vcr removes the
tape and destroys it


                                                            79

                    rebecca

          think your wife would feel if she saw
          this  not to mention your
          colleagues
          
dulaneys temper is near the breaking point again he strains
to control himself

                    rebecca
          you can think whatever you want
          frank  but i didnt kill andrew
          and im not going to prison for

                    biggs
          im sorry to barge in  but i

          lawyer before he became a dealer
          

                                                            80

                    biggs
          marshs secretary  joanne braslow
          
confusion fills dulaneys face
          
          
int  courtroom  morning

court is in session  rebecca looks around the courtroom
trying to get a feel of the crowds opinion  dulaney is not
there  she looks at the door anxiously  the rooms waits  a
beat  dulaney enters  sits beside rebecca  but acts as if
she isnt there


int  courtroom  later

dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an oriental man
in his thirties

                    dulaney
          dr wong  what type of medicine do
          you practice
          
                    dr wong
          oriental medicine
          
                    dulaney
          and is miss lawson a patient of
          yours
          
                    dr wong
          yes  ive been seeing her for over a
          year
          
                    dulaney
          why does she come to you
          
                    dr wong
          she suffers from severe menstrual
          cramps
          

                                                            81

                    dulaney
          did you ever prescribe any medication
          for her cramps
          
                    dr wong
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          what did you prescribe for her
          
                    dr wong
          chinese peony root
          
                    dulaney
          would you describe for the court what
          chinese peony root looks like
          
                    dr wong
          its a white powder that comes in a
          vial
          
there is a moan from the crowd  cardenas looks at troxell

                    dulaney
          how do you instruct your patients to
          take it
          
                    dr wong
          i tell them to pour an amount the
          size of a quarter into the their hand
          and mix it with water
          
                    dulaney
          a previous witness stated that she
          saw miss lawson pouring a white
          powder into her hand on october
          twentyeighth  according to your
          records when did you prescribe the
          drug
          
dr wong checks his records

                    dr wong
          october twentyseventh
          
                    dulaney
          one last question doctor  if
          someone didnt know better would it
          be easy to mistake the peony root for
          cocaine
          
                    dr wong
          yes  quite easy
          

                                                            82

                    dulaney
               to cardenas
          your witness
          
cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this
witness

                    cardenas
          no questions

                    judge burnham
          you may call your next witness
          
                    dulaney
          the defense calls miss margaret
          sellers
          
cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her
mid twenties approach the stand

dulaney and miss sellers

miss sellers appears a little nervous  dulaney smiles warmly

                    dulaney
          miss sellers do you know dr alan
          paley

          relationship with dr paley
          
                    miss sellers
          we dated for about a month last year
          
                    dulaney

          i realized he wasnt serious  he was
          seeing other women  asking other
          nurses at the hospital out so i
          ended it
          

                                                            83

                    dulaney
           and what did dr paley do after
          you stopped seeing him
          
                    miss sellers
          he used to call me  tell me that i
          couldnt just walk out on him  he
          said that if i didnt come back hed
          make my life miserable
          
                    dulaney
          did he make your life miserable
          
                    miss sellers
          yes  he did
          
                    dulaney
          how
          
cardenas stands again

                    cardenas
          objection  may i remind mr dulaney
          that the person on trial here is miss
          lawson  not dr paley
          
                    dulaney
          your honor im trying to establish a
          pattern in dr paleys behavior with
          women
          
                    judge burnham
          objection overruled  the witness
          will answer the question
          
                    miss sellers
          hed call me in the middle of the
          night  show up at my house and bang
          on the door  finally after two weeks
          i went to his office one day to tell
          him to stop
          
                    dulaney
          what did he say
          
                    miss sellers
          he laughed  and basically said he
          would decide when it was over
          
                    dulaney
          do you remember his exact words
          

                                                            84

                    miss sellers
          yes  he said if you want to play
          games well play  and youll be
          sorry
          
another buzz from the crowd   cardenas inwardly cringes
          
                    dulaney
          what happened next
          
                    miss sellers
          while i was seeing dr paley i
          mentioned to him one night that
          someone was stealing drugs from the
          third floor dispensary   three days
          after i spoke to him in his office he
          went to the head nurse and told her
          he had witnessed me stealing drugs
          
                    dulaney
          what happened
          
                    miss sellers
          there was an inquiry  it was his
          word against mine  they believed
          him  i was fired
          
          
int  dulaneys office  dusk

dulaney is at his desk  biggs enters excited

                    biggs
          joanne braslow is getting more and
          more interesting  i followed her
          today to an attorneys office
          joseph koehler
          
                    dulaney
          joe koehler  i know him  hes an
          estate attorney  and hes very
          expensive
          
                    biggs
          what would joanne braslow need with
          an estate attorney  she wasnt even
          mentioned in marshs will
          
dulaney thinks for a moment  he grins as an idea enters his
mind
          
                    dulaney
          not this will
          

                                                            85

int  file room  evening

dulaney and biggs sit at a table going through a stack of
papers  dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper

                    dulaney
          here it is  according to the old
          will joanne braslow was to inherit
          two hundred and fifty thousand
          dollars
          
                    biggs
          what good does that do  its the
          old will
          
                    dulaney
          under the law a person cannot profit
          from their own wrong doing  since
          rebecca lawson is the sole
          beneficiary of the new will if she
          is found guilty the will is void and
          joanne braslow could make a very good
          case to have the old will reinstated

                    biggs
          she kills the old man and makes it
          look like miss lawson did it  pretty
          slick
          
          
int  dulaneys house bathroom  evening

dulaney is washing up for dinner  he speaks to sharon who is
in the bedroom

                    dulaney
          i was thinking that when the trial is
          over wed all go skiing for a
          weekend
          
                    sharon
          maybe it would be a good idea if you
          just took michael
          
sharon leaves the room  dulaney reaches for his toothbrush 
picks up a tube of tooth paste  it is empty  he stares at the
empty tube

                    dulaney
               to himself

dulaney looks worn tired  the tension between him and
rebecca shows

                    judge burnham
          mr dulaney are you ready to call
          your next witness

                    judge burnham

dulaney snaps out of it

                    dulaney
          yes your honor  the defense recalls
          joanne braslow
          
as joanne walks towards the stand dulaney looks over at
rebecca  its as if he is trying to make up his mind about
her  joanne takes her seat

                    judge burnham
          miss braslow id like to remind you
          that you are still under oath
          
                    dulaney
          how often do you use cocaine
          
cardenas shoots out of his seat

                    cardenas
          objection your honor
          
                    judge burnham

                    judge burnham
          mr dulaney im getting tired of
          seeing you this close to me
          
judge burnham looks at cardenas indicating he will hear his
argument now
          
                    cardenas
          whether or not miss braslow uses
          drugs is not an issue here
          

                                                            87

          your honor  the prosecution has
          introduced cocaine as one of the
          contributing reasons mr marsh died
          how it may have been introduced into
          the household is of vital importance
          
                    judge burnham
          are you able to back up this
          allegation  or are you fishing
          
                    dulaney
          i can back it up
          
                    judge burnham
          you better
               to joanne
          please answer the question
          
                    joanne
          ive tried it
          
                    dulaney
          youve tried it  isnt it true that
          youve been in and out of rehab
          centers for the last four years
          
this is clearly embarrassing for her

                    joanne
          ive been to a few  yes
          
                    dulaney
          you dont like miss lawson much do
          you
          
                    joanne
               hesitantly
          no
          
                    dulaney
          you dont like her because you were
          involved with mr marsh before she
          came along  isnt that true
          
                    joanne
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          you resented the fact that she told
          you what to do in mr marshs house
          
                    joanne
          yes
          

                                                            88

dulaney moves the questions along quickening their pace
building a rhythm
          
                    dulaney
          and you resented that he cared for
          her in a way he once cared for you
          
                    joanne
               breaking down
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          and that mr marsh paid less
          attention to you
          
                    joanne
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          and that he changed his will
          
                    joanne
          yes
          
she has blurted out the answer before the full implications of
the question has dawned on her  her face reveals her mistake

cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat

                    dulaney
          in his previous will mr marsh left
          you two hundred and fifty thousand
          dollars  then he cut you out  why
          do you think he did that
          
                    joanne
          she talked him into it  she wanted
          everything
          
                    dulaney
          two hundred and fifty thousand
          dollars is a lot of money  that must
          have made you pretty angry
          
                    joanne
          yes
          
dulaney picks up a small piece of paper and walks towards
joanne
          
                    dulaney
          you testified that you returned to
          mr marshs house at eleven oclock
          the night of his murder  is that
          correct

                                                            89

          
                    joanne
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          well  im a little confused
               holds up the paper
          this is a charge receipt from rosens
          drug store where mr marsh had an
          account  its dated the day of the
          murder
               hands it to her
          is this your signature
          
                    joanne
               nervously studies
                it
          yes
          
                    dulaney
          theres an item you picked up thats
          marked  will you read it
          
                    joanne
          dristan nasal spray
          
                    dulaney
          would you read for us the time of the
          purchase
          
                    joanne
          three fifteen
          
                    dulaney
          am  or pm
          
                    joanne
          pm
          
                    dulaney
          you see thats what bothers me  no
          other bottle of nasal spray was found
          in the house  the police looked
          there was only the one bottle  but
          you say you didnt arrive until after
          mr marsh was dead  yet we know he
          was using the nasal spray prior to
          his death  how do you think it got
          there
          
                    joanne
          i dont know
          

                                                            90

                    dulaney
          isnt it true that you stopped by the
          house after you left the drug store
          and dropped off the items you bought
          
                    joanne
               nervously
          no
          
                    dulaney
          isnt it true that you put the
          cocaine in the bottle
          
                    joanne
          no  why would i want to kill him
          
                    dulaney
          because you were jealous  because he
          cut you out of the will  because you
          have a cocaine habit to feed 
          because you know that if rebecca
          lawson is found guilty the new will
          is void  and theres a very good
          chance the old one would be honored
          
silence fills the room  members of the jury look at rebecca
they are confused  doubt fills their minds

                    dulaney
          the defense rests


int  dulaneys den  evening

dark  dulaney is standing by the window watching the rain
fall outside  sharon enters

                    sharon
          we cant go on like this frank
          
dulaney continues to stare out the window
          
                    dulaney

                                                            91

                    dulaney
               emotionally
          i cant talk about it now
          
she senses his pain and moves to him wrapping her arms around
his shoulders

                    sharon
          dont shut me out  let me in
          
he turns and faces her  she can see the pain on his face
          
                    dulaney
          you wouldnt like what youd see
          you dont know me anymore  i dont
          know me anymore
          
                    sharon
          we cant pretend this isnt
          happening
          
                    dulaney
          please  not now
          
                    sharon
          why didnt you come to me
          
                    dulaney
          i dont know
          
                    sharon
          you used to like to touch me  to
          make love to me
          
                    dulaney
          its more involved than that
          
                    sharon
          it was a place to start
          
                    dulaney
          you think thats the answer  sex
          is that what you want  you want me
          to make love to you
          
                    sharon
          i dont want our lives ruined because
          of this  i love you frank  i want
          this to work  but you have to help
          me  you have to come back from where
          ever it is you are
          

                                                            92

dulaneys confusion and emotion begins to surface  she kisses
him softly gently  dulaney closes his eyes  he kisses her
harder  and harder  his passion builds  his anger grows
he runs his arm over his desk brushing everything to the
floor

he grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk  he kisses
her forcefully his lips pressed hard against hers  she
struggles against him  his hands tear at her blouse  it is
rough angry sex and it frightens sharon

                    sharon
               screaming
          frank  stop it  stop it
          
                    dulaney
          is this what you want  huh  is it
          
she is crying now  struggling futilely against him

                    sharon
          let me go  godammit frank let go
          
                    michael os
               racked with fear
          daddy  stop it
          
dulaney stops and looks

michael is standing in the doorway his face filled with fear
and incomprehension  tears streak down his face

dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him
his face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total
effect of his behavior

                    dulaney
               softly
          oh  jesus
          
filled with pain and embarrassment dulaney runs from the room
          
          
ext  band shell park  night

rain falls in sheets  dulaney sits inside the small structure
huddled against one of the pillars  he is a tragic figure
desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once
knew



                                                            93

ext  dulaneys house  later  night

rain continues to fall  dulaney is standing across the street
staring at the house  he crosses over and is half way to the
door when he stops  he starts to leave

the front door opens and sharon steps out onto the porch

                    sharon
          frank
          
he turns around slowly  he cant bring himself to look at her
she walks out into the rain  he lifts his head  tears flow
down his face and he cries  when she begins to cry with him
he breaks down

                    dulaney
               ashamed
          im sorry  god  im so sorry
          
he slowly drops to his knees  holding on to her as if she
were a strong tree in a windstorm

                    dulaney
          help me  please  help me
          
          
int  courtroom  day

dulaney sits beside rebecca there is tension between them  he
does not look at her

                    judge burnham
          mr dulaney

dulaney stands and walks over to the jury

                    dulaney
          the prosecutions case is built on
          theory  speculation  could rebecca
          lawson have done this  is it
          possible that she did that where are
          the facts  the evidence  the state
          has presented two spurned lovers and
          a jealous secretary  hardly what i
          would call impartial witnesses
          where is one shred of conclusive
          irrefutable evidence  i dont see it
           and i dont think you do either
          do you know why  because there isnt
          any

                                                            94

               beat
          whats the issue here  that rebecca
          lawson likes wild sex  no  but the
          district attorney is trying to make
          you think if rebecca lawson could
          stray from the path of normal
          accepted sexual behavior then she
          could be capable of murder  did she
          force andrew marsh to make love to
          her  did she hold a gun to his head
          no  andrew marsh wanted her  and
          why wouldnt he  shes beautiful
          alluring  the type of woman men
          dream about
          
as dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing
arguments to himself

                    dulaney
          its human nature  we want what we
          want  when we want it  we dont
          think about the consequences of our
          actions  when desire fills us we all
          do things that we know are bad for
          us  we live for the moment
               beat
          here was an exciting young woman who
          unlocked doors  doors that led into
          a new world  a world he entered
          willingly  eagerly  he wanted to
          please her  and so he did not tell
          her of his illness  i know it might
          be difficult for you to understand
          wanting something so badly that you
          are willing to risk everything  but
          thats what passion does to you
          its a fire  uncontrollable  it
          consumes you  and the only thing
          you can do is let it burn  andrew
          marsh let it burn  it was his life 
           his choice  and maybe his mistake
           but making love is not a crime
               beat
          we all have fires inside us  secret
          desires  we guard them hold them
          in the cages that weve built  when
          someone comes along and opens the
          gate they rush out and feed blindly
          on their pleasure  rebecca lawson
          loved andrew marsh  she didnt kill
          him  if anything did it was his
          own passion
          

                                                            95

dulaney walks back to his table and sits down  rebecca looks
at him warmly  dulaney does not look at her  cardenas stands
to address the jury

                    cardenas
          its true  we all have fires
          burning inside us  rebecca lawson
          was very aware of the fire burning
          inside andrew marsh  and she stoked
          those flames  fanning them until
          they burned so hot that reason and
          judgement left him  is making love a
          crime  of course not  but the
          question isnt as simple as that
          rebecca lawson used her seductive
          qualities to entice andrew marsh
          she used sex as a catalyst and
          cocaine as the terminus  the
          combination of the two provided the
          conclusion of a premeditated act
               beat
          she asked dr paley about cocaine
          her fingerprints were found on the
          nasal spray bottle that contained the
          cocaine  and she was the sole
          beneficiary of andrew marshs will
          she planned it from beginning to end
          she knew about his heart  she
          secretly administered cocaine then
          used wild and physically demanding
          sex to induce a heart attack
               beat
          making love is an act of passion
          between two people to affirm their
          vows of love  this was not an act of
          love  this was an act of greed
          this was betrayal  rebecca lawson
          killed andrew marsh  and im
          counting on you to punish her for
          that crime
          
          
int  waiting room courthouse  day

dulaney sits on one side of the room  rebecca on the other
the room is quiet  tense  a man enters and nods to him

foreman then walks over to judge burnham and hands it to him
judge burnham reads the decision  he hands it back to the
bailiff who takes it to the court clerk

          the jury finds the defendant  not
          guilty
          
relief floods rebeccas face  dulaney shows no emotion
sattler and biggs shakes hands then lean forward to
congratulate dulaney

rebecca turns to dulaney to hug him  before she can dulaney
has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom


int  underground parking lot  afternoon

dulaney walks towards his car with biggs  there is no sense of
victory or elation

                    biggs
          what are you gonna do now

                                                            97

          
                    dulaney
          take some time off
          
                    biggs
          you think the das gonna file on
          joanne
          
                    dulaney
          i dont know
          
dulaney reaches his car

                    dulaney
          you did a good job charlie
          
                    biggs
          thanks mister d
          
biggs walks away  dulaney takes out his keys opens the door
to his car  he is about to get in when he senses someone
behind him  he turns around

joanne steps out from behind a pillar  she stares at dulaney
hatefully  her hand is inside her purse

                    joanne
          that bastard should have left me
          something  i worked for him for six
          years  and he goes and gives it all
          to her
          
dulaney looks around the parking lot  he is alone  joanne is
obviously very high on something  her mind seems to wander
her eyes drift

                    joanne
          you take what people say and make it
          ugly  you make others believe what
          you want them to  she should have
          been found guilty  she shouldnt
          have gotten off
          
                    dulaney
          then you would have gotten your
          money
          
                    joanne
          yes

                    dulaney
          you killed him  didnt you joanne
          

                                                            98

                    joanne
          do you think if i did id be stupid
          enough to tell you
          
dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse
          
                    dulaney
          what do you have in your purse
          
                    joanne
          what do you think ive got  a gun
          maybe im gonna kill you too  maybe
          ill blow your head off right now
          
her hand starts to come out of the purse  suddenly biggs
appears rushing her from behind a pillar  he grabs her hand
and pushes her against a car

he pulls her hand from the purse  she is holding a piece of
paper

                    joanne
               crying
          im gonna go to jail  i know theyre
          gonna make it look like i did it
          they gotta put it on someone

                    dulaney
          whyd you come here
          
                    joanne
               holds up the letter
          to show you this  its a letter from
          that lawyer koehler  he wrote it to
          me the day after i saw him  hes the
          one who told me i could get the money
          if miss lawson went to jail
          
                    dulaney
          you didnt know about it before that
          
                    joanne
          no
          
dulaney is suddenly very confused
          
                    dulaney
          then why did you go see mr koehler
          in the first place
          
                    joanne
          because he called me
          
dulaney is stunned  he looks at biggs with a knowing stare


                                                            99


ext  house  evening

it is raining lightly  dulaney waits at the door of a nice two
story home  it is answered by a heavyset man in his fifties
joseph koehler

                    dulaney
          hi joe
          
                    koehler

                    dulaney

          made you get in touch with joanne
          braslow
          
                    koehler

                    dulaney

          specifics  i just want to know what

                    koehler
          sorry
          
koehler starts to close the door dulaney sticks his foot
inside blocking it  his face is filled with determination
koehler sees it

                    dulaney
          please  i need your help
          
koehler thinks for a moment  he can sense dulaneys need
          
                    koehler
          all i can tell you is i was contacted
          by an interested party on miss
          braslows behalf
          
          
int  dulaneys car  night

dulaney stares through the windshield straining to see the
road through the heavy rain  his car phone rings

                    dulaney
          hello
          
                    rebecca vo

                                                            100

          
a calmness spreads over his face

                    dulaney
          ill be right there
          

ext  rebeccas house  night

rain falls  lightning fills the sky  dulaney drives up 
finds a parking spot down the street   gets out of his car
and runs to the door  as he knocks as loud clap on thunder
booms overhead  dulaney waits impatiently  he lifts the
flower pot removes the key and opens the door


int  den  night

the dim glow of a desk lamp is the only source of light
dulaney moves through the room slowly

                    dulaney
          rebecca
          
two champagne bottles are on the floor by the couch  dulaney
looks on the coffee table

his pov  coffee table

a vial is open and on its side  a razor blade and straw lay
next to it  a pile of white powder has been dumped out
several lines of cocaine have been drawn

dulaney starts to move towards the living room  he is almost
at the door when the big screen television turns on  we see
the tape of dulaney and rebecca making love

                    rebecca os
          is this what youre looking for
          frank

dulaney turns around to find rebecca standing behind him a
remote control in her hand

                    dulaney
               distant
          you killed him  you killed him 
          and i got you off
          
                    rebecca
          thats crazy
          

                                                            101

                    dulaney
          is it  joanne braslow was perfect
          wasnt she  you knew wed see her on
          the tape and find out about her coke
          problem  after that the digging
          should have been easy  but we
          missed the will  you knew we were
          following her so you called koehler
          and had him contact her  that put us
          right back on track  all we needed
          then was to prove that she had an
          opportunity  the drug store took
          care of that  she dropped off the
          stuff and you came back and killed
          him  didnt you
          
she shrugs her shoulders  his frustration clearly amuses her
she grins slightly almost taunting him

                    dulaney
          i want the tape
          
dulaney starts into the living room
          
                    rebecca
          ive been thinking about that  ive
          decided to give it to you after ive
          collected the inheritance  you can
          take that one if you want  but
          theres another copy
          
                    dulaney
          that wasnt the deal
          
                    rebecca
               provoking him
          so sue me
               as cold as ice
          things have changed  i think you
          should go home  and after you leave
          i see no reason for us to ever have
          contact again
          
                    dulaney
               growing angrier
          im not leaving without that tape
          
                    rebecca
          dont push me frank  i might lose
          my temper and send it out just for
          spite
          
dulaney loses control
          

                                                            102

                    dulaney
          you fuckin bitch
          
he grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall
rebecca struggles but it is little use  he is a man consumed
with rage  dulaney continues to smash her into the wall

rebecca reaches onto the desk  lifts up a fountain pen and
stabs it into dulaneys shoulder at the base of his neck
dulaney screams and lets go  rebecca starts to runs into the
living room  dulaney follows


int  living room  night

dulaney catches rebecca  grabs her  spins her around 
then backhands her across the face knocking her to the ground
in the bg the video of them in bed plays on the screen
dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair  he
repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor

                    mans voice
          let her go
          
dulaney stops  he looks behind him

his pov

standing in the bedroom doorway is dr paley  he is holding a
gun at dulaney

dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his
feet his hand holding the wound on his shoulder  a short
breathless laugh drifts out of dulaney as he starts to put it
all together  rebecca stands up holding her head as she tries
to catch her breath

                    dr paley
               to rebecca
          are you alright
          
rebecca nods  her face hardens

                    rebecca
          youve got to kill him alan
          
                    dr paley
          what
          

                                                            103

                    dulaney
          shes right paley  youve got to
          kill me  she doesnt have to 
          shes free  she cant be tried
          again  but you you planned it with
          her  you supplied the coke  youre
          an accessory to murder

                    rebecca
          shoot him
          
paley struggles to make a decision  the gun shakes in his
hand  suddenly the whole scheme becomes clear to dulaney

                    dulaney
          dont you see what shes doing  she
          needs you to kill me  shes planned
          it that way from the start  thats
          why she phoned me tonight
          
                    dr paley
          you called him
          
                    rebecca
          no  hes lying
          
                    dulaney
          hows it supposed to work rebecca
          you and paley celebrate your victory
          you get me over here and provoke a
          fight so he has to rush in and save
          you  but then hes given himself
          away as your accomplice  now he has
          to kill me
               to paley
          after that i figure shell tell the
          police that you broke in  that you
          were crazed because we humiliated you
          in court
          
                    rebecca
          dont listen to him  cant you see
          hes trying to turn you against me

                                                            104

                    
                    dulaney
               continuing to
                paley
          heres the good part  the truth dies
          with me and she turns states
          evidence against you  it wont
          matter what you say  no one will
          believe your version  youve
          already discredited yourself in
          court  youll go away forever and
          shell have the money all for
          herself  shes played us both
          perfectly
          
paley is becoming more and more confused  dulaney moves
towards him  paley lowers the gun slightly

                    rebecca
          alan listen to me  if you dont
          kill him its over  everything we
          did will be for nothing
          
                    dr paley
          shut up rebecca
          
                    dulaney
          shes good isnt she  but maybe with
          you its the real thing
               points to the
                screen
          im sure all those nights she was
          fuckin me she was thinking of you
          
confusion crowds paleys mind

                    dulaney
          im sure that every orgasm she had
          with me was faked
          
                    dr paley
          thats enough
          
                    dulaney
          i mean she only screwed me two or
          three times a night because she had
          to  im sure she didnt enjoy it
          
                    rebecca
               softly
          i love you alan  you have to
          believe i love you  kill him  kill
          him and we can be together forever
          

                                                            105

                    dulaney
          thats right she loves you  just
          like she loved roston and marsh and
          me  dont be a fool  youre nothing
          to her  the second you pull that
          trigger shell turn on you
          
betrayal fills paleys face  his eyes fill with tears
          
                    dr paley
               to rebecca
          i loved you
          
                    rebecca
               tense

          everything to me
               she moves closer
          give me the gun  give me the gun and
          ill do it for you
          
paley stares at her  his mind races  pain fills his face as
he fights to make a decision  suddenly his face tenses  he
starts to raise the gun at dulaney  then just as suddenly he
turns it on rebecca and fires

the bullet hits rebecca in the chest  the force blows her off
her feet

paley stares at her blankly  he slowly lowers the gun and
drops it to the floor then staggers over to rebecca

on rebecca

she stares up through glazed dead eyes

paley takes her pulse  he breaks down weeping over her body
his tears signaling to dulaney that she is dead


ext  rebeccas house  later  night

police cars are lined up outside their red lights flashing


int  rebeccas living room  night

members of the police force along with forensic people go over
the area  dulaney sits on the couch  he looks indifferent 
as if all emotion has been sucked out of him  troxell is
beside him taking notes  dulaney looks up

a bodybag on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room


                                                            106

dulaney follows it with his eyes  cardenas enters from the
bedroom  they lock eyes

                    cardenas
          paleys confessed to the whole thing
          its like hes got no will to live
          now that shes gone
               thinks for a moment
          she almost got away with it  ironic
          huh  do you believe in karma frank
          
dulaney doesnt answer

                    cardenas
          well  call it what you want  fate
          destiny  we usually get what we
          deserve in the end
          
a beat  dulaney looks at him wearily
          
                    dulaney
          can i go
          
                    cardenas
               to troxell

                    troxell
          yeah
          
                    cardenas
          then you can go
          
dulaney gets up and starts for the door  cardenas watches him

                    cardenas
          frank
          
dulaney turns around slowly  cardenas reaches into his
raincoat pocket and take out a vhs tape

                    cardenas
          i found this video in her room  it
          has your name on it
          
the two men lock eyes  there is a long silence between them
dulaney waits for cardenas next move

                    cardenas
               holding it out
          i assume its yours
          
dulaney knows that cardenas has seen it  a hint of a grateful
smile shows on his face  he takes the tape


                                                            107

                    dulaney
          thanks
          

ext  rebeccas house  night

a light rain falls  dulaney walks out and heads towards the
street  he stops  looks back at the condo  then walks down
the street towards his car
