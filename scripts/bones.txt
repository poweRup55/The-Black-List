			ext blackstone ave  2000  night

            dark night  most street lights shot out  just one or two of
            the eerie vapor lights left on the block

            a middleaged africanamerican man carries his single bag of
            groceries  the man listens and watches carefully as he
            negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the
            street

            we wont see his face until he reaches the next pool of
            light but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear

            moving down the block all shops abandoned  broken windows 
            rats  the man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out
            and crumpled in an abandoned doorway  its the crackhead we
            saw mumbling himself into the nodoff zone  hes still
            faintly singing a part of the bones song as the man passes 
            he stops in the light

            and we see its shotgun 20 years of fear and loathing etched
            on his face  he freezes listening for a second to the
            crackheads wheezing mumbles  no  its something else hes
            listening for  and hearing

            from behind him a low wheezy sound like some huge panting
            dog  he stops  and it stops  he walks on and it follows

            as he hurries to the next pool of light and safety his ears
            strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily
            following

            suddenly he hears that panting closer and closer until its
            nearly right behind him  he starts running though he hasnt
            yet seen anything  only heard the mongrel hot on his heels

            follow with shotgun

            as he stumbles careens and wheezes through the streets and
            alleys terrified  winded he eventually stops his hand
            trembling into his shopping bag seeking a weapon

            and we see the building hes paused beside bones place 
            pockmarked by age  like the face of some furious old man

            now he can almost feel the dogs breath on the back of his
            neckshotgun spins whipping a bottle of milk out of the
            bag and hurling it into the darkness behind him

            the bottle smashes against the wall of bones building  for
            a second silhouetted against the now whited wall the tall
            too tall shape of the skinny black dog

            without waiting to see what he hit shotgun takes off running
            to reach his building across the street  the sound of the
            dogs nails skittering across the street right behind him 

             and he just makes it

            stairs

            ext shotguns building  continuous

            from outside his third floor window we see shotgun run into
            his apartment slam down his groceries on the counter grab
            an old rifle from under his bed and hurry to his open window

            int shotguns apartment  continuous

            he scanaims out his window across the street to the now
            desolate building where bones once lived  finger on the
            trigger eyes scanning the shadows for the dog  mumbling
            quotations from the bible about canines some of which are
            handwritten and taped up on his walls and mirrors

                                shotgun
                      thou shalt not bring a dog into the
                      house of the lord thy god for they are
                      an abomination  deuteronomy

            suddenly something moving on the empty street catches his
            eye

            his angle on

            the black dog emerging from the shadows in the street  our
            first good look at the beast  long clawed paws all teeth
            and tongue and a curved bony rib cage like it hasnt eaten in
            20 years

            its long black head seems almost to be throbbing moving
            from within almost subliminally we see a weirder demonic
            more skeletal dog face just beneath the black fur or is it
            just the buzzing light from the vapor lamps

                                shotgun contd
                          as he aims his rifle
                      they return at evening snarling like
                      dogs and prowling the city psalms 59
                      vs 6

            the dog stands in the pool of light offering a perfect shot 
            shotgun smiles aims and then fires making 

            ext bones building  continuous

             a direct hit  but the dog doesnt move  unfazed  the
            bullet must have missed  or else gone right through him

            the longfaced dog just looks up at shotgun like it was
            laughing at the fool  and has been for years

            shotgun reaches for the spilled groceries on the counter 
            shoving aside bread and canned goods and other edible
            necessitates and finds a halfdozen boxes of rifle rounds

            he calmly reloads the rifle  and the sound of another shot
            echoes in the night over

            ext around the corner  continuous

            two frat boys jason and palmer driving a too nice car in a
            too bad part of town  palmer at the wheel while jason makes

            he turns around and sees behind them two guys standing on
            the far corner  ones on the phone

            they exit the car looking all around them with more than a
            touch of paranoia

            as they walk nervously down the block they join the two on
            the corner  its stank and weaze both 17

            look on his face palmer would rather forget about it

                      dont worry  its just round the corner

            ext blackstone ave  continuous

            they walk around the corner and enter a bleak block with at
            least half the lots burnt out

                                palmer
                      is it too late for me to officially
                      register my growing certainty that this
                      is an extremely bad idea

            farther down in the center of one side of the street stands
            a particularly ominous abandoned building  bones building

            jason ignites a zippo and they see one loose brick  jason
            pulls it out and behind it sees a glint of baggy

                                jason
                      easy as pie  and twice as tasty

            he opens the bag  its filled with rock cocaine

            angle  across the street

            on the third floor shotgun sits in his straightbacked chair
            in front of the open center window drinking coffee cradling
            his rifle on his lap  sees the frat boys picking up their
            shit  then he looks out at bones tomb

            dark blank windows staring back at him the buildings front
            door covered with broken vertical boards with jagged pieces
            missing looking almost like a jackolanterns grin

            shotgun then looks back down at the boys below  from behind
            them they hear their car alarm go off

                                palmer
                      someones screwing with the car

            but from the other way come cops in a plain wrap car a hand
            reaching out and putting the spinning blue light on the roof 
            no place to run  no place to hide for the boys  they reach
            for the door of the shuttered building  and it opens

                                shotgun
                      yo  you two get the hell away from
                      there

            but they ignore him and disappear into the darkness inside
            the gaping maw of bones building

            shotgun shakes his head sitting back down cradling his
            rifle

                                shotgun contd
                      fools

	int bones building  continuous

            inside the boys huddle in the darkness behind the door
            waiting for the cops to pass

            the boys look around the decayed gothic interior lit only by
            the eerie glow of the sodium vapor lights outside

            what we last saw as the ornate 70s luxury lobby in bones
            day is now  a horror show

            walls torn and stained  mold grows in patches on the wall
            and ceiling  huge cobwebs hang  the furnitures all broken

            a gnawing tearing sound makes palmer spin a rat sticks its
            head up through the rotted cushions of the couch

                                palmer
                      lets get the hell outta here

            jason shushes him as the room is filled with the flashing
            blue light of the cop car trawling slowly down the street

            from inside they hear the sounds of a car door slamming and
            cop shoes walking

                                jason
                      oh fuck cmon

            he gropes his way in the darkness to a staircase  palmer is
            right behind him as they slip upstairs deeper into the
            gaping darkness of the abandoned building

            while below them the door opens and cop lights and cop voices
            penetrate the gloom

                                older cop
                      not going in there  waste o time

                                younger cop
                      i saw em go in

            and from the boys high vantage point up the stairs we see
            the first cop walk in with flashlight drawn

            while inside the cop car  close angle

            all we see are two meaty hands unwrapping a waxpaper covered
            pork chop sandwich  the cop face in shadow brings the drip
            ping sandwich up over his huge belly towards his face

            inside bones building

            the frat boys hold their breath while rats run across their
            feet  jason slamming his hand over palmers mouth to keep
            him from screaming

            down below

            the young plainsclothes cop steps deeper into the room and
            shines his flashlight at the stairwell

            upstairs

            jason pulls the reluctant palmer further up the stairs to
            the third floor as below them they hear the cop coming up

            jason pulls palmer through the nearest door and into

            int jimmy bones old pad  continuous

            the rotted remains of what was once jimmy bones master
            bedroom  the room he was betrayed and slaughtered in

            downstairs

            the cop begins to head up the stairs  visible behind him
            down through the open front door is the plain wrap car  the
            older cop inside mouth fulla sammich loudly says

                                fat older cop
                      forget it  no way theyre in there 
                      trust me  ive been working down here
                      twenty years  no one goes in there

            from the fat older cops pov

            we watch as the younger cop returns to the car giving up 
            and when he climbs in we reverse and reveal who the older
            cop is lupovich the cop who helped kill bones

            but hes decayed and expanded into a hank quinlanlike
            mountain of corrupt cop flesh  too many pork chop
            sandwiches

                                lupovich

            int jimmys old pad  same

            from upstairs the boys see the blue light of the cop car
            recede as the car pulls away down below

            palmer reaches for the door  he wants out  but in the
            darkness he cant find the door

                                palmer
                      gimme some light

            behind jason we see a shape a shadow a tall silhouette a
            manshaped deeper darkness forming within the darkness

            jason lights his lighter  and in the flickering we see
            behind him that this room now contains a portion of hell

            its not just the chipped paint and peeled rotted wall paper
            or the cracks and gaps in the broken old ceiling mirror

            all surfaces seem to be a swirling shifting pattern in which
            we can dimly and subliminally make out faces as if people
            were trapped on the surface of things  exactly like the
            glimpse we had beneath the world when jimmy died

            the floor the walls the furniture everything in it  made
            out of the wracked and twisted devouring and devoured forms
            of dead souls  their faces hollow pleading eyes and howling
            mouths visible like flowing grain in wood

            and in the center of it all stands the dark silhouette of
            bones impossibly tall and thin stretching malevolently out
            across the room like a living shadow

            but the boys dont see this as theyre finding the door  we
            see bones shadow arching towards them while they fumble

            palmer finally opens the door to the sound of a deep rumbling
            growl from the darkness on the other side  and in the open
            door stands the black dog

            they boys jump back  but breathes easy

                                palmer contd
                      just a dog

            and the black dog leaps up at them  teeth flying right for
            the boys throats  and in the flickering ghastly light we
            see its demon face breaking through

            the dog sinks his long teeth into jasons arm  he flails and
            drops his lighter still lit on the floor

            as soon as he does the dog releases jason and disappears as
            fast as it appeared back into the darkness

            the two kids panic jason shaking and bleeding looking
            around waiting for the dog or something else to attack
            seeing back through the doorway into the room from hell

            behind them we see that tall manshaped shadow  the bones
            shadow is oblivious to the two frantic boys intent only on
            the small flickering flame of the lighter still burning where
            it fell against the lower wood paneling of the wall

            a thin trail of black smoke as the flame barely begins to
            catch on the chipped leadfilled flammable paint

            the boys run

            and stumble down the hall away from the horror while back in
            the room the bonesshadow watches as the lighter flickers and
            dies out  other than a slightly blackened spot the wall is
            unburned

            the black shadow shudders in rage arches back and hooooowls
            in frustration its mouth abnormally large  the shadowy head
            snaps in the direction of the boys  ready to vent its
            wrath and for a subliminal second we see in the head the
            hellish face of jimmy bones

            the boys round the second floor landing and fly down the last
            flight of stairs 
            jasons foot breaks through a rotted floorboard and for a
            second it appears as though rotten hands are just below the
            stairs grabbing at his foot and leg

            he yelps in terror pulling his foot back as they continue
            towards the front door the bonesthings wooferbusting howl
            roaring down from the third floor

            the sheer infinite adrenaline rush

            of pure horror and the desperation to survive drags the boys
            off the stairs as they tear across the floor and hurl
            themselves out the front door into the night air jason

            across the street shotgun sees the boys in the doorway 
            then as a nearly dead vapor light suddenly flickers and
            comes to life the shadows created on bones building make it
            look almost like a demonic face

            gulping for air laughing hysterically at their survival the
            frat boys pause  jason sits back on his butt checking his
            wound  the doorway behind them just a black hole in space

                                palmer
                          bumping fists together
                      damn bro  that was close

            then suddenly

            something  it happens so fast were not sure just what grabs
            suckspulls palmer back into the black doorway hole

            jason still prone tries to crawl away but whatever got his
            friend now sucks him in too  his fingernails scraping along
            the stoop in frenzied desperation

            with shotgun

            when he hears the boys pitiful screams and whimpers from
            across the street he leaps to his feet and tries to see into
            the dark of the doorway across the street  but he can only
            hear what is happening to the unlucky frat fellas

            moans and the sound of flesh torn and swallowed and their
            last dying screams

            up and down the block

            the screaming reverberates  faces appear in some windows 
            while in others shades are drawn and the lights go out

            back with shotgun

                      revelation 22 vs 15

            tears welling in his eyes that he angrily flicks away

            looking at the building

            it still has the shadowy lookshape of jimmy bones now
            shifting again as the vapor light on the street sputters out
            again plunging the street into near darkness  the body of
            palmer no longer visible below

            when he looks back the building seems just an old building
            again  then theres movement in an upper window catching
            his eye  shotgun sees the tall shadowy silhouette

            the figure is elongated cant tell if it is a man or the
            distorted shadow of a man  it beckons to shotgun

            shotgun

            just tightens his grip on his rifle and speaks as if the
            shadowy thing across the street could hear him

                                shotgun contd
                      you still mad  still want me  come on
                      and get me

            the shadow

            shakes its head  as if it can hear him  and again mutely
            beckons to him

            on shotgun

                                shotgun contd

                      i can see it now  the first major urban
                      theme park  village ghetto land 
                      kinda like legoland but made entirely
                      from broken glass hypodermic needles and
                      crack vials  totally eticket

            tia checks out the second floor while bill and maurice
            continue up the stairs to the third floor  bones old crib

            with bill and maurice

            behind them barely subliminal glimpse  a manshaped darker
            shadow within a shadow  bill feels a cold wind from nowhere 
            and hears a whispery sound seemingly carried in the breeze

                                hollow echoes
                      it aint eh money  its the big fat
                      floating what if

                                bill

                                hollow echoes

                      him

                                bill

                      take who where  what you smokin

            below on the second floor

            tias checking out a bedroom  hears a light tinkling in a
            closet  she opens it empty except a row of rusty metal
            hangers holding the moldy remains of bones old suits

            downstairs in the basement  patrick

            is there a flashlight poking around  trying to find the
            metal knob to turn on the gas  eerie as hell down there

            out of the corner of our eyes we see a shadow moving
            looming  a scurrying sound and patrick turns his flashlight
            in the other direction we glimpse a bloated rat

            behind him the shadow we glimpsed grows elongates  patrick
            notes another door  this one padlocked  sensing someone or
            something behind him patrick turns with the flashlight

            nothing there  but the bonesshadow is behind him again 
            again he feels something and again he turns the flashlight
            around nothing

            except the bonesshadow is againbehind him

            shaking it off patrick heads for the old heater pulling out
            matches to light the pilot as bonesshadow stays behind him

            bones pov

            bones watches as patrick reaches around the gas heater  when
            patrick strikes a match head the bonesshadow moves even
            closer to him as patrick reaches in and lights the pilot

            when patrick steps back bonesshadow grows and stretches
            spreading like an ink stain reaching across to where the
            pilot flame flickers

            in profile the shadowmouth blowsbut no breath comes out 
            the flame doesnt even flicker

            bones tilts his head back and lets loose an eerie bellow of
            frustration in a subliminal flash we see a howling mouth
            bigger than any human mouth howling within the shadowface

            the sound echoes all through the basement rooms as patrick
            walks back upstairs  he slaps a nearby plumbing pipe

                                patrick
                      go on old pipes groan all you like 
                      just please dont burst  that i cant
                      afford

            follow with bones pov

            as disappointed in whatever he hoped blowing out the furnace
            pilot would do he steps into the rusted remains of the old
            elevator and the pov begins to levitate

            int elevator  continuous

            bones pov rises straight up as if still in a working
            elevator  it rises and we follow up from the basement to the
            empty first floor past the second floor to

            the third floor

            where were still inside floating in the elevator cage 
            then the pov moves through the metal bars and floats towards
            bill whos approaching the door of the room where jimmy
            died

            as bill reaches to open it bones pov floats closer  and
            closer  right up on bills back now  bill feeling the hairs
            on his neck suddenly rising  then he hears

                                hollow echoes
                      go on  it wont kill you

            bill turns around to check with maurice

                                bill
                      you had to hear tha

            but maurice is gone  and he doesnt see the shadow there
            behind him  bill leans in to the door listening

                                hollow echoes
                      i aint gonna be the only one with this
                      niggers blood on my hands

                                bill
                      what the f

            a hand jolts him from behind  he spins  its just maurice

                                maurice

                                bill
                      nothing  contact paranoia  must be
                      buggin from hanging with you

            they turn to walk back down  maurice stops to relight his
            joint when the bonesshadow reaches out to grab his wrist

            but its no good  the shadow hand passes right through
            maurice pauses for an instant as if he felt something

            maurice lights his roach and the match burns closer and
            closer to his fingertips  then singes them and he drops the
            match  maurice then heads downstairs after bill

            the shadow remains behind staring at the still burning match
            on the wooden floor  he bends down staring intently as if
            willing it to burn his hands urging it on the flame
            suddenly rising  but then the match sputters harmlessly out 
            the shadow turns back towards the boys downstairs

            while on the second floor

            tia explores the rest of the floor  hears a sound like a
            whimpering from behind another door

            she slowly eases open the door then jumps back  inside the
            dog  it growls low and mean the black fur on the back of
            its neck rising  its eyes burning too red and bright

            tia freezes

            the dog growls deeply at her  and as he does we see the
            bones shadow rising behind her  it seems to lean in and over
            her and the dog stops growling

            tia cautiously holds her hand outstretched with the burger
            for the dog to smell

            bones shadow from lingers behind her perhaps simply
            enjoying the first sight in hellish eons of a beautiful girl

                                tia
                      howd you get locked in here  and for
                      how long  poor baby

            the dog leaps up  but not to rip her throat out  instead it
            snatches the burger and wolfs it down in one gulp

                                tia contd

                      every street two streets  theres a
                      whole city a whole world kinda beside

                      hordes of dead people shambling around
                      us  fingers rotting off

                                cinnabar
                      maybe  but theres an invisible wall a
                      fabric that kinda keeps things separate

                                patrick
                      lucky thing

                                cinnabar
                      yeah  but when something bad happens
                      something really bad  the wall breaks

            an old woman

                      shit
                          now to mauriceat camera
                      bones was awrright  he was solid  and
                      then one day he just wasnt around no
                      more  dont pay to ask too many
                      questions round here

            int the building  that night

            upstairs inside what was once bones bedroom  beneath the
            cracked ceiling mirror bill lies on the airmattress  hes
            listening with headphones to a minidisk player

            eyes closed head nodding to the beat  around him we see
            something strange  the room shifts

            its the same room  but changed  it looks like it did when
            the frat boys were trapped in here  or in the instant after
            jimmys death all surfaces seem to be a swirling shifting
            pattern in which we can dimly make out faces as if people
            were trapped on the surface of things

            then the faces and bodies begin to step out of their surfaces
            and into the room  

            so as bill eyes still closed rocks to the hypnotic beats in
            his headphones we see the room around him begin to fill with
            figures

             all twisted dead human forms emerging out of the surfaces
            of floor and walls  we hear a low murmur of ghost voices
            different languages

            and as the track ends the sound cuts through bills
            headphones and his eyes snap open

            but the room is empty  and completely normal  bill pulls

            the sounds return fainter and form above  bill looks up
            and for a fraction of a second in the mirror bill sees the
            crowded eerie hell of the other version of the room

            bill jolts out of bed and to the door whips it open and
            someone dark looms right there  but its just patrick

            the bathroom is entirely wood lined like some 70s hot tub
            paradise  the room dominated by a large two person tub

            tia lights four small scented candles on the counter  the
            wind through the open window blows the curtains  she shuts
            the window and then steps gingerly into the steaming bathtub

            she lies down in the bath with her back to the door  the
            four candles throwing varying shadows of her

            then one of the shadows becomesthe shadow of bones  all
            its attention is focused on one lit candle  the one closest
            to the curtain

            slowly the bones shadows fingers start to caress the
            curtain to make it move ever so slowly closer and closer to
            the candle  the drapery reaches out straining straining
            towards the candle flame

            tia soaks with her eyes closed enjoying the moist heat

            bones shadow fingers more and more urgently drawing the
            flame towards the curtain the curtain towards the flame 
            and soon the corner of the drape just reaches the little
            flickering flame  and in an instant the drape is on fire

            patrick and bill still talking in front of the bedroom down

            drapes from the wall and throws them into the bathtub

            her name  or just the wind

            jumps as a door to her left flies open

            perfect  old a little faded but clean  no stains 

            with a smile of satisfaction he rolls the cleaner out of the
            room and closes the door behind him  we remain in the room

            angle on

            the now clean carpet  suddenly we see glutinous red liquid
            seeping back up through the shag until the stain is right
            where it was  wet and fresh  then we see it spread and
            move in the shape of a body and the path by which it was
            dragged out of the room

            the door opens again and patrick steps in to show off the
            freshly painted room clean rug to cinnabar and the others 
            hes brought up short by the sight of the stain

                      must be something seeping through  from
                      the floor

            they roll the carpet back thinking there must be something
            on the floor  the floor beneath the carpet is wet too but
            cant tell if its from the rug or viceversa

            he puts his hand down on the wood  a low rhythmic rumbling

                                patrick contd
                      do you feel that

            the others place their hands on the floor

                                tia
                      yeah  its  throbbing

                                bill
                      like a heartbeat

                                maurice
                      like a heartbeatlike a love beat 
                      listen to the di franco twins there 
                      just the plumbing or something fool

                                patrick
                      maybe theres a pipe underneath the
                      floor  it leaked and stained

            they just look at him

                                patrick contd
                      you got a better explanation

            int basement  later

            patrick and the others in the basement listening to some very
            strange sounds groans thumps throbs

                                maurice
                      sounds like we got the invisible scratch
                      piklz hiding in our pipes

            patrick traces the piping with the wrench he comes to a
            triple corner where three small pipes all come together

                                patrick
                      i think these bring the water down from
                      the bathroom  into this

            a larger pipe that goes down the wall and disappears beneath
            the floor  the thumping sounds emanate from here  he puts
            his finger along the seam of the joint  he pulls it away
            red

                                patrick contd
                      check it out  the same shit that was in
                      the carpet  told you it was from the
                      plumbing

            he lifts the wrench to tighten the seal  the metal groans 
            then snaps  sending a thick spray of foul smelling red
            sludge shooting out of the seam right into patricks face

                                patrick contd
                      damn i knew these pipes were wacked

            he turns the wrench the other way retightening  the sound
            seems to move now through the piping  then the red sludge
            sprays out of the next three joints smearing the others

            the pounding throbbing sounds begin to bounce around the
            room as if something were actually moving through the pipes
            until it returns to the central large pipe and moves down
            disappearing beneath their feet

            then a rasping bark calls their attention  bones the dog
            sits by the padlocked door panting  grinning

            patrick smashes the old lock with the large wrench and opens
            the door to reveal another set of stairs leading down into a
            deeper storm cellar where the sound disappeared

            int storm cellar stairs  continuous

            as they go the temperature drops  a cold damp sheen
            appears on their skin  then comes a thick glutinous buzzing
            sound

                                tia
                      what is that

            flies  the stairway walls are thick with furry black flies

                                maurice
                          stopping
                      ugh  muchos moscos man  this is too
                      much

                                bill
                      just some flies

                                maurice
                      some flies  i think this qualifies as
                      way more than some

                                cinnabar
                      what a smell 

                                maurice
                      hey what you expect  where theres
                      smoke theres fire  and where theres
                      flies theres shit

            the stairs end in a dark damp dirt cellar and the remnants
            of the terminus of the old elevator shaft

                                maurice contd
                      oh yeah i guess this would be that space
                      that was so perfect for a recording

                      no one could hear shit up on the street

            behind them the dog is digging in the dirt  furiously

                      yeah perfect  really excellent  we can

                      hear us scream  be afraid

            theyre not paying any attention to the dogs incessant
            digging  only cinnabar is  shes staring at it

                                cinnabar
                      oh god

            and she sees in the deepening muddy hole at the dogs paws
            at first glimpses and then the full view a rotted human
            corpse  really just a skeleton  with something sticking out
            of its chest  cinnabar shrieks while the guys try very hard
            to act real cool

            cinnabar sees something  bright color beneath the body 
            bends down to a piece of cloth poking out from beneath the
            bones

            the dog growls viciously as she reaches down to the scrap of
            color poking up  tia restrains the hound the best she can

            are gone  then maurice hurriedly bends down and while
            holding his face back away from the stench attempts to pull
            bones ring off his finger  but its stuck

            he tugs again harder and rips the corpses finger off

            the lock broken the door stands ajar  and as the dog gorges
            upstairs something very strange is happening down here

            flesh is growing on the bones  bit by bit red wet strips
            of muscle and flesh appear and spread over the corpse

            the shadow looks down at his semireconstituted corpse  it
            almost looks like him minus the skin  but it still has a
            long ways to go  still mere strips of muscle and flesh on
            the skeleton

            over the low bass of their hymnsinging her voice cuts in 
            uncoiling and rising like smoke in the air its a beautiful
            voice and it does seem to open a window in the air

            its cold in the place  and spooky  so she doesnt mind

            suddenly the curtains fly open  and pearls voice suddenly
            stops and the flame on the candle shoots up scorching the
            ceiling before returning to normal

            inquiring for each of them  each time the table says no 
            until there is only her left  an eerie pause

            the table starts bucking wildly  and suddenly pearls neck
            snaps back like its been caught in a whip

            her mouth opens and a low moan escapes  but sounds nothing
            like her voice  a deep wind through an organ tube with
            swarming bees and squealing hogs mixed in

            everyone around the table just stares at her in alarm

            as her eyes widen  go super close on her eyes and we see a
            reflection in her pupil not of the room she is in but the
            jimmys building twenty years ago

            int bones building  pastpresent

            intercut with her face back in the seance staring wide
            mouthed in her trance

            the sound of her heart pounds like the deepest dub track

            total dislocation for her as she sees jimmys old room as it
            was  but also sees it as it is now and with her daughter
            cinnabar lying underneath the covers of the big round bed

            and lying close beside her another figure beneath the
            covers

            whoever is there snuggles closer to cinnabar  she responds
            as he presses against her then wakes up

                                cinnabar
                          laughing low
                      cut it out

            but he doesnt  the movement beside her is undulant 
            strong erotic she almost gives into it  and still laughs
            as she says

                                cinnabar contd
                      no no patrick  stop

            the figure in the bed presses urgently against her in a
            rocking movement which catches her up in it  she cant help
            it she begins to respond to the urging behind her

            pearls eyes widen as the whole room shifts and becomes one
            fetid necropoliptic texture  the bed retains its shape but
            liquefies seems to become one with the floor and the walls
            all made of a kind of thick bloodymud in which the trapped
            faces and distorted limbs of the dead twist and moan

            meanwhile on that strange bed the figure behind cinnabar
            seems to wrap soft limbs around her locking her in embrace

                                cinnabar contd
                      cut it out

            but it doesnt cut out  it builds  strong  erotic 
            insistent  she almost gives in to it

                      no no patrick  stop

            but the movement is more insistent  and rougher  she starts
            to protest louder when she feels a hand or something steal
            across her mouth to muffle her objections

            pearl tires to reach across her vision to grab her daughter
            and help her but she cant

            int pearls parlor  continuous

            back at the seance pearls back is arched like a bass fiddle
            string bowed and then drops  released  back in her chair

            the instant shes returned to herself shes out of her chair
            and out the door

            int bones pad  continuous

            cinnabar struggles with something in the bed the covers
            pulled tight against her face she cant scream  she twists
            and wrenches herself about finally striking behind her with
            a flailing fist twists her face free and screams

            cinnabar looks wildly around the room  shes alone in the
            big bed  no one attacking her  and she sees patrick in the
            doorway  but then who  or what  was in the bed

            suddenly her mother yells from below

            below her mothers going nuts at the entrance pounding on
            the door and practically running over bill whos opening the

            cinnabar races down the stairs with patrick bewildered at
            her heels

            cinnabar runs out the door and straight into her mothers
            arms burying her face in the protective bosom of her mom

            pearl wraps her frightened daughter in her arms and turns her
            to home  pearl looks up at the boys standing stunned in the
            doorway

                                pearl

                      i couldnt wait to see your face when i
                      fixed it up

            its the building  freshly painted with the neon sign  but
            jeremiahs face shows nothing like what patrick expected 
            nothing but a horrified angry disgust

                                jeremiah
                      is this some kind of sick joke

            jeremiah is furious out of all proportions  some of the
            others on the block have stuck their noses out to see what
            the fuss is  then jeremiah comes eye to eye with pearl
            standing across the street watching worried out of her
            mind
			
			then he looks up and sees shotgun in the window  feeling
            trapped humiliated  he wants out of this street  out of
            those glances

            patrick frozen turned to stone by rage and hurt and shame

            another car pulls up  several young people inside  they
            look around a little dubiously

            lupovich turns but then spins back around with a 45 in his
            hand and its pointed at jimmys forehead  jeremiah didnt
            expect this  or did he

                                jeremiah

                      you heard the man  try it

            bones keeps his eye on him as he lights the lighter and takes
            a deep puff  then lets out a deep cloud of smoke

            his eyes go a bit glazed  and from his pov we see the room
            start to tilt on its axis as everything goes wobbly

            just then the door opens and pearl steps in distracting
            lupovich for an instant

            in one eternal crack fueled fastandslomo second jimmy
            sees his chance he pulls his razor but too slow 

            lupovich turns the razor no more than lightly slices his
            arm and he pulls the trigger on jimmy bones

            pumping three shots into jimmys abdomen knocking him to the
            ground  shotgun grabs his gun but too late  hes covered

                                mack

            bones is bleeding and still tripping bad

                      spread her like butter

            shotgun gently puts his hand on pearls mouth to quiet her  

            back in bones fuckedup pov

            looking down he sees his own blood pouring out a thick
            divine river of many colors  looking up they all stand
            wavering above him hungry demons their voices distorting

                                lupovich contd
                      get his razor  i aint gonna be the only
                      one with this niggers blood on my hands

            mack plucks bones silver razor right out of his hands

                                lupovich contd
                      take the gloves off  everybody leaves a
                      print  we hang out together  or we hang
                      separately  cut him  and cut him good

            eddie pulls his glove off and enjoys himself as he shoves the
            razor into jimmy

                                mack
                      what it is  what it will be muthafucka

                                lupovich

                      you cut him or i shoot you  make your
                      choice

            jeremiah gets down near bones  bones stares right into his
            eyes as his life blood pours freely weakly lifts his arm to
            his best friends face

                                bones
                      jay birdhelp melike brothers

            jeremiah feels lupovichs gun behind his head  hears it
            cocked

                                jeremiah
                      sorry my brother

                                bones
                      since we was just grasshoppers

                                jeremiah
                      you always told me its a dog eat dog
                      world

            and he thrusts bones razor right between the ribs  bones
            eyes tighten but never lose their lock on jeremiahs eyes 
            his mouth moves as if hes trying to speak  instead he
            spits a bog of blood right into jeremiahs face

            a shaken jeremiah hands the bloody razor to shotgun

                                jeremiah contd
                      just do it  he wont even feel it

            bones eyes bore into shotguns  shotgun hesitates  eyeing
            his gun on the floor feeling the one on the back of his neck
             calculating his chances

            then shotgun slices him  bones flinches he definitely still
            feels it  shotgun hands the razor back to eddie

                                lupovich
                      now you girlie

                                pearl
                      i wont

                                lupovich
                      same deal all around  or die with him

            she takes the razor and slowly kneels beside her dying lover 
            her hands trembling  theres no way she can do it  lupovich
            brings the gun to the back of her head

                                pearl
                      i cant  i wont  go ahead  shoot me 
                      ill be better off

            bones reaches one hand round the back of her neck weakly
            storking her there and with his other hand bones takes
            her wrists and pulls her hand towards him burying his razor
            in his heart  his eyes roll back and his hand falls away and
            hes gone

            she drops her hand from the razor which remains sticking out
            of his chest a river of blood pouring from around it

            bones pov

            as his spirit rises and rises up to the ceiling looking
            down on them as they stand watching his body bleed to death

            pearl just stands there completely covered in his blood 
            then in a frantic daze tears her dress off  jeremiah gently
            takes her bloody dress

            from above bones can hear them speaking below but its as
            if they were speaking far away

                                jeremiah
                      too risky to take him outside  take him
                      down to the storm cellar and bury him 
                      and get rid of this too
                          tosses pearls bloody dress
                      let this whole damn building be his tomb

            shotgun and lupovich drag bones body out of the room
            leaving behind a deep wet blood stain in the shag carpet

            bones pov

            as he stares down in horror at all this  above him it seems
            he can see right through the ceiling to the night sky and a
            swirling light opening above his head

            now his pov

            is floating upward towards the light but then he looks

                                                               back down

            staring down at the sight of his body in a deep puddle of
            blood and his murderers removing his womans dress covered
            with is blood  as he sees this his and ours pov changes
            becomes darker yet clearer too sharp razor sharp as some
            softness perhaps life itself drains out of it  bones sees
            his best friend jeremiah and lupovich together dragging his
            body out the door leaving a thick wet stain behind him

            we can hear jimmys last wail of rage twist and distorts in
            the air becoming another deeper voice within the voice
            and then he and we plunge back down to the ground right to
            the dark wet stain in the carpet

            hit it and go down through an instants glimpse into the
            black sea beneath the foundation of the world

            necropolis  where space itself seems to be made of pale
            bloated gnawing writhing things  bodies perpetually
            devouring themselves and each other

            we see through this dogeatdog nightmare back out through
            the blood stain as through a key hole slowly closing

                      be cool  everybodys gonna get in

            patrick alternates between tending the crowd and throwing
            anxious glances down the block towards cinnabars home

            torn between exhilaration at seeing his dream come true and
            disappointment that cinnabars not there to share it

            people chomping to get in  across the street shotgun watches
            with dismay

            patrick hears voices down the street  looks up to see
            cinnabar walking towards the club  his smile freezes when he
            sees pearl right behind her  trying to stop cinn

                                pearl
                      ive seen things  in there  last

                                cinnabar
                      you said bad things hurt places  so
                      maybe good things heal them  good things
                      are happening here  maybe for the first
                      time ever  and maybe thats all it
                      takes

            pearl sees she cant stop cinn  any more than her mother
            could have stopped pearl when she was her age

                                pearl
                      i hope so child  i really hope so

            she can only watch as cinnabar gives patrick a big hug and
            follows him and the rest of the crowd into the club

            int the buildingclub  continuous

            the place is unfinished  but all the cooler for it  the bar
            is crude  cheap beer and jug wine  but the crowd dont
            mind  the place is alive  the boys are on fire

            a packed floor of dancers move as sound and image break beat

            the tune fades in a distorted way as he startstopsstart
            stops it forcing the sound backwards and forwards

            as maurice twiddles dials and distorts it all further 
            its spooky but way funky

            new angle  the black dog

            is now in the house too  walking through the throbbing
            crowd making a path right through them most of the dancers
            paying it no mind its just another part of the trippy
            scene  or do they even see it  we cant tell

            closer angle  on the dog

            and its singleminded concentration  staring straight ahead
            as it moves through the crowd towards maurice who for a
            second notices the dog coming but making nothing of it

            woman a dark lady who only has eyes for him

            dancing seductively drawing a crowd as she moves she stares
            straight ahead at maurice

            maurices joint droops from the corner of his mouth as he
            realizes yes this worldclass beauty is most definitely
            flirting with him

            the dark ladys still throwing him deep looks as she dances
            off the floor and then disappears up the stairs making
            maurice lean into bill

            he cant see her  or anything in the dark room  finally his

            is but when he does its not her beautiful dark features he
            sees but

            for the blink of an eye its totally blank face except for
            a huge mouth with liver lips pink gums and wolfen teeth 
            when it exhales out comes a noxious cloud of tiny insects 
            and then in the blink its the raging black dog leaping open
            jawed at his face

            maurice screams and drops his light in fright  he starts
            crawling towards the door and the overhead light switch 
            while trying to fend himself from the wailing teeth and claws
            of the canine creature

                      yo  maurice  where are you

            he tries a door  nothing  then he hears noises from the
            third floor

            int hallway  continuous

            patrick opens the remaining bedroom door on a nightmare
            tableaux  maurice lies in a pool of blood  his body shakes
            and shudders spasmodically as the dog feasts on his liver

            patrick starts for maurice but the dog growls to keep him
            back away from its precious food  patrick backs up a step 
            almost out of his mind with terror  he really loses it when
            the dog in slomo looks up and directly at him  it seems
            to be wearing maurices face and speaks with a twisted
            version of his maurices voice

            and before patrick can even freak the dog has returned to
            its normal dog face and it lunges at patrick taking a
            sizeable bite out of his arm

            patrick leaps back out the door with only a fast glance back
            at the thing in the room 

            the dog is not following him  its standing  over maurices
            remains  growling low it begins to shudder uncontrollably
            to bulge and ooze

            the gore covered dog quivers and swells and bulges and
            finally explodes into a shower of pulsating maggots flying
            all over the room and all over patricks eyes and in his
            mouth

            int basement  continuous

            the body is now done  it looks whole again  even strong and
            young  if still gray and cold until bones lies down curls
            up into the body filling the rejuvenated corpse with the
            vital life force of his vengeful rage

            bonesthe body opens his eyes stands up not tottering as
            before but filled with strength  he looks as good as new
            except for the tattered clothes

            on the dance floor  continuous

            the dancers cant hear patrick screaming or running down the
            stairs  theyre just groovin along to ill bill and the
            funk

            until the maggots start oozing and pouring through the
            ceiling onto their hair and faces and clothes into their
            drinks at the bar and onto their pizza slices

            then patrick comes into the room screaming and all hell
            breaks loose as the sight of him plus the maggots sends
            everyone tearing for the exits

            seeing his brother in terror bill slams the tone arm
            screeching the needle across the record leaving only the
            psycho drum and bass playing on the other channels of the
            mix

            meanwhile down below the freshly embodied bones studies the
            gas furnace  this time when he bends down to blow out the
            light  wooosh he blows it out  he reaches under the tank
            and the gas hisses out

            then he eyes his old razor on the floor  with a confident
            strong grip he picks it up and now finally 

            bones is back in business

            patrick looks across the chaotic room and sees cinnabar and
            tia cringing under a table  trapped there  bill in the
            doorway trying to get people out

            int basement  continuous

            at the top of the stairs leading up out of the sub basement
            bones smashes the bulb of the hanging light  then flips the
            light switch  the spark ignites the gas behind him  it
            causes a fiery explosion in the lower basement

            the fires light seems the very glow of hellfire behind bones
            as he marches up the stairs razor in his hand

            int dance floor  continuous

            patrick trying to stay low crawls his way to where his
            sister and cinnabar are trapped

            the floor  the room is filling with smoke

            bills helping those trampled in the rush to get out  bill
            himself bleeds badly from his neck

            patrick runs with cinnabar and tia toward the door  and as
            the smoke fills the room through the haze we see

            bones step into the room  his arm raised with the razor 
            and he flings it out like a boomerang the razor flies
            around the room

            it swoops down through the smoke at the remaining kids
            hacking at them through the smoke like some savage bird
            though it doesnt seem intent on slaughtering them but
            rather herding them out  bill and patrick pull cinnabar and
            tia out the door  theyre the last in the room

            suddenly the razor stops freezes in midair and zips back
            into bones waiting fist  just like a boomerang

            to watch the fire  in the distance sirens already wail 
            pearl holds her breath until she sees cinnabar safe

            looking for an instant they all see bones as the room is
            engulfed in flames  see him raise his fists in a rage  or
            is it in triumph  before his figure is obscured by falling
            debris

            sirens wail as fire trucks pull up and the men start
            unrolling a hose  but freeze at the cocking of the shotgun

            inches from shotguns face

                                bones
                      take a look at what i remember
                      brother

            his big brown eyes fill shotguns vision and in what now
            seem to be the gigantic pupils in bones eyes shotgun sees
            the old apartment and there it all is again and again

            shotgun sees himself hesitating almost risking it all and
            instead giving in stabbing bones  he cant look away 
            then bones closes his eyes  shotgun sobbing now

                                shotgun
                      i had no choice jimmy  what else could

                      you coulda died with me  died trying

            shotgun is cradling his weapon hands shaking  he points it
            at bones and pulls the trigger  bones doesnt even flinch as
            the pellets rip through him

                                bones contd
                      feel better

            bones impossibly long fingers hold his long rusty razor  he
            waves the razor in front of shotgun the rusty blade swinging
            free back and forth hypnotically with a rasping sound

                                bones contd
                      you gonna be free and clear shotgun 
                      all debts paid

            and then in one swift motion on the back stroke bones hand
            and razor slash across shotguns throat

            shotgun doesnt even have time to scream we just hear his
            breath and blood escaping from the new opening across his
            neck

            bones bends down and cradling his old friend whispers gently
            into his ear  singing perhaps  we cant quite hear

                                bones contd
                      see you on the other side brother

            bones gets up and moves around the room standing before the
            window and looking down at the neighborhood he used to own

            for a second he sees the old neighborhood everybody hanging
            out  then he blinks back to reality  he looks down the
            block and sees pearls reader and advisor sign

            that night we see a walking shadow  the long tall black clad
            bones  heading down his old block  alone

            as he moves his face changes at times demonic and intent 
            but periodically that shifts as if a mask slipping off to
            reveal a similar but different face below  more human lost
            pained confused and we see why

            from bones fucked up undead pov

            the dark and desolate street he walks down keeps flashing for
            brief instants into the street of twenty years ago

            one moment people nodding to him waving blowing kisses
            and then suddenly its the empty burnt block it is now

            bones face shifts cracking one second the hungry ghost 
            the next hes the old bones who once ruled this hood

            he sees down the block the old palmistry sign  its
            pearls place  for a second the face of the real jimmy
            bones triumphs and he smiles  then hears voices behind him

            stank and weaze  they see a tall thin figure in some very
            fine looking long duster

            suddenly out from the depths of his shadow flies the edge
            of bones razor and the blade slashes stank in the face 
            cutting a sideways smart aleck smile in his cheek

            weaze pulls a gun and shoots bones  bones jolts a little as
            the bullet imbeds itself in his stomach  but he takes it

            he watches her sashay to the other room where the juke box
            is  then bends over the mirror to do a new line

            from the other room the song changes  a deep menacing
            rolling funk number

                                mack

            he walks doing a little funky rufus thomas shuffle to the
            music  he steps into the club room  its dark lit only by
            the jukebox  but its empty

                      bitch  nobody walks out on eddie mack

            then he sees something  her legs on the floor sticking out
            behind the jukebox  he walks towards her slowly

            then sees the deepening pool of blood pouring across the
            floor right towards him  whatever happened to her shes
            beyond his help now

                                mack contd

            he whips around but cant see anyone  he strides defiantly
            back into the pool room

                      cmon  i take you all on

            mack picks up the two gold plated revolvers off the mirror
            with coke on it  suddenly all the coke moves on its own 
            the many grams piled there all merge into one pile

                                mack contd
                      what the

            he bends down to check it out  and the coke actually flies
            straight up off the mirror with the force of a punch and
            shoots like a fire hose straight up his nose

            he reels back choking  coughing  after having probably an
            ounce fly straight up his snotlocker  blood pouring out his
            nose  wobbly now

            he hears a low echoing laughter through the club and the
            sound of the cue ball breaking and sending pool balls
            spinning round the table

                                mack contd
                      whos there

            bones stands by the pool table under the overhanging light 
            he pulls out his razor and with one savage slice splinters
            the pool cue in two

                                mack contd
                      bones  jimmy bones  that you  youre

                      muthafuckin chest  and ill add a few
                      more

            he fires both guns at bones while backing away  bones dont
            feel a thing  he just picks up the mirror and holds it up
            facing mack

                                bones
                      this it  your bigass tidal wave

            mack sees his own terrified face staring back from the
            mirror belling hanging over his briefs coke and blood
            clotted on his face

                                bones contd
                      look like the waves long gone and
                      nothing but oil scum dead fish and yo
                      ugly ass left on the beach

            mack shoots wildly at bones  at the mirror  blasting it
            into shards

            but bones stands unscathed  and the shards of broken mirror
            do not fall to the ground  they remain in the air forming a
            living room swarm of razor sharp glass

            mack turns and runs waaaaay too fucking late as the swarm
            of glass shards fly like angry wasps right at him

            eddies thrown forward by the sheer force of them and is
            skewered throughout his body by all the glass fragments 
            pinned  face mashed against the wall

            mack pinned to the wall  bleeding from everywhere  snot
            bloodcoke mess drips out his nose  bones pulls macks head
            back by his hair and slides his razor into the half inch
            between his adams apple and the wall

            as the juke box changes song we hear a liquid slice and a
            scream slip into a gurgle

            bones long hands drip blood as he ties something to his
            belt  we dont quite see what it is not until we catch the
            sight of eddie macks headless remains pinned to the wall

            int police station  night

            bones walks the night with a slicing stride  his legs
            stretching too far and somehow covering long distance in an
            instant  and in slomotion like a nightmare marionette a
            walking shadow or some great black grasshopper

            and shoves it into the still talking mouth of mack

            ext southwest side  night

            bright loud summer night  blues coming from inside a blues
            bar the guy playing killin floor

            lupovich heads toward the armor building  from a distance
            he sees a young runner emerge from a passage on the farside 
            of the building then set off to meet his mark  lupovich
            heads for the passage the music following him

            lupovich looks around to make sure no one is watching  then
            slips into a passageway leading to the old slaughterhouse

            a scary walk through inky darkness scattered with broken
            glass and scurrying rats and lit only by the eerie red light
            spilling like blood out of the open door into the old
            slaughterhouse at the end of the way

            lupovich reaches the back right next to the old loading dock
            where the stilllivestock were unloaded  he enters the door
            disappearing into the red darkness

            int slaughterhouse building  continuous

            the room large and open soaked in the sodium vapor that
            streams through the tall windows from the streetlights

            there are a few blood rusted meat hooks still there backlit
            hanging from the ceiling  graffiti covers the walls with
            arcane tags and symbols  the floors are caked with a sticky
            grime turned black in the orange haze

            in the far corner burn three red votive candles  behind the
            candles lies a crumpled brown paper bag  the stash

            lupovich starts over to the corner twitching at the gross
            sound of his shoes sticking to the layers of old coagulated
            blood on the killing floor

            behind him framed for an instant int he doorway  a tall
            sharp shadow a walking razor  bones

            the walk is tense  somehow the music has followed him here
            and is echoing and wailing in the walls around him  he gets
            to the corner and reaching over the candles opens the top
            of the paper bag  jackpot  five ziplocks of the rocks

            he hears a noise  lupovich fumbles for his gun and at the
            same time reaches to snatch the stash bag  his wrist touches
            the candles flame and it burns

                                lupovich
                      shit  fuck

            he hears another noise a blade scraping on concrete right
            behind him  now the music blends with the echoing squeals of
            the hogs once butchered on the cutting line

            lupovich hears another noise a blade scraping on concrete
            right behind him  now the music blends with the echoing
            squeals of the hogs once butchered on the cutting line

            lupovich turns and there towering over him stands bones 
            and just as startling theres macks laughing severed head
            swinging from his belt

            lupovich can only choke on his terror and while his mouth is
            open bones shoves a glass pipe into it

            brandishing his razor bones packs a rock into the bowl and
            torches it  he holds the razor to lupovichs throat

                                bones
                          in macks voice
                      just try itgo aheadit wont kill
                      you

            lupovich trembling takes a massive hit of the crack deep
            into his lungs  the music and the sounds of the dying pigs
            attack him as the coke fills his lungs and then his blood and
            then his brain his eyes starting to bug

            bones then knocks the pipe from his lips and seals his hand
            over lupovichs mouth and nose  he cant exhale  the sounds
            get louder the grafted walls come alive

            bones removes his hand revealing lupovichs nose is fused
            shut and his mouth is simply gone the skin flat where the
            mouth used to be

            lupovichs gotta lung full of crack and no way to exhale 
            severed mack laughs insanely as he sees lupovichs eyes bulge
            as his lungs start to strain under the agony

            his frenzied suffocation is nothing but pure torture  while
            he is still kicking with the fear and the drug rush bones
            drags lupovich to the middle of the room

            with one arm bones lifts the fat cop up and hooks him to one
            of the meat hooks above

                                bones contd
                          in lupovichs voice
                      i aint gonna be the only one with this
                      niggers blood on my hands

            as lupovich squirms bones takes his blade and shoves it in
            just below lupovichs sternum  and a spray of blood paints
            bones and macks hanging head

            thick crack smoke emerges from the wound and floats foglike
            out of the chest cavity  bones then yanks the blade
            southward and slices the cops belly wide open

            we hear lupovichs guts spill out on the floor

                                macks severed head
                      was that really necessary  can you wipe
                      my fucking face  i cant see a goddamned
                      thing

            the dope smoke wafts in the room four feet off the floor 
            the song immolates itself  blood drips  and bones adds
            another weight to his belt

                                pearl
                      is it there

            she gets down on her hands and knees as patrick shines the
            light but after a few frantic moments of digging its
            clear

                                pearl contd
                      its gone  he got it

            just then the sound of tremendous strain and creaking of
            wood  and the ceiling starts to give way  they all scramble
            for shelter and then it gives way completely  completely
            blocking their way out  theyre trapped

                                bill
                      no

            they all look in every direction for some glimpse of hope 
            of a way out  there is none  then they hear behind them a
            resonant ding

            turning  their pov

            where moments before there was a gaping ruined elevator
            shaft there is now a fully functioning elevator just as it
            was in 1979 the doors opening to them in eerie slomo

            pearl starts towards the open car  the others trying to hold
            her back

                                pearl
                      its alright  let me

            she walks closer peering into the dark recesses of the
            elevator  maybe again a flash of visible movement inside

            closer ever closer until pearl almost entranced steps in 
            and once inside theres no one or no thing there  pearl
            is about to tell them its okay when suddenly the doors
            of the elevator slideslam shut

                                cinnabar
                      mama

            then they hear the elevator chain start to move and the
            elevator starts to rise  cinnabar screaming louder

            int the elevator  continuous

            pearl stands there summoning all her courage for what she
            knows shes going to have to face  watching the elevator
            arrow as it climbs to the number three

            int subbasement  continuous

            patrick and bill beat on the door and try to pry it open 
            then they try jamming jagged boards into the opening but
            still to no avail

            pearls pov

            as a moment later the car stops and the doors open onto

            int bones pad  continuous

            down to the last detail exactly as it was 22 years ago the
            night bones died  music playing the delfonics didnt i
            blow your mind this time  the only new detail are the
            dozens of candles romantically burning everywhere

                                bones os
                      hey baby

            pearl feels a soft touch on the back of her neck and spins
            finds jimmy right behind almost nuzzling her  his face
            hidden though in darkness  holding something in his hand
            behind his back

                                pearl 
                          still with her back to him

            she turns slowly and we dont know what to expect 
            something horrible or something beautiful

            finally shes face to face and its jimmy just as he was
            22 years ago  all traces of the demonic are gone  pearl
            melts as the delfonics swell jimmy holding her close

                                bones contd
                      i want you to do something for me baby

            we see what hes holding the dress  rotted and blood
            clotted and ruined

                                bones
                      i always loved you in this dress

            he holds it up for pearl to see and from

            her pov

            the dress is brand new and beautiful  shes finally
            entranced

            int the subbasement  continuous

            patrick bill and cinnabar have managed now to pry open the
            elevators outer doors  they step inside on the soft ashen
            ground and look up

            their pov

            the shaft goes all the way into eternity  but along the
            tacked walls they see hand and footholds put there for
            workers

                                patrick
                      we can climb out

                                bill
                      climb out to where

                      anywhere but here

            one by one they start to climb bill first  as they climb
            they become aware of light on the first floor level just
            ahead

            back in bones crib

            pearl steps into the frame to look at herself in a floor
            length mirror on bones closest door

            pearls pov  in the mirror

            not only the dress but she too looks exactly as she was 22
            years ago skin smooth as cocoa butter eyes free from worry
            and pain  

            roberta flacks killing me softly as jimmy takes her in his
            arms and starts to slow dance her in the midst of all those
            candles

                                pearl
                      where are we baby

                      hush baby

            pulls her closer closer until her last misgivings are gone 
            whatever purpose she came with lost in the power of having
            the impossible

            int the elevator shaft  continuous

            the three still climbing handhold by handhold knocking loose
            dirt in each others eyes  bill is just now reaching the
            first floor level trying to force open the outer doors

            suddenly an ominous sound the chainmechanism of the
            elevator as they see it starting to descend towards them 
            panicking bill tries with all his might

            as the elevator inches closer and closer 

            until bill finally manages to get the doors open  they all
            scramble to safety just as the elevator slides by them

            new angle

            after they catch their breath they look up and around to
            find themselves  

            int the necropolis  continuous

            a distorted mc escherlike feel to the place  where up
            seems to be down down up and left is right  not helped by
            behind only lit by the eerie flickering gaseous lamps
            outside and the moonlight falling through the skylight

            then slowly through the gloom they begin to perceive that
            the walls are clotted and congealed teratomic masses of
            distorted flesh faces limbs eyes mouths all trapped 
            all contorted in agony  at first they seem to be frozen in
            the walls like the ruins of herculaneum  but then we see 

            they are slowly writhing moving  hands grasping teeth and
            rotted jaws widening and worst of all the eyes staring out

                                patrick
                      is this hell

                                bill
                          gripping the gun
                      or just helladjacent

                                cinnabar
                      aint no heaven  aint no hell  theres
                      just the world of the dead my momma
                      always talked about  like she said the
                      door is open and were seeing right
                      through our world into this one  we just
                      have to remember what was really here 
                      and follow it  those stairs should take
                      us to the second floor

            as they approach the stairs they can hear faintly above the
            dronemoan of the dead the soft music playing in bones
            crib

            angle as

            they start up the stairs into the darkness  patrick first
            cinnabar in between him and bill  patrick still holding his
            flashlight but its starting to flicker a little

            more of the same horror along the stairway walls eyes
            looking at them hands caress cinnabars hair another hand
            shooting up from the stair floor and grabbing bills thigh 
            bill stabs the hand with the knife on his belt  and the
            hands shoot back down

            back in bones crib

            the munchlike dance of death goes on bones stroking the
            back of her neck

                                bones
                      just like i told you this morning id be
                      stroking your neck tonight

            pearl absolutely lost

            back on the stairs

            the three still ascending when patricks flashlight suddenly
            cuts out  total darkness

                                patrick
                      shit

            a faint sound patrick shaking the flashlight  nothing but
            the sound of breathing both human and nonhuman

                                patrick contd
                      thing worked fine a minute ago 
                      batteries were brand new  

            then as suddenly as it went out the flashlight comes back
            on illuminating a horrible sight maurice  standing right
            there a few feet in front of them

                                bill
                      maurice

            maurice puts a finger to his lips and beckons them to follow 
            the boys want it to be maurice  but cinnabar knows better

                                cinnabar
                      thats not maurice 

            but with the beam of the flickering flashlight they follow
            the shadowy figure up the steps

            then maurice gets a bit to far ahead and they cant see him
            for a beat

                                patrick
                      maurice  hold up man

            then after a silent beat just maurices hand appears back
            out of the darkness beckoning them onward  then the
            flashlight cuts out again  theyre back in the darkness

                                patrick contd
                          as he shakes the flashlight
                      okay were on the second floor  i feel
                      it  no more steps

            the sound of patrick cursing and shaking the batteries around
            in the torch  eventually it comes on again

            up ahead they still barely see maurice his back to them
            face in one quarter profile leading them towards the next
            flight of stairs at the end of the hall

            they follow  closer and closer to the stairs maurice going
            eerily in and out of their vision  the flashlight dies
            again

            darkness  patrick shakes it and it comes back quickly  then
            just as quickly dies again  a shake and its lit again 
            just as bill is stepping into the corner where maurice
            disappeared

            flickering horror

            as the dog leaps at them from the corner all teeth and
            slavering jaws  everyone scrambles for their lives and the
            flashlight falls to the floor

            low angle from the floor  just behind the flashlight

            we see the skewed horror as the dog tears at bill as his
            gun skitters across the floor as patrick grabs the gun and
            fires and we get a bit more illumination from the exploding
            gunpowder  but it does no good

            bill screams in terror as hes torn to pieces and then the
            flashlight goes out and again were in stygian darkness 
            the sound of bill dying and a long silence

            were in near total darkness as they climb the stairs maybe
            a bit of moonlight now coming in from the roofless third
            floor theyre approaching  all we can hear is their
            footsteps and their breathing as they walk the rest of the
            way up the stairs and emerge into

            bones crib  their pov

            both amazed to see pearl as young and beautiful as cinnabar
            is clinging to the dashing jimmy dancing to the spectral
            sounds of some soul classic from back in the day  cinnabar
            entranced by the vision

            wall even starting to suck him in to the wall

                                patrick
                      no

            as patrick struggles and writhes and twists to get free from
            his fathers grasp he can see back across the room to the
            others  he sees the room as it really is  he can see whats
            really happening

            pearl not in a new dress but in a horrible tattered blood
            encrusted old dress standing next to a rotting cadaver
            thats stroking cinnabars cheek and holding her close

            jeremiah pulling patrick into the wall into the necropolis
            itself  patrick though just as concerned with cinnabar as
            with himself yelling at her across the crib

                                patrick contd
                      cinnabar  stop

            but cinnabar doesnt even turn her head  she just steps into
            her fathers embrace  but pearl does seem to hear something

            she looks back at patrick beneath the illusion of the room
            she sees him being pulled into the awful wall and can hear
            him more clearly now

                                patrick contd
                      no  cinnabar no

            slowly pearl turns and looks into the mirror and she gets a
            fulllength view of herself a woman in ruined tatters of her
            old rotted dress

            then coming into her view in the mirror is her only daughter
             dancing with a decayed corpse

                                pearl
                      noooooo

            pearl whirls and rips cinnabar away from bones who at first
            sort of chuckles to himself  but he stops laughing when
            pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her
            breast  in a terrible whoosh the dried old dress and pearl
            are engulfed in flames

                                bones
                      noooooooooo

            bones runs to pearl and throws his arms around her trying to
            smother the flames any way he can

                                pearl
                          to patrick and cinnabar
                      get out  go

            cinnabar in a shattered daze on the floor sees her mother in
            flames

            patrick desperately tries to escape his fathers death grip 
            finally with horrible sound patrick wrestles free from the
            wall and from his father

            he lurches free from them and makes it over to cinnabar and
            drags her out the door just as the room dissolves around
            them  as the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges
            of bones blood on it the room begins to turn to ash

            an eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl blowing the ash
            and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls

            cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was
            her mother and bones now too sees them almost lost in a
            shroud of flame and ash

            angle as

            patrick and cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the
            stairs the moon overhead and the flames from bones crib
            giving everything a flickering hellish cat

            everything behind and above them crumbling to dust  the
            floor and then the stairs and all the howling bodies trapped
            inside  

            on the first floor

            they reach the open elevator shaft

                                patrick
                      we gotta jump

                                cinnabar
                      i cant

            everything around them rumbling and crumbling

                                patrick
                      we have to

            patrick jumps and lands in the muddy ashes dazed but unhurt

            looking up

            he sees cinnabar peering over the edge in fear  then behind
            her he can hear a low rumbling growl  he sees cinnabar turn
            and scream 

            ashes and falling debris then temporarily blind hen he wipes
            his eyes and looks up cinnabar is gone from view

                                patrick contd
                      cinnabar  where are you

            he immediately climbs back up the shaft when he sees cinnabar
            standing at the edge of the shaft above him

                                patrick contd
                      cinn  jump

            and she jumps landing right next to patrick who quickly
            gets her to her feet

                                patrick contd
                      lets go

            they run out of the shaft and into the subbasement just as
            the elevator and shaft dissolve into ash

            a hurricane wind blowing down and out of the shaft now 
            mixed with the sound of all the screaming moaning souls in
            the necropolis

            patrick in a fury to live tears away the boards and debris
            blocking the exit  

            he pulls cinnabar out with him and they walk up the cellar
            stairs step into the dawn weary beaten down but not dead

            ext bones building  day

            theyve made it out of the inferno  like dante said thus we
            emerged again to see the stars  no stars here just the
            glorious dawn

            patrick stops feels the new sun on his face  breathes clean
            air again for the first time

                                patrick
                      we made it

            then from behind or above or somewhere we can hear what might
            be a low low chuckle  jimmy bones chuckle

                                bones os
                      dog eat dog boy  dog eat dog

            patrick turns and spins in mounting horror  there behind
            him right where cinnabar was standing

            the black dog  it leaps right at the camera filling the
            frame with huge teeth and bloody red tongue  we freeze

                                                          fade to black
