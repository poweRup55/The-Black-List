                    looks like a rope

     int cotters workloft  night

     heather has apparently gained a tad enough mastery to run tape
     through the imac

     shes playing and replaying a short section of cotters camcorder
     tape where the bunch of them were interacting with the stoner film
     crew

     she keeps seeing a flash on the tape between two trees far in the
     background but she cant seem to freeze the image inside the
     flash it looks vaguely like a middleaged man

                              heather
                    does this look like a person
                    stand there to you
                         no response
                    domini

     she turns sitting on the couch where domini was is now the very
     clear presence of

     a middleaged man

     in a topcoat he says nothing just stares straight ahead theres
     a horrible wound in his forehead

     heather is mindboggledand petrified she manages to stammer out
     the word

                              heather
                    dad

     heathers neck snaps to her right shes sitting on that same couch
     with domini

     her eyes scan the entire loft theres no one there but the two
     women

                              domini
                    are you alright

     fade up on

     int cotters elevator  dawn

     wide open the recorded pitbulls bark and bark and bark

     int cotters work  loft  simultaneous

     the barking bolts heather and domini up like a shot

     int nick and annas bedroom

     as soon as nick makes it to the door the barking stops

     int cotters work loft  just after

     nick domini and heather are gathered around him like kids on
     christmas

                              domini

                              heather
                    still looks like a blur only
                    bigger

     domini grabs it stares at it puzzled

                              cotter

     made for domini

                    its going to get into ourbrains

     and heather finally loses it and starts weepinggreat wracking
     sobs nicks a little awkward at first how to comfort her finally
     just starts lightly massaging her neck

                              nick
                    theres explanations rational
                    explanations for everything thats

                    supernatural whatifs

                              heather
                    that feels good lowerdown
                    into my neck

     nick moves his hands down

     and somehow the two of them are then guiding his hands down into
     her blouse onto her breasts

     and shes moaning and grabbing hard onto his hair

     and pulling his whole head down to hers and their lips and
     tongues meet and theyre biting each other like animals

     and his hands are yanking and twisting hard on her breasts
     between her legs

     and shes literally clawing him with her fingernails drawing
     blood down the length of his chest

     until she reaches a burgundycolored mark right at his belt line
     with tendrils like fingers

     snapits like someone woke them from a dream they both look
     at each other baffledwhat the hell just happened but it wasnt
     a dream nicks chest is streaming blood theres blood on
     heathers lips

     matching the color of the mark on nicks waist and the one
     heather now sees inside her elbow

     they both move away from each other uncomprehendingand scared

     int nick and annas bedroom  dusk

     nick pacing the floor as anna lies in bed

                              nick

     downing one coke after another hes so caffedout both his body
     and his voice is shaking

                              cotter

                    here do you think its some
                    thing heather

     heather doesnt even look up shes just sitting on the broken
     backed couch staring at dominis 8x10

                              cotter
                    but that could be just a shadow
                    i think its a shadow its nothing
                    heather do you think its nothing

     and he just keeps prattling on oblivious eyes fixed on the tape
     moving at a snails pace in front of him

                              heather
                    its about the tree its
                    something about the tree

     she puts it down on a cushion and snatches up the dogeared copy of
     the blair witch dossier easily flips to the page domini showed
     her elly kedward trussed in the wagon in the woods

     flips backwards in the book looking for something

                    the goddamntree domini

     and then she stops on the page that shows the anthropology
     students sketch of the parr foundation the skinny little sapling
     in the middle

     then back to the woodcut of elly kedward in the woods

     then back to dominis photo of the foundationthe huge tree

     huge windows hes waving to someone

     heather gets up slowly peers over the loft railing squints

     heathers pov

     a starknaked domini is standing in druid hill park looking up at
     them

     ext druid hill park  just after  night

     heather and cotters pace slows drastically as they try and
     navigate the overgrown pathways inside the park the flora is dense
     below and abovemoonlight barely penetrates where theyre walking

                              heather
                    domini

     cotter puts a finger to her lip whispers

                              cotter
                    not the place you want to
                    announce your arrival

                              heather
                    hows she going to know where
                    to

                              cotter
                    next time try putting on shoes

     the two of them stop dead in their tracks through the thicket
     ahead of them they can see a clearing illuminated by the moon is
     what appears to be an old

     wooden ox cart

     with snow drifted up nearly to the hubs of its wheels

     heather and cotter

     are suddenly so cold they can see their breath in the air

                              heather
                    what the fuck

                              cotter
                    i dont know

     he grabs her hand and pulls her through the thicket they enter

     the clearing

     the snow is now gone where the cart was is now just a stack of
     rotting cut brush a cleanup effort someone must have started
     then abandoned heather and cotter stare at each other baffled
     and not a little afraid

                              cotter
                    the moon trying to shoot down
                    through all these treescan make
                    things funky

                              heather
                    i saw what i saw

                              cotter
                    yeah me too

                              heather
                    the cart they brought elly kedward
                    into the woods with

                              cotter
                    into theblackhillswith200
                    something miles from here

                              heather
                    domini

     they both see it at the same time

     a naked white body

     face down at the base of a tree heather races over kneels down
     next to it

                              heather
                    oh jesus what happened are
                    you

     and heather lets out a screech the face of the body reveals an
     elderly male filthy tongue lolling black out of its mouth hes
     been dead for some time

     heather looks up cotters lying on the ground holding his
     bleeding forehead

                    what the fuck you dothatfor

     she grabs his hand pulls him up they start running

     int cotters kitchen  later that night

     heather and cotter at the table still out of breath and shaking
     as they tell nick what happened

                              heather
                    and one of the little boys

     a look of alarm comes to nicks face but he says nothing

                    atta boy

     and then the whole kitchen seems to explode

     glass and mullions from the big window in the room come hurtling
     in shards at them

     and then when the noise finally stops and the flying debris has
     all hit the floor they all look down and see

     on the peeling linoleum

     a horned owl

     broken and bleeding from its header through the window spasming
     and then dying eyes wide staring up at them

     no one says a word they just look at it

     int cotters workloft  later  night

     a lot of chairs but nobodys sitting down cotter heather and
     nick all look like their nerves are fraying down to bare wire

                    yes youd be amazed though what you
                    can get free on the net

     he opens a desk drawerthere must be a dozen little palm
     corders in there

     int the loft  various locations  night

     what cotter lacks in other equipment he makes up for with cable
     huge spools of itand hes running it from the various tiny vid
     cams to a motley bank of monitors hes set up on the kitchen table

     heather

     ducttapes one of the little units on the top of a closet door
     frame in the hallway

     cotter

     sees he has an excellent angle on the front doorelevator

     anna

     watches half asleep and befuddled in their bedroom as nick aims a
     camera on a jerryrigged broomhandle tripod

     cotter

     connects the cables in the kitchensees anna and a clear view of
     the bedroom door

     nick  heather

     collaborate on installing a camera from cotters workloft that
     provides a view of the dark areaunderthe workloft nick lowers
     the camera on a rope while heather guides and supports the cables
     attached

     cotter

     watches the camera descend on one of the monitors satisfied by the
     view its giving him he yells

                              cotter
                    thats good tie it off

     back in the workloft

     nick does so ties the rope securely around the loft railing ties
     a slip knot in the loose end and lassoes it over one of the iron
     beams above to keep it from being a hazard he has to jump to catch
     the rope as it comes down again from the beam

     stumbles backwards slightly as he catches it

     hitting the spindly loft railing

     which suddenly snaps

     and nick goes tumbling out into midair the slipknot in the rope
     in his hand the only thing keeping him from plummeting 20 feet to
     the floor below

                              nick
                    jeezus

     cotter

                              cotter
                    christ

     he dashes out of the kitchen

     back in the workloft

     heather is trying to lift nick back up by the rope by sheer
     physical strength she doesnt have

                              heather
                    i cant do it

     and cotter comes dashing in with a tall metal step ladder

                              cotter
                    just hold on

                              nick

     cotter splays the ladder open starts clambering up it

                              cotter
                    just let it go ive got you

                    shit

     nick loses his gripstarts falling

     cotter snatches hold of him as he falls pinning nick between the
     ladder and his torso

     the ladder wobbles precariously

                              cotter
                    dont move dont even breathe

     and then the ladder finally comes to a stable rest

     nick is savagely shaken as he slowly climbs down

                              nick
                    jesusjesusjesus

     ditto cotter

                    yeahpleasedont do that
                    again

     a giggle is heard from the doorway to the big room they all look

     anna

     is standing there laughing with her hand against her mouth like a
     little child she singsongs

                              anna
                    i could see up your dress

     int kitchen  later  night

     cotter heather and nick watch the monitors on the table in
     silence drinking coffee they all look majorly exhaustedbut none
     of them look in any immediate danger of falling asleep their eyes
     dart from monitor to monitor relievedly seeing nothingexcept
     anna tossing restlessly in bed

     heather sees that nick is massaging something on his forearm thats
     making him wince without a word she rolls his sleeve up

     a winecolored mark that looks vaguely like a jagged j

                              heather
                    gothic runethe letter s

                              nick

                    must be that blue collar life we
                    all lead

     cotter pulls up his pant leg two blurry burgundy markscrescent
     shapes overlapping each other

                              heather
                    thats a j

                              cotter

                              heather
                    goes right along with these two

     she pulls back her hairwhere jaw meets neck two smudgey marks
     that together look like badlydrawn lowercase ns

                              heather
                    put em together thats a k

                    or god knows whatelse we could have
                    picked up in the woods

                              heather
                    youknowwhat we picked up in the
                    woods

     and then theres a sharp knock at the door

     all three sets of eyes zoom towards the sound but no one moves

     the knocking grows louder more insistent still they remain
     frozen frightened

     they look at the monitor giving an angle of the doorelevator

     nothing can be seenjust a dark blur in the doors peephole
     indicating someones standing in the elevator

                              heather
                    who

                              cotter
                    no one ever comes here

                    have to open the door to find
                    out

     the knocking increases along with muffled shouts of

                              voice behind the door
                    cotter cotter

                              cotter
                    illgo

     cotter gets up and slowly walks to the door the rapping and
     shouting increasing in volume with each step

     finally a deep breath and then cotter looks through the peep
     hole he sees

     sid

     his techie friend from the film lab glowering back at him

                              sid
                    i know youre in there you

                    i cant let you in

     sid starts knocking again

     cotter walks back to the kitchen sits down in front of the
     monitors watches as the knocking continues finally stops the
     expression on cotters face never changes

     time cut to  the same  several hours later

     so quiet so tense they can hear the clocks ticking all over the
     loft 410am

                              nick

     and anna gently guides heathers face down begins stroking it and
     the next thing heather knows her body is gravitating towards
     annas shes kissing her stroking and fondling her as anna guides
     her fingers pulling down the covers guiding heather down the
     length of her body to

     a spot on the mattress between annas legs thats soaked solid
     with fresh gleaming blood

     heather yanks herself away now seeing that the entire mattress is
     bloodcovered runs from the room

     int kitchen  night

     heather stares at her face in the mirrored surface of a toaster
     blood blots on her cheekvaguely in the shape of little palm
     prints shes hyperventilating as she tells cotter

                              heather
                    rememberwhat mary brown said

     one of the video monitors

     the big room

     of the loft where they see anna twirling round and round on her
     tiptoes laughing as though she were simultaneously being hanged
