               a farmhouse and a large barn lie nestled in a scottish valley 
               riding down the roads that lead in from opposite sides are 
               scottish noblemen in full regalia eyepopping tartans 
               sparkling chestplates even the horses are draped in scarlet

                         historians from england will say i 
                         am a liar but history is written by 
                         those who have hung heroes

               another noble rides in from the opposite side two more appear 
               down the road converging on the barn

                         a son and the king of england a 
                         cruel pagan known as edward the 
                         longshanks claimed the throne for 
                         himself scotland’s nobles fought 
                         him and fought each other over the 
                         crown so longshanks invited them to 
                         talks of truce no weapons one page 
                         only

               the nobles eye each other cautiously but the truce holds

               they enter the barn with their pages

               ext scottish farm  day

               nestled in emerald hills are the thatched roof house and 
               barn and outbuildings of a wellrun farm the farmer malcolm 
               wallace and his nineteenyearold son john both strong 
               tough men are riding away from the farm they hear hooves 
               behind them and turn to see a boy riding after them

                         among the farmers of that shire was 
                         malcolm wallace a commoner with 
                         his own lands and two sons john

               we favor john wallace the nineteenyearold sitting easily 
               on his horse beside his father

               william a skinny eightyearold riding bareback catches up 
               to his father and older brother

                         macandrews he was supposed to visit 
                         when the truce was over

               they ride on over the lush hills

               ext the macandrews farm  day

               the horses are all gone the place looks deserted up on the 
               hill we see the three wallaces looking down

                                     father
                         stay here

               he means william he and his elder son spur their horses

               at the barn  day

               the wallaces ride up looking around

                                     father
                         macandrews macandrews

               malcolm finds a pitchfork john the woodpile axe

               int the barn

               pov from within as the door opens and a widening block of 
               sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows malcolm and john 
               wallace step in and are shocked to see

               pov the wallaces

               hanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty scottish 
               noblemen and thirty pages their faces purple and contorted 
               by the strangulation hanging their tongues protruding

               malcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger 
               john still grips the axe as he follows his father through 
               the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back row to see 
               the one man in commoners dress like theirs

                                     father
                         macandrews

               a shuffle john spins william has entered the back door

                                     john
                         william get out of here

                                     william
                         why would macandrews make so many 
                         scarecrows

               before his father and brother can think of anything to say 
               william with a boys curiosity touches the spurred foot of 
               the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in its too solid 
               he takes a real look at the face and suddenly 

                                     william
                         r  real ahhhhhgggg

               he turns to run but knocks back into the feet of the hanged 
               man behind him in blind panic he darts in another direction 
               and runs into another corpse and another the hanged men 
               begin to swing making it harder for williams father and 
               older brother to fight their way to him

                                     father
                         william william

               then worst of all william sees the pages boys like himself 
               hanged in a row behind their masters

               finally his father and brother reach william and hug him 
               tight there in the barn among the swinging bodies of the 
               hanged nobles malcolm wallace grips his sons

               ext wallace farmhouse  night

               the cottage looks peaceful the windows glowing yellow into 
               the night from outside the house we see john rise and close 
               the shutters of the kitchen where men are gathered we pan 
               up to the upper bedroom window

               inside that bedroom

               young william is in nightmarish sleep he mumbles in smothered 
               terror he twitches we see

               his nightmare

               in the bluegrays of his dream william stands at the door 
               of the barn gazing at the hanged knights we whip pan to 
               their faces garish horrible then one of the heads moves 
               and its eyes open william wants to run but he cant get 
               his body to respond and the hanging nobleman his bloated 
               tongue still bursting through his lips moans

                                     ghoul
                         william

               william tears himself from sleep looking around swallowing 
               back his tears and panic

               in the kitchen

               a dozen strong tough farmers have huddled redheaded 
               campbell scarred and missing fingers is stirred up while 
               his friend macclannough is reluctant

                                     campbell
                         wallace is right we fight em

                         fight was at that meeting

                         wont lie down to be their slaves

                                     macclannough

                         fifty farmers we can raise

                                     malcolm wallace

                         em to show em were not dogs but 
                         men

               young wallace has snuck down and is eavesdropping from the 
               stairs he sees his father drip his finger into a jug of 
               whiskey and use the wet finger to draw on the tabletop

                                     malcolm wallace

               malcolm and john have saddled horses they are checking the 
               short swords theyve tucked into grain sacks when william 
               comes out of the barn with his own horse

                                     malcolm

               these words from his youngest son make malcolm pause and 
               kneel to look into williams eyes

                                     malcolm

                         men i love ya boy you stay

               malcolm and john mount their horses and ride away leaving 
               william looking forlorn they wave he waves back

               ext scottish hills near the wallace farm  day

               its strangely quiet until william and his friend hamish 
               campbell a redheaded like his father race up the hillside 
               and duck in among a grove of trees breathless gasping 
               they press their backs to the tree bark william peers around 
               a tree then shrinks back and whispers

                                     william

               hamish leans forward for a look but william pulls him back

                         not yet here he comes be ready

               they wait heavy footsteps then from around the edge of the 
               grove three enormous ugly hogs appear the boys hurling 
               rotten eggs the eggs slap the snouts of the pigs who scatter 
               as the boys charge howling we pull back as the sun goes

               williams face appears at the window looking toward

               the distant hills

               of trees and heather where there is no sign of life

               int the house  night

               william has cooked stew in a pot and now spoons up two 
               steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table but he 
               is only hoping he looks out the window again he is still 
               all alone so he leaves a candle burning on the table beside 
               the stew and moves up the stairs

               ext farmhouse  dawn

               the house is silent fog rolling around it in the dawn

               int farmhouse  dawn

               william has been awake all night afraid to sleep he rises 
               and in quick cuts he dresses he moves down the hall stops 
               at the door of his fathers bedroom and sees the undisturbed 
               bed he moves on passing the door of his brothers room 
               also unrumpled

               in the kitchen

               he finds the two cold bowls of stew beside the exhausted 
               candle he spoons up his own cold porridge and eats alone

               ext house  day

               william is in the barn loft shoveling corn down to feed the 
               hogs while he glimpses something coming

               the boys pov

               an ox cart is coming down the curving lane its driver is 
               campbell with macclannough walking behind it the farmers 
               glance up at william their faces grim

               from his perch in the loft william sees that the neighbors 
               have brought the bodies of his father and brother the cart 
               stops campbell with a bandage around his left hand where 
               more of his fingers are now missing studies the back of the 
               ox as if it could tell him how to break such news the butt 
               of the ox seems to tell him to be matteroffact

               but the bodies are still there

               ext house  day

               on a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is 
               preparing them cloths around the lower jaw and top of the 
               head bind their mouths shut pennies cover their eyes

               softly william enters the shed drawn to his father and 
               brother campbell follows him in wanting to stop him  but 
               what can he say now the undertaker goes on with his work

               william approaches the table the bodies dont look real to 
               him he sees the wounds the dried blood

               the undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the

               standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother as

               into the ground beside her has all of the neighbors shaken

               the local parish priest drones mechanically in latin

               the farmers who were secretly gathered in malcolm wallaces 
               kitchen the previous night are now glancing at william but 
               no one is anxious to adopt a grieving a rebellious boy

               beautiful girl with long auburn hair and she clings to her 
               own mothers hand as if the open graves are the mouths of 
               death and might suck her parents in too

                         restare in pacem eternis amen

               with the final amen the neighbors drift from the graveside 
               pulling their children along to give william a last moment 
               of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies

               the boy stands alone over the open graves his heart so 
               shattered that he can scarcely cry a single tear makes its 
               way down his face and the tiny girl feels for william in a 
               way that the adults cannot from the ground she pulls a 
               scottish thistle moves to the softly weeping william and 
               places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand

               william looks up and their young eyes meet her sad blue 
               eyes hold williams as the grave diggers cover the bodies

               then a lone mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill 
               above them tall thin and angular in black clerical garb 
               he looks like the grim reaper

               the girl hurries back to her mothers side everyone watches 
               in silence as the figure rides down to them he is argyle

               william stares up at this frightening figure they are 
               interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses a 
               dozen mounted english soldiers armed with lances are 
               approaching argyle rattles to the priest

               argyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed he stands 
               awkwardly idle as william scrubs his face at the washstand 
               and crawls into bed

                                     william

               leans down over william and with great tenderness the 
               grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair

               int the kitchen  night

               tears of grief spill down the old mans cheeks

               int the hanging barn  in williams dream

               once again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn looking 
               at the garish hanged faces in his nightmare then a mangled 
               hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder william 
               gasps but the hand holds him gently he turns to see his 
               father and his brother they are wounded bloody but they 
               smile at him theyre alive weeping in joy william reaches 
               to hug them but his father stretches forth a forbidding 
               hand

               william keeps reaching out helplessly his father and brother 
               move past him to the hanged knights two empty nooses are 
               there before the boys weeping eyes they put their heads 
               into the nooses and hoist themselves up

               williams grief explodes his tears erupt and

               the kitchen

               but his uncle is not there either then william hears a 
               strange haunting sounddistant carried by the wind he 
               moves to the window and sees only moonlight he opens the 
               window and hears it more clearly bagpipes william lights a 
               candle and throws open the door wind rushes in blowing out 
               his candle but he hears the pipes louder in the wind

               of the pipes is growing louder he moves through the 
               moonlight drawn toward  the graveyard he stops as he 
               realizes this then forces himself on

               ext graveyard  night

               william moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are 
               buried and discovers a haunting scene two dozen men the 
               farmerwarriors of his neighborhood are gathered in kilts  
               and among them a core of bagpipers the pipes wail an ancient 
               scottish dirge a tune of grief and redemption a melody 
               known to us as amazing grace uncle argyle has heard them 
               and walked out too he stands at the fringes of the 
               torchlight still holding the massive broadsword he glances 
               down noticing william as the boy moves up beside him william 
               whispers

               whispering his own private prayer argyle whispers half to

               william takes the sword from his uncle and tries to lift 
               it

               slowly argyle takes the sword back

                                     argyle

               with an experts easy fluidity he lifts the huge sword it 
               glistens in the torchlight the music plays the notes hanging 
               in the air swirling in the scottish breeze as if rising

                         in england give our own nobles 
                         estates in the north make them too 
                         greedy to oppose us

               one old advisor speaks up hesitantly

                                     old advisor
                         sire our nobles will be reluctant 
                         to relocate new lands mean new taxes 
                         and they are taxed already for our 
                         war in france

               longshanks glares at him but takes the point the wheels 
               grind in his brain his dark eyes falling on the princess 
               he is inspired

                         perhaps its time to reinstitute an 
                         old custom grant them prima noctes 
                         first night when any common girl

               the prince and a muscular young friend phillip are stripped 
               to the waist and fencing they pay no attention to the

               knock or to the princess as she enters she watches them  
               they are dancing more than fencing edward loses his sword 
               it clatters to the polished floor he looks up at his wife 
               as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness

                                     edward
                         what is it

                         moment the kings conference was 
                         ended

                                     edward

                         scotland he intends 

               but edward and his friend are fencing again the clanging of 
               their blunted swords so loud that she cant hear herself

                                     princess
                         he intends to grant 

               edward loses his weapon again and whirls on her

                                     edward
                         shut up would you how can i

                         his majesty was quite keen that 
                         you should understand

                         learn to fight too so let me do it

               for an instant anger flares into her eyes she glances at 
               edward and at the young man with him then lowers her eyes 
               and starts to back out but edward has noticed

                                     edward
                         stop there

               she stops but does not raise her eyes

                                     edward
                         do you disapprove of phillip

               he lifts his hand and draws his friend phillip to his side

               still the princess does not lift her eyes

                                     princess

               she lifts her eyes but she could not brace herself enough 
               for what she sees edward nuzzling phillip the princes 
               bare chest to his muscular friends bare back both men 
               glistening with sweat and sexual excitement

               the princesss eyes quiver but she does not look away

                                     edward

               she starts to leave as quietly as she came but her husband 
               calls after her

                                     edward

                         manage

               she closes the door softly on her husband and his lover

               man full of intelligence and power

                                     voice over

                         earl of bruce a leading contender 
                         for the crown of scotland

               robert strides to his seat in the center of the table and 
               the others settle in respectfully mornay another young 
               warrior gives him a bow as does craig a grizzled noble

                                     craig

                         he will support their claim to the 
                         throne if we make a show of 
                         opposition the commoners will favor

                         father believes we must lull 
                         longshanks into confidence by neither 
                         supporting his decree nor opposing 
                         it

                         he strained his leg so that it pains 
                         him to ride but he sends his 
                         greetings  and says that i speak 
                         for all the bruces and for scotland

               ext scottish village at the edge of town  day

               flutes and dancing laughter and garlands village families 
               have gathered for a wedding celebration  we see the happy 
               bride and groom farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of 
               cheese villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of 
               smoked fish

               and watching the people are ubiquitous english soldiers 
               battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears

               riding along the road comes william wallace grown now a 
               man he sits his horse as if born there his back straight 
               his hands relaxed on the reins he has a look of lean rippled 
               power he looks dangerous

               and the soldiers notice him nudging each other as he passes

               he carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle he 
               stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the 
               scene farmers are roasting a pig women are comparing 
               handiwork young men are tossing huge stones in the 
               traditional highland games  and everyone is noticing 
               williams arrival especially the farm women with daughters 
               of marriageable age

               among those watching william arrive is campbell grown older 
               now and with his old rebel friend macclannough william 
               dismounts and ties his horse to a willow one of the english 
               soldiers shoves william from behind

                                     soldier
                         hey boy you hunt this bird

               williams eyes fix themselves on the soldier

                                     soldier
                         its against the law for scots to 
                         own bows you shot this bird

               his buddies enjoying their role as intimidators grab the 
               bird and begin to search it for evidence

                                     william
                         i hit it in the head with a rock

               they dont believe that  but they cant find any puncture 
               wound on the bird william reaches his hand out for the return 
               of the bird the soldiers drop it onto the ground

               slowly william picks it up and heads into the clearing

               the farmers watch him come

               among those noticing williams arrival but pretending not 
               to is marion macclannough grown now into a stunning young 
               woman her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long 
               ago she wears it the same way straight and full down her 
               back her dress is plain like the grass that surrounds a 
               wildflower shes the most beautiful girl in the village 
               maybe in all of scotland and the soldiers who hassled william 
               notice her too

               william reaches the food table and contributes his goose to 
               the feast farm women eye him he nodes to one

                                     william
                         miz macdougal you look well

                                     farm woman
                         william its william wallace 
                         back home  have you met my 
                         daughter

               the daughter mentioned is missing teeth william nods to 
               her its impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright 
               as her hopes and she lowers her head in disappointment but 
               then raises her face in surprise as william takes her hand 
               and gives her a respectful bow

               he moves away from the table passing through the crowd like 
               a stranger then he glances toward the knot of girls he 
               sees marion she sees him then looks away do they remember 
               each other he moves toward her she is shy her eyes 
               downcast but then she raises them and looks at him

               they move closer and closer together just as they are about 
               to reach each other a huge round stone thumps to the earth 
               at williams feet

               he looks up to see one of marions suitors  the broad 
               muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in williams 
               way now everybodys looking to see how william will handle 
               the challenge he tries to move around but the guy cuts him 
               off then william thinks he recognizes the big redhead

                                     william
                         hamish

               it is his old friend but hamish wont admit it or be put 
               off from the challenge he points to the huge stone

                                     hamish
                         test of manhood

                                     william
                         you win

                                     hamish
                              blocks him
                         call it a test of soldiery then 
                         the english wont let us train with 
                         weapons so we train with stones

                                     william
                         the test of a soldier is not in his 
                         arm its here

               he taps his temple hamish stretches out his hand as if to 
               show william something in his palm

                                     hamish
                         no its here

               with a sudden movement he slams his fist into williams 
               jaw dropping him a few men move to interfere but campbell 
               macclannough and the other farmers who are the true leaders 
               here stop their neighbors from interrupting hamish stands 
               over william waiting for him to get up

                                     william
                         a contest then

               william stands and hoists the huge stone eighteen inches in 
               diameter straining with the effort he lugs the stone to 
               the line scratched in the rocky field beyond the line are 
               the muddy dents from previous tosses william takes a run 
               and heaves the stone it flies past the other marks in the 
               field people are impressed william looks at hamish

                                     william
                         i still say this is no test a 
                         catapult can throw a stone farther 
                         than a man can

                                     hamish
                         that depends on the man

               hamish walks out lifts the stone and lugs it back to the 
               line he takes a run and heaves with a great groan the stone 
               flies passing williams mark by a couple of feet

               people laugh and whistle william nods impressed

                                     william
                         can you do it when it matters as it 
                         matters in battle could you crush a 
                         man with that throw

                                     hamish
                         i could crush you like a roach

               william walks to the dent made by hamishs throw

               hamish scowls at william at everybody watching he lifts 
               the stone and carries it back to the line william stands 
               calmly hamish backs up for his run william yawns

                                     hamish

               hamish backs up a few more feet for a longer run

                         run

               william seems completely unafraid he leans down picks up a 
               small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually

               stung by this show of calm hamish takes furious run and 
               heaves the stone flies through the air just misses williams 
               head and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him 
               william never flinches the people cheer

                         an ox is stupid enough to just stand 
                         in one place

                         thats not the point

               william turns walks double the distance hamish threw and 
               turns and hurls the rock he holds it whistles through the 
               air hits hamish in the forehead and drops him like a shot

                                     william

               tosses the cold liquid into hamishs face he wakes and 
               his eyes uncrossing accepts williams hand pulling him up

                                     william

                         brother their cart turned over

               the musicians interrupt their playing a group of heavily 
               armed horsemen with banners and flying colors ride up 
               reining their horses into the middle of the celebration in 
               the middle of the group is an english nobleman he is gray 
               in his fifties and stops in front of the bride and groom

                                     nobleman
                         i have come to claim the right of

                         taking the bride into my bed on the 
                         first night of her union

               stewart father of the bride lunges forward

                                     stewart
                         no by god

               the horsemen point their lances at the unarmed scots  who 
               see that the english soldiers from the village have moved to 
               the edge of the gathering as if to dare any resistance

                                     nobleman
                         it is my noble right

               even unarmed stewart is about to attack  but the bride 
               intervenes she grabs her father and whispers to him she 
               moves to her husband and does the same holding back tears 
               she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen 
               marion macclannough is looking on sobered by her friends 
               courage and sickened by her fate  and marion is even more 
               unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers a 
               particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face is 
               leering at her william wallace sees this too

               the noble and his escorts ride away and as they do it begins 
               to rain the celebration destroyed the scots gather the 
               food and disperse to their homes but wallace remains 
               standing in the downpour keeping his thoughts to himself

               ext the wallace farmhouse  magic hour

               the farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn william stands at 
               the open door and gazes out at the rain it leaks on him 
               through his roof he doesnt seem to notice

               ext the macclannough house  magic hour

               a thatched cottage lit with a cozy fire beneath the rain

               a hand knocks on the door and macclannough opens it to find 
               william on a horse macclannough frowns

                                     william

               up to help her down the moment she touches the ground they 
               look into each others eyes but the door is snatched open 
               so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss

               the church is at the base of the precipice beside the loch

               int the church  night

               this ancient gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by 
               the occupying army and yet it looks devoutly holy this way 
               lit only by candles and moonlight through the open roof the 
               village priest whom we saw at the wedding celebration is 
               waiting at the altar marion steps into the confessional as 
               william moves to the altar and kneels in prayer

               marion emerges shes changed into the wedding dress she 
               made from the cloth she bought william stands and watches 
               her float down the aisle his whole life was worth this 
               moment

               together the two lovers turn to the priest

                                     priest
                         you have come to pledge each to the 
                         other before almighty god

               from within his shirt william withdraws a strip of cloth 
               woven in his family tartan he and marion each lift a hand 
               to the priest and he binds their wrists with the cloth

                                     william
                         i will love you my whole life you 
                         and no other

               from her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief embroidered 
               with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those 
               years ago

                                     marion
                         and i you you and no other forever

               the priest waits for them to go on but neither can theyre 
               too taken with emotion looking at each other the priest 
               intones holy phrases

                                     priest
                         agus bhayd lauch the lord bless 
                         and keep thy love now and forever

               the lovers kiss as they break their embrace a figure 
               carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door 
               of the church and william spins as if to attack but the 
               priest catches his arm they see the man carries bagpipes

                                     priest
                         i trust him  or ida killed him 
                         meself a weddin needs pipes

               the piper begins to play and the tune from his primitive 
               chanter is wispy ethereal beautiful the lovers look into 
               each others eyes as the single melody of the pipes merges 
               into a swell of music underscoring montage

               william and marion ride the path to the top of the precipice 
               where in the shelter of the grove they spend their 
               honeymoon the music continues as still sweaty from their 
               lovemaking he returns her to her house just before dawn

               she waves from her window as william rides away as we

                                                               dissolve to

               merchants of all kinds and a few special attractions like 
               jugglers and fortune tellers marion moves along a table 
               full of flowers and fruit william concealed behind hanging 
               baskets watches her unseen savoring the beauty of his 
               beloved bathing his soul in the sight of her then she looks 
               up and spots him her smile sudden and luminous before she 
               remembers to conceal it he moves up beside her

                                     william

                         cant keep meeting you every night

               playfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress 
               pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their 
               wedding which she now wears hidden around her neck

                                     william

               angle  drunken english soldiers  by an ale cask  day

               they spot marion moving through the fair glowing beautiful

               the soldiers smirk at each other as marion passes one of 
               them grabs her wrist its the soldier with the scar the 
               one whos been staring at her

                                     soldier

                         let go

               a second drunken soldier pipes up

                                     soldier 2
                         why dont you marry my friend here 
                         then ill take the first night

               the scarred soldier pulls marion into his big arms she shoves 
               him away with surprising strength and he staggers back to 
               the laughter of his friends then he snatches her again and 
               kisses her hard on the lips

               she breaks free and slaps him fiercely hard enough to draw 
               blood from his mouth tasting the trickle he slings her 
               down against sacks of grain and the soldiers are all over 
               her pinning her down ripping her clothes a full scale 
               public gang rape as the townspeople try to move in the three 
               soldiers waiting their turn at marion pull their knives 
               keep them townspeople back

                                     soldier 1
                         bitch who do you think you are

               he slams his mouth down against hers for a long awful time 
               comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body and 
               is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed

               it takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what 
               just happened and in that instant william is on them he 
               wrenches one soldiers arm in a direction it was never meant 
               to go breaking the elbow separating the shoulder and 
               slinging the howling soldier into his comrades

               two of the soldiers leap at william swinging their short 
               swords william ducks knocking their ale cask into their 
               knees william lifts the whole table where they were sitting 
               and slams it into the faces of two more attackers

                                     marion
                         william

               she shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier now 
               bloodyfaced has recovered from the rock and is behind william 
               with a knife william sidesteps the first thrust snatches a 
               leg from the shattered table and crushes the mans skull

                                     market women

               but theres no time for celebration theres blood and ale 
               everywhere and the fallen soldiers are yelling

                         rebels help

               more soldiers hear the call and come running reinforcements 
               converging from all over the village

                                     village folks
                         run william run

               will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws 
               marion up onto its back he slaps the horses rump and it 
               plunges with marion into the twisting village lanes william 
               darts off through the crowd as the magistrate and more of 
               his soldiers arrive  dozens of them

               william pauses out in the central street of the village 
               just long enough to be sure theyve spotted him and darts 
               into a side lane in the opposite direction marion went 
               william weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval 
               town knocking over baskets jumping carts

               as the soldiers stumble after him the magistrate looks down 
               at his mangled soldiers the one with the ruptured arm is 
               lying in agony

                                     magistrate

                         the girl on the horse stop her

               the shout rings through the village marion hears it and 
               when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane shes 
               trying to take out of town she urges the horse into an even 
               narrower back alley she sees a clear route to freedom

               but the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there 
               behind the shops rise into the horses face with a sudden 
               thrashing of wings and the horse shies against a wall

               marion controls him but a flap of her ripped dress has caught 
               on a crude nail and as the frightened horse lunges forward 
               again she is pulled off its bare back her dress catching 
               and ripping at the same time dropping her hard

               william

               reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the 
               river the soldiers are running every which way but theyve 
               lost him thinking marions made it too william heads deeper 
               into the trees

               the soldiers pikes appear over her and the magistrate leers

               william moves into the shelters of the trees expecting to 
               see marion he doesnt he listens only the rustling of the 
               wind through the treetops

               marion is thrown into a chair and her arms are bound with an 
               oak staff behind her elbows she and two dozen soldiers are 
               in the tavern the english have commandeered

               the magistrate is a battlescarred veteran a brutal pragmatist

               dont want to be near the soldiers but they hang on the 
               fringes of the square too curious to pull away

                         an assault on the kings soldiers is 
                         the same as assaulting the king

               he looks down at marion her mouth bound her eyes defiant

               he jerks out his dagger and slices marions throat

               her eyes spring open like a does then she sags dead the 
               townspeople are speechless even some of the soldiers are 
               shocked the magistrate turns calmly to his men

               reluctantly forcing himself forward as he reaches the grove 
               william appears hurrying out to him

               we stay in the long shot seeing william asking anxiously 
               for any news and seeing hamishs great shoulders as he tells 
               him something that makes william step backwards

               he has stopped rock still the soldiers hush there is 
               something unsettling about this man alone staring at the 
               twenty of them as if to steel himself for the butchery

               bows the arrows whish toward the lens fly past

               the arrows tear through wallaces clothes but dont catch 
               his flesh he charges on his horse leaps the barrier as 
               wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword  and hes 
               more than an expert the tip at the end of a huge arc nearly 
               breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the 
               corporals helmet taking off the upper half of his head

               the soldiers try to rally to shoot him in the back as his 
               horse leaps over them one of them has sighted williams 
               back but hamish and his father crash into them its a 
               wild fight old campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder 
               but keeps hacking with his sword hamish batters down two

               the magistrate and his men dont like this where did he go

               which way will he come from and then they hear the horses 
               and see the other scots at the head of the main street the 
               soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them

               they are loading to fire again when wallace runs in  on 
               foot  and cuts down two soldiers the other scots charge

               the startled soldiers break and run in every direction

               the magistrate abandoned runs too wallace pursues

               not far along a twisting lane the bulky magistrate falters

               he turns to fight and wallace slashes away his sword

                                     magistrate
                         no i beg you mercy

               in the town square

               as the scots see wallace they break off pursuing the english 
               soldiers and stop to watch dragging the magistrate by his 
               hair wallace hauls him back into the village square slams 
               him against the well and stands over him with heaving lungs 
               and wild eyes staring at marions murderer

                                     magistrate
                         please mercy

               wallaces eyes shift falling on

               the stain of blood

               marions blood in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well 
               the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street wallace 
               spins jerks back the magistrates head and cuts his throat 
               with the sword

               on the other scots

               silenced by what theyve just seen and done on old campbells 
               face is a look of reverence and awe

                                     campbell
                         say grace to god lads weve just 
                         seen the coming of the messiah

               william staggers a few steps and collapses to his knees

               and then not just the scottish farmers but the townspeople 
               too begin a strange hilo chant

                                     crowd
                         ahhhhhhhuhhhhhh ahhhhhhuhhhhhh

               williams wild eyes slowly regain their focus and there in 
               the dirt beside the well he sees the severed cloth strip he 
               gave to marion now stained with her blood he lifts it 
               crushes it in his hand as the highlanders chant for war

               ext lanark village  night

               the villagers are still excited by what just happened at 
               the blacksmiths forge men tend to campbells wound

                         pour it straight into the wound i 
                         know it seems a waste of good whiskey 
                         but indulge me

               they obey then take a glowing poker from the fire and run 
               it through campbells shoulder where the arrow went there 
               is a terrible sizzle and campbell reacts to the pain

                                     campbell
                         ah now thatll clear your sinuses 
                         lads

               campbell looks down at his left hand his thumb is missing

               wallace is sitting alone nearby staring at nothing hamish 
               moves over and puts a hand on his shoulder wallace looks at

               gate rises the messenger spurs his horse to gallop through  
               and is hit in the chest with an axe

               wallaces hand closes on the archers fingers  and bottoms 
               sees that the archer at the other end of the arrow shaft is 
               none other than the highland farmgirl he forced into his bed 
               on her wedding night beside her is her husband holding a

               soldiers wait in ambush edgy they perk up at the sound of

               wallace  suddenly looms up behind them galloping and 
               swirling fire he hurls burning torches into the clustered 
               soldiers setting some of them on fire

               meanwhile hamish has crawled to marions grave and is digging 
               frantically the new dirt parts easily and he pulls the 
               shrouded body out cringing with the effort

               more soldiers rush from behind the rocks at the far side of 
               the graveyard wallace charges them driving them back he 
               grabs the reins of hamishs horse hidden among trees and 
               gallops to him

               hamish hands the shrouded body up to william and bounds into 
               the saddle of his own horse they spur the horses and ride 
               away william clutching marions shrouded body to his chest

               old grave he sees the emotion on williams face

               leads the horses away william starts to dig

               wallace and his friends are starting to panic the blood 
               beats in their ears their breath scalds their lungs and we 
               move in on wallaces eyes he stops gasping

                                     stephen
                         we cant stop

                                     wallace

                                     wallace

                         someone must have given it to them

                                     stephen
                         who would do such a thing

                                     wallace
                         exactly

               wallace pulls out his dagger

               the dogs

               bark frantically now they smell a kill they tug so hard at 
               their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along

                                     handler
                         be ready we have them

               the soldiers grip their weapons ready to take their 
               prisoners they burst into the little clearing the dogs 
               find a body stabbed his throat cut the dogs plunge their 
               snouts into the gore yipping wildly the handlers must fight 
               furiously to tear the dogs from the body

               lord pickering approaches the body and looks down it is 
               faudron mangled now but clearly identifiable  with the 
               scarf he gave william in place of williams own tucked 
               into his shirt

                                     lord pickering
                         damnation damnation

               as pickering rants his men look at the darkness all around

                                     lord pickering
                         after him get them going again

                                     handler
                         their noses are drowned in new blood 
                         theyll follow nothing now

               and just as the realization hits pickering that he cant 
               pursue wallace any further a cloaked figure mixed in among 
               his men leans in from behind him to whisper

                                     stephen of ireland
                         the almighty says for you to give 
                         his regards to the devil

               pickerings eyes go wide then roll back as stephens dagger 
               slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart as 
               pickering falls and his men realize what has happened stephen 
               has already run back into the trees

               pickerings men freeze at this sudden turn of events even 
               the dogs whimper picking up the rising fear of the men around 
               them then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus 
               of demonic bloodcurdling yells 

                                     wallacehamishstephen
                         arrrrrggggggghhhh

               three wild men tear out of the darkness from different 
               directions their swords slashing pickerings men panic and 
               run their dogs yelping and the other soldiers evident by 
               their torches fell with them in all directions

               wallace hamish and stephen are left alone in the heart of 
               the woods howling barking like dogs snarling like wolves  
               and then laughing like hyenas

                                     stephen
                         i thought i was dead when ya pulled 
                         that dagger

                                     wallace
                         no english lord would trust an 
                         irishman

                                     hamish
                         lets kill him anyway

               they laugh again then wallaces laughter leaks away and he 
               stares into the trees where he saw marion in his dream

               various shots  the story spreads through scotland

               two men are talking in a village

                                     villager
                         and william wallace killed fifty 
                         men fifty if it was one

               the same tale is exchanged by two farmers at a crossroads

               to a circle of ancient monoliths there hidden among the 
               stone pillars he finds wallace and his band resting

                                     runner

                         others will not commit to war but 
                         word has spread and highlanders are 
                         coming down on their own by the 
                         hundreds  by the thousands

               wallace rides down the road followed by his band as they 
               pass people on the road the women the children all cheer

               at a crossroads more of wallaces men join them in clusters 
               one group carries something long encased in wool covers 
               farmers in the field blacksmiths at their forges leave 
               their work and uncover their inevitable weapons and run after 
               the riders they put on their forbidden tartans kiss their 
               wives and head off to fight

               ext stirling field  day

               stirling castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field 
               cut in half by a river spanned by an old wooden bridge

               scottish nobles have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking 
               the field they wear gleaming armor with plumes sashes and 
               banners and are attended by squires and grooms

               the mists of morning shroud most of the field but from the 
               opposite side of the bridge they hear the clattering of a 
               huge army moving forward lochlan a noble gallops to mornay

                                     lochlan
                         it sounds like twenty thousand

                                     mornay
                         the scouts say it is ten

                         and we have but two

               the common scottish soldiers

               are wearing padded leather shirts and carry pikes and 
               daggers as through the mists they see the numbers arrayed 
               against them a young soldier tugs at a grizzled veteran

                                     young soldier
                         so many

                                     scottish veteran
                         the nobles will negotiate if they 
                         deal they send us home if not we 
                         charge when we are all dead and 
                         they can call themselves brave they 
                         withdraw

                                     young soldier
                         i didnt come to fight so they could 
                         own more lands that i could work for 
                         them

                                     veteran
                         nor did i not against these odds

               he lowers his pike and starts to desert at first onebyone 
               and then in clumps more highlanders follow

               the nobles see the desertion

                                     lochlan
                         stop men do not flee not now 
                         wait until we have negotiated

                                     mornay
                         they wont stop  and who could 
                         blame them

               then riding into the mob of men comes wallace followed by 
               his friends hes striking charismatic his powerful arms 
               bare his chest covered not in armor but a commoners leather 
               shirt and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses 
               wallace rides a swift horse like he was born on it

               the entire scottish army watches in fascination as wallace 
               and his men ride through them toward the command hill the 
               soldiers whisper among themselves

                                     young soldier
                         william wallace

                         couldnt be

               the common soldiers already having broken ranks cluster up 
               the hill to see the confrontation as wallace and his captains 
               reach the nobles stephen laughs

                                     stephen

                                     wallace

               wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen 
               men now frightened ready to desert we play this picture 
               wallace sitting his horse looking down in awe at this thing 
               that has grown beyond anyones imagination

               he glances at his friends campbell hamish stephen

               theyve got no suggestions theyre just as awed as he is

                         home the english are too many

               wallace raises his hand and the army falls silent

                         the hundreds and if he were here

                         fireballs from his eyes and bolts 
                         of lightning from his ass

                         they make take our lives but they 
                         will never take our freedom

               down on the plain english emissaries in all their regal 
               finery gallop over the bridge under a banner of truce

                                     veteran
                         look the english comes to barter 
                         with our nobles for castles and 
                         titles and our nobles will not be 
                         in the front of the battle

                                     wallace
                         no they will not

               he dismounts and draws his sword

                                     wallace
                         and i will

               slowly the chant begins and builds

                                     scots
                         wallace wallace wallace

               bagpipers play pulling the mob back into companies but 
               through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy 
               army hamish campbell and stephen move up beside william

                                     stephen

                         in the field

               over lifts the reins of wallaces horse and extends them 
               to him an invitation to join the prebattle talks

               wallace mounts up and rides out with the scottish nobles to 
               meet the english contingent

               out on the field the two groups of riders

               meet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff 
               cheltham head of the english contingent glares at wallace

                                     wallace

                         an annual duty

               wallace pulls his broadsword and snaps it at cheltham whose 
               eyes flash in disbelief at the bad manners

                                     lochlan
                         you disrespect a banner of truce

                         today

               cheltham barks at the scottish nobles

                                     cheltham
                         you are outmatched you havent even 
                         any cavalry in two centuries no 
                         army has won without it

                                     wallace

                         that bridge stand before this army 
                         put his head between his legs and 
                         kiss his own ass

               the outraged englishman gallops back to his lines

                                     mornay
                         id say that was rather less cordial 
                         that he was used to

                                     wallace
                         be ready and do exactly as i say

               they return to the scottish lines wallace dismounts where 
               his men are breaking out new 14foot spears hamish eyebrows 
               raised looks expectantly at wallace wallace nods

                                     hamish
                         wish i could see the noble lords 
                         face when he tells him

               lord talmadge at his command post

               the husky english commanders blood boils from chelthams 
               report before he can respond they see wallaces spearmen 
               taking up a position on the far side of the bridge suddenly 
               the scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the english

                                     talmadge
                         insolent bastard full attack give 
                         no quarter and i want this wallaces 
                         heart brought to me on a plate

               cheltham spurs his horse to form up the attack

               ext the field below stirling castle  day

               the english army moves forward toward the bridge its so 
               narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it 
               at any one time the english heavy cavalry two hundred 
               knights cross uncontested and form up on the other side

               with wallace and the scots

               things look terrible stephen turns to william

                                     stephen
                         the lord tell me he can get me out 
                         of this mess but hes pretty sure 
                         youre fooked

               on the english side

               talmadge sees the scots doing nothing

                                     talmadge
                         amateurs they do not even contest 
                         us send across the infantry

                                     general
                         mlord the bridge is so narrow 

                                     talmadge
                         the scots just stand in their 
                         formations

               our cavalry will ride them down like grass get the infantry 
               across so they can finish the slaughter

               the english leaders shout orders and keep their men moving 
               across the bridge talmadge gestures for the attack flag

               the cavalry on the other side of the bridge

               the english knights see the signal banners telling them to 
               attack they take the lances from their squires and lower 
               the visors of their helmets proud plumed glimmering they 
               look invincible their huge horses themselves draped in 
               scarlet and purple look like tanks the knights charge

               their hooves thunder the horses are so heavy the ground 
               literally shakes with the charge

               the scots stand and watch them come on its difficult to 
               imagine the courage this takes from the pov of the scottish 
               lines we see the massive horses boring in we feel the 
               rising thunder of the charge closer closer

               wallace moves to the front of the lead group of scots

                                     wallace
                         steady hold hold now

               the scots snap their 14foot spears straight up in unison

                                     wallace
                         form

               now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks the first 
               line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above 
               the ground the men behind them bracing theirs at a five 
               foot level the men behind that bracing at seven feet

               the english knights have never seen such a formation their 
               lances are useless and its too late to stop the momentum 
               that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on 
               foot now becomes suicidal force knights and horses impale 
               themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers

               talmadge

               can see it but worse is the sound the screams of dying men 
               and horses carried to him across the battlefield

               wallace and his men

               are protected behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and 
               knights wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen 
               out onto the field attacking the knights that are still 
               alive most are off their horses a few have managed to pull 
               up their mounts wallace and his men are so much more mobile 
               than the knights the field runs with blood

               wallace faces talmadge in the distance

                                     wallace
                         here i am english coward come get 
                         me

               talmadge is even more enraged  and his judgment is gone

                                     talmadge
                         press the men across

                                     cheltham
                         but mlord

               talmadge himself gallops forward

                                     talmadge
                         press them

               wallace smiles he grabs hamish

                                     wallace
                         tell mornay to ride to the flank and 
                         cross upstream wait tell him to be 
                         sure the english see him ride away

               hamish hurries off with the message

               the english infantry keeps moving across the little bridge

               the scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback

               they have a few dozen mounted riders none heavily armored

                                     lochlan
                         if he waits much longer 

               hamish hurries up

                                     hamish
                         ride around and ford behind them

                                     mornay
                         we should not divide our forces

                                     hamish
                         wallace says do it and he says for 
                         you to let the english see you

                                     mornay
                              understanding
                         they shall think we run away

               mornay leads his riders away

               lord talmadge

               sees the scottish nobles ride off and shouts to cheltham

                                     talmadge
                         see every scot with a horse is 
                         fleeing hurry hurry

               he drives half his army across the river

               wallace

               lifts his sword

                                     wallace
                         for scotland

               he charges down the hill

               the fight at stirling bridge  various shots

               the scots follow wallace on foot charging into the english

               the english leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack

                                     talmadge
                         press reinforcements across

               the english leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers 
               onto the bridge which only hams them up meanwhile on the 
               other side of the bridge wallace and his charging men slam 
               into the english infantry with wild fury the english fall 
               back on each other further blocking the bridge

               up on the hilltop

               the nobles look back with grudging admiration

                                     mornay
                         hes taking the bloody bridge the 
                         english cant get across hes evened 
                         the odds at one stroke

               with rising desire to join the bandwagon the nobles spur

               down on the plain wallace and the attacking men drive the 
               english back killing as they go the scots reach the bridge 
               itself the waters below it run red with blood

               talmadge has begun to panic

                                     talmadge
                         use the archers

                                     general

                         own men

               on the bridge

               the scots are carving their way through the english soldiers 
               nothing can stop them wallace is relentless each time he 
               swings a head flies or an arm hamish and stephen fight 
               beside him swinging the broadsword with both hands old 
               campbell loses his shield in the grappling an english 
               swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand but 
               campbell batters him to the ground with his right and stabs 
               him reaching the english side of the bridge the scots begin 
               to build a barrier with the dead bodies

               the english are not without courage cheltham leads a 
               desperate counterattack the scots make an impenetrable 
               barrier of slashing blades still cheltham keeps coming 
               wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet 
               his hair and his brain

               talmadge has seen enough he gallops away the remaining 
               english general tries to save the army

                                     general
                         we are still five thousand rally

               the english try to form up but the scottish horsemen fording 
               the river high upstream come crashing into the english flank 
               and ride over the surprised english infantry

               at the bridge wallace

               sees the scottish nobles attacking the english soldiers are 
               in utter panic running and being cut down on all sides

               and the scottish soldiers taste something scots have not 
               tasted for a hundred years victory even while finishing 
               off the last of the english soldiers they begin their highlow 
               chant even the noblemen take up the chant

               wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle bodies 
               on the field soldiers lying impaled stacks of bodies on 
               the bridge the bridge slick with blood

               before it can all sink in william is lifted on the shoulders 
               of his men

                                     scottish soldiers

               int castle  great hall  day

               william kneels before one of scotlands ancient elders who 
               lifts a silver sword and dubs williams shoulders

                                     elder
                         i knight thee sir william wallace

               william rises and faces the great hall crowded with hundreds 
               of new admirers as well as his old friends in their new 
               clothes and armor the crowd chants 

                                     crowd
                         wallace wallace

               wallace lifts his eyes taking it all in at the rear of the 
               hall is a balcony backed by a magnificent sunlit stained 
               glass window and in the center of its rainbow corona he 
               sees a familiar form marion so real to him in this moment 
               of triumph that he can see her glowing like an angel in a 
               gown worthy of the occasion but the illusion wont last in 
               the blink of an eye she is gone and wallace hears the chant 
               and fingers the cloth she gave him

               int scottish council  day

               the nobles of scotland are gathered in the huge chamber a 
               massive table runs across the far end of the room and aligned 
               on either side are the two rival factions of nobles glaring 
               at each other old craig is in the center with young robert 
               the bruce on his right there is a general murmur along the 
               nobles and robert whispers to craig

                                     robert
                         does anyone know his politics

                                     craig
                         no but his weight with the commoners 
                         could unbalance everything the 
                         balliols will kiss his ass so we 
                         must

               a court stewards steps in and formally announces

                                     steward
                         lords of scotland sir william 
                         wallace

               the nobles on each side of the table try to outdo each other 
               in their acclamation as wallace strides in flanked by hamish 
               campbell and stephen splendid in their tartans

               old craig rises

                                     craig
                         sir william in the name of god we 
                         declare and appoint thee high 
                         protector of scotland and thy 
                         captains as aides decamp

               the nobles rise court attendants hurry to wallace and drape 
               a golden chain of office around his neck wallace takes the 
               three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the 
               necks of his friends as once again the nobles applaud

               almost before the applause dies a member of the balliol 
               clan who has kept an open seat beside him speaks up

                                     balliol
                         sir william inasmuch as you and 
                         your captains hail from a region 
                         long known to support the balliol 
                         clan may we invite you to join us

               but wallaces gaze has locked onto robert the bruce who 
               stares back the two young lions instantly recognizing the 
               leadership power of each other

                                     wallace
                         you are robert the bruce

                                     robert the bruce

                         my father fought in support of yours

               the balliols shrivel the nobles on the bruce side can barely 
               keep from grinning suddenly the men on the other end of the 
               table change their attack

                                     balliol
                         with this new success the result of 
                         all of scotlands efforts now is 
                         the time to declare a king

                                     mornay
                         then you are prepared to recognize 
                         our legitimate succession

                                     balliol

                         the true claim i demand consideration 
                         of these documents

               wallace glances again at the bruce who suddenly feels ashamed 
               of the bickering

                                     mornay
                         those were lies when they were 
                         written our documents prove 
                         absolutely that 

               suddenly wallace turns his back and walks toward the door

                                     craig
                         sir william where are you going

                                     william

                         free one price  courage

               he turns again and strides toward the door

                                     craig
                         but what will you do

                                     wallace
                         i will invade england and defeat 
                         the english on their own ground

                                     craig
                         invade thats impossible it 

               wallace slings out his broadsword and moves down the length 
               of the table bashing the succession documents into the laps 
               of the nobles

                                     wallace
                         listen to me longshanks understands 
                         this this

               he brandishes the broadsword

                                     wallace
                         there is a difference between us 
                         you think the people of this country 
                         exist to provide you with position 
                         i think your position exists to 
                         provide the people with freedom and 
                         i go to make sure they have it

               wallace bangs through the door suppressing smiles his 
               friends file out behind him

               int edinburgh corridor  day

               wallace and his men are marching away as robert the bruce 
               runs out after them

                                     robert
                         wait i respect what you said 
                         but remember these men have lands 
                         castles much to risk

                                     wallace
                         and the common man who bleeds on the 
                         battlefield does he risk less

                                     robert
                         no but from top to bottom this 
                         country has no sense of itself its 
                         nobles share allegiance with england 
                         and its clans war with each other 
                         if you make enemies on both sides of 
                         the border youll end up dead

                                     wallace
                         we all end up dead its only a 
                         question of how and why

               wallace walks robert catches up and speaks to him in an 
               urgent half whisper so that no one else can hear

                                     robert
                         im no coward i want what you want 
                         but we need the nobles

                                     wallace

               countryside of northern england it is autumn the foliage 
               is beautiful the wheat fields gold with harvest

               ext establishing york city  day

               he is studying maps and written appeals for help his captain 
               of defenses strides in with another note

                         settlements along the border

               they hear shouts as a rider arrives and dismounts they look 
               out to see a panicked rider who shouts up

                                     rider
                         he advances

               carts rumbling in panic down a road

               as civilians flee the walled city in the distance

               the scottish army

               has cut a huge tree and placed it on wheels it rumbles 
               ominously toward camera

               the civilian panic continues as more people join the swell 
               of those leaving york

               the scottish army keeps coming on

               inside the walls of the city  day

               the governor is furious and confused

                                     governor
                         we will not allow a bandit to panic

                         the city has emptied already sire 
                         only the scottish civilians remain

               the governor turns to his captain with a look worthy of his 
               uncle longshanks the king

               on the battering ram

               as it picks up speed and slams into the wooden gate of the 
               city with the collision the battle is on its a night 
               battle torches flaming arrows pots of boiling oil being 
               splashed down at the attackers who swarm the gate

               the oil beats the first wave of scots back but wallace rushes 
               forward grabbing the ram cart with his own hands the 
               attackers rally to him helping him slam the gate again and 
               again it breaks but behind it is an awful tangle of carts 
               broken sheds impenetrable rubbish wallace grabs a torch 
               throws it into the wooden tangle and shouts 

                                     wallace
                         back wait for it to burn

               inside the city

               the captain hurries into the tower room

                                     captain
                         theyve breached the wall

                                     governor
                         then do as i ordered

               outside the walls

               the scots wait biding their time as the barrier burns

               suddenly they look up in horror the english are throwing 
               the bodies of hanged scots over the wall

               they stare at this in mute shock wallace is frozen his 
               eyes reflecting his boyhood reaction his men rush forward

                                     wallace
                         stop not yet listen to me

                         into attacking too soon dont look 
                         away look

               the scots look at the hanging bodies

                                     wallace
                         behold the enemy we fight we will 
                         be more merciful than they have been 
                         we will spare women children and 
                         priests for all else no mercy

               wallace draws his broadsword the burning debris inside the 
               gate collapses leaving a tunnel through the fire wallace 
               screams and leads the charge through the burning barrier

               int the palace in london  day

               prince edward and phillip his fencing friend and lover 
               hear a contingent of horsemen clatter into the courtyard 
               below they look out the window and see the arrival of 
               longshanks

               they lean back into the room and edward begins to pace 
               nervously

                                     phillip
                         it is not your fault stand up to 
                         him

               edward shows phillip the dagger he has concealed in his belt 
               behind his back

                                     edward
                         i will stand up to him and more

               longshanks bangs the door open and stalks in angrily first 
               he glares at phillip with obvious loathing then turns his 
               piercing stare to his own son

                                     longshanks
                         what news of the north

                                     edward
                         nothing new majesty we have sent 
                         riders to speed any word

                                     longshanks
                         while i am in france fighting to 
                         expand your future kingdom i learn 
                         that stirling castle is lost our 
                         entire northern army wiped out and 
                         you have done nothing

                                     edward
                         i have ordered conscriptions

               a messenger enters and hands the prince a message edward 
               reads it and nearly loses his balance

                                     edward
                         wallace has sacked york

                                     longshanks
                         impossible
                              to messenger
                         how dare you bring a panicky lie

               the messenger has also brought a basket he approaches the 
               central table with great dread and places the basket on it 
               uncovering its contents prince edward is closest he looks 
               in then staggers back stunned longshanks moves to the 
               sack coldly looks in and withdraws the severed head of his 
               nephew yorks former governor

                                     phillip
                         sire thy own nephew what beast 
                         could do such a thing

               the king drops the head back into the sack unmoved

                                     longshanks
                         if he can sack york he can invade 
                         lower england

                                     phillip
                         we would stop him

                                     longshanks
                         edward who is this shitpoker who 
                         speaks to me as if i needed his 
                         advice

                                     edward
                         i have declared phillip my high 
                         counselor

               longshanks nods as if impressed he moves to phillip and 
               examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears

               then longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window the 
               same one edward and phillip were looking out six stories 
               above the courtyard we hear phillips scream as he falls

               edward rushes toward the window in horror he looks out at 
               the result turns back toward his father in shock and hatred 
               and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it

               he stabs at longshanks the old king smiles at the attack 
               parrying letting his arms be cut

                                     longshanks
                         you fight back at last

               then longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury he grapples 
               with edward knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the 
               floor then longshanks kicks his son again and again he 
               exhausts his fury on him

               edward is a bloody mess longshanks coughs up a bit of blood

               he ignores it and his sons wreckage and goes back to the 
               discussion as if this fight was normal business

                                     longshanks
                         we must sue for a truce and buy him 
                         off but who will go to him not i 
                         if i came under the sword of this 
                         murderer i would end up like my 
                         nephew and not you the sight of my 
                         faggot son would only encourage an 
                         enemy to take over this country so 
                         whom do i send

               longshanks calculates

               ext wallace army camp  day

               a full encampment across an english field campfires chase 
               the dawn chill soldiers sharpen swords and spear points

               wallace is huddled with his inner circle all except campbell 
               who receives a report from a scout

                                     campbell
                         a royal entourage comes flying 
                         banners of truce and the standards 
                         of longshanks himself

               wallace buckles on his sword

               an english pavilion tent  yorkshire  day

               set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow wallace and his men 
               ride in wary ready for ambush they surround the tent

               there are two dozen royal soldiers there but they make no 
               threatening moves

               no sound from the tent wallace rests his hand on the handle 
               of his broadsword ready

                                     wallace
                         longshanks i have come

               servants pull back the sides of the tent door and a tall 
               slender shapely female figure appears there there in the 
               shadows she looks just like marion william is not the only 
               one who notices the resemblance he glances at hamish and 
               campbell and sees them haunted by it too is this another 
               dream he pales as she steps into the morning sun she moves 
               toward him her face lowered it is marion

               she reaches him lifts her face and he sees the princess

               william is relieved  and yet as he sees the princess more 
               closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she 
               carries herself her shape the fall of her hair

               the princess is struck with wallace too  tall powerful 
               and commanding wallace dismounts and moves to face her

               their eyes hang on each other she sees something that she 
               has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life

               she surprises him by bending at the knee in a halfsubmissive 
               yet proud curtsey

                                     princess
                         i am the princess of wales

                                     wallace
                         wife of edward the kings son

               she nods somehow she is already ashamed

                                     princess
                         i come as the kings servant and 
                         with his authority

                                     wallace
                         its battle i want not talk

                                     princess
                         but now that i am here will you 
                         speak with a woman

               she leads him under the pavilion a purple canopy shading 
               rich carpets laid on the bare ground watching the gorgeous 
               walk stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg 
               like a horny dog hamish backhands him campbell hamish and 
               stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession 
               shouldering their way in beside the princesss french guards 
               so they can watch wallaces back the rest of the scots 
               surround the tent ready for ambush

               nicolette is among the royal attendants there seeing wallace 
               she shoots a glance at the princess that says ooolala the 
               servants have brought a throne for the princess a lower 
               chair for wallace she sits he refuses the chair

               she studies him taking in his anger and his pride

                                     princess
                         i understand that you have recently 
                         been given the rank of knight

                                     wallace
                         i have been given nothing god makes 
                         men what they are

                                     princess
                         did god make you the sacker of 
                         peaceful cities the executioner of 
                         the kings nephew my husbands own 
                         cousin

                                     wallace
                         york was the staging point for every 
                         invasion of my country and that 
                         royal cousin hanged a hundred scots 
                         even women and children from the 
                         city walls

                                     princess
                         that is not possible

               but knowing longshanks family she glances at a richly 
               dressed advisor a crony of the king who averts his eyes

                                     wallace
                         longshanks did far worse the last 
                         time he took a scottish city

               the crony mumbles to her in latin with subtitles

                                     crony
                              latin
                         he is a murdering bandit he lies

                                     wallace
                              latin
                         i am no bandit and i do not lie

               they are startled at wallaces fluency in latin

                                     wallace
                         or in french if you prefer that 
                         certainmous et ver ask your king to 
                         his face and see if his eyes can 
                         convince you of the truth

               she stares for a long moment at wallaces eyes

                                     princess
                         hamilton leave us

                                     crony hamilton
                         mlady 

                                     princess
                         leave us now

               he reluctantly obeys seeing that she wants the exchange to 
               be private wallace turns and nods for his men to leave

               stephen who has been admiring the ladys beauty nonstop 
               leans in and whispers to william

                                     stephen
                         her husbands more of a queen than 
                         she is did you know that

               stephen moves off with hamish and campbell wallace and the 
               princess are left alone

                                     princess
                         let us talk plainly you invade 
                         england but you cannot complete the 
                         conquest so far from your shelter 
                         and supply the king proposes that 
                         you withdraw your attack in return 
                         he grants you title estates and 
                         this chest with a thousand pounds of 
                         gold which i am to pay to you 
                         personally

                                     wallace
                         a lordship and gold that i should 
                         become judas

                                     princess
                         peace is made is such ways

                                     wallace
                         slaves are made in such ways

               the outburst startles even those watching from a distance

               the princess is mesmerized by wallaces passion

                                     princess
                         i understand you have suffered i 
                         know about your woman

                                     wallace
                         she was my wife we married in secret 
                         because i would not share her with 
                         an english lord they killed her to 
                         get to me and she was pregnant

               the princess is stunned wallace is dead still

                                     wallace
                         ive never told anyone i dont know 
                         why i tell you  except because you 
                         look much like her and someday 
                         you will be a queen and you must 
                         open your eyes
                              beat
                         tell your king that william wallace 
                         will not be ruled nor will any scot 
                         while i live

               the princess rises slowly from her chair moves in front of 
               him and lowers herself to her knees the crony and her other 
               attendants seeing this from a distance are shocked

                                     princess
                         sir i leave this money as a gift 
                         not from the king but from myself 
                         and not to you but to the orphans 
                         of your country

               she lifts her face their eyes hold a moment too long

               later ext field  day

               wallace and his captains sit on horseback at the head of 
               their company and watch as the princess procession leaves

               hamish studies wallaces face wallace notices and gives him 
               a noncommittal shrug as the carriage rolls away its window 
               curtains lift back slightly all they see are the princess 
               fingers but they know she looked back wallace reins his 
               horse away to ride back to camp

               beside him comes alert a small group of riders in 
               distinctive attire are coming toward them what can this be

               guards stay back hamish helps her from her horse she moves 
               to wallace and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding

               have placed a spearmans chestplate against a bale of hay 
               as william cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position 
               and places a bolt in its slot stephen tucks a melon behind 
               the armor

               william aims and fires the bolt slashes through the air 
               and punches through the armor and the melon leaving no doubt 
               what it would do to a mans heart the nobles pale

                                     craig

                         weapon it makes war too terrible

                                     wallace
                         with cavalry  not heavy like the 
                         english but light fast horsemen 
                         like you nobles employ  we could 
                         outmaneuver their bowmen

                                     craig
                         it is suicide

               the bruce sees wallace about to explode and tries to 
               intervene  but wallaces anger is too great

                                     wallace
                         we won at stirling and still you 
                         quibbled we won at york and you 
                         would not support us then i said 
                         nothing now i say you are cowards

               the nobles grip their weapons wallace hamish and stephen 
               are ready to finish this quarrel right here robert the bruce 
               backed by mornay steps between the two sides

                                     robert
                         please sir william speak with me 
                         alone i beg you

               the nobles stalk away and robert draws wallace away to the 
               target wallace shot so they are alone

                                     robert
                         you have achieved more than anyone 
                         dreamed but fighting these odds 
                         looks like rage not courage peace 
                         offers its rewards has war become a 
                         habit you cannot break

               the question strikes deep

                                     wallace
                         war finds me willing i know it wont 
                         bring back all i have lost but it 
                         can bring what none of us have ever 
                         had  a country of our own for 
                         that we need a king we need you

                                     robert
                         i am trying

                                     wallace
                         then tell me what a king is is he a 
                         man who believes only what others 
                         believe is he one who calculates 
                         the numbers for and against him but 
                         never weighs the strength in your 
                         own heart there is strength in you 
                         i see it i know it

                                     robert
                         i must consult with my father

                                     wallace
                         and i will consult with mine

               robert the bruce walks off the field heading the way the 
               other nobles went wallace rejoins hamish and stephen they 
               look to him what do we do now

                                     wallace
                         remember when the english turned 
                         their hounds on us maybe we should 
                         introduce them to our dogs

               int the darkened room of bruce the elder the leper

               in the faint nimbus of the single candle young robert sits 
               across from his leper father the son grips his own head as 
               if stunned by a blow

                                     robert
                         this cannot be the way

                                     the leper
                         you have said yourself that the nobles 
                         will not support wallace so how 
                         does it help us to join the side 
                         that is slaughtered

               heartsick the father reaches across the table then stays 
               his arm unwilling to touch his son with his leprous hand

                                     the leper
                         my son look at me i cannot be king 
                         you and you alone can rule scotland 
                         what i tell you you must do  for 
                         yourself and for your country

               young robert holds his father with his eyes and does not 
               look away

               ext the battle of falkirk  day

               the scottish army moves out onto the hilly plain covered in 
               the gray mists they see glimpses of the enemy in the 
               distance wallace deploys the scots campbell with the 
               schiltrons spear formations stephen with the infantry 
               the noble mornay leading the cavalry and with wallace and 
               hamish on horseback looking over the field hamish sees 
               gazing up at an empty hill above the field

                                     hamish
                         the bruce is not coming william

                                     wallace
                         mornay has come so will the bruce

               hed better the odds look long and its nasty ground one 
               side of the field is ankle deep in water and the english 
               are covering it with a layer of burning oil releasing thick 
               smoke to hide their movements

                                     wallace
                         stephen ready

                                     hamish
                         aye

               the priest from their home village is moving through the 
               scottish ranks dispensing absolution he reaches the two 
               friends who accept the host say their own last prayers 
               and give each other a look of goodbye hamish rides off to 
               join the schiltrons

               longshanks and his generals

               on the opposite side of the field send their army forward

               wallace and the scots

               see them through the smoke wallace spots what hes looking 
               for there they are the ranks of crossbowmen

               and as they draw nearer wallace hears a haunting noise he 
               sees the bowmen more clearly and the english infantry some 
               are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes

                                     wallace
                         irish troops

               stephen of ireland with the scottish infantry

               he stares at the approach of his countrymen wallace appears 
               beside him stephen sees him and is ashamed

                                     stephen
                         so thats where longshanks got his 
                         soldiers irishmen willing to kill 
                         scottish cousins for the english

                                     william
                         their families are starving theyll 
                         feed them however they can if you 
                         dont want to fight them 

                                     stephen
                         no ill stand with you

               loyal to the end wallace signals to hamish and campbell 
               among the schiltrons the formations bristling with spears 
               move forward hamish looks back at wallace both men know 
               the spearmen are the bait here wallace and stephen see the 
               english heavy cavalry advancing

                                     stephen
                         they cant be that stupid to attack 
                         the schiltrons again

               wallace is scanning the battlefield he sees the english 
               cavalry charge but before they reach the bristling spears 
               they pull up and crossbowmen moving up behind the knights

                                     wallace
                         its only a faint to shield the 
                         crossbows

               the crossbowmen fire a volley too hurriedly we see the 
               hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison  you 
               can actually see them coming the bows fall short of the 
               front ranks of the schiltrons

                                     wallace
                         now give em the dogs

               stephen signals and up the slope behind them come handlers 
               with ten war dogs

               huge mastiffs they wear steel collars with razor sharp 
               protrusions their handlers hold them at the end of long 
               catch poles the crossbowmen are distracted from their 
               reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs now as the 
               scottish handlers run toward the english ranks and unleash 
               the dogs fear races through the english line

               the dogs tear into them it is chaos the bowmen cant flee 
               and as the dogs mix among them the bowmen fire frantically 
               mostly hitting each other the dogs collars slash legs 
               their jaws crush bones even when their back legs are hacked 
               off the frenzied dogs keep killing

               wallace signals to mornay with the scottish cavalry mornay 
               does nothing the crossbowmen though taking great punishment 
               are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers and 
               are regrouping

                                     wallace
                         now charge charge them

               mornay tugs his reins and leads his cavalry away

               at the english command

               longshanks and his officers see mornay and his cavalry melt 
               away the english general looks knowingly at longshanks

                                     general
                         mornay

                         for double his lands in scotland 
                         and matching estates in england

               wallace with stephen

               they see the scottish army abandoned

                                     stephen
                         betrayed

               wallace glances to the other hilltop still no sign of bruce

               he looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another 
               volley the scottish spearmen bunched in a tight group are 
               helpless the bolts fall cutting through their helmets and 
               breastplates like paper wallace has no cavalry  and his 
               men are being slaughtered he spurs his horse and stephen 
               and the infantrymen race behind him

               the english heavy cavalry surge to meet them but wallace 
               weaves through them dodging with his horse slashing with 
               the broadsword cutting down on knight another another

               the scottish infantry claws in dragging down the horses 
               hacking the knights as they run by

               the english bowmen are about to fire again but they see the 
               scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim 
               the bolts cut into the infantrymen one bolt tears off the 
               armor of wallaces left shoulder he wobbles on his horse 
               regains his balance and keeps up the charge

               at the english command

               longshanks and his generals are watching the action

                                     general
                         my god and still they come

                                     longshanks
                         use the reinforcements but take 
                         wallace alive

               the general signals and the english reinforcements surge 
               into the battle

               in the thick of the battle

               on horseback wallace fights his way into the watery edge of 
               the field where english infantry is now overrunning the 
               schiltron he hacks men down left and right reaches the 
               scottish center and finds hamish bending over another 
               soldier wallace dismounts

                                     wallace
                         hamish ham 

               and wallace sees that hamish is holding his father fallen 
               in battle wallace has no time to react he cuts down and 
               english swordsman moving in to hack hamishs back wallace 
               lifts campbell across the saddle and shouts at hamish

                                     wallace
                         get him away

               hamish obeys jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward 
               the rear wallace fights with new vengeance swinging the 
               doubleedged broadsword with deadly accuracy

               rallied by wallaces presence the scots surge back then 
               wallace sees the english reinforcement cavalry coming

                                     wallace
                         a charge form up form up

               the scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron

               the spears bristle out ready the english horsemen thunder 
               in but before the spears impale the horses another flight 
               of crossbow bolts cuts down half the scots still fighting

               hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp 
               body of his father to the scottish monks who are attending 
               to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying

               still wallace fights back meeting the english charge the 
               scots hold their own an english knight tries to ride over 
               william he knocks the lance aside and tough the horse slams 
               into him william also unseats the rider

               the rider rolls to his feet william struggles up to meet 
               him  and comes face to face with robert the bruce

               the shock and recognition stun wallace in that moment 
               looking at robert the bruces guiltridden face he 
               understands everything the betrayal the hopelessness of 
               scotland as he stands there frozen a bolt punches into the 
               muscle of his neck and wallace doesnt react to it

               bruce is horrified at the sight of wallace this way he 
               batters at wallaces sword as if its use would give him 
               absolution

                                     robert
                         fight me fight me

               but wallace can only stagger back bruces voice grows ragged 
               as he screams

                                     robert
                         fight me

               all around the battle has decayed the scots are being 
               slaughtered another bolt glances off wallaces helmet a 
               third rips into his thigh plate making his legs collapse

               suddenly stephen comes through the melee on roberts horse

               he hits robert from behind knocking him down and jumps to 
               the ground to try and lift william onto the horse

               robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up sighting out 
               wallace taking careful aim bruce leaps up and helps stephen 
               sling wallace onto the back of the horse even covers him 
               with his shield deflecting another bolt fired at wallace 
               as stephen mounts too

               as the horse plunges away into the smoke robert falls to 
               the water his own troops reach him realize who he is see 
               the horrible expression on his face and race on after the 
               scots

               robert is left alone on his knees in the water the fire 
               and noise of battle now dim to him as if his senses have 
               died along with his heart

               longshanks

               looks over the battlefield strewn with the bodies of the 
               scottish dead for now he is satisfied

               ext road  sunset

               remnants of the defeated army straggle past wallace and 
               stephen are trying to help hamish carry his father but now 
               old campbell says

                                     campbell
                         son i want to die on the ground

               but as they tilt old campbell onto the ground he grabs at 
               something that starts to fall from the wound in his stomach

                                     campbell
                         whew thatll clear your sinuses 
                         goodbye boys

                                     hamish
                         no youre going to live

                                     campbell
                         i dont think i can do without one 
                         of those whatever it is

               hamish is too griefstricken to speak

                                     wallace
                         you were like my father

               old campbell rallies one more time for this

                                     campbell
                         and glad to die like him so 
                         you could be the men you are all of 
                         ya

               the last three words to hamish telling him hes a hero too

                                     campbell
                         im a happy man

               hamish is weeping when he looks up again his father has 
               died we pull back from them in tableaux with the army the 
               people of scotland the whole gray world in defeat

               wallace still bloody and in his battered armor removes the 
               chain of office from beneath his breastplate lays it onto 
               the table in front of craig and the other nobles and walks 
               from the room hamish and stephen see the satisfaction on

               wallace is in the woods in the grove of trees looking at 
               marions hidden grave the rain falls on his face like tears 
               but he has no tears of his own the cold the icy rain the 
               wounds nothing seems to touch him

               with his fingertips he carefully draws her embroidered cloth 
               from beneath his breastplate hanging in his trembling hands 
               filthy with the grime and gore of battle it looks impossibly 
               white something from a better purer world

               ext the princess scottish castle  day

               locharmbie is a small picturesque castle on a hillside as 
               the queens entourage moves through the gates they close 
               behind her she steps out of the carriage and moves into

               int castle  the great hall  day

               inside the great hall are thirty killers led by their chief 
               assassin a cutthroat with a mangled eye

                                     chief assassin

                         would not suspect

                         traitors pass it on all thats left 
                         is for you to say where

               ext marions grove  night

               wallace is in the grove of trees where marion is buried

               drinking in the silence his own isolation he hears a rustle 
               behind him and spins drawing the broadsword then his face 
               registers its hamish and stephen

               hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here  
               unsure until wallace moves to them and hugs them

               int cave  night

               they are in the old secret cave rain is falling but its 
               dry inside with a campfire smoldering at the entrance

                                     wallace
                         thanks for the food and drink and 
                         for bringing em yourselves

                         live if we cant fight beside ya

               stephen pulls a jug of whiskey from his pocket he swigs 
               hands it to hamish for a chug then to wallace who declines 
               but smiles for the first time in many weeks

                                     hamish
                         there is one thing william 
                         longshanks is offering a truce he 
                         has dispatched his daughterinlaw 
                         as his emissary and she has sent 
                         word that she wishes to meet you  
                         in a barn

               wallace frowns a barn

               ext a barn in the scottish countryside  day

               hauntingly similar to the one in wallaces childhood as he 
               sits on his horse and looks at the place surmounted by a 
               white flag of truce it gives him a chill but in full view 
               of the barn he hands hamish his sword and rides forward

               inside the barn

               are the assassins killing knives ready

                                     chief assassin
                         its william wallace sure and 
                         hes given up his sword be ready

               they position themselves at every entrance

               outside the barn

               wallace reaches the barn dismounts and moves toward the 
               door but suddenly instead of entering he grabs the heavy 
               bar and seals the door at this motion scots spring from 
               the woods in all directions the assassins inside realize 
               the ambush is being turned on them but its too late they 
               hear the entrance being sealed from the outside

               more scots led by stephen scramble up from hiding place 
               tinderdry brush and pitch against the barn and set it on 
               fire in moments the entire barn is blazing the scots stand 
               back and watch the barn burn their faces lit by the flames 
               after awhile there are no more screams from inside

               ext castle  night

               the princess sees the burning off in the distance like a 
               bonfire she stands on the wall looking out at it and then 
               she sees on a hillside silhouetted against the night and 
               the fire a rider just sitting there on his horse looking 
               at the castle she runs into the castle up the stairs and 
               stands on the pinnacle of the castle so that she too is 
               silhouetted and he can see her

               the lone rider is william wallace

               close  a candle

               being placed in a window of the stable cottage built into 
               the outer wall of the castle at a distance the candle burns 
               like a tiny beacon and william sees it

               inside the stable cottage the princess

               sits alone wondering if her signal is going to work

               outside the castle

               wallace climbs the castle wall hand over hand up the mortared 
               stones to the window twenty feet above the ground

               he reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the 
               ledge he looks through the window and sees her inside

               inside the room she looks up and sees him there the first 
               glance frightens her and yet she expected him prayed for 
               him to come now for a long long moment the two of them 
               look at each other through the glass each realizing the 
               implications of this moment

               she moves to the window and opens it the wind rushing through 
               extinguishes the candle and he slips inside they face each 
               other in the darkness then she strikes a match and relights 
               the candle and they look at each other

                                     wallace
                         a meeting in a barn it had to be a 
                         trap and only you would know i would 
                         be aware of it

                                     princess
                         it does me good to see you

                                     william
                         i am much diminished since we met

               she wants to say something  but instead she says something 
               else

                                     princess
                         there will be a new shipment of 
                         supplies coming north next month 
                         food and weapons they will trav 

                                     william
                         no stop i didnt come here for 
                         that

                                     princess
                         then why did you come

                                     wallace
                         why did you

                                     princess
                         because of the way youre looking at 
                         me now the same way as when we 
                         met

               he turns his face away gently she pulls it back

                                     princess
                         i know you looked at me and saw 
                         her

               he twists back toward the window

                                     princess
                         you must forgive me what i feel no 
                         man has ever looked at me as you 
                         did

               surprised he looks at her now

                                     wallace
                         you have you have a husband

                                     princess
                         i have taken vows more than one 
                         ive vowed faithfulness to my husband 
                         and sworn to give him a son and i 
                         cannot keep both promises

               slowly it starts to dawn on him what shes asking and an 
               unexpected smile plays at his lips her smile lights too

                                     princess
                         you understand consider before you 
                         laugh and say no you will never own 
                         a throne though you deserve one 
                         but just as the sun will rise 
                         tomorrow some man will rule england 
                         and what if his veins ran not with 
                         the blood of longshanks but with 
                         that of a true king

                                     wallace
                         i cannot love you for the sake of 
                         revenge

                                     princess
                         no but can you love me for the sake 
                         of all you loved and lost or simply 
                         love me because i love you

               slowly he reaches to the candle flame and pinches it out

               in the shadows of the cottage bed

               we see the surging pentup passion and

                                                               dissolve to

               the lovers

               their bodies limp they lie asleep entwined the first rays 
               of morning spread yellow light through the room and across 
               their faces

               wallace wakes suddenly sunlight he grabs for his clothes 
               as she wakes covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of 
               bed rushing to the window to look out

                                     princess
                         no one hurry

               he reaches her throws the window open and sees a clear 
               path down the wall to safety he stops and looks at her and 
               touches her face in gratitude she has to ask

                                     princess
                         when we did you think of her

               pausing to look straight into her eyes he kisses her  
               her not marion  and climbs out she watches him go

               ext grove of trees  night

               wallace stands alone in the grove where marion lies

               montage

                wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way 
               to an english fortress the villagers drop what theyre doing 
               and run to follow them we see wallaces face relentless 
               as he hacks men down in the attack with the fortress sacked 
               and smoking in the background we see wallace lead his men 
               away the people cheering him

               ext forest encampment  night

               once again wallace stares at the fire beside his friends

               pulling a tattered tartan around himself he lies down

               longshanks int his palace  night

               he sits by a palace hearth where a huge blaze burns still 
               hes huddled beneath a blanket and coughing blood but he 
               ignores the ice in his lungs his mind is plotting

               she walks the parapets alone lost in her own thoughts

               robert the bruce in a stone room of his castle

               sits staring at the stone coffin of his father the coffin 
               is closed on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his

               he shows robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in 
               scotland the bruce barely glances at it

                                     robert

                         homage is nothing it is the crown 
                         that matters

                                     robert

                         price to all this required both by 
                         longshanks and our nobles pay it 
                         and you will be our king and we 
                         will have peace

               can still see her back and hear her looking at wallaces 
               eyes through the mask she cant quite hold back her tears  
               dangerous tears that threaten to say too much wallace tries 
               to distract her

                         knows what can happen if you can

               tears and the jailers are watching

                                     wallace

                         princess so kind that she can grieve 
                         at the death of a stranger

               she almost goes too far now pulling closer to him  but 
               she doesnt care she whispers pleading

                         lives

               she pulls out a hidden vial and whispers

                         drink this it will dull your pain

                         have them all if im senseless or 
                         if i wail then longshanks will have 
                         broken me

                         torture take it

               on the verge of hysteria she presses the vial to the air 
               hole at his mouth and pours in the drug the jailers seeing 
               suspicious movement shift inside the cell she backs up 
               her eyes wide full of love and goodbye from inside the 
               mask he watches her go when the door clangs shut he spits 
               the purple drug out through the mouth hole

               int longshanks bedchamber  night

               edward sits against the wall watching him die glee in his 
               eyes the princess enters and marches to the bedside

                                     princess

                         worthy enemy show mercy oh thou 
                         great king and win the respect of 
                         your own people

               longshanks shakes his head

                                     princess
                         even now you are incapable of mercy

               the king cant speak but hatred still glows in his eyes

               the princess looks at her husband

                                     princess
                         nor you to you that word is as 
                         unfamiliar as love

                                     edward
                         before he lost his powers of speech 
                         he told me his one comfort was that 
                         he would live to know wallace was 
                         dead

               she leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair the 
               guards flanking the door start forward but the princesss 
               eyes flare at them with more fire than even longshanks once 
               showed  and the guards back off she leans down and hisses 
               to longshanks so softly that even edward cant hear

                                     princess
                         you see death comes to us all and 
                         it comes to william wallace but 
                         before death comes to you know this 
                         your blood dies with you a child

                         the throne i swear it

               she lets go of the old king he sags like an empty sack back 
               onto his satin pillows without even a look at her husband 
               she strides out of the room with the rattling breath of the 
               dying king rasping the air like a saw

               the crowd is festive hawkers sell roast chickens and beer 
               from barrels royal horsemen arrive dragging wallace strapped 
               to a wooden litter as they cut him loose and lead him through 
               the crowd the people begin to jeer and throw things at him 
               chicken bones rocks empty tankards

               we see a former english soldier one of those who fled in 
               terror at the battle of stirling lift a stone from the street 
               and hurl it it cracks against wallaces cheek

               wallaces eyes capture the soldier and hold him piercing 
               his soul the soldier looks away in shame even as the rest 
               of the crowd jeers more

               grim magistrates prod wallace and he climbs the execution 
               platform on the platform are a noose a dissection table 
               with knives in plain view and a chopping block with an 
               enormous axe wallace sees it all

                                     magistrate
                         we will use it all before this is

                         declare yourself the kings loyal 
                         subject and beg his mercy and you 
                         shall have it

               he emphasizes mercy by pointing to the axe wallace is 
               pale and trebles  but he shakes his head the crowd grows 
               noisier as they put the noose around wallaces neck

               we intercut

                the princess in helpless agony hearing the distant noise 
               from her room in the palace

                hamish and stephen disguised as peasants among the crowd 
               helpless too but there as if to shoulder some of the pain

               scotland his eyes are haunted he grips the embroidered 
               handkerchief that belonged to wallace

               on the execution stand

               a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around 
               wallaces neck and hoist him up a pole

               through all that happens now ties hand and foot wallace 
               is strangling the magistrate watches coldly even when the 
               executioner gives him a look that says theyre about to go 
               too far he prolongs the moment then the magistrate nods 
               and the executioner cuts the rope wallace slams to the 
               platform the magistrate leans to him

                                     magistrate

               with great effort wallace rises to his knees the magistrate 
               assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak

               the executioners slam wallace onto his back on the table 
               spread his arms and legs and tie each to a crank goaded by 
               the crowd they pull the ropes taut they crowd grows quiet 
               enough to hear the groaning of wallaces limbs hamish and 
               stephen feel it in their own bodies

                         remains conscious through such pain 
                         enough

               wallace shakes his head the executioners cut off his clothes 
               take hot irons from a fire box the crowd grows silent we 
               see them not wallace as the irons are touched to his body 
               but we hear the burning of flesh then the magistrate signals 
               wallace wants to say something

               everyone hears hamish smiles even through his tears

               rebuffed the magistrate nods to the executioners who lift 
               the terrible instruments of dissection

               we are spared seeing the cutting we are on wallaces face 
               as the disembowelment begins the magistrate leans in beside 
               him

                         come lets get it over with

               but robert holds something  uncurling his fist he looks 
               at the thistle handkerchief that belonged to wallace the 
               nobles start to rein their horses toward the english

                                     robert
                         stop

               robert the bruce tucks the handkerchief safely behind his 
               breastplate and turns to the highlanders who line the hilltop 
               with him he takes a long breath and shouts 

                                     robert the bruce
                         you have bled with wallace now bleed 
                         with me

               bruces broadsword slides from its scabbard a cry rises 
               from highlanders as from a tomb rising 

                                     scots
                         wallace wallace wallace

               the chant builds to a frenzy it shakes the earth the 
               scottish nobles can scarcely believe it the english are 
               shocked even more robert the bruce king of scotland spurs 
               his horse into full gallop toward the english and the 
               highlanders hurl their bodies down the hill ready to run 
               through hell itself in slow motion we see their faces

               and over this we hear the voice of william wallace

                                     wallaces voice
                         in the year of our lord 1314 patriots 
                         of scotland starving and outnumbered 
                         charged the fields of bannockburn 
                         they fought like warrior poets they 
                         fought like scotsmen and won their 
                         freedom forever

               on wallaces army behind robert the bruce charging down the 
               hill to victory and glory we slow to freeze frame and hear 
               their chant huge echoing

                                     scots
                         wallace wallace wallace

                                                                  fade out

                                         the end
