	boston mass  1965

	int high school  auditorium  day

	aaron altman looking almost preposterously young in his
	graduation gown  is delivering his valedictory  he is a
	rare bread  a battlescarred innocent

				aaron
		and finally to the teachers of
		whitman high school i dont have the
		words to express my gratitude which
		may have more to say about the quality 
		of the english department here than 
		my own limitations

	he awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
	discomfort

				aaron
		that was of course not meant to
		be taken seriously  a personal note  
		i am frequently asked what the special 
		difficulties are in being graduated 
		from high school two months shy of my 
		fifteenth birthday  i sometimes 
		think it was the difficulties 
		themselves which enabled me to do it
		if id been appreciated or even tolerated
		i wouldnt have been in such a hurry to
		graduate  i hope the next student who
		comes along and is able to excel isnt
		made to feel so much an outcast  but
		im looking forward to college this is
		the happiest day ive had in a long
		time  i thank you and i forgive you

	this is very little applause

	angle on teachers

				male teacher
		im always so confused by aaron
		is he brave and earnest or just
		a conceited little dickhead

	back to aaron as we super future network news reporter

	angle on stage

	as aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
	semiliterate high school graduates

	ext school yard  day

	clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
	yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
	cuff aaron around

	closer in

	aaron feeling from a blow  his lip bleeding  his teeth
	covered with bloodas he gets to his feet  he is livid 
	something primal triggered by this brutality

				aaron
		go ahead stephen  take your
		last licks
			points at his
			 face
		but this will heal  what im
		going to say to you will scar you
		forever  ready  here it is

	he dodges as they come after him  they catch him by the hair
	and hurl him to the ground  as he gets up he hurls his
	devastating verbal blow

				aaron
		youll never make more than
		nineteen thousand dollars a year
		ha ha ha

	they twist his arm and grip him  his face scraped on the
	concrete

				aaron
		okay take this  youll never
		leave south boston and im going
		to see the whole damn world  youll
		never know the pleasure of writing
		a graceful sentence or having an
		original thought  think about it

	hes punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground  as the
	young toughs walk off aaron catches a phrase of their
	conversation

	atlanta georgia  1968

	int suburban home  night

	jane craig ten years old is in her room typing  above the
	desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
	pictures tacked to each one  her desk has several file racks
	which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes 
	a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side  jane types
	very well in the glare of her desk lamp

				jane
			voice over as
			 she types
		dear felatzia its truly amazing
		to me that we live a world apart
		and yet have the same favorite music
		i loved the picture you sent and
		have it up on my bulletin board
		youre growing so much faster than
		i am that i

	other angle

				jane
			voice over
		am starting to get jealous
		i read in the newspapers about
		the italian strike and riots in
		milan  i hope you werent

				father
			softly
		honey

	jane screams and grabs her heart breathing heavily babbles
	nervously at her dad

				jane
		oh god  daddy  dontdont
		dont ever scare me like that 
		please

	we super  future network news producer

	her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction
	falling back towards the door

				father
		jane  for gods sake
			recovering
		look its time for you to go
		to sleep

				jane
		i just have two more pen pals and
		then im done

			he doesnt get in
		nooo  this way the rotation stays
		the same

				father
		finish quickly  i dont want you
		getting obsessive about these 
		things  good night

	we remain with jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
	troubled

	int house  night

	as jane moves to room at the other end of the hall  a family
	room where her father reads the latestrolling stoneof the
	mid60s  hunter thompson the new journalism the slim
	jann wenner  jane bursts into the room

				jane
		dad you want me to choose my words
		so carefully and then you just throw
		a word like obsessive at me  now
		unless im wrong and
			enunciating
		please correct me if i am obsession
		is practically a psychiatric term
		concerning people who dont have anything
		else but the object of their obsession 
		who cant stop and do anything else  well
		here i am stopping to tell you this  okay
		so would you please try and be a little
		more precise instead of calling a person
		something like obsessive

	she advances furiously on her father since even this strung out
	even with two additional pen pal letters to get off she had
	enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
	the room  she exits the room into black

	stay on black as we begin main titles

	over ext small midwestern city  day

	emerging from the blackness  jane craig  now a
	twentyeightyearold woman  a long speed walker wearing a
	jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued  the kind
	of gear only possessed by someone who runs at offhours  the
	jacket itself is a wishihadit souvenir from some important
	news assignment the sort of treasure you love about all else
	yet never mention  she stops running as she feeds quarters into
	the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines  getting seven
	different papers before moving on

	int motel room  day

	as she enters from the bathroom having showered and dressed
	the sun is jus now rising  she sits next to her phone

	insert  janes room

	the filofax book is almost an additional character  a crucial
	handfashioned tool of janes trade  she flicks at a page 
	takes down a typewritten sheet scotchtaped to it showing the
	room number of her crew and reporter

	on jane

	as she dials one room number

	she hangs up  takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moments solitude  she sits stiffly palms on top of
	her legs  it looks like someone with unusually good posture
	waiting for something and now we begin to see the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry  now she sobs  then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom  this crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine

	int bus station  day

	jane standing behind her husbandwife  camerasound team

				woman three
			os
		im seventeen now and ive been

	the lights come up on the room  the two screens go black
	there is general applause  jane blinks nervously

				jane
		please dont applaud

	on audience

	sitting in groups of three  news team from around the country
	remarkably similar in comparisona great looking woman good
	looking man either young or attractively avuncular and a black
	or hispanic  they still applaud  not yet having grasped the
	sincerity of janes plea which she presses with more urgency

				jane
		please  dont
			she yells
		i gathered these pieces as an
		example of whatswrongwith local
		television news

	the applause stops

				jane
		the excerpts from three separate
		series on prostitution were
		simultaneously broadcast by all
		stations in one city during sweeps
		week  by what bend of either or
		suspension of duty is that broadcast
		news

	she pauses half a beat for possible applause  hearing none
	she continues  an anchorman sneezes  four people shout
	gesundheit simultaneously  they laugh

				jane
		the legacy of edward r murrow

		is in danger

	tracking shot

	as jane continues revealing that the news team now have even
	more in common  they do not like jane

				jane
		yesterdays compliment has somehow
		managed to become todays kiss of
		death  to be considered a serious
		journalist is no longer flattering
		it presents the risk of being labeled
		ponderous or worse yet elitest 
		right

	shot continues

	women playing with their hair young man boredone
	middleaged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie

	on jane

	briefly departing from text

				jane
		all of you know what im talking about  
		were all trying to act together than 
		we are  but we care  so were all 
		secretly terrified arent we

	not a peep  she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
	prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit her voice
	begins to rasp

				jane
		we are being increasingly influenced
		by the star system  the network
		anchormen are so powerful they 
		compromise our last best hope  the 
		current group is clearly qualified 
		tied still to our best traditions but 
		who follows these men

	tracking shot moves to tom grunick

	seated with other members of his news team a young blonde
	woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg a good looking
	hispanic  tom feels a growing excitement  jane is not just
	a speaker she seems a savior

				tom
		wow

	his female colleague looks at him

				female colleague
		oh ive known so many women like
		that  they dont like their looks
		so theyre angry

	back to jane

	fumbling with her cards sunk but game  gamer than she would

	dominoes falling into one another provoking waves crossing tiny
	bridges setting off little fireworks  janes audience applauds
	loudly and squeals with delight

	on scene

	jane between the two monitors  she begins to speak loudly over
	the audience noises of approval

				jane
			loudly

	stray voice  shout good

	other angle

	jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia by the event
	dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart  she takes
	some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return

	wider

	tom the last person remaining in the room  he approaches her 
	she is totally unaware of his presence even when he casually
	mounts the stage with an athletic leap  it takes courage for
	tom to fully intrude himself which he now does

				tom
		hello

	she looks up at him

	angle on tom

	earnest nervous  handsomejust when she needed a mirage
	there it is

				jane
		hi

				tom
		i just wanted to tell you  how great 
		you were  my names tom grunick

				jane
			dumbly
		thank you
			then
		they hated me  i dont hate them

				tom
		well they say if you can reach
		even one person it means something
		and you did that

	jane looks up at his smile  a beat then

				jane
		would you like to have dinner
		with me

	int hotel restaurant  night

	jane arrives at the maitre d stand  she has attempted to dress
	up to the extent that  packing for a shortday trip allows  she
	looks for tom  tom rises from a table and is immediately at
	her side

				jane
		hi  i was worried i was early

				tom
		i was a lot earlier

	they are lead to a table and sit down

				tom
		i kept thinking what a great break
		it was for me to get to see you
		tonight  more than a great break
		maybe just what i neededjust when
		i needed itangel of mercy 
		godsendlifesaverwhat

				jane
			picking one
		i like godsend

				tom
		i havent been in news that long
		ive just been looking for the
		right person to talk to  i have
		about two thousand questions for you

	he notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest  he looks at her a beat

				tom
		its possible nows not the right
		time

	she lifts her head

				jane
		if we could just eat first

				tom
		totally understood  totally
		wrong of me to talk shop after
		the day youve had  totally
		sorry

				jane
		nooo  if i could just have a
		roll id be okay

	she takes a roll from the roll plate  he smiles at her  she
	takes a bite

				jane
		thank you

	ext convention hotel  night

	as they walk along  dumping occasionally and selfconsciously
	jane is feeling a version of being turned on  that is a little
	adrift and temporarily free of obligations  she is open to
	making a memorable mistake

				jane
		another thing i cant stand 
		is this dull

	tom shakes his head almost violently

				tom
		no no no no

	jane looks at him curiously  then

				jane
			broadly
		another thing i cant stand is
		when white house reporters
		bullshit with each other after
		a briefing and then one of them
		has a theory and the other quotes
		it in his story as white house
		sources say

				tom
		that actually goes on

				jane
		yes  my room is down here 
		im not tired  do you want to
		keep talking

				tom
		yes sure

	int janes room  night

	a small good room  her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidencethe quality briefcasethe reams of well organized
	notesthe thick contact book  jane is sitting on the bed 
	tom not far away in the rooms only chair  one lamp is on
	and it serves to place jane in the shadows and cast tom in an
	enormously flattering light  music comes from her miniature
	portable stereo system

				jane
		come oneven im not that
		hard on myself

				tom
		no i really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up

	jane smiles a calming smile

				jane
		i was doing sports at the station
		the newspaper ran this untrue story
		that i was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail  so they
		made me anchor

				jane
		so great  right

				tom
		except im no good at what im being
		a success at

				jane
		how are you at back rubs

	jane shifts her position so that her back is to tom he is
	immobilized by the sudden turn  jane waits just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghostlike clutch of rejection  she moves
	briskly past the moment  grabbing a good night chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return tohisagenda

				jane
		its sort of normal  the way you
		feel  in graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in

	he moves to the bed

				tom
		listen to me  you keep on thinking
		im somebody ho lacksconfidence
		thats not it  i know i can talk well
		enough and im not bad at making contact
		with people but i dont like the 
		feeling that im pretending to be a 
		reporter
			contd
		and half the time i dont really get 
		the news im talking about  it isnt
		that im down on myself  trust me
		i stink

				jane
			levelly
		i trust you

				tom
		i didnt even have the chance to get
		really good at sports  i wasnt bad
		i thought i was starting to do
		interesting features but hockey is
		big at the station and

				jane
			interrupting
		what about the obvious remedy
		reversing things  maybe getting a
		job on a newspaper

				tom
		i dont write

	jane laughs or more accurately scoffs as tom continues

				tom
		but that didnt stop me from
		sending out audition tapes to
		bigger stations and the networks

				jane
		well come on  it is your life
		nobody is tying you to the fast
		track  did you go to college

				tom
		one yearalmost one year

				jane
		so youre not well educated and
		you have almost no experience and
		you cant write

	he nods agreement

				tom
		and im making a fortune

	jane laughs very briefly  then rubs her face vigorously with
	her hands hes making her feel a little crazy  she gets off
	the bed

				jane
		its hard for me to advise you
		since you personify something that
		i truly think is dangerous

				tom
		uhhuh

				jane
			holding it in
		i agree with you  youre not qualified
			letting it out
		so get qualified  you can insist on
		being better prepared  you dont have
		to just leave it as
			mimicking him
		i dont write  im not schooled
		i dont understand the news im reading
		but at least im upset about it folks

	a beat then he mumbles softly to himself

				tom
		whoa this was a mistake

				jane
		just what do you want from me anyway
		permission to be a fake  stop whining
		and do something about it

	he gets up to leave  she follows him

				jane
		well you dont have to start right now

	he turns to her

				tom
		i hated the way you talked to me just
		nowand it wasnt just because you
		were right

	he exits

	int janes hotel  night

	she is on the phone

				jane
			into phone
		no  it wasnt just the speech 
		the same thing happened with this
		guy  i have passed some line some
		place  i am beginning to repel people
		im trying to seduce

	int aarons apartment  night

	as he talks with jane

				aaron
			agreeably
		he must have been greatlooking right

				jane
		why do you say that

				aaron
		because nobody invites a bad
		looking idiot to their bedroom

	she smiles

				aaron
		okay  lets do me

				jane
		sure

				aaron
		okay  i feel like im slipping but
		do people who are actually slipping
		feel that way or is it always the
		really good people who are moving up
		who invariably think theyre slipping
		because their standards are so high

				jane
		this conversation is not worthy of you

				aaron
		id give anything if that were true

				jane
			laughing
		good night

				aaron
		wouldnt this be a great world if
		insecurity and desperation made us
		more attractive  if needy were a
		turnon

				jane
		call if you get weird

	int janes hotel  night

	she hangs up  pulls back the bedspread on the double bed 
	on the other half are papers schedules  tapes  she doesnt 
	clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work  
	the phone rings

				jane
			answering
		i was just thinking it was the
		shortest phone conversation we
		ever had

	ext phone booth

	a deserted welllit area  tom on the phone

	always returning with wonder to focus on jane

	through her hair  opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
	toothbrush brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
	from her canteen  she puts everything back in place then looks

	as he passes jane he leans next to her and we hear him whisper

				aaron
		please laugh so they think im not

				camerawoman
		huh  sorry

				buddy
		cause for the interview theyre
		going to use a screen and disguise
		me to protect my anonymity so could

	the camerawoman punches a button and immediately buddys image
	comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor  hes not
	happy with the image  but works at concealing his reaction 
	gasping a bit of air  trying to touch it  aaron enters
	tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters buddy momentarily
	but again he almost manages to conceal his private rush  buddys
	internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up
	fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
	thoughts

	aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes

				aaron
		its mr buddy felton

				buddy
		yes

				aaron
		thats your full name

		for you to say that in front of
		the president of the news division

				blair
		you think anyone whos proud of

				aaron
		no  i think anyone who puckers their

	breaths as she keeps walking  we hear snatches of party
	conversations ie

				george weln

	jane turns  sees that tom is still looking at her from a few
	feet away

				jane
			badly

	jane starts twitching  she pauses  holds a hand lightly on
	his arm to steady herself

				tom
		you okay

				jane
		yes  just dont say anything mean
		for a while  thanks

	she meets his gaze for an instant  and in that instant loses
	control for the first time in her memory  she looks strange as
	she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval

				jane
		ive got to find someone  its
		important  excuse me

	she walks away

	on aaron and ernie

				ernie

	picks it up and wraps it around herself a bit chilled  she
	sees jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
	too loud anxietyridden voice as she goes

				jane
		jennifer  hey jennifer

	a few words

				ernie

		jane if you want to go ahead  i

	jane moves quickly off awed at the prospect of taking on the
	big boss

	on jane

	as she moves past tom who is talking on the phone eventually
	catching up with paul  in the bg tom has just heard the
	beep of an answering machine

				tom

	one  he reaches for a package of new red suspenders  he takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one  all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman  by the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know hes now

	int bureau newsroom  jane and blair

	jane is not hyper  she is purposeful  organized  even
	calming blair with a little physical contact  a touch on
	the arm to still her colleagues hysterical demons

				jane
		tell george and jessica to try
		and cover everything without
		tom having to ask additional
		questions

				blair
		and bobbie says

				jane
		did you hear what i just said 
		do you have that  take a breath

				blair
			a breath then

	in the bg tom has exited his office and looks about 
	waiting for some indication as to what to do next

				jane
		and the most important thing
		make sure his earpiece works
		have backups ready  thats
		never been more vital  he
		must be able to hear me at
		every second and clearly

	jane sees him  she moves across the room  takes tom by the
	arm

	int control room  day

	jane mounts some steps in the control room  she moves past
	the director and technical crew up to the next level where the
	two news execs ernie and paul stand with their backs to the
	wall and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
	table occupied by blair  now she slips into the large well
	paddled thronelike seat  as we begin music cue

	literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
	immediate access to the field reporters at the pentagon state
	and the white house  in front of her the bank of monitors the
	technical team and past them the studio where tom is seated at
	anchor a floor producer and writer feeding him copy

	angle favoring blair

	as she looks at jane poised to control the complicated apparatus
	of minds and machines comprising the big time network news
	and jane craig is at the helm  blair experiences a flash of 
	emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it

				blair
			sotto to jane
		executive producer  wow

	jane looks at her and in a moment of atypical merriment does
	a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
	graphic reading  special report we hear an announcers voice
	say this is a special report from

	insert  janes control panel

	each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
	her to tom and the field reporters  she presses the button
	marked tom

				jane
		you hear me tom  tom  tom

			to blair
		i told you if there was one thing

	toms voice on speakers

				tom
			voice over relaxed
		i can hear you  i was just teasing

	gulping the air in relief she slumps nonetheless impressed by
	the macho cool as

	tom smiles towards her then  poises himself just as the
	announcers last words clear

				announcers voice
			voice over
		in washington tom grunick

	he begins his report  he seems authoritative compelling even
	in a low key way  we trust him

				tom
		good afternoon  a libyan fighter
		plane attacked a united states
		military installation early this
		morning and was itself shot down
		by american f14 interceptors

	another monitor shows the graphic running  in the bg two

		mr moore im marvin usher and this

		the libyan missile destroyed an army

	int aarons apartment  day

	aaron is seated feet up drinking listening to music  reading
	a book two remote controls are on the cushion next to him  he
	sings out loud with the record as he reads  at one point
	providing his own lyric line over the music

				aaron
			singing loudly
		and i can read while i sing

	he picks up the television remotecontrol device an puts the
	television on the sound off

	on tv

	we see the graphic of the libyan planes flight route its
	missile firing  the us planes taking off and the shooting
	down of the mirage jet at one point aaron lowering the music
	and raising the tv sound hearing tom

				toms voice
			voice over
		the heat seeking missile virtually
		disintegrated the  plane on

	aaron turns down the tv sound and turns up the music

	int booth

	janes hand flicks at the button marked pentagon

				jane
		george youre ready

	on pentagon monitor

		cover everything

	george nods

				jane
			hitting toms button
		were going to george  say the
		joint chiefs are meeting  we have
		george weln at the pentagon

	on tom

				tom
		george weln is at the pentagon where
		the attack launched by the lone
		libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
		movement of military might

	int aarons apartment  day

	where he still balances stereo and tv sound

				aaron
		a lot of alliteration from anxious
		anchors placed in powerful posts

	he picks up the phone

	int control room  day

	as blair hands it to jane

				blair
		its aaron

				jane
		yes

				aaron
		i think the pilot that shot down the
		libyan in 1981 is stationed right
		here  maybe you could get him 
		and maybe tom should say that our f14
		is one of the hardest planes to fly
		theyre nicknamed tomcats

				jane
		thanks
			to tom
		the f14 is one of the most difficult
		planes to master
			remembering
		oh you call them tomcats and in
		the 70s the first crop had a number
		of crashes

				tom
		george isnt the f14 tomcat one of 
		the most difficult machines for a
		pilot to master

				george
		i think youre right  its certainly
		one of our hottest planes

	int aarons room  day

				aaron
		i say it here  it comes out there

	he giggles

				tom
			voice over
		there was trouble with them in the
		early days  back in the 70s

	aaron dials again as we see jennifer standing at the
	white house

				aaron
			into phone
		me again  hi  listen gaddafi doesnt
		foam at the mouth or anything  when
		you speak to him hes not at all nuts
		he seems like a leader  very
		impressive selfcontrolthats
		whats so strange

	on jane

				jane
		right and we have the 81
		pilot on the way in  nobody else
		will have him

				aaron
			voice over
		youre welcome  sow how does it
		feel toi know you gotta go 
		me too  were very busy here

	he hangs up  long shot aaron with his remote controls
	the picture switches back to tom  he turns up the volume

				tom
			voice over
		outlaw nation but strangely those
		who have interviewed gaddafi find
		him in a phrase we like to use in
		this country very presidential

				aaron
		nice jane

	int control room  day

	jane is on the phone  the atmosphere buckling with strain

				jane
			into phone
		just a minute

	her finger hits the tom button

				jane
			to tom
		to state for the message from libya
		then youll have the carrier pilot
		from the sidra in time to
			a sudden shriek
		what  no

	on tom

	jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing

	back to jane

	as she screams into the phone  this is more than volume she
	is overthetop livid her face red neck cords popping

				jane
		we only have ten minutes left 
		how can you talk to me about parking
		problems  no not youll tryyoull
		do it  do it or ill fry your fat
		ass estelle  goodbye

	as she bangs the phone down  paul comments sotto to ernie

				paul
			sotto
		i had no idea she was this good

				jane
			hitting toms button
		fill for a second

				tom
			fluidly
		the latest message seems to indicate
		that the libyan pilot was acting on
		his own without authority from anyone
		else
			into camera directly
		in other words i think were okay

	int studio  eight minutes later

	moving camera from toms left profile towards his right profile
	taking in the production assistant who madly shuffles pages
	even as tom talks on camera the monitor through which he sees
	the subject of his interview at the pentagon the clusters of a
	assistants on the floor and now we continue to circle behind him
	beginning to see the control room in the bg and as we move in
	towards his ear the white ear piece firmly in place we begin
	to hear the barely audible crackle of janes voice as she tells
	him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it

				tom
		so commander it must have been
		a bit tougher today  shooting down
		the frenchmade mirage jet  the one
		you got was a su22etc

	and now all is obscured except the anchors ears the ear piece
	and the red light on the camera and beyond almost an abstract
	vision

	int control room  day

				toms voice
		once again  the libyan government
		has disavowed any prior knowledge of
		the flight  this has been tom grunick
		reporting from washington

	the special report ended jane breathes a breath  she and
	blair momentarily grasp hands  the first talk concerns tom

				jane
		well there were no major gaffs anyway

	ernie scoffs in her direction

				jane

	she exits the scene

				paul
			to the usher brothers
		this was important for tom  theres
		that bonding thing that happens with
		the public and an anchorman during a
		crisis  its not the conventions
		anymore its this kind of moment

	tom enters  he is exuberant

				paul
			to tom

				paul

			to ernie
		wasnt he great

				ernie
		it worked

	man two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
	news theme  a suite meant to have majesty and drive a towering
	composition  the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
	that the two men vocalize other instruments over the keyboard

	int newsroom  day

	as tom makes his way across it  crews are drifting in he
	enters janes cubby flushed with the electricity of the win
	the most noteworthy moment of his working life

	int janes cubby  day

				tom
		youre an amazing woman  what a feeling
		having you inside my head

				jane
			a bit thrown
		yeah  it was an unusual place to be

				tom
		indescribable  you knew just when to 
		feed me the next thing just a split 
		second before i needed it  there was a 
		rhythm we got into like great sex

	jane looks at him and nods slightly  an unconscious spasm of
	truthfulness

				tom
		you have to celebrate with me dont
		you  everybodys going to that bar
		on the corner caps

				jane
		im going over to aarons  maybe ill
		hoop up with all of you later  how
		long do you think youll be there

	tom indicates that its an impossible question to answer  they
	enters the elevator

	ext news building  night

	as several people cross the street towards the bar  tom has
	been holding back on one question

				tom
		its tempting to ask you how you think
		i did
			she starts to reply
		no  im enjoying myself  take it easy

	he starts across the street

				jane
			trying to be casual
		maybe ill see you over there

	indicates bar

				tom
		youll never show up

	he starts across the street  then turns and calls to her

				tom
		jane

				jane
		yeah

				tom
		ill wait for you till seven

				jane
			shouting back
		okay

	tom races to catch up with the others  jane in the distant bg
	pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction  jane
	moving quickly along

	sound of men vocalizing news theme comes up and continues
	through

	ext aarons apartment  early evening

	as jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
	stoop outside

	on aaron

	happy to see her rising fairly soberly to his feet  he applauds
	as she comes toward him

				jane
		really  it was good

	he nods and applauds some more

				jane
		your calling in that information 
		youre the classiest guy i know

	he waves her off and sits down on the stoop

				aaron
		it was strange to watch him  whats
		the next step  lip synching

	she sits a step or two above him waiting to gauge his mood

				aaron
		ive been doing some of the most
		important thinking of my life  i
		wonder if this is the right time to
		tell you about it

	she steals a glance at her watch

				jane
		well whatever you think

				aaron
		i figured out exactly why it is im so
		hung up on getting a chance at weekend
		anchorits because if i do that well
		theyll pay me more treat me great and
		my life will be better  thats why

				jane
		sounds like you may be on to something

				aaron
		which means im at their mercy and who
		wants thatim not going to tell
		you where this thought led me
		anyway well why not  tell you 
		its a happy thing  in the middle of
		all this i start to think about something
		that does nothing but make me feel good
		and makes immediate sense and thats you
		and ill stop here but jane id give
		anything if you were two people so i could
		call up the one whos my friend and tell
		her about the one im in ii dont think
		i should go any further  come on 
		ill walk you to the corner

	he tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner

				jane

		id sleep on all these things youve
		been thinking

				aaron
		absolutelyyou go have a good time
		you have some place to go

				jane
		yes

				aaron
		good

	he grabs her and hugs her exuberantly  takes her face in his
	hands and kisses her full on the lips

				aaron
		well i felt something

	he leaves her on the corner and walks back

	on jane

	as the sound of news theme vocalizing picks up one more
	jane moving quickly hailing a cab

	int cab  evening

				jane
		were going to caps bar at
		seventeenth and vermont
		connecticut is clear on sunday
		take that over to fifteenth then
		around vermont and well bypass

		anywhere near that fast before

				jane
		thanks  good driving 

				driver
		thanks  coming from you i
		appreciate it

				jane
		thanks

	as she turns to enter the restaurant  tom and jennifer exit
	as they confront each other

				tom
		i didnt think youd make it

				jane
		well i thought id check if all
		of you were still here  ill just
		go in and join the gang and you
		two go on

				tom
		theres no gang in there  we

				jane
		well ill go in and have a bite

				jennifer
			as they move off
		i sure know that feeling  terrific
		work today

				jane
			too jocklike
		right back to you

				tom
		thanks for getting me through

	he puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
	camaraderie  she awkwardly disengages waves and steps
	inside the door to the restaurant standing there between
	the two sets of doors watching tom and jennifer walk away

	on tom and jennifer

	as they walk to his car first exchanging a look of reflection
	over jane then bumping accidentally then bumping back a
	look then kissing with passion wrapped around each other

	int jennifers apt  night

	as tom and jennifer rush in locked in an embrace shedding
	clothes even as they enter

	int jennifers apt  night

	we are aware of moving forms

				jennifer
			intense shout
		damn all you sonsofbitches  oh
		shit you bastards

	they finish  a beat then

				jennifer
		sorry

	on tom and jennifer

	tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman hes just made
	love to

				tom
		no its okaypeople say different
		things  they dothe plural threw
		me

	she laughs

				jennifer
		the last time i was with someone we
		went through this awful mutual disease
		questionnaire but i guess it beats
		getting paranoid the next day  okay
		ill go first  i havent

				tom
			stopping her
		it would never occur to me to worry
		at all about you

	jennifer is touched

				jennifer
		you know something  im deeply
		complimented   isnt it strange to
		be deeply complimented because the
		man youre with doesnt think you
		have a venereal disease

	tom slides out of bed naked  she moves quickly across the bed
	one outstretched hand reaching for his ass a free  even lusty
	sort of motion punctuated by her comment

				jennifer
		give me some of that

	he dances away  out of range  liking the action a stupid
	grin on his face

				tom
		wheres the bathroom

				jennifer
		through the closet

	he opens the door and turns on the light in the closet

	int closet  night

	it is a converted room  given over the racks of clothes and
	shoes extraordinarily well organized  tom stands there agape
	various rain coats  clothes for all climates  lots of
	luggage

	she joins him in the closet  holding out a sheet in front of
	her

				jennifer
		i converted a bedroom  this
		stuff builds up  wait till
		youve been doing this sixteen
		years

				tom
		im not knocking it  its a
		great solution  not only the
		storage but you can see everything
		you have

	jennifer laughs  he follows her gaze and sees himself in
	silhouette against the door  his penis prominent in outline

				jennifer
		do you do bunny rabbits

	tom is enjoying himself immensely

				tom
		isnt this a great date

	we hear the sound of scratching as we

	int janes editing cubicle  morning

	jane feeds another tape in  she is taking editing notes alone
	and scratching her arm  she looks worn out  stock footage of
	statesmen move across the small screen  she sighs and without
	realizing implores the heavens to help cure a malady shes yet
	to recognize in herself

				jane
			to herself
		god help me

	people have begun to filter into the newsroom in the bg

				aaron
		jesus jane  how long have you
		been here

				jane
		a long time  i was restless
		will you crack my neck

	he starts massaging her neck as the phone rings  she lets it
	ring for a beat as aaron works on her  as she picks up the
	receiver we hear a crack  she reacts to it at the same time
	she utters a greeting

				jane
		aaah 
			into phone
		 ello  you sure they said the
		management meeting
			hangs up then
			 to aaron
		they want me to be at the

				paul contd

	the men look at her curiously  she repeats herself more
	rationally

				jane contd

	int toms office  late afternoon

	he has been reading from a respectable stack of mail  jane
	appears in his doorway  for the first time we notice that

	int italian embassy  night

	as they walk in  one man looks at tom with a glint of
	recognition  then another  a handshake  a woman introduces
	herself  a small knot of people form

				jane
		its much too soon for you to have
		this kind of buzz around you

				tom
		do i have to stand here in the middle
		and meet them all

				jane
		ill get you through  move and smile

	on aaron

	and now he sees that its tom

				aaron
		why dont you lead  ill just
		follow the flurry you cause

	tom turns  the sharpness of the tone unsettles him

				tom
		what did i do to you

				aaron
		youve made my dreams silly

	tom decides not to deal with the remark  hes jolted by the
	hostility  he leads the way out french doors to a ground floor
	terrace where aaron joins him closes the door and the two men
	stare at the party

				tom

				aaron
		you cant talk about feeling

				tom
		im not buying into any of that  i

		to act as if

				aaron
			finishing for him
		you have the job you have

	the sudden debate is important to tom  but its moving too

				tom
			picking his words
		i made one rule for myself when this

				tom
		i just read about it in a magazine
		and it affected me

				jane

				jane contd

				tom
		its about women who are attacked
		by someone they know on a date
		daterape thats the piece
		well

	jane clamps a hand over her own mouth

				tom
		okay  good move  keep it there

	she continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car
	opens her door and then begins to half carry half pull her out
	she keeps her hand clamped over her mouth  laughing from 
	behind her door and runs for it

	on tom

	his spirits lifted

	on jane

	behind the door trying to hide the glow in her eyes

	int janes apartment  night

	the phone rings janes hand bounces off her nightstand to
	turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
	instead  three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio
	finally the light comes on  janes voice is so thick with
	sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable

	int newsroom  night

	as the regulars watch the evening news in particular the date
	rape piece which is now in progress  tom anxiously eyeing jane
	out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor  her
	face impossible to read as she studies the screen

	on monitor

				uniformed cop

		a man in and he says they uh had
		sex and she says he raped her and
		then you find out theyve been out
		together two three timeshow can
		you prove a crime

	new shot on monitor

	tom and a woman of about thirty  dignified but fragile  she
	looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
	of glass menagerie

				young woman
		it will be a year next month since it
		happenedi never thought id talk
		about it outside of counseling

	on newsroom

	as aaron enters the scene

				aaron
		hi

	he is shushed by every woman in the room accepts this and takes
	up a position near tom and jane to watch them

	on monitor

				young woman
		wed gone out twice and i hadnt
		enjoyed myself that much but it gets
		to a point  i dont know if you can
		appreciate this but where you dont
		want to sit home or be with your
		girlfriends and people had always been
		telling me that i was too picky
		im not  its just you want to meet
		a nice guyso anyways it was that
		givehimachance thing  no it
		wasnt  i was lonely  so we went
		to a movie and when he brought me home
		he said could he just come up and have
		one beer and then hed go  how do you
		say no to that  so first it was
		this wrestling match which was awful
		enough because it got to be really
		a fightbecause im a modest person
		then he ripped my clothes and he 
		forced me tomake love  he stayed in
		my apartment and forced me more times
		 he didnt leave until
			she has started to cry
		i promised myself i wouldnt cry
		its just hard not to 
			ruefully
		you sure have a sympathetic face
			she cries a bit more
		i was so sure i wouldnt do this 
		but the whole thing messed me up 
		maybe more than it should

	on monitor

	as the news piece cut to  toms face  he turns clearing a tear
	from his eyes

	on newsroom

	these watching struck  perhaps embarrassed but riveted  aaron
	is aghast  aaron approaches the set

				aaron
		can i turn on the news for a second
		oh wait a minute  sex  tears 
		this must be the news

	tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
	monitor

	on monitor

				public official
		i dont think you can overestimate it 
		on any given saturday night tens of
		thousands of women are being attacked
		and there isnt much they or we can do
		about it

				tom
			on monitor
		the victims often remain too terrified
		to talk  the police powerless and all
		the social welfare groups can finally do
		is monitor this epidemic of crime without
		punishment  this is tom grunick in
		annandale virginia

	as his piece concludes

	newsroom

	tom continues to glare at aaron

				aaron
		im in a pissy mood  im sorry

				tom
		whats wrong with it

				aaron
		nothing  i think you really blew
		the lid off nookie

	blair moans with displeasure  aaron exits scene  others start
	to congratulate tom on the piece  in the bg on the

	monitor

	we see frozen wilderness  men digging in the ground  clumps
	of people watching them work

	on jane

	probing her own ambivalence  or to be more accurate working
	towards a positive stance

				jane
			to tom
		nice work
			checks watch
		ive got to get a crew off the clock

	she starts off  tom stopping her

	on tom and jane

	now off a bit by themselves

				tom
		so what did you think

				jane
		it moved me  i did relate to it  i
		really did  it was unusual for you to
		cut to yourself when you tear up  and
		that might not have been my choicebut
		its real and it got meand i think a
		lot of the time im too conservative about
		that kind of stuff  okay

				tom
			enormously pleased
		yeah

	he walks back towards the area of the monitor

	on monitor

		differently

				tom
		we sure do  i dont mean it as a
		knock either
			he smiles
		go ahead  ill just say what i think
		and you can disregard it if you want

				aaron
		it just might not work for me because

	various angles  he interrupts  aaron reading from the prompter

				tom
		no  no

				aaron
		no

				tom
		dont let your eyes go from the
		beginning of the sentence to the end
		like that  you dont want to look
		shifty do you

				aaron
		oh god no

				tom
		and the left side of your face is the
		good one  go again  and try to punch
		one word or phrase in every sentence 
		punch one idea a story  punch  come

	aaron does same with the story he is reading

				tom

	outfit

				blair

				bill
		thanks

	a selfconscious look of greeting to paul and shes gone

				bill
		ive forgotten  was she on the list

	paul nods yes

				bill
		this is a brutal layoffand all

		by knocking a million dollars or so off
		your salary

	as bill turns

				paul
		just a bad joke  im sorry  awful
		its a miserable day and that was
		some kind of totally sickjoke

	walks to tom

	some goodnatured laughter

				tom contd

		they thought i was kidding  i told them

	he continues to talk  as the two former colleagues catch up
	their ease returns if not their intimacy as the frame locks and
	the scene slowly recedes into a black bg and we

							fade out
