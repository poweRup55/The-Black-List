             fade in

             ext medieval village  just before sunset

             we see an italian village at the height of the plague  funeral 
             processions decrepit houses with their windows boarded up  
             the stench of death all around

             title  europe the dark ages

             through the filth a knight walks his horse  he is weary but 
             not so dingy as his surrounding a stranger in these parts  
             he comes to an inn where a boy takes his horse round back  
             he enters the inn

             int inn  same time

             the inn is dark and almost empty  a couple of patrons drink 
             silently at tables  behind the bar stands a slovenly barmaid 
             darkhaired and lazy  she scratches at her shoulder on which 
             we see a birthmark  the knight approaches the bar throws 
             money down

                                       knight
                            a tankard of ale wench

             the barmaid pours him a cup of ale  he drinks deep stands a 
             moment

                                       knight

                            some plague were having huh

                                                                    cut to

             int inn  upstairs hallbedroom  night

             the barmaid leads the knight by candlelight upstairs to his 
             room  the door opens inward  the knight stands in the doorway 
             places a hand on the barmaids hip  she pauses a moment then 
             breaks free of his grasp starts down the hall  he laughs a 
             bit resignedly and closes the door

             a vampire stands behind it  not two feet from the knight 
             grinning at him  his eyes are skullhollow and dancing in his 
             head his bloody smile full with teeth  his skin is gray and 
             peeling  the knight turns slowly and sees him

                                       knight
                            oh my god

             the vampire licks his lips

             he is on the knight in a second pushing him backwards into 
             the middle of the small room  the knight struggles but is no 
             match for the vampire who buries his face in the knights 
             neck  the knight screams

             angle on door

             it suddenly flies open the lock shattered

             the vampire turns like a frightened animal  in the doorway 
             stands the barmaid a slayer  in her hand is a wooden stake

             the vampire drops the knight who crabs backwards into a corner  
             the slayer and the vampire come at each other  the slayer 
             spins and kicks the vampire flies back  snarling he comes 
             back at the slayer  they struggle he slips free and is out 
             the door

             for a moment the slayer remains still crouched on the floor  
             the knight watches her  she seems to be making a decision  
             perhaps even knows what is going to happen

             she runs at the window

                                                                    cut to

             ext in front of the inn  same time

             the vampire comes running out the front door  before he is a 
             few feet from the front of the inn the slayer smashes through 
             the upstairs window and lands on him  they both hit the ground 
             and she plants the stake right in his heart

             after a moment we hear a voice

                                       amilyn os
                            the lord giveth and the lord taketh 
                            away  ashes ashes

             she looks up

                                       amilyn
                                continuing
                             all fall down

             there are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in 
             the otherwise deserted street  at the front maybe ten feet 
             away is amilyn

             amilyn is a grinning jackal a servant to the vampireking  
             his garb is a rotted approximation of a courtiers livery  he 
             ambles toward the slayer giggling as she stands

             behind her is lothos the vampireking  his skin is deep white 
             and smooth  he wears a long coat  his dress is not of any 
             era  he is practically upon her before he speaks

                                       lothos
                            you must forgive amilyn  he tends 
                            to drool before supper

             she turns  he smiles almost lovingly

                                       slayer
                            lothos

                            you people will never learn

             she swings at him but he grabs her arm  amilyn laughs 
             obnoxiously  lothos grabs the back of the slayers head brings 
             her to him in a loving embrace

                                       lothos

             he pulls her head back swiftly snapping her spine as her head 
             hits the back of her legs  lightning flashes

                                                                    cut to

             are both obviously noble of birth

             he pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her shoulder 
             identical to the barmaids

             as she grips the stake more tightly an awareness and sense of 
             power sees to fill her  she lifts the stake over her head

             are fairly punked out and not currently attending high 
             school  pike is long and lean has short hair spiked and a 
             taste for long coats and black  benny is somewhat stockier 
             opts for a shaved head and suspenders  doc martins for both  
             benny is clearly the more belligerent of the two  when pike 
             speaks its with surprising wit and reserve  sometimes

                            machete but its not really dead

                                continuing
                            later

             grueller walks off head through a park

             at the same time pike and benny emerge from the theater  
             they pass andy and jeffrey and the two pairs circle each other 
             almost growling eyes locked before pike and benny turn and 
             walk off not quite in the direction grueller took  buffy 
             kimberly jennifer and nicole come out right after  buffy 
             heads straight for jeffrey and they kiss massively

                                       buffy

             ext the park  same time

             grueller walks through the trees enters an enclosed clearing 
             of grass  he hears something stops  maybe his name maybe 
             just the bushes rustling  he looks about him hesitantly  
             starts forward stops again

                                       grueller
                            yo  who is that  dont mess with

                                continuing
                            come on come out here  lets see 
                            what you got

             rustling  no one

                                       grueller
                                continuing
                            forget this

             he turns on his heel ready to drop all show and bolt  wally 
             bessel is right behind him

             wally is a ninth grader small nerdy and recently undead  
             in marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue wally 
             is freshly undead  he still has fat on his face in fact he 
             looks almost normal from afar  but his inhuman eyes and his 
             uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire  and the way he speaks 
             is unearthly  hollow almost detached repeating phrases 
             sometimes almost as though he had never heard them before

             he smiles at grueller

                                       grueller
                                continuing
                            bessel  what are you doing here

                                       wally
                            hi grueller

                                       grueller
                            what are you grinning at  you think 
                            i was scared

                                       wally
                            could be

                                       grueller
                            you think so

                                       wally
                            could be

             grueller grabs wally by his shirt collar and readily hoists 
             his small body up wallys feet dangling two feet off the 
             ground

                                       grueller
                            listen you little worm  i could 
                            beat your head to a pulp for you 
                            just like i did last year you got 
                            that  you got that

                                       wally
                                repeating
                            got that

                                       grueller
                            good

             he lets wally go  wally remains two feet in the air  
             gruellers eyes go wide

                                       grueller
                                continuing
                            what the

             wally smiles even more broadly quietly hissing  he has long 
             fangs made somehow more grotesque by the fact that he also 
             has braces

             wallys hands vise onto gruellers head lightning quick  
             grueller screams

             angle  pike and benny

             crossing a street turning and listening

             angle  jeffreys car

             speeding by everyone packed into it  andy howls back at 
             grueller mistaking his intent  he settles back  the girls

             fade away for a moment  buffy shifts slightly almost a twitch 
             and the spell is broken  the sound returns buffy looks away 
             letting go of the knife exactly where it was

             benny looks down  his hot dog has been sliced neatly down to 
             about an inch  he is shocked

             buffy looks off a little surprised herself

                                                                    cut to

             perhaps in answer we see the same shadowy figure moving behind 
             pike and benny as they continue to walk home  theyre really 
             bombed now  they are somewhere in the hills now and they 
             come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley  a 
             waisthigh concrete wall is built into the side of the earth  
             they stand below a thick green tree

                                       pike
                            ill have it running in a week

                            totally cherry

             pike finishes the bottle eats the worm and chucks the bottle 
             over the side  there is a moment before they hear it shatter

                                       benny
                            when you get your car together

                            and grow beans  hundreds of beans

             benny wavers catches hold of pike

                                       benny

             pike passes out

             closeup  benny

             still waiting to throw up  the figure approaches slowly from 
             behind him  the figure is a few feet away from him when a 
             hand shoots down from above and grabs bennys face

             angle  in the tree

             amilyn sits on a low branch pulls benny up to face him  amilyn 
             has changed his manner of dress drastically  he wears a 
             motorcycle jacket and sunglasses  his hair is punked out  
             benny is in shock as amilyn holds him easily by his shirt 
             collar

                                       amilyn
                            you wanna go for a ride

             amilyn leans back  all the way back falling back out of the 
             tree and pulling benny with him  we see them fall out past 
             the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it

             it is merrick the man from the mall  he runs to the side of 
             the wall looks over  the two are already lost in the dark 
             mist  merrick turns around looks about him  he digs in his 
             pockets pulls out a cross and a stake holds them tightly  
             while digging he pulls out an old stained picture lays it on 
             the railing  stake and cross in hand he stands by pike looking 
             out at the night

             angle  the picture

             she looks around her  she starts doing a routine tentatively  
             then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps flies 
             into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels  
             she rolls into one final flip a huge one and lands a perfect 
             ten about three inches from merrick

             she screams in surprise steps back

             clutch at the ground

             robert berman pops halfway out of his grave like a jackinthe
             box his face dirty and deadwhite  he sees buffy in front of 
             him and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin stretching as 
             to a mothers tit

             merrick drops down behind robert and grabs him raising the 
             stake  buffy watches immobilized

             a pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under buffy  
             they grab her and pull her to the ground  next to her face 
             the face of another vampire a young woman emerges grinning 
             from the crumbling earth

             buffy screams lustily and struggles to break free

             merrick is momentarily distracted by this and robert throws 
             him off and pulls himself out of the grave  merrick falls to 
             the ground and his stake goes flying

             buffy pulls herself out of the girls grasp starts running 
             away but the girl grabs her  buffy remembers the cross in 
             her hand spins and holds it to the vampires forehead  it 
             burns and the lady lets go screaming and falling to the ground

                                       buffy
                            bye now

             buffy runs

             angle  merrick and robert

             they are struggling several feet away  robert grabs merrick 
             by the shoulders and picks him up preparing to bite him  a 
             stake suddenly pops out of his chest planted in his back by 
             buffy  he falls and dies

                                       merrick
                            wheres the other one

                                       buffy
                            she 

             it leaps at her screaming  she throws it off as merrick 
             produces another stake and throws it to her  buffy sticks it 
             in the vampires heart  she dies screaming her face still 
             smoking blood spurting onto buffy

             buffy looks at herself  at the blood

                                                                    cut to

             ext front of buffys house  night

             merrick walks buffy to the door  she is silent slow

                            when the vampires find out who you 
                            are you wont be hunting them 
                            anymore

                            all right

             he hands her a piece of paper

             merrick moves on  buffy goes inside

                                                                    cut to

             buffy shuts the door turns to go up to her room  she is 
             startled by someone standing in her path  she almost screams

             its her mother  she stands arm akimbo looking very 
             confrontational  buffy looks a sight and stands uncomfortably 
             in front of her mother for a moment

                                       buffys mom
                            do you know what time it is

                            i knew this thing was slow

             she crosses out of the room

                                       buffys mom
                                continuing

             her mother gone buffy lets out a small sigh  of relief or 
             frustration it is not clear  she heads upstairs

                                                                    cut to

             buffy stands at the sink washing her shirt  she tries to get 
             the blood off with fierce intensity  she is near tears

                                                                    cut to

             she sits in the middle of the bed in her pajamas the blankets 
             pooled around her  she cannot sleep  finally she lies back 
             on the pillow

             lothos is beside her

                                                                    cut to

                            last night

             buffy looks confused for a moment then remembers

                                       buffy
                            oh  no  she never showed

                                                                    cut to

             int lothos cave  closeup of cassandras face

             she is waking up obviously from being knocked out  she blinks 
             stupidly looks around  she is lying by a pool of what looks 
             to be dark water in a large cave  torches burn around her

             she tries to get up and finds it difficult  she pulls herself 
             up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face

             its blood

             she starts staring with growing horror at her hands  she 
             does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first

             its lothos  he wears no shirt only white trousers and boots 
             the style maybe nineteenth century  no blood seems to touch 
             him as he rises  he looks at cassandra with an almost sleepy 
             lust

                                       lothos
                            i find it restorative sleeping in 
                            the lifeblood of so many  to feel 
                            their souls coursing about me

                                       cassandra
                            whats happening  what do you want

             cassandra turns  amilyn stands behind her grinning  he 
             hisses bares his fangs at cassandra

                                       cassandra
                            what are you

                            are we so strange  so alien to 
                            you  ive seen this culture the 
                            wealth the greed the waste 
                            its truly heartwarming  the perfect 
                            place to spread my empire  honestly 
                            eastern europe was so dead the 
                            communists just drained the blood 
                            out of the place  its livened up 
                            a bit in the past few years but 
                            its nothing compared to this 
                            this mecca of consumption  the 
                            city of angels

             he steps right up to her

                                       lothos
                                continuing
                            what are we  we are man perfected  
                            we exist to consume

             on the world to consume we see amilyn mouthing the words 
             with lothos his eyes to the ceiling  hes heard this a hundred 
             times

                                       amilyn
                            so  do we change this one or do 
                            we just drain her

             cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet

                                       cassandra
                            here look  my gold card  its 
                            your  ill never report it

             amilyn snatches it from her looks it over

                                       lothos
                            she has a certain quality this 
                            one

             amilyn bites the card

                                       amilyn
                            i dont think this is gold

                                       lothos
                            not as singleminded as the others 
                            not as sybaritic  almost thoughtful  
                            shes useless

                                       cassandra
                            no wait  i can be dumb  really  
                            or mean or whatever  i can learn

                                       lothos
                            really

                            swear to god

             he rips out her throat tearing at it with his teeth as blood 
             gushes around their faces and she wriggle twists dies  he 
             hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth

                                       lothos
                            i wish you wouldnt mention him

             slowly cassandra slides down the wall her eyes glazing over  
             as she descends we see stenciled on the wall hemery high 
             school  maintenance only

                                                                    cut to

             int warehouse  afternoon

             grey dusty and long since abandoned  sunlight pours in through 
             the large windows practically caked with dust  old crates 
             are stacked here and there bits of manikins leaning on one or 
             two  merrick sits on a crate reading the newspaper

             buffy enters hesitantly puts down her bookbag next to a pile 
             of merricks stuff including a rolledup sleeping bag  this 
             is definitely not her turf  she runs her finger along a crate 
             picks up a world of dust  she holds up her finger at merrick

                                       buffy
                            fire the help  no kidding

             merrick looks up at her

                                       merrick
                            its not pretty but it does suit 
                            our purposes

                                       buffy
                            our purposes

             she repeats it not with attitude but a dull wonder at her 
             connection with this strange man  she crosses to him

                                       buffy
                                continuing

                            do you know what a vampireking is

                            to lay the groundwork  the vampires 
                            find a community and they feed on 
                            it make it their own  you were 
                            difficult to trace and i think the 
                            process has gone a lot further than 
                            id anticipated  usually this goads 
                            a community into some kind of 
                            paranoid frenzy  but for some 
                            reason nobody here seems to be 
                            paying any attention

             buffy starts a bit awkwardly doing a cheer

                                continuing

                                pathetically following her

                            no  you dont have to 

                                       merrick

                                       buffy

             she starts again

                            into cream of wheat

             gradually buffy gets more into the cheer  the steps become 
             more complicated as she repeats the verse

             closeup  merricks hand

             we see a knife slip out of merricks sleeve  he palms it 
             hands behind his back

             in the middle of her routine he hurls it at her  she catches 
             it reflexively inches from her face  stops dead  then bursts 
             into tears  merrick is thrown off by this reaction

                                       buffy
                            oh what the hell is wrong with 
                            you  you threw a knife at my head

                            one could have done that

                                       buffy

             buffy punches him in the face  he goes flying a good ways 
             lands on his back  his nose bleed merrily  buffy stops

             cans  she moves slowly down the alley toward the noise  she 
             is about halfway down when a rat scurries out from the cans 
             and down a drain

             thirty feet away

             frantically trapped  it hits her at top speed and she 
             instantly rolls onto her back flipping it and hurling it 
             against the wall at the end of the alley  as it hits buffy 
             still rolling produces a stake from her jacket and throws it 
             directly at its heart  the stake punctures the startled 
             creatures chest  before he can so much as grab it buffy 
             throws a roundhouse kick driving the stake all the way home 
             with her foot  the vampire screams sinks to the ground

             burning down

                                                                    cut to

             int pikes car  night

             on the edge of town  the car has stalled at an intersection  
             pike is hunched over the wheel his head down as he listens to 
             the rasping engine

                                       pike
                            come on come on  dont leave me 
                            baby  come on breathe

             amilyn appears in the street in front of the car  pike finally 
             hears the scraping of his feet as he approaches the car  pike 
             straightens up slowly and as the rear view mirror comes into 
             the frame we see there are two more behind him  they are 
             both highschool age fresh like bessel and benny  they all 
             approach slowly

             pike waits for a second his hand on the key

                                       pike
                                continuing
                            this is for the money baby  make 
                            me proud

             he turns the key again and the car roars to life  the 
             headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as pike pops 
             the car in reverse smashing into the back two vampires  they 
             both go flying hurt but not killed

             angle  inside the car

             pike races at amilyn but he leaps up as pike reaches him and 
             pike hears a thud as amilyn lands on the roof of his car  
             pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly 
             punches through the roof grabbing at him  he fights off the 
             hand and tries to control the speeding car

             it cant be done  he goes off the road and into a park  the 
             car careens along

             angle  on top of the car

             amilyn ride it laughing

             angle  inside the car

             pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it  still 
             fighting he aims at the branch  it gets closer

             angle  on top of the car

             amilyn looks up

             angle  inside the car

             they pass under the branch and we hear a tearing thud  the 
             arm stiffens and falls into pikes lap

             the car hits another tree dead on  pike slams into the steering 
             wheel  the guitar case flies right through the windshield and 
             lands on the grass

             pike pulls himself slowly from the car  he is bleeding but 
             not badly  just shaken  he hears a low seething wail from a 
             few yards back and turns around  amilyn is getting shakily to 
             his feet

                                       pike
                            oh give me a break

             amilyn hisses at him then turns and races away snarling 
             clutching whats left of his arm

             one of the other vampires nears him  pike tries to run and 
             his knees buckle  he lands on them right next to the guitar 
             case  as the vampire nears he pulls the guitar out of the

             him again  the vampire bats away the guitar and grabs pike  
             brings his face to pikes as pike squirms

             to one side falls  he starts up at buffy and she nails him 
             with a stake  pike stares at her  she pulls a walkietalkie 
             from her pocket

             beat buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off  she 
             and the vampire meet in the middle  the creature barely moves 
             before she buries the guitar neck in its chest  it falls

             merrick runs up  he is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker  
             he is more modern than he was before but subtly  he sees the 
             decaying bodies one with a guitar sticking out of its chest

             pikes eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into buffys 
             arms

             at it  the tattered end of his jacket covers the grossness of 
             it but it still isnt good

             her arm  its not bleeding much any more but its fairly 
             impressive  pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with 
             her shirt

                                       pike

             pike looks at her a moment as she wraps her shirt around it

                                       pike
                                almost awed
                            who are you

             buffy doesnt look up  the questions seems to upset her a 
             great deal  she even fights back tears

                                       pike
                                continuing

                            till you strike me dead or

             buffy smiles at this though still upset  she sits down

             streets with less ease than determination

             her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a 
             violently bumpy and erratic course through the site  she 
             finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the 
             bike  she hits the ground hard she rolls into it but has

                            no kidding

             she headbutts him with enormous force sending him staggering 
             back  before he can recover she dives for a pile of discarded 
             lumber chooses a nasty shard of wood

             she turns on grueller who is smiling again  there are two 
             more vampires approaching her surrounding her

                            his kingdom now

             they rush her  she takes one on as the second hits her 
             knocking her over  they all three swarm over her meeting her 
             kicks with raking claws  the two hold her in front of grueller

                            you

             he smiles again and leans toward her neck

             the stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise 
             to him as it is to buffy  he falls backward shocked and dead  
             behind him stands pike

             one of the other vampires stupidly goes after pike who runs 
             away  buffy instantly flips the other one over onto grueller 
             impaling him as well

             pike runs more or less in a circle yelling the vampire at 
             his heels

                                       pike
                            i didnt mean it  i didnt mean 
                            it

             wooden shard in hand buffy sprints toward them jumps into a 
             series of flips  she lands with her legs around the vampires 
             shoulders plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto 
             pike

             for a moment pike and buffy lie on top of each other breathing 
             hard  then they get up awkwardly embarrassed by their 
             touching and by their slight arousal

             angle  kimberly

             sitting by the window with her bovine date she watches buffy 
             dance disdainfully

                                       kimberly
                            i cant believe it

             the window shatters by her head a vampires hand reaching for 
             her  she screams starts back

             other windows shatter vampires appearing all around  a couple 
             of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from 
             the other side

             gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the 
             situation  they vaguely herd to the middle of the room

             angle  buffy and pike

             looking around assessing the situation

             angle  outer door

             a student runs staggering in blood spurting from his neck

                                       bloody student
                            theyre out there  theyre vampires  
                            god help me

             he falls to the ground a few feet in front of the doorway  
             nobody moves for a second  then one of the students starts 
             toward the body

                                       buffy
                            dont go near the door

             buffy does instead checking the lifeless body and listening 
             as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through 
             the mist

             buffy steps back as three 17yearold vampire come to the door

                                       1st vampire

             small stakes he has made hands them to buffy  she opens her

             clustered about it  some have keen and eager expressions 
             some vacant halfconscious with bloodlust  they wait

             a figure appears in the doorway walking slowly out  buffy

             desks and twisting her leg badly  amilyn laughs repulsively

             he grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her against 
             the wall in the corner  she reaches for the stake but it is 
             just out of reach  he is squeezing the life out of her his 
             face inches from hers

             he turns in horror letting go of buffy trying to catch the 
             shade  the instant he releases her buffy grabs the stake and 
             in one swift motion buries it in amilyns back

             the shade goes up flapping loudly as it spins  it is still 
             pitch black out  amilyn stare wideeyed and silent at the 
             night as he dies

             amilyn spins dying rage in his eyes  he grabs her  his 
             strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke  
             suddenly screaming he forces her over suddenly with such power 
             that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards

                                                                    cut to

             blood pool

             amilyns body surfaces first now just a husk

             buffy pops up from the waistdeep blood soaked and wounded  
             she stays a moment breathing hard  suddenly her eyes go wide

                                       buffy
                            oh god no not yet

             lothos rises from the pool smiling  buffy is clearly paralyzed 
             by fear

             buffy is suddenly galvanized into action  she throws a few 
             punches at lothos but he takes them without flinching  she 
             grabs at the stake in what remains of amilyns chest  lightning 
             quick lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes till the 
             stake splinters and she screams with pain  he knocks her back 
             on her ass

             she starts moving backward away from him but it is hard enough 
             for her to make her way through the thick gore  lothos 
             contemplates amilyns corpse and his face darkens

                                       lothos

                            you waste time  that is a sin

             he kneels over her prostrate body  she is reaching frantically 
             into her purse  he runs his hand along her body a gesture 
             both lustful and disdainful

             bursts into flame  he holds her hand onto it

             she squeezes it at him the spray catching fire form the cross 
             and whooshes a jet of flame right into his face  he screams 
             letting her go and backing up  hey his head is on fire

             buffy turns and hobbles away

             as he pulls himself out of the pool we are treated to a good 
             look at his new head  it is charred and torn almost beyond 
             recognition  it is so inhuman looking that we are almost 
             surprised when it screams

                                                                    cut to

             gary murray stops in front of kimberly takes her face in his 
             hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the wall  
             crosseyed she slides back down into comatic silence

             she pushes them away  lothos crashes through the trap door 
             behind her ugly and crazed  he picks her up floating a good 
             two feet off the ground

                                       lothos

             he hurls her the length of the room  she hits a locker which 
             opens spilling out someones notebook  the binder falls open 
             inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within

             buffy looks by this time like shit  she props herself up as 
             best she can looks about her  there is nothing wooden nothing 
             sharp within reach

                                       lothos

             andy charges lothos from behind  pike tries to stop him but 
             is too late as lothos grabs him by the face without even 
             looking at him

                                       lothos

             lothos roars  furious he charges buffy his feet just skimming 
             the ground racing toward her violently fast upon her

             she spins on her feet in a flash one quick motion  she 
             thrusts her palm forward and stops him cold like superman 
             stopping a train palm at his chest

             silence  buffy looks directly into his eyes the mad rictus 
             of his face

             lothos stops almost wideeyed as he looks down at his chest

             sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser and 
             a 2

             he steps back staring at buffy  the expression on his horrible 
             face seems to have changed to one almost of respect  her look 
             is unfathomable

             lothos smiles graciously

                                       lothos

             large old sports jacket a baseball cap pulled backward  skirt 
             and sneakers  casual cool but disarming  she carries a
