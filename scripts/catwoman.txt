												 june 16 1995

	in complete darkness

	a cat is heard moaning at first gently then unbearably

	ext   a snowy patch of gotham citynight

	coming out of the darkness the viewers viewpoint glides across
	a moonlit blanket of snow toward the cry of the wounded feline a
	black cat is revealed twitching on its back amid the expanse of
	white the viewer hangs over her only briefly before drifting
	forward

	like mismatched carpet samples the patch of glowing snow cuts
	neatlyabsurdly at a patch of sunscorched desert

	ext   the desertday

	easing all the way into the daylit desert one catches sight of a
	lizard and gloms onto the creatures frenetic path moving faster
	and faster across the parched land until zap the lizard
	kamikazes into a grand electrified barricade

	the viewers viewpoint arcs over the fence way way into the
	air to take in a spectacular view of the sparkling oasisburg a
	gorgeous urban island in a sea of dirt and sand major emerald
	city vibe as the viewer circles the city day turns to night
	lights blast on everywhere and the voice of selina kyle
	insinuates onto the soundtrack

					selina vo
			i do not know how i came to live in
			oasisburg no one ever does but then
			i have forgotten what is and more
			to the point what ever was

	the viewers viewpoint whooshes down into the city to squeamishly
	embrace its majestic tackiness as frightening as it sounds the
	city is a crazed amalgamation of lavegaspalm springs
	disneyland  garish billboards shriek simple messages like relax
	and be happy  people putter about not in cars but in adorable
	golfcart vehicles

	the viewer makes a dazzling plow down the painful neon of the
	citys main street toward an awesome edifice at the end a casino
	andmore to end all casinosandmore a colossal sign proclaims
	it franks fun palace

					selina vo
			the most hot and most top tourist
			spot in the worlda place like all
			places only more so was i selina
			kyle having fun with the fun of
			oasisburg  the answer is no

	the whooshing airborne tour of oasisburg selinas narration and
	whatever holy music is bellowing on the soundtrack all come to a
	dead halt outside a litup room in the middle of a bland office
	building

	int  the stark room of blandnessnight

	beneath a flickering fluorescent a group of unhappy women sit
	slumped in a circle of uncomfortable chairs not very
	spectacular  heading the group in infinitely more upbeat dress
	and demeanor as if on a first date is an ultraperky demon
	named dr penelope snuggle

				    penelope
			we did it weve won over the last
			years there have been super changes
			for women and we should be pleased
			as dare i say it punch hand to
			backproceed to pat there are
			limits though and barbara if you
			try starting your own business
			youll probably fail i say that in
			the nicest possible way whos next

					sad woman
			hi im mona and im a victim

					the group
			hi mona

					sad woman
			my husband tried putting styrofoam
			down the garbage disposal i told him
			he shouldnt do thathe just started
			screaming at me

					penelope
			i have one word for you mona shh
			h its a better for a womans soul
			to take pain than to give it out
			now have we all finished my new
			book

	penelope holds up a hardcover with a lame drawing of catwoman
	the catwoman complex by dr penelope snuggle

					penelope
			the catwoman complex of course refers
			to the fabled catwomanwe all know
			the tale pardon the pun a couple
			years back in whereelsebut that
			gloomy heckhole gotham city a woman
			all done up as a black cat was
			supposedly sighted committing various
			acts of terrorism  whether or not
			she actually ever existed this
			catwoman has much to teach us
			that the pursuit of power turns women
			into monsters and very unhappy
			monsters at that women stop trying
			to be catwomen and start being women
			whos next

	a short sweet pan is made from the sad woman to the completely
	bentover woman beside her she raises her head it is the woman
	we know to be selina kyle and she has been through hell with
	all her energy she aches her voice into a barely audible
	melancholy rasp

					selina
			hello im selina kyle

					the group
			hi selina

					selina
			and im a victim i mean thats what
			they tell me i was brought into an
			emergency room in that aforementioned
			hellhole gotham city scars
			bruises and bulletholes all over my
			body most interesting thing thats
			ever happened to me and i remember
			nothing nothing my mother brought
			me back here to oasisburg to relax
			and be happy just like the
			billboards say but its hard i

	selina is rudely cut off by a melodic chime sonicbooming across
	the city all the women except selina do a giddy pavlovian leap
	from their chairs and race to the window

	disturbing the old mexican hag wobbles before the creepy
	domicile stoking a fire

					selina
			ill let you know

	overcome with emotionfear love anger utter utter confusion
	selina trembles into a bite of her lip she then suddenly
	dramatically lunges across the table and vividly kisses both men
	one by one with a passion they can only barely handle

					selina
			i love you one of you

	selina storms off the stunned men not looking at each other
	shudder for a moment then rise off in opposite directions

	int  the hutdusk

	selina blusters into her hut and snarls to her cat as she rants
	a pacing halfcircle the wall of the hut behind her begins to
	very slowly then less slowly crackle into flames

					selina
			dont ask it was a stupid idea im
			so notacrimefighter what was i
			expecting  that one of them would just
			say oh now that you asked i am
			the man who did all those evil
			things the minute i left the
			casino he probably walked to a pay
			phone to call the hideout and say

	the black cat leaps up out through the window the smoking embers
	of the hut begin to flare up into fullfledged flamage as cactus
	and adonis trudge in behind selina who finally takes it all in

	cactuss new arm looks like a real one only its three times too
	big for his body ugly adonis has two severe bandages on the
	spearcaused holes of his cheeks his voice is now a cross
	between nell and a walrus

					selina

	selina wearily snickersthen bolts to the chest and flings it
	open frantically rummaging around

					selina
			it was herewhere is

	adonis yanks selina by the hair and heaves her from the hut
	selina soars out and skids across the dirt

	cactus and adonis tear through the belongings of the hut in and
	around the chest but the heat is too great

	selina bounds up and races over to her motorcycle she
	frantically guns it nothing happening cactus rips her off the
	hut collapses with a whoosh selina gives it a sad glance

					cactus
			where is it

					selina
			im not kidding i put the disc in

					cactus
				laughing

	tosses her the catwoman outfit she catches it

					cactus
			youll need this now howd you like
			to help me break in my new arm

					selina
			whatever

	selina folds her arms and closes her eyes cactus swings back a
	popeye punch with his fake colossal arm and then punches right at
	the viewer

	int  the hideoutnight

	selinas face aches into consciousness in the catwoman outfit
	pulling out it is revealed catwoman is hanging in air from the
	ceiling of the hideout like a brilliant mobile flexible red
	cords tug separately at each one of her hands and each one of her
	legs  with outraged catsqueals she tries to untangle

					captain god
			quite a little performance you gave
			in the casino todayfor me and that
			other guy come on down lets chat

					cactus
			i got her

	materializing below her captain god fires his mighty remote
	control the four cords simultaneously snap and catwoman dives
	from the air with intentionally comic feebleness cactus holds
	out his arms

	catwoman slams to the ground a foot in front of him the
	unbudging cactus laughs it up as catwoman painfully prys herself
	up

					cactus
			sorrywhat happened to that whole
			landing on your feet thing

					catwoman
			i dontknow where the disc is i
			swear i put it

					captain god

			selina  there are only winners and
			losers you lost we won

					cactus
			car wash captain

					captain god
			absolutely

	adonis pulls the earlierseen lever and the floor opens the
	viewer gets a small glimpse of what looks to be a traditional car
	wash  adonis and cactus tear the battered catwoman down a small
	set of steps and stuff her into a very small red car at the end
	of the line

					captain god
			id love to stay and watch but
			theres always last minute stuff that
			needs to be taken care of before a
			big catastrophic heist  adonis put
			it on video so i can watch it later
			when im feeling more relaxed oh if
			for some reason the damsel
			undistresses herself and she makes it
			out of that contraption do me a
			favor shoot her with this gun

	captain god hands adonis a very traditional handgun he and
	cactus head out hefting a video camera onto his shoulder adonis
	presses the button marked car wash

	with a loud whining noise the car wash gears into action the
	car jolts forward wheels traditionally harnessed in a moving
	track in the car catwoman frantically looks around then
	quickly rolls up her window nozzles on both sides of the car
	spew acid that sizzles into the side of the car

	adonis nods a not bad nod walking along with the car from
	above

					adonis
			she remembered to roll up her window

	moving in and out of the drivers pov the viewer huddles with
	catwoman in the car soap suds and water hit the car as it passes
	beneath the familiar car wash curtain of fabric straps

					catwoman
			once you get past the acid this car
			wash isnt so bad

	suddenly buzzing buffers uncoil out from sides but they are not
	made of brush they are spinning steel spikes that proceed to
	rend the car shredding through the doors tearing at catwomans
	leg

	adonis chuckles tugging out and speaking into a cellular phone
	with his noncamera holding hand

					adonis
			no no im fine weally juth a
			tempuhwary sethback ill be back on
			the runway weally soon

	the car and the snarling but game catwoman continue to be motored
	forward toward a new curtainof hanging snakes the sunroof
	above catwoman automatically screaks open

					catwoman
			oh come on snakesthats just
			rude

	just as the curtain of snakes dribbles through the sunroof
	catwoman does a backwards somersault through the back windshield
	of the car she slithers down the top of the trunk and lands
	right on the trackwhich locks both her feet in

	adonis gives a curious narrow of his eyes to the proceedings
	belowbut continues his cordless chat

					adonis
			but is he good  the last plasthtic
			surgeon i wenth to

	in a helpless enforced standing position catwoman rattles down
	the track a vehicle all by herself another more vast than them
	all buffer of steel spikes thunders in an up and down motion
	ahead  it comes down on the now empty car and completely churns
	it to hell selina is next

	catwoman unzips a little zipper on her leg and fingers out the
	last of the lethallyshaved ballerina figurines she harshly
	wings the miniweapon to a constellation of wires to the side of
	the car wash proper the wires spark

	adonis face drops snapping shut the cellular wavering up the
	gun

					adonis
			im going to have to call you back

	the spikes ahead grind to a nonspinning halt but the apparatus
	continues to slam up and down catwoman clawpicks her lockedin
	feet then launches forward using the upanddown chugging
	apparatus of stalled spikage as a trampoline catwoman does a
	dainty bounce up into a facetoface with a momentarily too
	stunnedtoshoot adonis

	catwoman effortlessly bats the gun away then grabs adonis by his
	cape wrenching him into a ferocious drag up the hideout
	staircase  the viewer moves in on adoniss clamoring head

					adonis
			stop  isnt ruining my career enougth
			for you  what do you think youre
			dewwing  you wanna go out with me is
			that it  hey youre hurting me

					catwoman
			oh calm down youre already dead

	the viewer inhales out to see that catwoman has pulled adonis to
	his disembodied powerpack and has tied his cape to it she
	flicks a switch

	with a mighty explosive whoosh the power pack rockets into the
	air yanking adonis up with it

	both man and pack go hurtling out the hole in the roof into and
	out of the alley and then up toward the stars shooting upward
	with the video camera catwoman cackles up to the comet then
	stops

					catwoman
			i guess i should have asked whats
			the name of the place theyll be
			robbing tonight
				hitting her head

	catwoman suddenly realizes shes wet and goes into a shaking wail
	of discomfort

	int  the alley behind the casino

	catwoman clambers out of the hole to the hideout and wipes
	herself off the young boy she earlier traumatized skips down the
	alley with a new gameboy he stops with a body racking quiver

			hi dont scream please its okay
			i wont hurt you im a good guy now

	the young boy wails away catwoman tries to feebly reach out and

			brock i cant believe its taken you

	unzipping a big black bag he comes around to the couch where
	selina remains a deathly pale unbudging blob

	ahead of them a panorama of disarmingly darkly dressed male and

	the tourists drop their bags and flee away back down the tunnel
	a sweating frank bustles into the frame to join them in their
	escape from the city

	finally found someone they are comfortable with

	selina gently eases through a field trip of small children who

	sunglasses and hangs them on a hook with hundreds of other pairs
	on hooks a nearby plaque reads only fools wear sunglasses
	indoors but then you knew that inhaling some bliss selina
	leans back against a wall next to a thermometer reading 73
	degrees

	she takes in the new surroundings of the fun palace the lights
	are lower as well as the tacky factor a softened esmeralda
	wearing a flute around her neck tugs up the instrument and
	coolly blows  didi and kelly in new uniforms that are sexy but
	artfully subdued mosey up along with male workers also in sexy
	but subdued uniforms all smile in intense discussion

	the viewers viewpoint pans to see dj oink has been buried up to
	his neck in desert sand selina saunters to stand over him as he
	continues to rant she unscrews a bottle labeled nip and proceeds
	to niagara the goo all over his face

					dj oink
			oh sure sure tell a couple jokes

					selina
			whatever you say babe

	selina places a microphone down by oinks disembodied face she
	swivels off in a glide back toward the gate she wears an
	absurdly long scarf that billows up into the desert breeze

					dj oink

	flowing past her

	the viewers viewpoint violently jerks back to thunder across the
	desert floor away from the oncoming cats oinks wailingfromthe
	back head and the perhaps impolite confrontation about to occur

	the viewer then arcs grandly up into the air for a last awesome
	allencompassing look at the paradise of oasisburg heavenly rays
	of sun beaming downward into this perfect image comes as the
	storys exclamation point the figure of adonis limply hanging
	by his cape from his lowonfuelpatheticallychuggingupand
