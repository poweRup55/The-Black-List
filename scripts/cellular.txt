        of her long auburn hair across his face there is no
        response  its as if shes not even there

        high angle  above the canyons

        perched here amidst the wilderness one of the giant dishes
        that relay thousands of calls to a satellite station in the
        sky

        on the sound track we heara cacophony of overlapping voices idle babble  crucial information  and just plain
        talk totally unintelligible  which quickly begins to take
        on the quality of chirping insects  as still more voices
        join in and the volume rises to virtually engulf us

        across the sidewalk and into the parking lot of a small
        corner mall with its donut shop and chinese laundry  he
        takes the exit which leads onto a residential side street

                                 theo

                     i hear them coming upstairs  i
                     wont be able to talk for awhile
                     i have to lay the phone down and
                     pretend to be asleep  so dont
                     talk  dont say a word or theyll
                     hear it

                                 theo
                     i cant stay on this line  im
                     picking people up  im already
                     overdue
                           no response
                     hello
                           no answer but the
                           line remains open
                           theo listens

        theo quickly puts the convertible top up and rolls up the
        windows so he can hear more clearly

        there are indeterminate sounds coming over the open phone
        line  it could be someone walking on a wood floor  theo
        keeps listening as he drives  hes not paying a lot of
        attention to the road  a large trailer truck honks at him
        nearly blowing him out of his seat  he quickly covers the
        earpiece of the phone  but the kidnappers may have already
        heard the sound and have been alerted by it  he waves at
        the truck driver to hold it down  the truck driver laughs
        at him  honks again

        theo pulls around onto the main boulevard again  hes
        bypassed the overpass but not the traffic  he keeps driving
        and listening  maybe shes gone  gone for good

        minutes ago he wanted her gone  now hes oddly concerned
        he listens harder  still nothing  alongside him a black
        kid in a honda has his rap music blaring  theo continues to
        keep the mouthpiece of the cellular pressed tightly to his
        chest to muffle all noise  but he has to lift the receiver
        to his ear now and then to listen  still nothing

        theos pov  the international house of pancakes on the
        corner ahead  his two partners are waiting to climb in when
        theo pulls up

        klinger is about sixty  once a ladies man he has watched
        his looks fade  he tries to hide his years with the aid of
        clairol badly applied and a few shades too dark

        caitlin caruso has the look of a young woman who works out
        five or six times a week  shes completely buffed  she
        compensates by dressing in ultrafeminine attire  pinks
        with lace cuffs and an abundance of makeup

        he gets out carrying the cellular phone which he continues
        to listen to  even as he crosses the street to the bank

        theres silence on the other end of the line

        and theo makes no attempt at further conversation lest he
        alert lenores captors that the phone is open

        all at once he draws up short  he sees something across the
        street

        someone inside  is he watching the bank  the windows are
        pulled up  all theo can see is a silhouette inside

        dozen tellers in action

        he carries the cellular with him  still listening

        int the bank

        theo looks around for some sign of the man lenore described
        with such clarity  theres nobody like that  hell wait

        there are video cameras mounted  surveying the bank from
        all angles

        theo cant just stand idly around  hed attract attention
        he gets on the long line where he wont seem conspicuous

        he keeps the cell phone to his ear and his hand cupped over
        the speaker portion to muffle even the sound of his
        breathing  and he listens hard

        there are male voices distant and unintelligible

        then the sound of some furniture being turned over

        then a womans scream

        finally theres a rumble as if the receiver on the other end
        was being roughly dropped and picked up again

        theo reacts to what he hears while standing in the midst of
        the crowded bank  he struggles to control his emotions

        a deep voice is suddenly heard on the line

                                 male voice
                     is somebody there  answer me

        he walks off the line  still riveted to the phone

        but they havethe line is deadhe has finally lost allcontact with lenore  hes numb with anger

        camera swivels 180 degrees around theo as he experiences a
        sudden dizziness  total isolation sets in  he just stares
        at the dead phone in his hand  which is trembling now

        camera continues another 180 degree sweep around him to
        reveal a very tall man coming out of the vault area and
        crossing the bank toward the exit  his upper forehead is
        covered with minuscule tufts of implanted hair  his eyes
        are deeply set and close together  he carries a large
        leather attache case

        theo focuses on the man  just as he reaches the automatic
        doors which swing open wide  in an instant hes out on the
        street

        theo hurries after him  camera follows

        ext brentwood street  day

        the tall man is moving swiftly along the sidewalk

        theo is directly behind him  the dead phone is still in his
        hand  he realizes this and stuffs it in his jacket pocket

        trucking shot  the tall man walks to the corner with theo
        behind him  the light is red  traffic thick

        suddenly the man abruptly turns looking face to face at
        theo

                                 tall man
                     tell me what you want

        theo struggles to control himself and put on an act

                                 theo
                     my brothers considering one of
                     those transplants and i wondered

                                 tall man
                     you were watching me in the bank

        theo grabs the wrist of the hand that holds the attache
        case twists it hard

                                 theo
                     that looks heavy  let me help you

                   youre fucking with the wrong
                     people mister

        theos instinct is always to hit first  he throws a jarring
        left that takes the bigger man by surprise

        his adversary is stunned but pulls free and uses his thick
        attache case as a weapon swinging it hard

        theo staggers then lurches forward to avoid a second blow
        tackling the six footer low and propelling him off the
        sidewalk and into the path of oncoming traffic  wham

        a chevy blazer slams into theos adversary knocking him off
        his feet

        the car behind the blazer rearends it as other vehicles slam
        into each other

        the tall man has struck his head on the sidewalk after
        bouncing off the hood  hes lying quite still and hes
        bleeding

        around him a crowd is forming and traffic is at a
        standstill  theo takes a step forward and trips over
        something  its the leather attache case at his feet  he
        stoops andpicks it up

        its chaos as the drivers of the stopped vehicles jump out
        shouting at each other

                                 motorist
                     he jumped in front of me

                                 2nd motorist

                     ill go look for one

        he walks casually through the mob thats forming  in the
        direction of his chrysler

        behind him the crowd around the accident victim grows  and
        still no police in sight

        a uniformed guard from the supermarket kneels over the body

                                 supermarket guard
                     hes hurt bad

        an eyewitness rushes over shouting

                     i saw the whole thing  he was
                     pushed  i was sitting at the
                     starbucks over there and i saw it
                     all

        angle on theo

        hes heard the eyewitness  any moment he could be pointed
        out

        camera follows theo to his chrysler

        he gets in and lowers the sun visor to partially obscure his
        face as he turns the ignition key and pulls out of the
        parking space  he makes a quick right into the ralphs
        market lot and heads out the far exit which will bring him
        onto an entirely different street

        he pulls over and turns his attention to the briefcase  he
        fishes in his pocket and finds a small swiss army knife  he
        uses one of the blades on the lock  finally breaking it
        the briefcase snaps open  its stuffed full of loose money
        fifties and hundreds  plus a stack of negotiable bonds
        bound together in wrappers  an impressive haul  theo tries
        to count it but his head is swimming

                                 theo
                     some fucking jackpot

        he closes the briefcase but now that the locks broken it
        wont stay shut  it springs back open  he can barely keep
        the money inside it

        he looks around noticesan indoor parking facilityacross
        the street

        he drives over takes an automated ticket  then pulls up
        the ramp

        he drives all the way up to therooftop parking zone  few
        cars are up here  hes alone

        he pulls into a space

        int theos car  rooftop parking area  day

        he reaches into his glove compartment which is crammed full
        of cds and pushes a button which pops the trunk

        ext rooftop parking area  day

        theo gets out holding the attache case tightly shut

        tight shot  inside the trunk  theo wedges the attache case
        in next to the spare which manages to hold it in place

        we take casual note ofan alternate set of license plateslying in the trunk  before theo slams the lid shut

        angle on theo

        looking out from the vantage point of the rooftop at all the
        many homes and residences in the distance  and in one of
        them lenore and her family are being held captive

        he tries to figure out what to do  should he just keep what
        hes got and take off  he reaches into the car for his
        cellular

        close up  cell phone  as theo dialsstar 69

        hes ringing back the last number that called him  finally
        the call is picked up  but nobody speaks

        pacific coast highway and the beach

        ext pacific coast highway  day

        as theo turns and heads up the coast  camera follows 

        a few hundred yards ahead a boarded up fruit and produce
        stand is closed for the season

        theo pulls off the highway and parks behind the stand  he
        again pops the trunk using the release button in the glove
        box

        he gets out and proceeds to the open trunk

        tighter angle  theo again examines the overstuffed attache
        case that will no longer lock  he flips it wide open looks
        over the loose money spilled out and the bonds secured with
        rubber bands  he begins tying the money up with the rubber
        bands  stacking it  diving it into portions

        he doesnt see or hear the highway patrol car thats quietly
        pulling up behind him  out of focus

        the whoosh of passing cars hides the sound of the prowl
        cars arrival

        still in soft focus

        we see the uniformed officer getting out and approaching

        then theo senses hes not alone  he hears the jingle of
        keys and handcuffs on the officers belt

        he turns halfway and the cop is there  the approaching cop
        is about thirty and his nametag identifies him as grillo

                                 officer grillo
                     saw you pull over  thought you
                     might have a flat

                     leave it open

        turns to face the cop

                     something was rattling around
                     some loose tools

                     mind if i have a look

                     theyll wait  meantime raise the
                     lid

        theo is thinking how lenore described the murderer of her
        driver as a uniformed cop who pulled her over

        then he sees the cops police car is identical to the one he
        saw opposite the bank and near the parking garage

                                 theo
                     whatd you do  tail me from

                     why would i do that

        theo lifts the lid to the trunk all the way up and steps
        aside  the cop leans forward for a look

        he sees the attache case jammed shut against the tire  he
        also cant missthe extra license platesthat lie in plain
        view

                                 grillo
                     lets have your license mister

                     officer

        theo flashes the folder with the phony treasury dept id
        which was to be used in the scam

                                 grillo
                     whats this

                     see for yourself federal agent
                     us treasury  on the job

        as the confused cop studies the impressive id theo moves
        into action grabbing grillos gun hand so he cant draw the
        weapon  then throwing all his weight against the cop
        forcing him close enough to the lid of the trunk to be
        struck hard as theo smashes it down on his shoulder

        grillo is momentarily stunned and cant recover in time to
        avoid the impact of the trunk smashing down again  this
        time on the back of his neck

                                 theo
                     does that answer your question

        he finishes grillo with two brutal jabs to the jaw  the cop
        goes limp

        theo is alarmed as a car zips by on the highway and the
        driver leans on its horn  he fears hes been seen  theres
        no time to delay  he lifts the officers legs and dumps
        grillo in the trunk

                                 theo
                     seems ive got me a hostage

        he removes the cops 38 calibre sidearm from its holster

        he grabs the attache case before shutting the trunk and
        making sure its secure

        some fifty dollar bills fall loosely to the ground as theo
        hurries back to the drivers seat  he doesnt waste time
        scooping more than one or two of them up

        he starts the ignition and steps on the gas  he pulls away
        leaving the police cruiser parked where it stands behind the
        fruitstand

        int theos car  day

        hes sweating now  the attache case lies half open across
        the seat next to him  the windows are down and the loose
        money starts blowing all over the inside of the vehicle

                                 theo
                     shit

        theo quickly puts the windows up but the damage is done
        there are loose bills everywhere

        theos pov  the highway

        as he passes a mobile home park he sees the carload that
        may have spotted him assault the cop  theyre at a pay
        phone  excitedly reporting it  one of them recognizes
        theos vehicle going by and points

        angle on theo

        speeding up

        view thru windshield  temescal canyon beach turnoff

        the huge parking lot is coming up on the left  it seems
        totally vacant  not another car in sight all the way up the
        beach  no attendant is on duty so theo simply pulls in and
        keeps driving

        theres still no sign of the van

        theo looks back toward the main highway half expecting to
        see a squadron of police cars  but traffic remains normal

        he sees a wooden shack  a fast food outlet with large
        colorful signs proclaiming fried clams  fried chicken

                     shit  fuck

        he realizes he assaulted a real la cop on the job  maybe
        that cop is awake in the trunk and can hear whats going on
        but she doesnt know that

                                 lenore
                     sit completely still with both
                     hands on the wheel  until they
                     get here

                                 theo
                     why pick me to be your mark

                                 lenore
                     nobodys easier to con than a con
                     man

                                 theo
                     you knew about me

        suddenlytheres a violent thumpinginside the car  the
        vehicle is shaking  lenore has no idea what it is  theo
        knows immediately

        its the cop locked up in the trunk  hes conscious and
        trying to bust his way out

        the distraction causes lenore to glance toward the rear of
        the vehicle  and it gives theo the chance to clip her
        across the jaw  with the other hand he twists the gun out
        of her hand  even as she is able to fire off one shot  it
        singes theos hair leaving a powder burn across his scalp
        and shatters the side window

        the van has pulled to a stop six feet ahead of theos car
        two men inside are halfway out  a large powerful linebacker
        and a haitian with braided hair

        before they can completely emerge theos foot hits the gas
        his car plows straight into the van stunning both me

        lenore has slumped to the floor of the car as theo struggles
        to back up  hes hooked onto part of the torn wreckage of
        the van

        the larger man inside the van recovers and tries to fire 
        but the clip jams  by the time he slams the clip straight
        theo is backing away into a hairpin turn

        several shots are now fired at the departing chrysler

        tight insert shot  two bullets puncture the trunk  which
        holds the unfortunate cop  theres a scream

        wider shot  theo smashes through a low barricade and plows
        down a hillside onto the beach  in a moment hes driving up
        the temescal beach  a totally illegal route  but the
        quickest getaway path  an old man flying a kite dashes out
        of his way

        theres a ramp up ahead down which beach cleaning equipment
        may gain access  one such large orange vehicle is just
        accessing the beach

        theo leans on his horn  the sanitation dept vehicle pulls
        up short just avoiding a headon smashup with theo who
        speeds by and up the ramp  heading back toward the pacific
        coast highway

        int theos car

        lenore still lies on the floorboard along with some of the
        bonds and the money

        theo has the gun in his right hand as he steers with his
        left  the cell phone is on the seat

        the thumping from the trunk continues

                                 lenore
                     whos in back

                     worse shape

        angle on van

        battered but fully operable  in pursuit

        int theos car  day

        the phone conversation between theo and those in the van
        remains open  theos hands are occupied with the wheel and
        the gun which he holds on lenore in an effort to make her
        behave

                                 theo
                     your friends are probably still on

                     assure them that youre being well
                     treated

        lenore finally lifts the cellular and speaks

                                 lenore
                     nels are you there  hello is
                     anybody there

        the thick voice weve become accustomed to hearing comes on
        the line  now well call him by his actual name  nelson

                                 nelson
                     i thought you said you could
                     handle him

                     some poor bastard for it

                                 lenore
                     he seems to think hes entitled to
                     it all

                                 theo
                     not all  they already have a
                     third  the question is how much
                     of that are they willing to give
                     to get you back

                                 lenore
                     you wont shoot me  thats not
                     your style

                                 theo
                     we might hit a bump and the gun
                     might go off  ever see that
                     tarantino movie  where travolta
                     blew that guy away in the back
                     seat  purely by accident

                                 lenore
                     do you have to point that

                                 theo
                     absolutely  and topanga canyon
                     has a hell of a lot of potholes if
                     i recall

                                 lenore
                     he seems to be headed for topanga

                                 theo
                     im not trying to lose them  nor
                     am i exceeding any speed limits

                                 lenore
                     the one thing you dont want is to
                     attract the police

                                 theo
                     granted the cops are not an
                     alternative  certainly not with
                     one of their own still locked in
                     my trunk

                                 lenore

        theyre reluctant to try to pass on these twisting
        rock lined roads with traffic coming around blind curves
        from the other direction  and theres nowhere to pull over

        then theo jams on the brakes  the van veers to the left to
        avoid total disaster plowing into the canyon wall and

        the second police car rearends the first

        its a total pileup as theo predicted  a perfectly
        orchestrated accident

        then a camper coming from the valley approaches and passes
        theo  rounds the bend and compounds the accident 
        smashing into the disabled van from the opposite side

        at the same time lenore makes a grab for the gun

        the cell phone is dropped as the three of them struggle over

                     what the fucks coming off

        the cop wrestles the gun from theos grasp  then stumbles
        backwards covering both of them

        lenore breaks out into laughter  like some kind of

        halfway between them and grillo

        keeping the gun leveled on theo the cop crouches down and
        picks up the phone  he speaks

                                 grillo
                     nels  you asshole  you almost

                                 grillo
                     it took you long enough to get my
                     ass out

                     worried about me

        lenore walks over to the cop and plants a kiss on him as
        theo looks on  a numbness rapidly overtaking him

                                 grillo
                             to theo

        lenore and the officer make a chilling couple

                                 grillo
                     in case you crapped out it was my
                     job to go after that briefcase

                                 theo

                     me out  that was quite a
                     humiliation

                     its only a few miles and our
                     friend was thoughtful enough to
                     bring spare plates

                     were switching plates now

        lenore has fired the shot entirely for nelsons benefit
        shes conning him just as she conned theo

                                 grillo

                     keep quiet  get him busy on those
                     license plates

        at gunpoint theo is forced to kneel down remove the plates
        and replace them with the ones lying in the trunk

        he uses the same small swiss army knife with which he broke
        open the briefcase

        while theo works at it lenore and grillo confer in hushed
        tones out of his earshot

                                 lenore

                     full of goodies

                                 grillo

                     jesus the shit you come up with

        officer grillo gathers the loose money and bonds and stuffs
        it all in the broken attache case before depositing it back
        in the trunk

        lenore forces theo into the passenger seat in front  shes
        positioned directly behind him  the gun at his head

                                 lenore

        spilling out dozens of cds at theos feet  hes satisfied
        theres no weapon in there  the glove compartment remains
        open

        ext the freeway  day

        cars speeding along at better than 70 mph

        back inside

        close on the police service revolver flipped open so the
        bullets can be removed

        lenore spills the cartridges out in her hand

                                 lenore
                     five  six

                     dont want to lose count

        she tosses the bullets over his shoulder onto the floor of
        the front seat  so theo can clearly see them

        hes still bent forward with his hand inside the glove
        compartment  pressed against that crucial little button

        ext freeway high angle day

        construction ahead  the lanes will soon converge  traffic
        will decrease to a virtual standstill  once traffic slows
        or stops theos threat become meaningless

        int theos car  day

        theo realizes traffic is slowing  hes got to act now
        hes bent forward so grillo doesnt notice that hes
        reaching under the seat with his free hand

        just as he pops the trunk he uses all the force in his legs
        and all his body weight to slam the seat back  straight
        into lenores face

        the impact is quick and violent

        shes struck in the nose and forehead and propelled
        backwards

        quick cuts

        the trunk pops open

        the loose cash and bonds in the broken attache case flutter
        and take flight

        as theo predicted its a snowstorm of cash and negotiable
        instruments

        wider shot  the freeway  day

        as bills of high denominations waft through the air landing
        upon and sticking to the windshields of other vehicles

        the door to theos car is flung open  hes trying to jump

        multiple shots  other drivers in their cars reacting to the
        appearance of cash money on the opposite side of the glass

        its money they cant reach  theyre going at better than
        60 mph now and the dough is on the outside of their
        windshield  some nearly lose control and veer into other
        lanes

        int theos car  day

        the front passenger door flung wide open  grillo panics
        his fortune is blowing to hell  lenore in back is still
        recovering from the blow to the head

        grillo still has a firm grip on theo whos attempting to
        bail out  theo elbows grillo stunning him

        the excavation ahead and the converging lanes have forced
        traffic to slow to the 40s  as theo breaks loose and
        jumps

        angle on theos body

        hitting the surface of the freeway and rolling

        other vehicles are coming at him 

        but he rolls out of their path and into the excavation that
        has narrowed the lanes at this section of the freeway

        he lies there on his back wondering if any bones are broken
        he aches all over  but hes alive

        wider shot  freeway  day

        a few cars and a trailer truck have pulled to a stop

        motorists and the truck driver rush out to the aid of the
        man they saw fall from the car  the trucker is a thickly
        built greek

        as we draw closer we get a better look at the house  the
        earthquake has left it rather lopsided  there are cracks
        evident in the pillars in the front portal  tiles have
        fallen off the roof  the lawn is totally overgrown and ivy
        has invaded the house  some windows are broken but most are
        boarded up tight

        he proceeds to the boarded up entrance  pries the thick
        planks apart to gain access to the door  he and theo slip
        through avoiding long rusty nails which jut out  nelson
        carefully replaces the boards squeezing them back together

        int spanish mansion  day

        totally deserted

        the only furniture left is a ratty old sofa and a few beach
        chairs  theres no electricity in operation and the covered
        windows allow little light  it may as well be night

        theres a gaping hole in the floor that theo nearly steps
        into

                                 theo
                     somebody better tear this down

        nelson proceeds carefully up the cracked marble staircase to
        the second level

        nelson disappears into the darkness above

        angle on nelson  with theo visible down below

        nelson kneels pulls up whats left of a threadbare rug to
        reveal the once luxurious maple floor  several planks are
        easily pried up and nelson reaches in and retrieves one of
        the weapons which have been left here for safekeeping  its
        a 45 glock automatic  the clip is already loaded

        he replaces the rug then opens his backpack and takes out
        his own cell phone which he speed dials  lenore picks up

        he hangs up stuffs the phone into the backpack then
        crosses to the stairs and descends  theo awaits him

                                 nelson
                     nobody can do anything right but
                     you

        nelson jacks a cartridge into the chamber of the glock
        obviously theo is not to be trusted with a weapon

                                 nelson
                     first thing theyll see when they
                     walk in isyou  and while theyre
                     wondering how in hell you got here
                      i will be picking grillo off
                     from behind the staircase

        theo claps his hands in mock applause

                                 theo
                     im in awe

                                 nelson
                     following which we will have a
                     serious question and answer
                     session with your girlfriend

        theres the sound of an automobile coming up the road
        lenore and grillo are making their arrival  we hear them
        park

        theo and nelson silently await their entry through the
        boarded up front door

        moments later theyre heard prying away the boards nelson
        recently replaced

        nelson still carrying the backpack withdraws into the
        shadows beneath the staircase with the glock ready to open
        fire at grillo

        he motions theo to move into the center of the entry hall 
        where he cant be missed  hell be spotted immediately

        the boards are being pulled loose  the door is opening
        inward  but nobody steps inside

        instead two quick shots ring out

        nelson staggers out of his hiding place dragging the
        backpack in one hand and sprawls face down on the cracked
        marble floor  blood oozing out of him

        hes been shot from behind  his 45 automatic is still
        gripped in his trembling hand

        theo realizes that either grillo or lenore mustve come in a
        back way  while the other directed nelsons attention to
        the front door

        no ones shooting at theo yet  maybe he cant be seen from
        the shooters vantage point  and nobody expects him to be
        here

        nelson raises his head a few inches from the floor  hes
        looking straight at theo

        then with the last bit of strength left in him he skitters
        the gun across the slick marble floor  directly to theo
        who makes a dive for it

        then the front door swings wide open  as grillo rushes in

        it must be lenore  behind theo in the dark  who fired
        the fatal shots

        grillo spots theo going for the gun

                                 grillo
                     lenore  look out

        two more shots spray the marble inches away from theo  as
        he grabs the automatic and fires blindly in return

        grillo rips a heavy plank with rusted nails away from the
        doorway and makes a mad dash at theo whos still sprawled on
        the floor

        theo stops him with one shot before grillo can strike a
        lethal blow

        grillo tumbles backwards and lies motionless 

        theo fires wildly into the darkness again as he inches
        forward and reaches out for the strap of the backpack

        grasping it he retreats to cover as a bullet aimed at him
        strikes the backpack instead

        theo gets to his feet and stumbles down the long hallway
        there are half a dozen other rooms on this first level
        plenty of places to hide in the pitch dark

        but lenore also has many hiding places and she must know the
        layout of the house better than he does

        camera follows theo from one vacant room to another 
        through what once was a huge kitchen  all the appliances
        have been ripped out  windows everywhere are boarded up 
        blocking out the light  the floor groans under his weight

        close up  lenores hands

        shes leaning over officer grillos body taking spare
        cartridges from his belt and reloading

        back to theo

        waiting in the darkness  an idea flashes through his mind

        he opens the backpacklocates nelsons cellular phoneonce again a cell phone may be crucial to his fate

        he steps out into the corridor again  the floor creaks as
        it did before advertising his progress

        camera moves forward with theo

        there are half a dozen doorways ahead  on both sides

        she could be anywhere

        a few more steps forward  then he pauses  stays
        absolutely still

        shes heard enough of the creaking to draw her to him

        its nearly pitch black in that narrow hall

        if he cant see her then she cant see him

        hes ready to put the cellular to use

        extreme close up  cell phone

        as theo punchesredial

        wider shot

        as in the darkness another cell phone begins to ring

        theo guessed right  lenore is still in possession of the
        cellular that once belonged to him  the cellular nelson
        dialed only minutes ago

        the ringing in the darkpinpoints lenores position exactly

        theo empties his weapon in the direction of the ringing

        theres a scream  several flashes as lenores gun goes off
         as we hear her fall

        then just the constant unnerving sound of the cellular
        ringing

        theo waits  then he hears her

                                 lenores voice
                     oh god  oh no  help me 
                     dont let me  die

                                 theo
                     didnt we play this scene before

                                 lenores voice
                     dont leave me here to die 
                     theo please  you cant let me
                     die 

                                 theo
                     im afraid ive used up all my
                     good deeds for the day

        theres another gunshot fired by her  a wild shot that
        blows a hole in the stucco wall inches away from theos
        head

        then the sound of the gun clattering to the wood floor  a
        gasp  then only the continuous ringing 

        after a moment theo approaches her body  hes still
        dragging the backpack beside him

        he kicks the 38 away from her cautiously before
        ascertaining that shes no longer any threat  she wont
        live much longer  but she can still speak  the phone lying
        beside her keeps ringing

                                 lenore
                     i picked the wrong number when i
                     chose you  didnt i

                                 theo
                     turns out you did me a favor
                     youre looking at a rich man

                                 lenore
                      the phones theo  dont leave
                     any of them behind  the cops
                     could pull up a record of all our
                     calls and  find you

        even lying there losing blood shes still trying to call the
        shots

                                 theo
                     you are some control freak lady

        he bends over and retrieves his own cellular flipping it
        off before dropping it in the backpack along with nelsons
        phone

                                 lenore
                     ive got  one last number for
                     you theo

                     i told you  sooner or later
                     youd have to trust me 

        she raises her hand and theo grips it tightly  he can see
        shes slipping away

                                 theo
                     you know i meant what i said
                     about falling for your voice

        through the pain she forces an odd smile

                                 theo contd
                     now just say goodbye

        but she isnt saying anything more  she releases his hand
        her head slumps to the side  shes dead  he looks at her
        for a long moment  sadly  before leaving her there

        int entry hall

        theo pauses by grillos body and searches his pockets  he
        finds his own car keys

        ext the old spanish house  day

        as theo emerges and crosses to his chrysler peers inside 

        theos pov  the money the bonds  the attache case

        all where lenore and grillo left them on the seat

        wider shot  in car

        as theo stuffs everything of value into the backpack and
        tosses it on the floor next to him

        he starts the engine and backs out

        he executes a turn and heads back down the hill

        he doesnt look back

        ext the road stretching below the getty museum  day

        as theo drives safely away

        int theos car

        he hits sunset and keeps going

        after a moment he reaches over into the backpack and
        retrieves his own cellular for one final call  he dials
        411 

                                 theo
                           into phone
                     information  i need a number for
                     the united airlines shuttle to san
                     francisco

        it seems hes taking lenores advice after all  but the
        call is interrupted by a shrill beeping

        thebattery has finally run out

        theo looks down at the phone fondly

                                 theo
                     i take back every rotten thing i
                     said about you

        the much despised cellular which got him into this  has
        gotten him out of it and made him rich

        the phone continues beeping plaintively as he smiles at it
        with a warmth reserved for old friend whos shared a lot of
        grief and whose time is now up

                                 theo
                     you did good  get some rest

        theo kisses the cellular lovingly  then flips it offclicksilenceblackoutthe end
