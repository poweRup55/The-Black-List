prologue

ext xanadu  faint dawn  1940 miniature

window very small in the distance illuminated

all around this is an almost totally black screen  now as the camera moves slowly
towards the window which is almost a postage stamp in the frame other forms appear
barbed wire cyclone fencing and now looming up against an early morning sky
enormous iron grille work  camera travels up what is now shown to be a gateway of
gigantic proportions and holds on the top of it  a huge initial k showing darker
and darker against the dawn sky  through this and beyond we see the fairytale
mountaintop of xanadu the great castle a sillhouette as its summit the little
window a distant accent in the darkness

dissolve

a series of setups each closer to the great window all telling something of

the literally incredible domain of charles foster kane

its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the gulf coast it truly extends
in all directions farther than the eye can see  designed by nature to be almost
completely bare and flat  it was as will develop practically all marshland when
kane acquired and changed its face  it is now pleasantly uneven with its fair
share of rolling hills and one very goodsized mountain all manmade  almost all
the land is improved either through cultivation for farming purposes of through
careful landscaping in the shape of parks and lakes  the castle dominates itself
an enormous pile compounded of several genuine castles of european origin of
varying architecture  dominates the scene from the very peak of the mountain

dissolve

golf links miniature

past which we move  the greens are straggly and overgrown the fairways wild with
tropical weeds the links unused and not seriously tended for a long time

dissolve out

dissolve in

what was once a goodsized zoo miniature

of the hagenbeck type  all that now remains with one exception are the individual
plots surrounded by moats on which the animals are kept free and yet safe from
each other and the landscape at large  signs on several of the plots indicate that
here there were once tigers lions girrafes

dissolve

the monkey terrace miniature

in the foreground a great obscene ape is outlined against the dawn murk  he is
scratching himself slowly thoughtfully looking out across the estates of charles
foster kane to the distant light glowing in the castle on the hill

dissolve

the alligator pit miniature

the idiot pile of sleepy dragons  reflected in the muddy water  the lighted
window

the lagoon miniature

the boat landing sags  an old newspaper floats on the surface of the water  a copy
of the new york enquirer  as it moves across the frame it discloses again the
reflection of the window in the castle closer than before

the great swimming pool miniature

it is empty  a newspaper blows across the cracked floor of the tank

dissolve

the cottages miniature

in the shadows literally the shadows of the castle  as we move by we see that
their doors and windows are boarded up and locked with heavy bars as further
protection and sealing

dissolve out

dissolve in

a drawbridge miniature

over a wide moat now stagnant and choked with weeds  we move across it and through
a huge solid gateway into a formal garden perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred
yards deep which extends right up to the very wall of the castle  the landscaping
surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a long time but this particular
garden has been kept up in perfect shape  as the camera makes its way through it
towards the lighted window of the castle there are revealed rare and exotic blooms
of all kinds  the dominating note is one of almost exaggerated tropical lushness
hanging limp and despairing  moss moss moss  ankor wat the night the last king
died

dissolve

the window miniature

camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame of the screen
suddenly the light within goes out  this stops the action of the camera and cuts
the music which has been accompanying the sequence  in the glass panes of the
window we see reflected the ripe dreary landscape of mr kanes estate behind and
the dawn sky

dissolve

int kanes bedroom  faint dawn  1940

a very long shot of kanes enormous bed silhouetted against the enormous window

dissolve

int kanes bedroom  faint dawn  1940

a snow scene  an incredible one  big impossible flakes of snow a too picturesque
farmhouse and a snow man  the jingling of sleigh bells in the musical score now
makes an ironic reference to indian temple bells  the music freezes 

					kanes old old
						voice
			rosebud

the camera pulls back showing the whole scene to be contained in one of those glass
balls which are sold in novelty stores all over the world  a hand  kanes hand
which has been holding the ball relaxes  the ball falls out of his hand and bounds
down two carpeted steps leading to the bed the camera following  the ball falls
off the last step onto the marble floor where it breaks the fragments glittering in
the first rays of the morning sun  this ray cuts an angular pattern across the
floor suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of light as the blinds are pulled
across the window

the foot of kanes bed  the camera very close  outlined against the shuttered
window we can see a form  the form of a nurse as she pulls the sheet up over his
head  the camera follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at the
face after the sheet has covered it

note  here follows a typical news digest short one of the regular monthly or bi
monthly features based on public events or personalities  these are distinguished
from ordinary newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed
editorial or storyline  some of the more obvious characteristics of the march of
time for example as well as other documentary shorts will be combined to give an
authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject  as is the accepted
procedure in these short subjects a narrator is used as well as explanatory titles

dissolve

a great number of headlines set in different types and different styles obviously
from different papers all announcing kanes death all appearing over photographs
of kane himself perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign languages  an
important item in connection with the headlines is that many of them  positively
not all  reveal passionately conflicting opinions about kane  thus they contain
variously the words patriot democrat pacifist warmonger traitor
idealist american etc

cabinent photograph full screen of kane as an old old man  this image remains
constant on the screen as camera pulls back taking in the interior of a dark
projection room

int projection room  day  1940

a fairly large one with a long throw to the screen  it is dark

the image of kane as an old man remains constant on the screen as camera pulls back
slowly taking in and registering projection room  this action occurs however only
after the first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken  the shadows of the
men speaking appear as they rise from their chairs  black against the image of
kanes face on the screen

note  these are the editors of a news digest short and of the rawlston
magazines  all his enterprises are represented in the projection room and rawlston
himself that great man is present also and will shortly speak up

during the entire course of this scene nobodys face is really seen  sections of
their bodies are picked out by a table light a silhouette is thrown on the screen
and their faces and bodies are themselves thrown into silhouette against the
brilliant slanting rays of light from the projection room

a third man is on the telephone  we see a corner of his head and the phone

					third man
				at phone
			stand by  ill tell you if we want
			to run it again
				hangs up

					thompsons voice
			well

a short pause

					a mans voice
			its a tough thing to do in a newsreel
			seventy years of a mans life 

murmur of highly salaried assent at this  rawlston walks toward camera and out of
the picture  others are rising  camera during all of this apparently does its
best to follow action and pick up faces but fails  actually all setups are to be
planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality from this scene which
is expressed entirely by voices shadows sillhouettes and the big bright image of
kane himself on the screen

					a voice
			see what arthur ellis wrote about him
			in the american review

					third man
			i read it
			
					the voice
				its owner is already leaning
				 across the table holding a
				 piece of paper under the desk
				 light and reading from it
			listen  kane is dead  he contributed
			to the journalism of his day  the
			talent of a mountebank the morals of a
			bootlegger and the manners of a pasha
			he and his kind have almost succeeded in	
			transforming a once noble profession into		
			a seven percent security  no longer secure

					 another voice
			thats what arthur ellis is writing now
			thirty years ago when kane gave him his
			chance to clean up detroit and chicago and
			st louis kane was the greatest guy in the
			world  if you ask me 

				 	another voice
			charles foster kane was a

then observations are made almost simultaneous

					rawlstons voice
			just a minute

camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow from the projection room

					rawlston
			what were kanes last words

a silence greets this

					rawlston
			what were the last words he said on
			earth  thompson youve made us a
			good short but it needs character 

					somebodys voice
			motivation 

					rawlston
			thats it  motivation  what made kane
			what he was  and for that matter what
			was he  what weve just seen are the
			outlines of a career  whats behind the
			career  whats the man  was he good or
			bad  strong or foolish  tragic or silly
			why did he do all those things  what was
			he after
				then appreciating his point
			maybe he told us on his death bed

					thompson
			yes and maybe he didnt

					rawlston
			ask the question anyway thompson
			build the picture around the question
			even if you cant answer it

					thompson
			i know but 

					rawlston
				riding over him like any
				 other producer
			all we saw on that screen was a big
			american 

					a voice
			one of the biggest

					rawlston
				without pausing for this
			but how is he different from ford
			or hearst for that matter  or
			rockefeller  or john doe

					a voice
			i know people worked for kane will tell
			you  not only in the newspaper business
			 look how he raised salaries  you dont
			want to forget 

					another voice
			you take his labor record alone they
			ought to hang him up like a dog

					rawlston
			i tell you thompson  a mans dying
			words 

					somebodys voice
			what were they

silence

					somebodys voice
				hesitant
			yes mr rawlston what were kanes
			dying words

					rawlston
				with disgust
			rosebud

a little ripple of laughter at this which is promptly silenced by rawlston

					rawlston
			thats right

					a voice
			tough guy huh
				derisively
			dies calling for rosebud

					rawlston
			heres a man who might have been
			president  hes been loved and
			hated and talked about as much as
			any man in our time  but when he
			comes to die hes got something on
			his mind called rosebud  what
			does that mean

					another voice
			a racehorse he bet on once probably
			that didnt come in  rosebud

					rawlston
			all right  but what was the race

there is a short silence

					rawlston
			thompson

					thompson
			yes sir

					rawlston
			hold this thing up for a week  two
			weeks if you have to

					thompson
				feebly
			but dont you think if we release it
			now  hes only been dead four days
			 it might be better than if 

					rawlston
				decisively
			nothing is ever better than finding
			out what makes people tick  go after
			the people that knew kane well  that
			manager of his  the little guy
			bernstein those two wives all the
			people who knew him had worked for
			him who loved him who hated his guts 
				pauses
			i dont mean go through the city
			directory of course 

the third man gives a hearty yesman laugh

					thompson
			ill get to it right away mr
			rawlston

					rawlston
				rising
			good

the camera from behind him outlines his back against kanes picture on the screen

					rawlstons voice
				continued
			itll probably turn out to be a very
			simple thing

fade out

note  now begins the story proper  the seach by thompson for the facts about kane
 his researches  his interviews with the people who knew kane

it is important to remember always that only at the very end of the story is
thompson himself a personality  until then throughout the picture we photograph
only thompsons back shoulders or his shadow  sometimes we only record his voice
he is not until the final scene a character  he is the personification of the
search for the truth about charles foster kane  he is the investigator

person of bertha anderson an elderly manish spinnster seated behind her desk
thompson his hat in his hand is standing before her  bertha is on the phone

distant and imposingly framed door  thompson with a bit of a sigh follows

	dissolve out

dissolve in

int the vault room  thatcher memorial library  day  1940

a room with all the warmth and charm of napoleans tomb

as we dissolve in the door opens in and we see past thompsons shoulders the length
of the room  everything very plain very much made out of marble and very gloomy
illumination from a skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and
classical despair  the floor is marble and there is a gigantic mahogany table in
the center of everything  beyond this is to be seen sunk in the marble wall at the
far end of the room the safe from which a guard in a khaki uniform with a
revolver holster at his hip is extracting the journal of walter p thatcher  he
brings it to bertha as if he were the guardian of a bullion shipment  during this
bertha has been speaking

					bertha
				to the guard
			pages eightythree to one hundred
			and fortytwo jennings

					guard
			yes miss anderson

					bertha
				to thompson
			you will confine yourself it is our
			understanding to the chapter dealing
			with mr kane

					thompson
			thats all im interested in

the guard has by this time delivered the precious journal  bertha places it
reverently on the table before thompson

					bertha
			you will be required to leave this
			room at fourthirty promptly

she leaves  thompson starts to light a cigarette  the guard shakes his head  with
a sigh thompson bends over to read the manuscript  camera moves down over his
shoulder onto page of manuscript

manuscript neatly and precisely written

charles foster kane

when these lines appear in print fifty years after my death i am confident that
the whole world will agree with my opinion of charles foster kane assuming that he
is not then completely forgotten which i regard as extremely likely  a good deal
of nonsense has appeared about my first meeting with kane when he was six years
old  the facts are simple  in the winter of 1870

the camera has not held on the entire page  it has been following the words with
the same action that the eye does the reading  on the last words the white page of
the paper

dissolves into

ext mrs kanes boardinghouse  day  1870

the white of a great field of snow seen from the angle of a parlor window

in the same position of the last word in above insert appears the tiny figure of
charles foster kane aged five almost like an animated cartoon  he is in the act
of throwing a snowball at the camera  it sails toward us and over our heads out of
scene

reverse angle  on the house featuring a large sign reading

mrs kanes boardinghouse
high class meals and lodging
inquire within

charles kanes snowball hits the sign

int parlor  mrs kanes boardinghouse  day  1870

camera is angling through the window but the windowframe is not cut into scene
we see only the field of snow again same angle as in previous scene  charles is
manufacturing another snowball  now 

camera pulls back the frame of the window appearing and we are inside the parlor
of the boardinghouse  mrs kane aged about 28 is looking out towards her son
just as we take her in she speaks

					mrs kane
				calling out
			be careful charles

					thatchers voice
			mrs kane 

					mrs kane
				calling out the window
				 almost on top of this
			pull your muffler around your neck
			charles 

but charles deliriously happy in the snow is oblivious to this and is running
away  mrs kane turns into camera and we see her face  a strong face worn and
kind

					thatchers voice
			i think well have to tell him now 

camera now pulls back further showing thatcher standing before a table on which is
his stovepipe hat and an imposing multiplicity of officiallooking documents  he
is 26 and as might be expected a very stuffy young man already very expensive and
conservative looking even in colorado

					mrs kane
			ill sign those papers 

					kane sr
			you people seem to forget that im
			the boys father

at the sound of kane srs voice both have turned to him and the camera pulls back
still further taking him in

kane sr who is the assistant curator in a livery stable has been groomed as
elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever since daybreak

from outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and cheerful cries of the boy
blissfully cavorting in the snow

					mrs kane
			its going to be done exactly the
			way ive told mr thatcher 

					kane sr
			if i want to i can go to court
			a father has a right to 

					thatcher
				annoyed
			mr kane the certificates that mr
			graves left here are made out to mrs
			kane in her name  hers to do with
			as she pleases 

					kane sr
			well i dont hold with signing my
			boy away to any bank as guardian
			just because 

					mrs kane
				quietly
			i want you to stop all this nonsense
			jim

					thatcher
			the banks decision in all matters
			concerning his education his place of
			residence and similar subjects will be
		  	final
				clears his throat

					kane sr
			the idea of a bank being the guardian 

mrs kane has met his eye  her triumph over him finds expression in his failure to
finish his sentence

					mrs kane
				even more quietly
			i want you to stop all this nonsense
			jim

					thatcher
			we will assume full management of the
			colorado lode  of which you mrs kane
			are the sole owner

kane sr opens his mouth once or twice as if to say something but chokes down his
opinion

					mrs kane
				has been reading past
				 thatchers shoulder as he
				 talked
			where do i sign mr thatcher

					thatcher
			right here mrs kane

					kane sr
				sulkily
			dont say i didnt warn you

mrs kane lifts the quill pen

					kane sr
			mary im asking you for the last
			time  anyond think i hadnt been
			a good husband and a 

mrs kane looks at him slowly  he stops his speech

					thatcher
			the sum of fifty thousand dollars a
			year is to be paid to yourself and
			mr kane as long as you both live
			and thereafter the survivor 

mrs kane puts pen to the paper and signs

					kane sr
			well lets hope its all for the best

					mrs kane
			it is  go on mr thatcher 

mrs kane listening to thatcher of course has had her other ear bent in the
direction of the boys voice  thatcher is aware both of the boys voice which is
counter to his own and of mrs kanes divided attention  as he pauses kane sr
genteelly walks over to close the window

ext mrs kanes boardinghouse  day  1870

kane jr seen from kane srs position at the window  he is advancing on the
snowman snowballs in his hands dropping to one knee the better to confound his
adversary

					kane
			if the rebels want a fight boys
			lets give it to em

he throws two snowballs missing widely and gets up and advances another five feet
before getting on his knees again

					kane
			the terms are underconditional
			surrender  up and at em  the
			union forever

int parlor  mrs kanes boardinghouse  day  1870

kane sr closes the window

				   	thatcher
				over the boys voice
			everything else  the principal as
			well as all monies earned  is to be
			administered by the bank in trust for
			your son charles foster kane until
			his twentyfifth birthday at which
			time he is to come into complete
			possession

mrs kane rises and goes to the window

					mrs kane
			go on mr thatcher

thatcher continues as she opens the window  his voice as before is heard with
overtones of the boys

ext kanes boardinghouse  day  1870

kane jr seen from mrs kanes position at the window  he is now within ten feet
of the snowman with one snowball left which he is holding back in his right hand

					kane
			you cant lick andy jackson  old
			hickory thats me

he fires his snowball well wide of the mark and falls flat on his stomach starting
to crawl carefully toward the snowman

					thatchers voice
			its nearly five mrs kane dont
			you think id better meet the boy 

int parlor  mrs kanes boardinghouse  day  1870

mrs kane at the window  thatcher is now standing at her side

					mrs kane
			ive got his trunk all packed 
				she chokes a little
			ive it packed for a couple of weeks 

she cant say anymore  she starts for the hall day  kane sr ill at ease has no
idea of how to comfort her

					thatcher
			ive arranged for a tutor to meet
			us in chicago  id have brought
			him along with me but you were so
			anxious to keep everything secret 

he stops as he realizes that mrs kane has paid no attention to him and having
opened the door is already well into the hall that leads to the side door of the
house  he takes a look at kane sr tightens his lips and follows mrs kane  kane
shoulders thrown back like one who bears defeat bravely follows him

ext mrs kanes boardinghouse  day  1870

kane in the snowcovered field  with the snowman between him and the house he is
holding the sled in his hand just about to make the little run that prefaces a
bellyflop  the kane house in the background is a dilapidated shabby twostory
frame building with a wooden outhouse  kane looks up as he sees the single file
procession mrs kane at its head coming toward him

kane holds the door open for thatcher  they come in together

					kane
			mr thatcher isnt everything ive

					kane
			the trouble is mr thatcher you
			dont realize youre talking to

kane moves around behind his desk  thatcher doesnt understand looks at him

				 	kane
			as charles foster kane who has 			eighty
two thousand six hundred
			and thirtyone shares of metropolitan
			transfer  you see i do have a rough
			idea of my holdings  i sympathize
			with you  charles foster kane is a	
			dangerous scoundrel his paper should
			be run out of town and a committee
			should be formed to boycott him  you
			may if you can form such a committee
			put me down for a contribution of one
			thousand dollars

					thatcher
				angrily
			charles my time is too valuable for

					kane
			on the other hand 
				his manner becomes serious
			i am the publisher of the enquirer
			as such it is my duty  ill let you
			in on a little secret it is also my

thatcher doesnt understand him

					kane
			if i dont defend the interests of

thatcher glares at him unable to answer  kane starts to dance

thatcher puts on his hat

					thatcher
			i happened to see your consolidated

				sneeringly
			this enquirer  that is costing you
			one million dollars a year

					kane
			youre right  we did lose a million

thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered

int city room  enquirer building  day  1891

the front half of the second floor constitutes one large city room  despite the
brilliant sunshine outside very little of it is actually getting into the room
because the windows are small and narrow  there are about a dozen tables and desks
of the oldfashioned type not flat available for reporters  two tables on a
raised platform at the end of the room obviously serve the city room executives
to the left of the platform is an open door which leads into the sanctrum

as kane and leland enter the room an elderly stout gent on the raised platform
strikes a bell and the other eight occupants of the room  all men  rise and face
the new arrivals  carter the elderly gent in formal clothes rises and starts
toward them

					carter
			welcome mr kane to the enquirer
			i am herbert carter

					kane
			thank you mr carter  this is mr
			leland

					carter
				bowing
			how do you do mr leland

				  	kane
				pointing to the standing
				 reporters	
			are they standing for me

					carter
			i thought it would be a nice gesture
			 the new publisher 

					kane
				grinning
			ask them to sit down

					carter
			you may resume your work gentlemen
				to kane
			i didnt know your plans and so i was
			unable to make any preparations

					kane
			i dont my plans myself

they are following carter to his raised platform

				 	kane
			as a matter of fact i havent got
			any  except to get out a newspaper

there is a terrific crash at the doorway  they all turn to see bernstein sprawled
at the entrance  a roll of bedding a suitcase and two framed pictures were too
much for him

				  	kane
			oh mr bernstein

bernstein looks up

					kane
			if you would come here a moment
			please mr bernstein

bernstein rises and comes over tidying himself as he comes

					kane
			mr carter this is mr bernstein
			mr bernstein is my general manager

					carter
				frigidly
			how do you do mr bernstein

					kane
			youve got a private office here
			havent you

the delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance with parts of the
bedstead and other furniture  he is looking about a bit bewildered

				indicating open door to
				 left of platform
			my little sanctum is at your disposal
			but i dont think i understand

			im going to live right here

coated is seated alongside him  leland seated in a corner is looking on
detached amused  the furniture has been pushed around and kanes effects are
somewhat in place  on a corner of the desk bernstein is writing down figures  no
one pays any attention to him

					kane
			im not criticizing mr carter
			but heres what i mean  theres a

				points to it
			and a picture  of a woman in brooklyn
			who is missing  probably murdered
				looks to make sure of the name
			a mrs harry silverstone  why didnt

			because were running a newspaper mr

kane has finished eating  he pushes away his plates

					kane
			im still hungry brad  lets go
			to rectors and get something decent
				pointing to the chronicle
				 before him
			the chronicle has a twocolumn
			headline mr carter  why havent we

					carter
			there is no news big enough

					kane
			if the headline is big enough it
			makes the new big enough  the murder
			of mrs harry silverstone 

					carter
				hotly
			as a matter of fact we sent a man
			to the silverstone home yesterday
			afternoon
				triumphantly
			our man even arrived before the
			chronicle reporter  and theres no
			proof that the woman was murdered 
			or even that shes dead

				 	kane
				smiling a bit
			the chronicle doesnt say shes
			murdered mr carter  it says the

					carter
				stiffly
			its not our function to report the
			gossip of housewives  if we were
			interested in that kind of thing
			mr kane we could fill the paper
			twice over daily 

					kane
				gently
			thats the kind of thing we are
			going to be interested in from now
			on mr carter  right now i wish
			youd send your best man up to see
			mr silverstone  have him tell mr
			silverstone if he doesnt produce his
			wife at once the enquirer will
			have him arrested
				he gets an idea
			have him tell mr silverstone hes a
			detective from the central office
			if mr silverstone asks to see his
			badge your man is to get indignant
			and call mr silverstone an anarchist
			loudly so that the neighbors can hear

					carter
			really mr kane i cant see the
			function of a respectable newspaper 

kane isnt listening to him

					kane
			oh mr bernstein

bernstein looks up from his figures

					kane
			ive just made a shocking discovery
			the enquirer is without a telephone
			have two installed at once

mr carter meantime has risen stiffly

			but mr kane 

					kane
			thatll be all today mr carter
			youve been most understanding
			good day mr carter

carter with a look that runs just short of apoplexy leaves the room closing the

			poor mr carter
					
					kane
				shakes his head
			what makes those fellows think that

			something inflexible that people

bernstein lifts his head and looks at kane  kane gazes back at him

the picture is mainly occupied by a large building on the roof of which the lights
spell out the word enquirer against the sunrise  we do not see the street or the
first few stories of this building the windows of which would be certainly
illuminated  what we do see is the floor on which is located the city room  over

already made up  on it is seated bernstein smoking the end of a cigar  leland is
in a chair

he looks at leland for a minute and goes back to his writing reading as he writes

bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of kane  they both stand looking out
leland joins him on the other side  their three heads are silhouetted against the

front page of the enquirer shows big boxed editorial with heading

my principles  a declaration
by charles foster kane

camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the top of a pile of
newspapers  as we draw further back we see four piles and as camera contines to
pull back we see six piles and go on back until we see a big field of enquirers 
piles of enquirers  all 26000 copies ready for distribution

a wagon with a huge sign on its side reading

enquirer  circulation 26000

passes through foreground and we wipe to

a pile of enquirers for sale on a broken down wooden box on a street corner
obviously a poor district  a couple of coins fall on the pile

the stoop of a period door with oldfashioned enamel milk can and a bag of rolls
across the sidewalk before this moves the shadow of an oldfashioned bicycle with
an enormous front wheel  a copy of the enquirer is tossed on the stoop

a breakfast table  beautiful linen and beautiful silver  everything very
expensive gleaming in the sunshine  into a silver newspaper rack there is slipped
a copy of the enquirer  here as before the boxed editorial reading my
principles  a declaration by charles foster kane is very prominent on the front
page

the wooden floor of a railroad station flashing light and dark as a train behind
the camera rushes by  on the floor there is tossed a bound bundle of the new york
enquirer  the declaration of principles still prominent

rural delivery  a copy of the enquirers being put into bins showing state
distribution

the railroad platform again  we stay here for four images  on each image the
speed of the train is faster and the piles of the enquirer are larger  on the
first image we move in to hold on the words circulation  31000  we are this
close for the next pile which reads 40000 the next one which reads 55000 and the
last which is 62000  in each instance the bundles of newspapers are thicker and
the speed of the moving train behind the camera is increased

the entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a descriptive complement of
sound  the traffic noises of new york in the 1890s wheels on cobblestones and
horses hooves bicycle bells the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters in
the rfd shot and in all cases where the railroad platform is used  the mounting
sound of the railroad train

the last figure 62000 opposite the word circulation on the enquirer masthead
changes to

ext street and chronicle buiding  day  1895

sign which reads

camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the chronicle office  the
chronicle office has a plateglass window in which is reflected traffic moving up and
down the street also the figures of kane leland and bernstein who are munching
peanuts

inside the window almost filling it is a large photograph of the chronicle
staff with reilly prominently seated in the center  a sign over the photo reads
editorial and executive staff of the new york chronicle  a sign beneath it reads
greatest newspaper staff in the world  the sign also includes the chronicle
circulation figure  there are nine men in the photo

as camera pulls back it is revealed that they are being photographed  by an old

room  it is 130 at night  desks etc have been pushed against the wall  running
down the center of the room is a long banquet table at which twenty diners have

he puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill whistle  this is a
signal  a band strikes up a lively ditty of the period and enters in advance a
regiment of very magnificent maidens as daringly arrayed as possible in the chorus
costumes of the day  the rest of this episode will be planned and staged later

and his celluloid collar are wringing wet  camera moves toward the window to
tighten on bernstein and to take in the city room behind him which is absolutely
deserted  it is clear that there is almost nothing more for bernstein to do  the

int city room  enquirer building  day  1900

the whole floor is now a city room  it is twice its former size yet not too large
for all the desks and the people using them  the windows have been enlarged
providing a good deal more light and air  a wall calendar says september 9th

kane and bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment  kane who really did
look a bit peaked before is now cleareyed and tanned  he is wearing new english
clothes  as they come into the room bernstein practically walking sideways is
doing nothing but beaming and admiring kane quelling like a mother at the carnegie
hall debut of her son  seeing and recognizing kane the entire staff rises to its
feet

					kane
				referring to the staff
				 with a smile
			ask them to sit down mr bernstein

					bernstein
			sit down everybody  for heavens
			sake

the order is immediately obeyed everybody going into business of feverish activity

					bernstein
			so then tonight we go over everything
			thoroughly eh  especially the new
			papers 

					kane
			we certainly do  vacations over 	
			starting right after dinner  but
			right now  that lady over there 
				he indicates a woman
				 at the desk
			 thats the new society editor i
			take it  you think i could interrupt
			her a moment mr bernstein

					bernstein
			huh  oh i forgot  youve been
			away so long i forgot about your
			joking 

he trails after kane as he approaches the society editors desk  the society
editor a middleaged spinster sees him approaching and starts to quake all over
but tries to pretend she isnt aware of him  an envelope in her hand shakes
violently  kane and bernstein stop at her desk

					bernstein
			miss townsend 

miss townsend looks up and is so surprised to see bernstein with a stranger

					miss townsend
			good afternoon mr bernstein

					bernstein
			this is mr kane miss townsend

miss townsend cant stick to her plan  she starts to rise but her legs are none
too good under her  she knocks over a tray of copy paper as she rises and bends to
pick it up

					kane
				very hesitatingly and
				 very softly
			miss townsend 

at the sound of his voice she straightens up  she is very close to death from
excitement

					kane
			ive been away for several months
			and i dont know exactly how these
			things are handled now  but one
			thing i wanted to be sure of is that
			you wont treat this little
			announcement any differently than	
			you would any other similar
			announcement

he hands her an envelope  she has difficulty in holding on to it

					kane
				gently
			read it miss townsend  and remember
			 just the regular treatment
			see you at nine oclock mr bernstein

kane leaves  bernstein looks after him then at the paper  miss townsend finally
manages to open the envelope  a piece of flimsy paper with a few written lines is
her reward

					miss townsend
				reading
			mr and mrs thomas moore norton
			announce the engagement of their
			daughter emily monroe norton to mr
			charles foster kane

					bernstein
				starts to read it
			mr and mrs thomas moore norton
			announce 

					miss townsend
				fluttering  on top of him
			shes  shes the niece of  of the
			president of the united states 

					bernstein
				nodding proudly
			i know  come on miss townsend 
			from the window maybe we can get a
			look

he takes her by the hand and leads her off

kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch drawn up at the curb in which sits
miss emily norton  he kisses her full on the lips before he sits down  she acts a
bit taken aback because of the public nature of the scene but she isnt really
annoyed  as the barouche starts off she is looking at him adoringly  he however
has turned his head and is looking adoringly at the enquirer  he apparently sees
bernstein and miss townsed and waves his hand

			i guess he didnt make her very happy

			you know i was thinking  that rosebud
			youre trying to find out about 

				  	thompson
			yes 

					bernstein
			maybe that was something he lost
			mr kane was a man that lost  almost
			everything he had 
				a pause
			you ought to talk to bradford leland
			he could tell you a lot  i wish i
			could tell you where leland is but i
			dont know myself  he may be out of

					thompson
			in case youd like to know mr

			you dont say  why i had no idea

			nothing particular the matter with

					bernstein
			just old age
				smiles sadly

			think of charlie kane  well  i suppose
			he has some private sort of greatness
			but he kept it to himself
				grinning
			he never  gave himself away   he
			never gave anything away  he just 
			left you a tip  he had a generous
			mind  i dont suppose anybody ever had
			so many opinions  that was because
			he had the power to express them and
			charlie lived on power and the excitement
			of using it   but he didnt believe in
			anything except charlie kane  he never
			had a conviction in his life  i guess
			he died without one   that must have
			been pretty unpleasant  of course a
			lot of us check out with no special
			conviction about death  but we do know
			what were leaving  we believe in
			something
				looks sharply at thompson
			youre absolutely sure you havent got
			a cigar

					thompson
			sorry mr leland

					leland
			never mind   bernstein told you about
			the first days at the office didnt
			he  well charlie was a bad newspaper
			man even then  he entertained his
			readers but he never told them the
			truth

					thompson
			maybe you could remember something
			that 

					leland
			i can remember everything  thats
			my curse young man  its the
			greatest curse thats ever been
			inflicted on the human race  memory
			  i was his oldest friend
				slowly
			as far as i was concerned he
			behaved like swine  maybe i wasnt

applause  during above bernstein has come to lelands side

			isnt it wonderful  such a party

his tone causes bernstein to look at him

					kanes voice
			however i think youll agree weve
			heard enough about newspapers and
			the newspaper business for one night

the above speeches are heard under the following dialogue

					bernstein
				to leland
			whats the matter

					leland
			mr bernstein these men who are now

kane whistles  the band and the chorus girls enter and hell breaks loose all around
leland and bernstein

			that the chronicle stands for
			mr bernstein

					bernstein
				indignantly
			certainly not  so whats that got
			to do with it  mr kane hell
			have them changed to his kind of
			newspapermen in a week

			yesterday morning you called the

			i said treason was a capital offense

			goodnight mr kane

kane stands in the door waiting for leland  leland gets up and moves toward the
office  goes in sits down across from kane at the desk  an uncomfortable pause
then kane smiles ingratiatingly  leland tries to cope with this

					leland
			first of all 
				he cant go on

					kane
				not cruelly 
				 genuinely kind
			whats wrong brad

					leland
			im drunk

					kane
			ill get you some coffee

he rises and goes to the door

					leland
			first of all i will not write a
			good review of a play because
			somebody paid a thousand dollars
			for an advertisement in the
			enquirer

				  	kane
				gently  opening the
				 door
			thats just a little promotion scheme
			nobody expects you 
				calling
			mike will you try and get mr leland
			some coffee

					mikes voice
			sure thing mr kane

kane turns back to leland  leland doesnt look up at him

					leland
			charlie its just no go  we
			cant agree anymore  i wish youd
			let me go to chicago

					kane
			why brad

					leland
			i want to be transferred to the new
			paper  youve been saying yourself
			you wish you had somebody to 
				he is heartsick inarticulate
			thats not what i wanted to talk
			about

kane goes around behind the desk and sits down

					kane
			ill tell you what ill do brad 
			ill get drunk too  maybe thatll
			help

					leland
			no that wont help  besides you
			never get drunk  i wanted to talk
			about you and emily

kane looks at leland sharply before he speaks

					kane
				quietly
			all right

					leland
				without looking at him
			shes going to leave you 

					kane
			i dont think so brad  weve
			just had word that the president
			is out of danger	
				ruefully
			it seems i didnt kill him after all

					leland
				takes his eye
			she was going to leave you anyway 

kane takes this in
	
					leland
			emilys going south next week with		
			the child  as far as anybodys to
			know its a holiday  when they get
			back 

					kane
				sharply
			brad you are drunk

					leland
			sure i am  she wants full custody
			of the child no matter what happens
		  	if you wont agree to that shell
			apply for a divorce regardless of
			the presidents wishes  i cant tell
			her shes wrong because she isnt
			wrong 

					kane
			why is she leaving me

					leland
				its very hard for him
				 to say all this
			she hasnt any friends left sine
			you started this oil business and
			she never sees you

					kane
			do you think the enquirer shouldnt
			have campaigned against the oil leases

					leland
				hesitating
			you might have made the whole thing
			less personal

no answer from kane

					leland
			it isnt just that the president
			was her uncle  everyone she knows
			all the people shes been brought
			up with everything shes ever been
			taught to believe is important 

still no answer from kane

					leland
			theres no reason why this  this
			savage personal note 

					kane
			the personal note is all there is
			to it  its all there ever is to	
			it  its all there every is to
			anything  stupidity in our government
			complacency and selfsatisfaction
			and unwillingness to believe that
			anything done by a certain class of
			people can be wrong  you cant
			fight those things impersonally
			theyre not impersonal crimes against
			people  theyre being done by actual
			persons  with actual names and
			positions and  the right of the
			american people to own their own
			country is not an academic issue brad
			that you debate  and then the judges
			retire to return a verdict and the
			winners give a dinner for the losers

					leland
			you almost convince me
				rising
			im just drunk enough to tell you the
			truth  i have to be a little drunk
			for that because im a coward  you
			know that  thats why you keep me
			around
				smiles
			you only associate with your inferiors
			charlie  i guess thats why you ran
			away from emily  because you cant
			stand the company of your equals  you
			dont like to admit they exist  the
			other big people in your world are dead		
			i told you that

kane looks at leland but leland cant be stopped now  he speaks very quietly  no
poison in his voice  no personal indignation  as though he were explaining the
nature of a disease

					leland
			you talk about the people of the
			united states as though they
			belonged to you  when you find
			out they dont think they are
			youll lose interest  you talk about
			giving them their rights as though
			you could make a present of liberty
			remember the working man  you used
			to defend him quite a good deal
			well hes turning into something
			called organized labor and you dont
			like that at all  and listen when
			your precious underprivileged really
			get together  thats going to add
			up to something bigger than  than
			your privilege and then i dont know
			what youll do  sail away to a desert
			island probably and lord it over the
			monkeys

					kane
			are you finished

					leland
			yes
				looking down
			now will you let me go to chicago

					kane
				with a little smile
			youre not going to like it in
			chicago  they wind comes howling
			in from the lake  and theres
			practically no opera season at all 	
			and the lord only knows whether
			theyve ever heard of lobster newburg 

					leland
			thats all right
				he wont be charmed
				 out of his duty
			what are you going to do about emily

					kane
				his face hardning a
				 little
			nothing  if she dosent love me 

leland has risen  he speaks as he turns away starting towards the door

					leland
			you want love on your own terms
			dont you charlie 
				he stops  his back
				 turned to kane
			love according to your own rules
			and if anything goes wrong and
			youre hurt  then the game stops
			and youve got to be soothed and
			nursed no matter what else is
			happening  and no matter who else
			is hurt

					kane
			its simpler than that brad  a
			society girl cant stand the gaff
			thats all  other things are 	
			important to her  social position
			what theyre saying on the front
			porches at southampton is it going
			to be embarrassing to meet somebody
			or the other at dinner 

leland has turned taking his eye again  now kane stops and smiles

					kane
			she can leave me  as a matter of
			fact ive already left her  dont
			worry brad  ill live

					leland
			i know you will

					kane
				with all his charm
			hey brad  ive been analyzed an
			awful lot tonight  lets have
			another brandy

leland shakes his head  kane lifts his glass

					kane
			to love on my terms  those are
			the only terms anybody knows 
			his own

with a huge picture of kane cheering crowds etc  emily and junior are to be seen
in the front of a box  emily is tired and wears a forced smile on her face
junior now aged nine and a half is eager brighteyed and excited  kane is just
finishing his speech

					kane

			upon this campaign with no thought
			that i could be elected governor of
			this state  it is now no secret that
			every straw vote every independent
			pole shows that i will be elected

					reilly
			i just got word from buffalo mr

this is said almost inquiringly as if he were hoping that kane would give him some
assurance that mcdonald is not making a mistake  there is no answer from kane

					reilly
			on an independent ticket theres
			never been anything like it  if

the camera is just inside the curtain angling upstage  we see the set for thais
 the principals in place  stage managers stage hands etc and in the center of
all this in an elaborate costume looking very small and very lost is susan  she
is almost hysterical with fright  maids singing teacher and the rest are in
attendance  her throat is sprayed  applause is heard at the opening of the shot
and now the orchestra starts thunderously  the curtain starts to rise  the camera
with it  the blinding glare of the foots moves up susans body and hits her face
she squints and starts to sing  camera continues on up with the curtain up past
susan up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into the gridiron
into a world of ropes brick walls and hanging canvas  susans voice still heard 
but faintly  the camera stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops  two
typical stage hands fill the frame  they are looking down on the stage below  some
of the reflected light gleams on their faces  they look at each other  one of them
puts his hand to his nose

ext corner drug store and street on the west side of new york  night  1909

susan aged twenty neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of the period is
leaving the drug store  its about 8 oclock at night  with a large mansized
handkerchief pressed to her cheek she is in considerable pain  the street is wet 
after a recent rain

she walks a few steps towards the middle of the block and can stand it no longer
she stops opens a bottle of oil of cloves that she has in her hand applies some to
her finger and rubs her gums

she walks on the pain only a bit better  four or five houses farther along she
comes to what is clearly her own doorway  a shabby old fourstory apartment house
she turns toward the doorway which is up a tiny stoop about three steps

as she does so kane coming from the opposite direction almost bumps into her and
turns to his left to avoid her  his shoulder bumps hers and she turns  as she does
so kane forced to change his course steps on the loose end of a plank which
covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk  the plank rises up and cracks him on the knee
also covering him with mud

					kane
				hopping up and down
				 and rubbing his knee
			ow

susan taking her handkerchief from her jaw roars with laughter

					kane
			its not funny

he bites his lip and rubs his knee again  susan tries to control her laughter but
not very successfully  kane glares at her

					susan
			im sorry mister  but you do
			look awful funny

suddenly the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw

					susan
			ow

					kane
			whats the matter with you

				 	susan
			toothache

					kane
			hmm

he has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief

					susan
			youve got some on your face

					kane
			if these sidewalks were kept in
			condition  instead of the money
			going to some cheap grafter 

susan starts to laugh again

					kane
			whats funny now

					susan
			you are  you look like youve
		  	been making mud pies

in the middle of her smile the pain returns

					susan
			oh

					kane
			youre no venus de milo

					susan
				points to the downstair

			if you want to come in and wash
			your face   i can get you some

parents and a few objets dart  one at the japanese rolling ball game at coney
island and  perhaps this is part of the japanese loot  the glass globe with the
snow scene kane was holding in his hand in the first sequence

waiting for her  she doesnt close the door

				starts to put the basin down
			shes a very decent woman

kane rushes to take the basin from her putting it on the chiffonier  to do this
he has to shove the photograph to one side of the basin  susan grabs the photograph
as it is about to fall over

his hand hitting him in the chest before it falls to the floor  susan laughs as he
bends over

susan comes out of the closet  she holds out the brush with her left hand her
right hand to her jaw in real distress

					kane
				takes the brush
			you are in pain arent you you
			poor kid

susan cant stand it anymore and sits down in a chair bent over whimpering a bit

					kane
				brushing himself
			i wish there was something i could 

he stops and thinks  susan her face averted is still trying hard not to cry

					kane
			ive got an idea young lady
				there is no response
			turn around and look at me
				there is still no response
			i said turn around and look at

slowly susan turns

					kane
			did you ever see anybody wiggle

it takes a second for susan to adapt herself to this

			watch closely
				he wiggles his ears
			it took me two solid years at the

			oh i know i always say i mean it

					kane
				interrupting
			youre in a tent darling  youre

					susan
			im not going to have my guests

					susan
			what you want me to want you mean

					kane
			susan i really think 

					susan
			oh i dont mean the things youve

			between giving me a bracelet or
			giving somebody else a hundred thousand
			dollars for a statue youre going to
			keep crated up and never look at  its

			youre not really giving anything that

					susan
			well im not going to stop it  im
			going to say exactly what i think
				she screams
			youve never given me anything  youve
			tried to buy me into giving you
			something  youre 
				a sudden notion
			 its like you were bribing me  thats
			what its been from the first moment i
			met you  no matter how much it cost
			you  your time your money  thats
			what youve done with everybody youve

she looks at him with no lessening of her passion

			or anybody else  you want to be
			loved  thats all you want  im
			charles foster kane  whatever you

without a word kane slaps her across the face  they look at each other

					susan
			you  you hit me

kane continues to look at her

					susan
			youll never have another chance to
			hit me again
				pauses

			dont tell me youre sorry

					kane
			im not sorry

					susan
			im going to leave you

					kane

int corridor outside susans bedroom  xanadu  night  1929

the housekeeper mrs tinsdall and a couple of maids are near the door but are too
afraid to be in front of it  from inside can be heard a terrible banging and
crashing  raymond hurries into scene opens the door and goes in

int susans bedroom  xanadu  1929

kane in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage is literally breaking up the
room  yanking pictures hooks and all off the wall smashing them to bits  ugly
gaudy pictures  susies pictures in susies bad taste  off of occasional tables
bureaus he sweeps susies whorish accumulation of bricabrac

raymond stands in the doorway watching him  kane says nothing  he continues with
tremendous speed and surprising strength still wordlessly tearing the room to
bits  the curtains too frilly  overly pretty are pulled off the windows in a
single gesture and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads of cheap
novels  discovers a halfempty bottle of liquor and dashes it across the room
finally he stops  susies cozy little chamber is an incredible shambles all around
him

he stands for a minute breathing heavily and his eye lights on a hanging whatnot
in a corner which had escaped his notice  prominent on its center shelf is the
little glass ball with the snowstorm in it  he yanks it down  something made of
china breaks but not the glass ball  it bounces on the carpet and rolls to his
feet the snow in a flurry  his eye follows it  he stoops to pick it up  cant
make it  raymond picks it up for him hands it to him  kane takes it sheepishly 
looks at it  moves painfully out of the room into the corridor

int corridor outside susans bedroom  xanadu  1929

kane comes out of the door  mrs tinsdall has been joined now by a fairly sizable
turnout of servants  they move back away from kane staring at him  raymond is in
the doorway behind kane  kane looks at the glass ball

					kane
				without turning
			close the door raymond

					raymond
			yes sir
				he closes it

					kane
			lock it  and keep it locked

raymond locks the door and comes to his side  there is a long pause  servants
staring in silence  kane gives the glass ball a gentle shake and starts another
snowstorm

					kane
			raymond 
				he is almost in a trance

					raymond
			yes sir 

one of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up  kane shakes the ball again
another flurry of snow  he watches the flakes settle  then looks up  finally
taking in the pack of servants and something of the situations he puts the glass
ball in his coat pocket  he speaks very quietly to raymond so quietly it only
seems hes talking to himself

					kane
			keep it locked

he slowly walks off down the corridor the servants giving way to let him pass and
watching him as he goes  he is an old old man

19 mary kane  18 to 19  past a blank crypt and then holding on the burial
of kanes son  a group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes are lowering a very
expensivelooking coffin into its crypt  kane stands nearby with raymond looking
on  the men strain and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor  the men now
place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words

directly over the blank place which will be occupied by kane himself

					kane
			do you like poetry raymond

					raymond
			cant say sir

					kane
			mrs kane liked poetry 

raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone indeed  not to say
off his trolley

					raymond
			yes mr kane

					kane
			not my wife  not either of them

			he was dead  thats a poem  do
			you know what it means

					raymond
			no i dont mr kane

					kane
			i didnt used to be afraid of it

a short pause  his eyes still on the wall but looking through it kane quotes the
translation

					kane
			the drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever
			and yet i saw many things
			seeing my glory in the days of my glory
			i thought my power eternal
			and the days of my life
			fixed surely in the years
			but a whisper came to me
			from him who dies not
			i called my tributary kings together
			and those who were proud rulers under me
			i opened the boxes of my treasure to them saying
			take hills of gold moutains of silver
			and give me only one more day upon the earth
			but they stood silent
			looking upon the ground
			so that i died
			and death came to sit upon my throne

			o sons of men
			you see a stranger upon the road
			you call to him and he does not step
			he is your life
			walking towards time
			hurrying to meet the kings of india and china
				quoting
			o sons of men
			you are caught in the web of the world
			and the spider nothing waits behind it
			where are the men with towering hopes
			they have changed places with owls
			owls who have lived in tombs
			and now inhabit a palace

the magnificent tapestries candelabra etc are still there but now several large
packing cases are piled against the walls some broken open some shut and a number
of objects great and small are piled pell mell all over the place  furniture
statues paintings bricabrac  things of obviously enormous value are standing
beside a kitchen stove an old rocking chair and other junk among which is also an
old sled the selfsame story  somewhere in the back one of the vast gothic
windows of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene rustling the
papers

in the center of the hall a photographer and his assistant are busy photographing
the sundry objects  the floor is littered with burntout flash bulbs  they
continue their work throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a
flash bulb goes off  in addition to the photographer and his assistant there are a
girl and two newspaperment  the second and third men of the projection room scene 
also thompson and raymond

the girl and the second man who wears a hat are dancing somewhere in the back of

just photographed a picture obviously of great value an italian primitive  the
assistant consults a label on the back of it

					thompson
			not much

					second newspaperman
			well what have you been doing

					thompson
			playing with a jigsaw puzzle    i
			talked to a lot of people who knew him

					girl
			what do they say

					thompson
			well  its become a very clear picture
			he was the most honest man who ever
			lived with a streak of crookedness
			a yard wide  he was a liberal and a
			reactionary he was tolerant  live
			and let live  that was his motto
			but he had no use for anybody who
			disagreed with him on any point no
			matter how small it was  he was a
			loving husband and a good father 
			and both his wives left him and his
			son got himself killed about as
			shabbily as you can do it  he had a
			gift for friendship such as few men
			have  he broke his oldest friends
			heart like youd throw away a cigarette
			you were through with  outside of that 

					third newspaperman
			okay okay

					girl
			what about rosebud  dont you
			think that explains anything

					thompson
			no i dont  not much anway  charles
			foster kane was a man who got everything
			he wanted and then lost it  maybe
			rosebud was something he couldnt get
			or lost  no i dont think it explains
			anything  i dont think any word explains
			a mans life  no   i guess rosebud is
			just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle  a
			missing piece

he drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box looking at his watch

					thompson
			wed better get along  well miss
			the train

he picks up his overcoat  it has been resting on a little sled  the little sled
young charles foster kane hit thatcher with at the opening of the picture  camera
doesnt close in on this  it just registers the sled as the newspaper people
picking up their clothes and equipment move out of the great hall

shovels are shovelling things into the furnace  raymond is about ten feet away

camera travels to the pile that he has indicated  it is mostly bits of broken
packing cases excelsior etc  the sled is on top of the pile  as camera comes
close it shows the faded rosebud and though the letters are faded unmistakably
the word rosebud across it  the laborer drops his shovel takes the sled in his
hand and throws it into the furnace  the flames start to devour it

ext xanadu  night  1940

no lights are to be seen  smoke is coming from a chimney

camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the picture perhaps omitting
some of the stages  it moves finally through the gates which close behind it  as
camera pauses for a moment the letter k is prominent in the moonlight

just before we fade out there comes again into the picture the pattern of barbed
wire and cyclone fencing  on the fence is a sign which reads

private  no trespassing
