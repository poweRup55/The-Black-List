     ext  mountain range  helicopter pov  day

     we are flying soaring wheeling diving through a range of
     magnificent mountains  they are the colorado rockies and
     right now in early spring its one of the finest sights on
     earth the lush greenery of the valleys gives way to cliffs of
     sheer rock and towering peaks crowned by snow

     as the credits roll we wheel past a mountain wall and realize
     this is the pov from


     a helicopter

     as it soars up to circle the tallest mountain  the tower  it
     rises thousands of feet from the ground below so high that its
     summit is wreathed in clouds

     thats part of a lower but equally formidable peak separated
     from the tower by a chasm two hundred feet wide  hal tucker
     30s and his girlfriend sarah collins 20s are decked out
     in warm weather climbing gear  hals aplomb suggests hes a
     veteran climber  sarahs worried look confirms she isnt
     hals knee is wrapped in several elastic bandages  he also
     carries a slow burning flare in one hand

     wide shot

     the chopper drops lower and from its perspective we now see
     gabe walker 30s climber extraordinaire literally clinging
     against the underside of a fifty foot rock ledge  it is a
     deathdefyingmanouevrethat goes completely against the laws
     of gravity

                        jessie
                    transmits
               oh my god  i cant recognize
               the face but the butt does look
               vaguely familiar
                    whistles

                        gabe
                    laughs

               rock jock

     hal fires a flare

     gabe finally reaches the edge of the ledge and grabbing the
     edge swings out into space where he hangs by one arm as he
     digs his free hand into a chalk bag that hangs from his waist

                        jessie
               hals signalling hes ok

     cut to  gabe

     he pauses and points out at jessie hovering above

                        gabe
               and when i came down my morals
               were corrupted forever

               right out

     gabe arrives at an overhang turns around and prepares to kick
     over what is apparently a dangerous move

     gabe pulls himself up on the ledge  winded he slumps down next
     to the couple

                        gabe

     ext chopper

     the helicopter dips down towards the ledge  no way can it land
     here  frank lowers a rescue wire to gabe who swings
     precariously out from the ledge to grab it  the wire is just
     out of reach

     gabe sees that sarah is growing increasingly nervous at the
     prospect of having to make an emergency transport  the
     choppers rotor wash requires all present to speak in a loud
     voice

                        gabe
                    eyes hal then sarah

     the helicopter

     frank gets out to secure the wire  now a lifeline spans the
     chasm


     on the ledge

     gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock  hal clips his
     harness onto the rescue line

                        hal
               remember whatever he says about

     with that hal pulls himself handoverhand across the sloping
     line

     hals povthe drop

     is vertigo defined  4000 feet straight down  however

     hal

     lets go of the overhead line and clasps his hands to his face
     in mock horror  he quickly whizzes the last thirty feet of
     line  frank grabs him

     the ledge

     gabe steals a glance at sarah realizes how frightened she is

                        gabe

               you ready for the best ride in
               the park

     gabe starts to push her out on the line but at the last moment
     her nerve fails her  she grabs his arm dropping her head to
     look down  gabe takes hold of her chin stopping her making
     her face him

                        sarah

     gabe pushes her out  as he does he nods across the abyss to
     hal who nods back confident but concerned  he cant forget
     that everything that matters to him is suspended by a thread
     over a 4000 foot drop

     gabe gently pulls himself up on the line crosses his ankles on
     it and clips himself on with a three foot safety line  he
     starts smoothly quickly pulling himself out  hal can barely

     sarah is in trouble  the bobbing of the line from gabes weight
     and the winds are making her lose her grip even more  gabe
     pulls himself along the line faster trying not to shake the
     line  he looks across at hal who has dug in to brace the line
     its not meant for this much weight

     sarah starts to look down into the abyss

     sarah is too scared to comply her other arm flailing as if
     that might stop the swinging with the next arc

     their grip slides to wrist level and keeps slipping  gabes
     hand digs into sarahs climbing glove and holds

                        jessie
               gabe hold her  hold her

     gabes face is a mask of strained concentration as he tries to
     grab the main line and maintain his grip on sarah

     he finally snags the main line but he cant stabilize them
     with the next swing

                        gabe

               up

     for what seems like an eternity sarahs eyes lock onto gabes
     with an expression of unabashed terror as her hand slides out
     of her glove  shefallsher eyes still locked on gabe who can
     only look down swaying helplessly on the wire as sarah screams

     on the opposite side

     frank and jessie look down in horror but neither look as
     anguished as hal  her screams are heard in jessies headset

                        hal

     imagine

     gabe

     twists from his safety line clutching sarahs glovehe wants
     to but cant shut his eyeshe locks eyes with

     hal

     whose horror and grief are even greater than gabes

     gabes pov  the chasm

     sarah is gone  the safety harness spirals down after her
     like a carefree bird  her scream echoes off the cliffs and
     through the canyons  fainter fainter  until its almost a
     memory  carrying across to

     ext  colorado town  early morning

     the weather is becoming moody as wind bends the tops of the
     trees and blows debris down the street  we see a wellworn
     vehicle moving past a filling station

     two young rock jocks are driving by in their impossibly mudcaked
     jeep  loud music blasts from their stereo  the two
     young men are brett and evan  they wear bright colored jackets
     and have their hats backwards over their long hair  wraparound
     shades adorn bretts face  brett notices gabes bronco
     crossing the intersection  he wildly honks the horn and does
     a radical uturn

                        brett

     the two boys spin off and gabe slowly moves on in the opposite
     direction


     ext  jessies cabin  morning

     it is a rustic modest home built mostly of local lumber and
     stone  in the corral we see jessie forking hay over the fence
     to her three horses

     the wind is picking up as gabe steps into view  thoroughly
     engrossed in her work she fails to notice gabes arrival  she
     turns and is momentarily taken aback by the sight of gabe  she
     collects herself

     they lock expressions for an uncomfortable moment then jessie
     throws one last wedge of hay

                        jessie
                    low
               hello gabriel

               if one night i got up and packed
               up all my things and drove away
               without leaving so much as a
               note and stayed away for months
               i think what id want to do is
               come up with a well thoughtout
               reason

                        gabe
               after the funeral i just had to

               mind everyday

                        jessie

               it doesnt get any better

     the treasury jet

     the dc9 cruises over mountainous remote terrain


     int  jet  close on travers

     who looks tensewe move around the cabin and find two more
     relaxed treasury agents dozing on the opposite side of the
     plane  the interior of the plane is rather spartan and cold
     matheson is edgy  an agent offers condescending reassurance

                        agent
               travers says youre being

     blocking out the sun

     matheson reacts to this and shifts his look upward to


     window pov the planeis flying a parallel course to the treasury jet and is just
     one hundred yards away


     inside the plane

     matheson stands  travers has noticed the plane by now too and
     gets out of his seat as the other agents react

                        matheson

                    to other agents
               stay put  dont anybody jump to
               conclusions

     travers moves into


     the cockpit

     where the pilot seems nervous but oddly not frightened

                        pilot
               hes coming in too slow

                        travers
                    cool
               no were going too fast and
               were too high up  give me 180
               knots and drop to fifteen
               thousand feet

     matheson is out of his seat

                        matheson
                    to agent
               christ  were losing altitude
               and slowing down  if you have
               automatic weapons get them

     travers steps out

                        travers
               what are you doing  i have
               jurisdiction on this jet

     matheson goes to his briefcase and flips it open  it contains
     a full auto uzi  he pulls it from its clasps

                        travers
               what the hell are you doing

                        matheson

               i said get your weapons

                        travers
               these are highly trained agents
               overreacting without just cause

     travers puts his hands out and walks forward slowly backing
     matheson into the cabin  not in surrender but as if hes
     calming a nutcase  the other agents see this and dont know
     which way to jump

                        travers
               calm downgive the gun to me
               youre out of control son

                        matheson

               for goddammit  dont you see
               what hes doing  hes hijacking
               the shipment

     the other two agents get behind matheson and rapidly disarm
     him  travers pulls out his gun and fires it three times one
     for each agents chest  the agents are cut down realizing too
     late whats happened  two shots knock matheson over a seat

     the copilot begins to step out when he is shot by the pilot
     with a silencer

     travers puts on a radio headset as he goes to a window

     himself to a safety wire flips on an oxygen mask and almost
     simultaneously pulls the lever that releases the bolts on the
     tail cone leaving a 6 by 3 hole

     a huge vacuum is created by the hole and loose debris such as

     over an led

     the led

     starts counting down from 200  159  158

     even in the last minute the storms gotten worse  the plane
     is flying right into the blackest center of it  the pilot
     looks more panicked than ever

     in the cabin

     the pilot has just placed his harness on and is about to push
     the cases out when behind him matheson shakily crawls forward
     and riddles the pilot with auto fire  as the pilot falls
     forward he hits the lever that releases the cases

     drops out of the plane flailing  if he is screaming we cant

     the cockpit all the way through the fuselage and out the rear

     dive down faster at an ever steeper angle over the edge of the
     colorado mountain range

     away at a piece of wood with a shiny folding knife used by most
     climbers  frank is standing behind a large 3 by 4 piece of
     glass upon which he is painting a bizarre abstract creation
     frank is approximately sixty years old but still possesses the
     wiry but partly stiff body of a former rodeo rider whos taken
     a hundred falls too many

     jessie enters looking rather despondent  she goes to the

               oh yes thats it right here  i
               believe ol frank nailed it with
               that stroke  hal cmere

     still whittling hal drifts over and observes the painting

     it is pouring rain as gabe guides his bronco down the winding
     mountain road  the bronco pulls over

     gabe stares straight ahead at the rain that beats down on the
     windshield  the wipers going back and forth become like a
     monotonous heartbeat  indecision fills his yes  he puts his
     head down on the steering wheel and we cut


     int  wrights office  day

     he should break first  davis shows up at the door

                        wright
                    furious
               okay whats the report  where
               the hell is that plane

                        davis

               theres no radio contact at all
               sir and were not receiving the
               tracer signal from the cockpits
               flight recorder

     he points to a huge part of colorado  hundreds of square
     miles

                        davis
               we have to assume it went down in
               the storm  that storm front is
               still building  even if we could
               get a search plane up now itd
               be impossible to see anything on
               the ground

                        wright
               what about the roads

                        davis
               most of this area doesnt even
               have roads

     a secretary enters

                        secretary
               mr wright theres two fbi
               agents that demand to see you

     two mature agents enter in a highly agitated state

                        agent 1
               mr wright im agent hayes and
               this is agent michaels  were
               here about the jet disappearance

                        wright
               look if youre just concerned
               about your agent who was along
               for the ride

                        agent hayes
               matheson wasnt along for the
               ride he was working
               surveillance

                        wright
               surveillance  for what

                        agent hayes
               the bureau had been receiving
               sketchy reports about treasury
               flight patterns being monitored
               from denver to san francisco  it
               was thought best not to alert
               anyone in your department in case
               there was the possibility of it
               being an inside job

                        wright
               thats impossible  you suggest
               a hijacking  impossible  not
               only did i have my best men on
               that flight each one of those
               cases are monitored and the
               money is in unexchangeable
               denominations  it would be
               useless for anyone to steal

                        agents michaels
                    presents a folder
               not for this man

               eric qualen  hes the one weve
               been tracking without much
               success  hes a former member of
               military intelligence who found
               it more profitable going to the

               international connections to move
               this currency and one hundred
               million offers one hell of a
               temptation to this psychotic

                        wright
               jesus christ this cant be
               happening

                        agent hayes
               i know  unfortunately it is and
               what we need is a complete
               profile on all the men aboard
               that jet backgrounds both
               business and personal

     ext  south wall  day

     the sheer wall that is leaning actually outward is a terrifying
     sight  we see a mere spec moving cautiously upwardit is
     gabe


     cut to  cu  gabe

     straining to maintain his balance in the driving wind and snow

                        gabe
                    echoes jessies words
               and if you go up the south wall
               you can catch him no problem
               yeah

     gabe has a moment of indecision almost a look of mounting fear
     in his eyes

     gabe starts to ascend and pauses to look straight up the rock
     face then straight down  as the wind tears at his face his
     eyes reflect in momentary panic


     flash back

     black and white grainy dreamlike effect as sarah falls  she
     strobes down the canyon floor her eyes and amplified voice
     shrieking in fear


     back to scene

     shaken gabe starts to descend then pauses and looks up the
     sheer face

     he pulls out his bolt gun and fires into the wall  hooking up
     he proceeds upward

                        gabe
               keep going keep going


     ext  mountain wall  day  high angle on hal

     whos now a good way up the wall at least a thousand feet off
     the ground  wind and snow make the climbing hard  this part
     of the wall is sheer slightly overhung and slick  his only
     foothold is about a halfinch of ledge  a larger ledge is
     above him tantalizingly just out of reach

     he gropes up stretching trying to get that extra halfinch
     reachhe gets it


     the top of the ledge

     suddenly a hand seizes hals  surprised hal starts to slip
     back  gabe pulls him the rest of the way up  panting from
     this last effort he leans against the wall next to gabe

                        hal
               what the hell are you doing
               here

               well you were wrong it was your
               weight on the line that did it

                        gabe
               there wasnt time for anything
               else

               everybody

                        hal

               bad time  you didnt love her
               you didnt have to explain to her

               and you werent looking into her
               eyes when she fell  now drop it

     hal suddenly catches gabe offguard by the front of the jacket
     gabe is precariously balanced on the edge his life totally in
     hals hands

                        hal
               no buddy it was you who dropped
               it

               if you want do it  i dont
               care

     gabe and hal lock stares for a long moment  hal pulls him back
     in

                        hal
                    a threat
               when its over you and me

     hal gives him a withering stare and moves away

     int  cockpit  day

     tight on a map spread out on the planes wrecked instrument
     panel

     we see travers keying a setup of numbers into his portable
     monitor the monitor lights up with a pattern of frequency

     gabe looks at the monitor then the map and he glances at hal

                        gabe
               looks like the tower  its a bad
               climb

                    to gabe
               lets go time to fetch


     ext  mountain wall  wide shot  day  hal and gabe

     have led the gang further up the wall using pitons and
     carabiner clips to create a guide rope  its still just a
     matter of climbing relatively easy ascending ledges  the
     howling wind continues to blow snow all around them

                        qualen
                    yells from behind
               the faster you find the bags the
               bigger you boys finders fee
               will be

                        hal
                    to gabe
               right all the bullets we can
               eat


     the wall

     the climbers have reached an easier section of the wall  the
     ledge is now two feet wide  travers takes out the tracer
     monitor it shows the first case is just above them

     travers and gabe look up through the driving snow

     qualen has hals walkietalkie in his hand  he monitors
     jessies message

                        jessie
                    vo
               hal come in please

     qualen turns off the radio

                        qualen
               sounds cute

     a crest

     juts out of the wall a hundred plus feet above their position
     as the rest of the wall above is completely sheer the case
     must have landed on top of a ledge  but this isnt easily
     accessible  we move down from the crest to see there are only
     the smallest of handholds and those are slick with ice making
     climbing almost impossible  tons of snow and ice are suspended
     precariously on top of the mountain

     on the ledge

     delmar holds his gun on gabe as hal helps gabe put on his
     crampons

                        hal
               watch yourself under that
               overhang
                    gabe eyes him
               it could goanytime

     gabe eyes the ledge and gets his meaning

                        qualen
               go on fetch

                        gabe

               axe

               we agree on something  and for
               insurance take his coat

               ryan get a rope i want the man
               on a leash too

     gabe looks up this is going to be tough even for him
                        hal
               forget me  if you can get away

                        gabe
               would you

     hal looks at him for a beat emotionally torn

     gabe moves away

     high angle  gabe

     moves up the wall with some ease at first  there are small
     handholds and decent footholds but twenty feet up theres
     nothing  to keep going gabe has to wedge his fingers into
     small cracks supporting his weight only by several fingerholds
     at any given moment

     on the ledge  travers and qualen with ryan

     who holds the rope fastened to gabes ankle

     gabe on the wall  close

     hes moving up a sheer face he has hit a section that barely
     has any edges for him to insert his fingers  he pauses and
     removes his necklace

     cut to  qualen and hal

                        qualen
               whats he doing

                        hal
               the best he can since you gave
               him nothing

     cut to  gabe

     he takes the charm which is really a miniature ice axe and
     inserts it into a crack then wrapping the necklace around his
     gloved hand he pulls himself up with one hand to a secure
     handhold

     gabe keeps this hold with one hand and slides the other up
     hammering into a crack wedged with ice some of the ice chips
     whistle past and down  finally gabe gropes one hand over the
     edge and pulls himself onto

     the crest

     exhausted gabe slumps prone across the top  he sees a case
     wedged in a crack

     he goes to it

     its battered from the fall but still holding together  gabe
     manages to force open the trashed locks he looks inside the
     case and fingers a band of 1000s

                        gabe
               jesus


     on the ledge  travers and qualen

     look up  they can see gabe has made it but they cant see him
     or the case

                        travers
               i dont trust him

                        qualen
               kill him when he gets down

     hal overhears the last statement and bolts forward screaming up
     toward gabe

                        hal
               dont come down theyre gonna
               kill you  dont come down

     delmar rams hal with his forearm against the back of hals
     neck levelling him

                        travers
                    shouting
               pull the rope  pull it

     on the crest  gabe

     gabe is painfully being jerked onto his side and pulled to the
     edge by the frayed rope that is still fastened around his
     ankle

     on the ledge travers and qualen

                        travers
               pull goddamn it

     gabe frantically claws at the ground as he desperately tries to
     sever the rope  nearly at the edge he manages to brace one
     foot against a rock as he wildly slashes at the rope with his
     crampon

     the rope being pulled by ryan and kynette suddenly snaps down
     on the men

     on the crest

     with the case gabe scrambles up the wall towards the girder
     of ice from travers and qualens point of view gabe can
     hardly be seen  since the mountain bulges out as it goes up
     gabes got a slight edge of cover

                        travers
                    shouts to heldon
               shoot  what the hell are you
               waiting for

     heldon runs along the lower edge firing up at

     gabe

     who has to flatten against the upper ledge  bullets howl past
     twenty per second sparking against the lip of the rock  the
     bullets chisel away at the ice above him  gabe looks ominously
     at the frozen overhang

                        qualen
                    holds a gun to hals
                     head

     frustrated qualen shoves hal aside

                        qualen
               get him

     heldon

     sees gabes cover is gone  heldons ledge is getting wider
     heldon moves out to the ledge and continues to fire into the
     ice

     the ice and snow

     emits a roar as itgives away dropping an avalanche of white
     death

     gabe

     drops the case and hugs the wall

     the avalanche  wide view on the mountain

     only now can we see how much snow and ice has been penned up on
     the mountain toptons of frozen fury sweeps down themountainside  it shatters the case against the wall easily
     sweeping a screaming heldon off the ledge

     travers qualen and hal

     are safe at their vantage but stunned at the sight of the
     avalanche  heldons machine gun fires uselessly as hes
     swallowed in an explosion of white and a flurry of green as the
     bills scatter amid the snow

     travers

     stares at thirty plus million dollars worth of snow settling
     far below

     qualen grabs hal by the throat

                        qualen
               your friend just had the most
               expensive funeral in history

     delmar shoves hal forward and the group moves out


     the upper crest

     where gabe was  nothing is stirring  then there is movement
     ten feet from where gabe was hugging the wall

     its a crevice in the mountain about two feet wide  a climber
     would call this a chimney and its packed with ice and snow
     its also packed with

     gabe

     his hand appears through the snow and he digs himself out
     gasping and coughing  coated with snow he leans against the
     wall  alive


     ranger station  day

     jessie looks out as the rain splatters against the window  the
     stations windspeed gauge is flying around so fast it looks

               type he needs something more

                        hal
               the only faster way up is the
               east face and its smooth as
               glass  maybe a dozen guys in the
               world could do it in good
               weather only a psycho would try
               it in a storm


     close shot  gabes face

     is torn with pain  hes making the toughest climb of his life
     besides nearly being frozen to death in the snow storm

     we pull back and reveal a wall that is as wide as it is high
     five thousand feet by five thousand feet narrowing to a domed
     peak at the summit  worse its checkered with ice  visible
     on the massive wall is a small dot moving twothirds of the
     way up

     gabe holds himself steady with one hand gets a foothold and
     lunges in a dyno movement to another set of handholds and
     swiftly continues on his way up


     ext  chopper  day

     we see the chopper being buffeted by winds as it hovers over a
     flat area in the west valley  jessie is being lowered by a
     winch  she reaches the ground and disconnects the harness
     waving shes okay

     frank banks the chopper out of there


     ext  east face wide shot  day

     the sheer wall of the east face rises seemingly forever into
     the sky above

     gabe is clearly exhausted and freezing  the wind and snow
     threaten to throw him off the wall but he forces himself on
     he is climbing up a huge frozen waterfall

                        gabe
                    teeth chattering
               a steam bath
                    pulls himself up
               a steam bath a bottle of remy
               martinkeep going

     he climbs higher into a chandelier of hanging icicles  its
     an incredible formation part of a

     frozen glacier overhang

     a sheer overhang of ice curling over the top of the east face
     waterfall

     gabe climbs past the icicles up a sheet of pure ice

                        gabe
               a steam bath with a bottle of
               remy martin and afirenow
               what

     he slows to a stop and the ice overhang curves out away
     gabe sticks his gloved hand into a stream of water  he reaches
     out and grabs a huge icicle with his wet fist  the glove
     freezes there instantly

                        gabe
               a steak soaked in remy cooking
               over a steam bath on fire

     gabe wets the other glove hauls himself up and goes for a
     second handhold  the next glove freezes on another icicle
     suddenly his feet slip off the wall and gabe is left dangling
     with a glove frozen into place  he tries to pull away to grab
     a higher handhold but his hand slips out of the glove

     gabe clings onehanded to the overhang his face showing real
     terror  his body swings wildly held only by one gloved hand
     frozen overhead  his legs kick out to find some support
     smashing into huge icicles  they break off and fall away  his
     naked hand stretches for the glove but cant reach it
     gabe swings his spiked boot up to try for a heel hold  his
     foot smashes into the snowy ice atop the serac and holds
     stabilized he snatches the frozen glove from the icicle and
     hauls himself up over the lip in the worlds toughest situp


     gabes pov through the driving snow

     a small shack with a sign commemorating the douglas mine shaft
     1933


     int  douglas shaft  day

     just a point of interest for tourists who have hiked up this
     far housing a minimuseum

     a pair of thundering kicks at the door and the lock shatters
     the light of day knifes into the otherwise dark windowless
     room comprised of old planks of knotted pine

     the gordon douglas display

     has black and white photos of the squarejawed 1930s climber
     with his expedition  more important is whats beneath it
     douglas original climbing equipment  a coil of rope some
     pitons a hat a cloth backpack small binoculars a parka and
     other odds and ends

     trembling badly gabe grabs a pick axe off the wall and
     prepares to smash the glass  he hears movement in the shaft
     area an opening not more than ten feet away  dust floats in
     the strip of light that is emitted from the door  gabes eyes
     tighten like an enraged animal

     shaft

     from inside the shafts entrance gabes figure stealthily
     approaches the ice axe raised high ready for the kill  he
     moves into the darkness  something tries to bolt away and he
     lunges at it furiously slamming the person against the wall
     a radio falls from the person and lets out a static death groan
     as it shatters to the bottom of the shaft  gabes axe is
     poised for the fatal blow

                        jessie
               no

     gabe pulls her forward into what little light there is and
     stares into her terrified countenance

               gabe

               the distress call was a fake  it
               was a downed plane full of
               thieves

     he shatters the three display cases and starts to remove the
     old clothing flares gloves etc

                        gabe
               before it crashed they dumped

     the last ten feet and are running even as they hit the ground
     more bullets hit where gabe and jessie were a split second ago

     they burst out of the trees and find all thats beneath them is

     gabe and jessies pov

     a sudden sloping plunge down a field of ice  no escape here
     anything that goes down this slide is going all the way to the
     ground far below

     a fresh burst of bullets forces them to dive behind a boulder
     the sole source of cover

                        gabe
               this way

     ryan

     emerges from the woods  he can see there is nowhere for them
     to have gone except behind the boulder  he walks toward it as
     if he had all the time in the world

                        gabe
               give me a flare

     gabe ignites the flare and heaves it over the boulder at ryan

     ryan  nightfinder pov  the flare

     arcs over the boulder to fully ignite turning everything into
     an agonizing flash of white

     ryan

     screams blinded as he tries to rip the goggles off

     gabe bolts out from behind the boulder and rushes him  ryan
     shoots blind fanning out in a semicircle as he gets the
     goggles off

     gabe charges straight for ryan just getting to him before the
     machine guns field of fire can intersect his path  he tackles
     him

     the machine gun clatters away landing on the edge of the ice
     just out of reach  ryan recovers from the blinding flash
     pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at gabe
     gabe rolls away and gets to the machine gun grabbing itbut
     ryan dives for gabe slamming into himthe force of it knocks
     the machine gun looseit skips down the ice slope  the
     momentum of ryans hit also carries both gabe and ryan over the

     to flip overon top of ryan and ride him down like a bobsled

     delmar pulls out his gun and brett and evan shocked take off
     running

     brett gets ten yards before delmar mows him down with his
     machine gun riddling the kid with at least thirty rounds at
     close range

                        hal
               you son of a bitch  you said you

     kristel clubs him with a pistol  an enraged delmar kicks him
     savagely in the midsection

     evan runs with kynette and travers in pursuit


     below on the wallside

     gabe and jessie moving along the rock wall react to the sound
     of the gunfire then move on  the wall is relatively sheer
     but there are shelves cut in that make progress easier


     in the woods  evan

     runs like his ass is on fire with kynette and travers still in
     pursuit

     he tries to pull on his parachute and run at the same time
     its not easy but he succeeds in closing the first of the
     three buckles  he continues running and weaving through the
     trees  he sees the edge just ahead and puts on an extra burst
     of speed

     the spur

     is a rock formation that juts off like a diving board  evan
     runs like hell down it

     travers and kynette

     emerge from out of the trees  they see evan launching himself
     off the edge


     gabe and jessie

     are several hundred feet below

                        gabe
               dont pull it


     on the spur edge  travers

     tries to grab the rifle from kynette

                        travers
               shoot him

     kynette tries to hit the falling target but misses

     pulls the dring the parachute billows open inflating


     kynette

     sights down the rifle

                        travers
               hit him  youre letting him get
               away

     in a startling smooth movement travers rips the gun from
     kynettes grip and fires almost simultaneously


     close on the parachute

     bullet holes pierce the canopy

     evan

     exhilaration turns to panic as a bullet lodges in evans upper
     back


     gabe and jessie on the ledge

     are powerless to do anything but watch

                        jessie
               oh god


     evan

     struggles to maintain consciousness and control


     jessie

     turns away  she cant watch any more


     evan

     lands hard and collapses

               you dumb bastard you waited too
               long  if he made it back this

     jessie nods yes and they move out


     ext  mountain  ariel shot  day

     hal leads the gang through a buttress a large boulder
     formation that lies between the mountain theyve just come
     from and the nearest mountain to it the tower

     hal and the rest of the expedition are totally exposed as they
     climb in single file up to the top the incline is angled so
     that the climb amounts to an uphill run on all fours

     closer on hal and gang

     hal leads the gang forward and keeps casting anxious glances
     back at them and beyond them

                        qualen
               forget it  your friends smart
               not invisible

     qualen is right  theres absolutely no way gabe can come up
     behind them without being seen


     lower down on bluff

     where the bluff meets a treelined plain  gabe and jessie in
     hiding watch hal and the others go up  they know they cant
     follow them without being seen

                        gabe
               hes taking them the long way
               around

     moving closer to the bluffs base gabe and jessie shove
     through a screen of brush to the beginning of

     the crack

     a crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff
     gabe pulls out his ancient binoculars and scans the crack

     gabes pov  the crack

     picture a mine shaft designed by a madman  the crack moves
     upward then erratically to the side then straight up again
     the width of the crack is uneven ranging from six inches to
     six feet and thats just how it looks on theoutside

     gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack  it looks
     as if the crack goes all the way through the bluff  on this
     route gabe can tunnel the mountain instead of going up the
     side

                        gabe
               we have to get through to the
               other side  you up for it

                        gabe
               a simple yes or no would have
               done

     mountain range  the only thing thats taller is the tower

     between the two mountains lies a drop of a mere four thousand
     feet

     travers tenses then turns to where the sides of the two
     mountains converge  at one point theyre only about fifteen
     feet apart  its here that a rope and timber bridge spans the
     drop

                        travers

     the dark  the light reveals theres about two inches of
     clearance between his chest and the rock and about the same
     between his back and the rock

     there is no light inside not even above because the crack
     doesnt go straight it zigzags up  gabe and jessie are well
     within the mountain rock  nothing could be closer to being
     buried alive

     straight up  gabe aims jessies flashlight upwards

     gabes povscores of batshang on the wall surrounding them up and down

     is somewhere between nausea and the realization that shes made
     a big mistake

     he starts to lift the boys body


     int  bluff crack  day

     gabe and jessie have a quick climbing rhythm now

     the passage starts to thin out  they grope up  the passage
     narrows to the point that they cant get through it

                        gabe
               what was god thinking when he
               built this place

               if we dont get out of here soon
               we can ask him in person

     gabe looks up to see if the crack has gotten wider  it hasnt

                        gabe
               keep going this way

     the light aims up no opening larger than a mail slot  still
     moving to the side he gets the opening he wants but not where
     he wants it

                        gabe
               oh you beautiful rockthis

     gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches
     himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack  as he
     brakes himself his flashlight shoots off into space  one more
     foot and he would have gone soaring to his death

                        jessie

     just as the crack has widened below him its widened above
     him  more important it slants at an easy enough angle to
     allow him to walk up  a rope is tied around his shoulder

     he braces himself with one leg and one arm until he has his
     hands on the curved edge where the crack snakes into a sideways
     passage

     int  crack

     kynette slides down the rope and enters the blackness of the
     crack  his weapon poised for action he stalks his prey
     suddenly gabe lunges out of the dark and attacks kynette from
     the rear  the machine gun goes flying  kynette rolls to his
     feet and smashes gabe with a shattering punch

     jessie can only look helplessly on as kynette slashes at gabe
     with a knife  the crack is getting wider  kynette powers into
     gabe with another bone shattering punch  gabe flies back
     several feet managing to straddle the crack walls  overhead
     are jagged stalagtites that hang like an entrance to the jaws
     of hell

     kynette moves in for the kill  he swings down with the knife
     the blade hissing in the gloom  jessie pulls off her belt that
     comes equipped with a rather large buckle  kynette has gabe
     cornered and draws back the knife for the kill

                        kynette
               whos the man now

     as he thrusts forward jessies belt buckle bashes with
     shocking force against the side of kynettes face  gabe uses
     this split second of great fortune to lunge at kynette and
     seizes his knife hand  gabe drives home a halfdozen painful
     punches that force the knife loose from kynettes hand  in one
     powerful moment gabe drops down wraps his arms firmly around
     kynette and swings upwards driving a stalagtite deep into
     kynettes upper back  gabe slumps in exhaustion  he picks up
     kynettes machine gun and checks the clip  empty  he pulls
     his bolt gun off kynettes back

                        gabe

     and timber bridge that spans the chasm  gabe is several paces
     ahead when he steps onto the bridge  a snapping sound from the

     jessie has just stepped onto the bridge  she jumps back
     the last bolt forced to take all the strain breaks free
     the bridge collapses swinging down spilling wooden slats and
     debris into the chasm  the rope and timber completelyunravel
     gabe jumps off the disintegrating bridge onto the

     rock spur

     jessie grabs him steadying him

                        gabe
               doesnt anything last

     jessie turns looking around as if somewhere shell see a
     solution

                        jessie
               my heart cant take much more of
               this  look if we climb down

     he turns around pointing across the chasm

                        gabe
               what do you think  maybe i could
               reach the ledge without falling
               no forget it

                        jessie
               oh good for a minute i thought
               youd lost your mind

     gabe

     points to a series of tiny outcroppings just below where the
     bridge was anchored

                        gabe
               but maybe with a good start i can
               hit those handholds

                        jessie
               handholds  i can barely see
               them

                        gabe
               we dont have time to argue about
               it

                        jessie
               are you crazy  has the altitude
               shrunk your brain gabe

               anybody in their right mind
               then again you never were in
               your right mind

                        gabe

                        jessie

               throat

                        gabe
               fine it shouldnt bother your
               conscience

                        jessie
               dont lay any guilt on me
               suicides a personal thing best
               done alone

     she turns and goes  gabe doesnt look after her  he backs up
     all of his senses are focused on the gap and the handholds
     beyond it  push in on his facea moment of meditation as he
     centers himself

                        jessie
               please gabe this is insane
                    to herself
               please dont do this  i cant
               watch this  i cant

     she starts to quickly wrap the rope twice around a thin
     outcropped rock

                        jessie
               y know youre not brave you
               just have no common sense  none

     then hes off  a few powerful strides and he leaps

     across the gap

     nothing but air for four thousand feet  his whole body would
     like a spring the wind rushing past  his arms firing out
     reaching

     the rock

     racing to meet us  his hands stretchingstretchinghis
     fingers touching  sliding down the rock gripping the hand
     holds  gabe like a fly on the wall hangs by nothing more
     than his fingernails

     jessie is determined not to turn and look  suddenly a scream

                        jessie
               gabe

     she slowly turns and sees gabe standing on the opposite ledge

                        gabe
               just kidding

                        jessie
               gabe  wait til i get over
               there  tie the rope so i can
               come across

               cant do it  now go back and get
               help

     he lets the rope fall and runs off

     forensics expert

     a search pilot zips the bag back up

                        stuart
               we found id on the dead pilot
               he was known to be in the company
               of qualen  we have to assume
               this was his jet

     ext  mountain wall  gabe moving on a ledge

     thats extremely narrow  its got irregular breaks causing it
     to go up or down several feet and gabe is jogging it leaping
     across the ledges gaps leaning toward the wall and away from
     the four thousand foot drop

     he makes the last jump to a section of ledge near the bottom of


     the bitker ladder

     a prominent sign reads property of the bitker mining company

     the ladder consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable
     bolted into the rock running two hundred feet to the top
     something left here by a past expedition now a tourists toy
     the bottom rung is three feet above gabes outstretched arms

                        gabe
                    coiling for jump
               bitker you cheap bastard
               couldnt you afford three more
               feet

     gabe leaps up grabbing the bottom rung instead of a half mile
     of air and he shoots up the ladder as we pull back

     wider angle on mountain wall

     a closer look at terrain seen earlier

     as we track gabe up the ladder we can see a lake on top of the
     mountain constant motion keeps it from totally freezing but
     it is still coated with a solid sheet of ice


     elsewhere on mountain slope  hal

     leads the others down the grade we can see from their relative
     position to the lake that gabe has a lead on them  a very
     slight one


     top of ladder  gabe

     pulls himself over and starts running into a

     rocky area

     where he spots the third case  it took a tough landing on a
     rock  its shattered into halves and the bands of bank notes
     are scattered around in the snow

     gabe rushes down behind a rock and starts gathering the cash
     soaked by the snow theyve nearly frozen into ice bricks
     something catches his eye  several feet away he sees rabbit
     tracks leading into a very prominent rabbit hole


     ext  further up on slope  hal

     and the other two crest a rise  unaccustomed to the altitude
     and the exercise travers and delmar are fading  they stop
     catching their breath

     travers

     checks the monitor  anxiety washes across his face  the
     relative position shows theyre

                        travers
               almost there  alright ive got
               it locked in

                        travers
                    nods
               yes and do it quietly your
               insane boss just made enough
               noise for anyone within ten miles
               to hear us

     travers studies the monitor and moves away

                        delmar
                    pointing at hal

               whos shooting

     delmar rears back and slams his head against hals forehead
     driving him to the ground  delmar then kicks him in the ribs

                        delmar
               how we feelin so far  upset
               stomach aye

     hal recoils from another kick and tries to rise

                        delmar
               like soccer  great sport  i was
               a bloody good striker  heres an
               outside right
                    kicks

     hal recoils in pain as delmar breaks the bone in his lower leg
     hal howls in agony but tries to rise

                        delmar
               did i hear somethin break
               outside left

                        hal
               fuck you

                        delmar
               cursin  thats a penalty kick
               for unsportsmanlike conduct
               mate

     he kicks hal again sending him back several feet crashing
     heavily on his side  hal tries to remove a folding climbing
     knife that fits in a sheath sewn into the side of his boot

                        delmar
               a lovely chip shot to the winger
                    kicks

     hal has been kicked near the edge of a cliff  he weakly
     reaches for his boot knife  again this is not noticed by
     delmar whos having a wonderfully sadistic time

                        delmar
               winger back to striker

     delmar kicks hal who is barely hanging on to consciousness

                        delmar
               he dribbles past one defender
                    kicks
               two defenders
                    kicks
               three defenders

     hal lies crumpled on his side curled in a ball of pain

                        delmar
               striker lines up to the goal
               focuses on the ball

     hal has barely managed to remove the knife and secretly opens
     it  its serrated edge glistens like a chrome serpent in his
     hand

     delmar backs up to take perfect aim at the back of hals head

                        delmar
               the crowd is on its feet the
               league cup championship for this
               season comes down to this last
               kick  the striker sees an
               opening draws back his foot and
               fires

     as delmars leg explodes forward hal spins and drives the
     knife into delmars approaching shin bone  delmar buckles in
     pain allowing hal to reach up and snatch a pistol from the
     goons waistband

     hal fires from a prone position and catches delmar in the mid
     section which blows the large man upright soaring onto his
     back

                        hal
               the seasons over asshole

     hal struggles to his feet and removes delmars automatic weapon
     and limps away in excruciating pain


     cut to  travers

     travers turns reacting to the shot and the distant sounds of
     delmar screaming  he thinks the painful cries are emanating
     from hal

     as gabe makes his way to a thickly wooded area  he has the
     money swung over his shoulder wrapped in a garment  suddenly
     bullets blast behind

     travers

     slides down onto the level that gabe is running  finding his
     footing he fires again and bullets blast the bare tree
     branches just above gabes head  he quickly bursts to his
     feet running for all hes worth

     a round from a second burst of gun fire rips into gabes
     shoulder  he tumbles out onto


     a slope

     that leads down to the frozen lake  gabe slips on the loose
     rock and slides out of control still holding the money bag


     timber bridge

     that spans out onto the river rising at least 20 feet above
     the ice  he slams into the base of it with a thud


     ext  mountain trail  day

     jessie is running down the trail for all shes worth  she
     hears the sound of a chopper approaching  her expression
     brightens as she now runs toward the sound  what lies before
     her is a cliff edge that drops into an expansive valley

                        jessie
               frank youre beautiful

     she runs to the edge just as the chopper rises into view like
     a whirling dragon from hell  the blood drains from her face as
     she locks eyes with the man at the controlsqualen  he has an
     automatic weapon trained on her


     ext  timber bridge  day

     travers runs onto the entrance of the bridge  gabe is gone
     but his footprints indicate hes gone out onto the bridge

     travers cautiously follows the tracks to the end of the bridge
     where they stop giving the impression that gabe jumped onto
     the ice below

     he peers over the edge  the ice stretches across the river
     like glass butno snowthus no footprints

     from under the bridge

     we see travers head glance under  finding nothing he
     retreats

     camera pans and

     picks up gabe about twenty feet back wedged in an x
     configuration against the underside of the bridge

     the weight from travers knocks bits of snow and ice onto gabe
     he strains to hold himself in place

     on the bridge

     travers steps back twenty feet stops just above gabe  he
     notices that snow is scraped off the side obviously where gabe
     crawled under

                        travers
               didnt you ever play hide and
               seek when you were a kid walker
               rule 1 cover your tracks

     he aims his gun at the wooden planks below him

     gabe

     knows its coming  he releases his foot holds and swings
     holding on by just one hand  a stream of bullets rip past him
     and lodge into the ice fifteen feet below

                        travers
               make it easy on yourself  you
               stole the money now ive got to
               take you in  come out so i can
               read you your rights

     travers

     cant tell if he hit him  he steps over to the edge peers
     down and just as he does

     gabe

     reaches for a hold with his other arm swings his legs up and
     does a kick maneuver scissors his legs around travers and
     tries to pull him over the edge  travers strains with all his
     might clinging to a cross rail for dear life

     the thrust from gabes weight pulls travers loose from his
     hold causing them both to


     ext  on the ice

     crash down onto the ice a spider web of cracks jolt from the
     point of impact  gabe scrambles to his feet sees travers gun
     about ten feet away

     as he lunges for it travers tackles him  the two of them
     crash against the ice again  this timeit gives way dropping
     them both into the freezing water


     ext  under water

     dark eerie silence  rays of light come through from the clear
     ice making it nearly impossible to identify the hole

     gabe and travers struggle clawing up toward the surface
     kickingdesperate  gabe reaches for the opening but travers
     pulls him down


     ext  on the ice

     travers head comes up reaches for solid ice  gabe yanks
     himself up on travers back gasping for air  travers elbows
     him in the face

     he loses his grip and slides back under the ice


     ext  under water

     gabe reaches up with his arms but the current pulls him away


     ext  on the ice

     travers drags himself onto solid ice  breathless he lies face
     down looking


     ext  under waterthrough the ice

     gabe has his mouth pressed against a tiny air pocket gasping
     hes holding on with only two fingers just as if it were a
     vertical climb but hes not going to last much longer  we can
     see the distorted shape of travers staring back at him


     ext  on the ice

     travers retrieves his weapon


     ext  under water

     gabe loses his grip and is swept away by the slow moving
     current

     travers steps above preparing to blast him away with his
     weapon  gabe sees this just before he passes beneath a cloudy
     patch of ice that causes travers to momentarily lose sight of
     him

     gabe still drifting frantically claws at his bolt gun


     ext  on the ice

     travers moves over the cloudy patch of ice awaiting the second
     gabe will reappear

     gabes head starts to pass into view  gabe also can now see
     travers outline

     travers levels his weapon and takes aim

     gabe fires the bolt gun  there is a solid thud as the ice
     underneath travers bulges upward

     gabes head emerges through the cracked ice as the bolt buries
     itself into travers chest

     gasping for breath gabe can only manage to pull his head out
     of the deathly water as travers staggers several feet away

     gabe helplessly watches as travers weaves forward  as life
     ebbs from his body travers struggles to raise the automatic
     weapon and aims it at gabes head  the weapon wavers then at
     the final moment of truth  it descends as travers can no
     longer maintain consciousness  his weapon hangs at his side
     he spasmodically pulls the trigger  bullets rip into the ice
     at his feet and travers disappears from view as if falling
     through a trap door


     ext  under the water

     travers takes in water as the current pulls at him  he pushes
     his face up for an air pocket but there isnt one


     ext  on the ice

     gabe totally exhausted and only half out of the water stares
     down


     angle through the ice

     travers is looking up at him his gruesome distorted face
     gasping for its last breath his eyes pleading for mercy as he
     drifts into eternity


     ext  ice

     gabe exhausted slips back into the water and is just about
     totally submerged  a hand shoots into the freezing water and
     yanks him back to the surface

     hal

     pulls gabe to the surface

     gabe tries to focus on hal

                        gabe
                    coughing
               am i dead or are you alive

     hal hauls him out of the ice hold

                        hal
               both  you gotta get outta these
               clothes fast

     hal opens his boot knife and with startling swiftness
     literally slices the nearfrozen garments off his friends
     torso

                        hal

               you didnt have to

               my pleasure

     hal places his jacket over gabes exposed upper body and pulls
     off the outer shell of his foul weather gear and starts to
     frantically rub his back and legs

                        hal

     flank of the chopper  qualen tries to gouge gabes eyes out
     but gabe manages to break free and pounds him repeatedly
     against the head

     hal tries to aim his weapon but there is no clear shot


     cut to  the treasury chopper

     wright and davis swing into view  wright looks through

                        wright
               its qualen  get me down there


     cut to  the ladder

     the bolt supporting the ladder which in turn supports the
     chopper is being worked loose by the ensuing battle  with
     each of the mens movement the bolts slip further out


     cut to  treasury chopper

     the chopper drops lower and directly above gabe and qualen
     the choppers backwash makes the men appear as if they are
     battling in a hurricane


     intext  chopper

     qualen manages to force gabes neck against the choppers
     blades  gabe manages to drop low and drive home several killer
     punches that now have qualen on the verge of unconsciousness
     gabe feels a sudden snap sharp movement of the fuselage  he
     realizes he has only seconds to live  pulling himself away
     from qualen he prepares to jump

     qualen with his last remaining strength grabs his legs
     tackling him

                        qualenwe go together walker

     gabe tries to crawl towards the ladder  the bolt is
     milliseconds from snapping

     jessie frantically yelling down

                        jessie
               gabe  jump

     qualen tightens his grip on gabes legs

                        qualen
                    hissingly
               you lost

     gabe breaks a foot loose and kicks qualen square in the head

                        gabe
               you fell

     qualen slides back and tumblesinto the door opening landing
     awkwardly against the dashboard


     ext  chopper

     at the precise moment the chopper finally breaks loose

     gabe leaps catching the final rung on the ladder


     the fall  long shot

     qualens screams trail behind the helicopter as we follow the
     entire 4000 foot drop


     int  chopper

     we see qualen is flattened against the windscreen looking
     straight down as the ground furiously rushes forward


     ext  chopper

     gabe watches as the chopper falls nose first like an atomic
     bomb finally exploding into a massive fireball on the valley
     floor


     int  treasury chopper

     wright turns to the pilot

                        wright
               now thats justice  lets get
               down there


     ext  spur

     gabe turns and looks back at the wall  he struggles with his
     remaining strength to pull himself up on one rung

     gabe leans back gripping the ladder too tired to move

     just the thought of one more climb drains him

                        gabe
                    mumbling
               forget it  no way  ive had it

     before gabe can take this any farther a loop tied to the end
     of a rope falls next to him  gabe looks up  the same old
     douglas rope that he left with jessie

     on the edge  hal

     has thrown the line down jessie is by his side

                        hal
               remember keep your arms and legs
               in the vehicle at all times

     gabe puts the loop around himself and tightens it by rote
     even this action aches

     hal and jessie draw gabe up  gabe pulls some of his weight by
     using hand and foot holds but when he reaches

     the precipice edge

     hal and jessie are both winded from the effort of hauling gabe
     onto the top  gabe unties himself and collapses into jessies
     lap

                        hal
                    winded coiling rope
               jesus  you think you could have
               put a little less effort into
               that climb  i thought you were
               in shape

     jessie embraces gabe  they share the kiss of their lives

                        gabe
               the old mouth to mouth
               resuscitation routine

                        jessie
               theres a lot more where that
               came from  youre not leaving
               again

                        gabe
               and miss all of this peace and
               quiet  never right hal

                        hal

                        jessie
               then its a deal

     they kiss as the camera pulls away to reveal the magnificent
     mountain range
