     fade incredit sequenceimages wipe across the screen kinetic and abstract floating
     and dreamlike in slomo

     shades of yellow  ribbons of silver  shimmers of chrome

     headlights sweeping past flaring to white  brake lights
     flashing halating red  reflections of overhead fluorescents
     flowing like liquid along windshield glass

     sounds are dreamlike and abstract as well echoey and
     discordant bouncing off concrete walls

     car doors opening and closing  pistons firing up  brakes
     squealing  a babble of multilingual crosstalk  an ebb and
     flow of dozens of different kinds of music  rap reggae
     country middle eastern rhythms a sitar

     int  taxi dispatch  queens  day

     and we find ourselves in a busy underground garage at change
     of shift  yellow ford crown victorias are wiping screen a 
     balletic convergence of arriving and departing cars

     two cabs

     wipe screen going in opposite directions parting like curtains
     to reveal

     max rilke

     sitting alone in the midst of it all biding his time reading a
     paperback a battered old briefcase by his side

     other cabbies mostly immigrants are in boisterous groups
     swapping stories sharing cigarettes counting cash

     not max  he seems to prefer his own company

     an arriving cab squeals to a stop  the dayshift driver gets
     out tosses max the keys

                                              timecut

     and in a series of shots max prepares for his workday

     wiping the seats with paper towels and 409

     repairing a tiny tear in the upholstery with duct tape

     fitting his tlc license into the small lexan slot

     checking his lights  indicators  hazards  all fine

     as car horns blare and cabbies shout max gets behind the wheel
     closes the door

     int  cab  day

     and wham  the noise evaporates into welcome silence  max
     takes a moment to savor it

     he starts the engine  rap music blares from the radio  max
     quickly turns the volume down scans the dial to a classical
     station  a soothing mozart sonata fills the cab

     one last thing  max opens his briefcase pulls out

     a tattered postcard

     which depicts the whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine
     a dream place  limitless horizon  sailboats dotting the blue
     its tobago cays the grenadines in the caribbean

     max

     slips the postcard under the rubber bands on the visor where he
     can see it whenever he wants to  but not now  he flips the
     visor up puts the car in gear and pulls out as we

                                              cut to

     aerial shot  cabqueensboro bridge  late day

     max travels the queensboro bridge into the city  the monolithic
     skyline of manhattan rises before us magical in the light the
     soft classical music lulling our senses

     int  cab  midtown  late day

     and the harsh crappy reality of the job intrudesas we find
     max driving on madison with a young professional couple having a
     heated argument in back

                         man
               why is everything always about
               you

                         woman
               everything is not about me dont
               make me the villain here  that
               asshole was out of line and you
               goddamn well know it

                         man
               im sorry i dont see it that
               way

                         woman
               oh bullshit  he was intruding on
               my space he was demeaning me
               personally he was patronizing

                         man
               what do you want me to do punch
               him out  i have to work with him

                         woman
               well last i checked you weresleepingwith me so unless you wanna
               start fucking the guy soon id
               suggest an attitude shift

     we hold on max enduring it silently invisible as a piece of
     furniture  he doesnt exist as far as his passengers are
     concerned

     int  cab  late day

     and were back to blessed silenceand soft classical music as
     max cruises chinatown looking for his next fare

     up ahead he sees a cluster of chinese teens wearing gang
     colors  theres a scuffle going on  one kids getting pounded
     by two others while everybody else watches

     max slows wondering if he should do something  one gang
     member sipping a bottle of beer turns and sees max

                         gang member
               whats you lookin at bitch

     the kid throws the beer  max hits the accelerator as the bottle
     shatters off the rear windshield

     extint  cab  gas station  late day

     and we find max carefully cleaning beer off the car with his
     paper towels and 409  the gas pump clicks off  he hangs the
     nozzle back gets in the car

     and slams the door  all quiet again

     he flips the visor down staring at his postcard  soothed by
     all that blue  hypnotized by it  taking a mental vacation

     in this quiet moment we realize were seeing the most private
     of maxs rituals the one he doesnt share with anybody

     a sudden knock on the window pulls him out of it  he glances
     over sees an impatient businessman peering in

                         businessman
               uptown

     max nods flips the visor up hiding the postcard from view
     the man gets in triggering an inane automatic recording

                         judge judy
                   tinny
               this is judge judy  buckle up back
               there  its the law

     max pulls out of the gas station

     int  cab  west side  late day

     and we find a midwestern family piling into the cab the kids
     bickering judge judy yammering mom trying to keep some
     frazzled order dad redfaced and fuming

                         dad
               grand central
                   to his wife

               back to this goddamn city

                         mom

                         dad

               to the friggin bank  i dont care if
               your sister lives here she can rot in
               this shithole for all i care

     max pulls smoothly into traffic staying zen  once again hes
     part of the furniture alone and untouched

                                              cut to

     ext  criminal court building  magic hour

     sunset rims the tops of the buildings  dusk approaching  the
     civic center is swarming with pedestrians and traffic

     int  cab  magic hour

     max drops off a fare makes a careful notation in his trip
     sheet  he puts the car in gear and creeps forward waiting for
     a chance to merge with the flow of traffic

     but he pauses seeing a commotion in front of the criminal
     court building  minicam crews are jostling as reporters swarm
     around an emerging group of city officials

     suddenly a pretty young woman breaks free of the group and
     makes a beeline for the cab hollering into a cell phone and
     fending off stray reporters  the reporters dont really care
     theyre too intent on the other mostly male officials

     the woman annie farrell jumps in the cab and slams the door
     everything about her says serious professional from her armani
     suit to her glossy leather briefcase  her adrenalines still
     flying as she finishes her call

                         annie

     she snaps the cell phone shut lets out a long breath her head
     still spinning  she notices maxs eyes in the rearview mirror
     watching her

     vincent nods  understood  he steps into the building foyer
     scanning the rows of buzzers

     max puts the car in reverse

     ext  alley  night

     and edges the cab around the corner backing into the alley
     that flanks the apartment building

     int  cab  night

     as max brings the car to a stop he notices vincents briefcase
     lying on the back seat  a trusting soul  max smiles

                         max
               definitely not from around here

     he kills the engine  silence

     theres a noticeable lack of city clamor here just a distant
     grumble of traffic from manhattan bridge  an occasional car
     passes the mouth of the alley but thats about it

     max turns on the radio tweaks the volume just loud enough to
     hear it  a beethoven sonata  soothing

     max checks his watch  dinnertime  he turns to his battered
     briefcase on the passenger seat opens it

     its filled with carefully arranged items  napkins in the
     pockets  utensils in the pen holders  minijars of mayo and
     mustard  bread cheese and cold cuts in individual baggies  a
     15 liter plastic bottle of drinking water

     he sets about making his sandwich everything applied in
     methodical order whistling softly with the music

     sandwich is done  he pauses glancing up at the visor  he
     tilts it down peering at annies business card  wondering what
     to do  knowing hell probably never call her

     he sits a moment fighting a wave of sadness  unhappy with
     himself  with his life  his place in the world

     he raises the sandwich to take a bite

     and whamsomething big lands on the hood like a hammerblowrocking the car to its axlesa massive shower of glass rains
     down with the object  a headlight explodes  the windshield
     cracks  max bounces off the ceiling as minijars of mustard and
     mayo do a jackson pollack all over the seats

     and then abrupt stunning silence

     max takes a dazed beat not even sure what hit him  he peers
     through the windshield

     and sees a dead face staring back at himmax recoils with a
     yell scrambles from the cab heart pounding

     ext  alley  night

     and finds a corpse on the hood of the car  some fat guy in a
     bathrobe  theres shards of tempered glass everywhere haloing
     the ground around the cab

     max is stunned beyond words  he looks around hoping somebody
     else saw it  theres nobody

     he looks up to see where the body came from  a window on the
     top floor has been shattered  a single white curtain billows
     out flapping gently in the breeze

     the sound of running feet  he turns as vincent enters the alley
     and stops  beat

     max is in total shock

                         max
               he fell on my cab
                   points

                         vincent
                   pause
               you always stutter

                         max
               yeah yeah  shit man  guy fell on
               my motherfucking cab

     max points again as if vincent might have missed it the first
     time

                         max contd
               i think hes dead

                         vincent
               no shit  since he has two 45s double
               tapped through the sternum and fell
               six floors onto his head

     max stares at vincent  its finally sinking in

                         max
               you  you killed him

                         vincent
               nono ii shot him  the bullets and
               the fall killed him

     a frozen beat  everything out in the open now  max realizing
     the trouble hes in  he starts backing away glancing over his
     shoulder for an escape route

     but quick as a flash like a magic trick vincents got a
     silenced sigsauer 9mm automatic in his hand slick twotone

                         max
               im cool

     the laser sight clicks off the gun smoothly vanishes back into
     vincents coat

                         vincent

     max reluctantly pops the trunk circles to the front of the car
     vincent reaches over the hood grabs the corpse by the bathrobe
     lapels heaves the body into a sitting position

               okay try it now

     vincent leans in the window cranks the key  the engine fires
     up  a look passes between them  they pile into the cab slam
     the doors as

     max pulls out of the alley

     angle from street

     and the cab accelerates up the street disappearing around
     the corner

     a long beat

     another car appears  it cruises down the street and stops in
     front of the apartment building

     phil heller emerges from the car  tall 40s softspoken but
     looks like he could kick your ass if he had to  theres
     something endearingly hangdog about his face

     he heads into the entry foyer of the building rings a buzzer
     waits a moment  rings again  nothing

     he sighs pulls a thin strip of metal from the inner pocket of
     his overcoat jimmies the door lock

     int  apartment building hallway  6th floor  night

     heller comes down the hallway to apartment 607  he raises his
     hand and knocks loudly

     causing the door to swing in slightly  he glances down sees
     the door framesplinteredat the lock  like it was kicked in
     tensing he fades to one side his hand going to his holster at
     the back of his belt

     he listens  draws his gun  baretta 9mm standard issue
     nothing fancy  he reaches out and pushes the door all the way
     open

     int  apartment  night

     revealing a dark shambles  heller enters cautiously alert
     for the slightest movement or sound

                         heller
               ivan

     nothing but silence  except

     the curtains across the room are billowing  he crosses the
     room sweeps the curtains aside finds the floortoceiling
     plate glass window missing  a few jagged shards in the frame

     he leans out peering to the alley below  a dizzying drop  a
     halo of broken glass on the alley floorin the center of which
     is a big blank spot

                         heller contd
               fuck

     int  cab  traveling  night

     max winds his way through downtown traffic in shock sneaking
     petrified glances at vincent in back  vincents got a file from
     his briefcase studying it  the silence is thick

     max finds his hand shaking lifts it off the wheel tries to
     steady his fingers  from the back

                         vincent
               try some deep breathing

               adrenalines wearing off  you get
               shaky after  its not uncommon  deep
               breathing helps

     max starts drawing in breaths letting them out slowly

                         max

     they stop at a red light  max glances at the passenger seat
     mustard and mayo everywhere along with stray slices of lunch
     meat  he parks the gearshift and automatically goes for the
     paper towels trying to clean up

     vincents eyes appear over the top of the file folder taking
     this in  softly

                         vincent
               what are you doing

     max keeps wiping as if getting the seats clean might somehow
     put everything right again

     cab  max looks over horrified to see 

     an nypd cruiser in the lane next to themthe rooftop lights
     start revolving  max sits frozen at the wheel as the spinning
     colors do a hallucinatory dance throughout the cab

     two uniformed cops emerge from the patrol car  faceless
     imposing silhouettes

               out of a ticket

     the cops are now circling to either side of the cab pulling
     their huge headbuster flashlights

     in tight nervewracking angles

     vincent eases the briefcase onto his lap  pops the latches

     max flinches at the sound  knowing thats where the gun is

     a second flashlight beam pops on this from cop 2 on the
     passenger side  checking out vincent in the back  vincent
     blinks goodnaturedly keeps a bland smile on his face

                         vincent

     max rolls his window down  cop 1 leans down and we see his

     cop 2 plays his beam across the cracked windshield and damaged

     allnight activity  giant bulldozers are lurching and belching
     smoke huge earth movers are shuttling debris from

     here to there cranes are swinging steel beams skyward  workers
     are jackhammering hollering swearing  long showers of welding
     sparks are lighting up the night  clouds of dust are kicking
     up carried on the wind before awesome storiestall work light
     gantries  all in all a surreal setting

     long lens

     finds a heavyset man in a rumpled suit conversing with a group
     of workers  theres a lot of gesturing and handwaving
     everybody shouting to be heard

     the group disperses  the heavyset man turns walking alone
     across the construction site toward the periphery

     max and vincent  watching  vincent lowers a tiny pair of
     binoculars from his eyes  the noise here is deafening

                         vincent
               dont these people ever exercise

     the heavyset man exits the construction zone through a gated
     chain link fence emerging half a block behind the cab  the man
     vanishes behind some trucks parked back there

     and vincent shifts across to the drivers side looking back
     trying to pick up a visual again  max dips his head watching
     in the sideview mirror his heart in his throat

     and the heavyset man reappears emerging from behind the
     trucks through a row of portasan chemical toilets  he heads
     across the street to a halfcompleted building  eight stories
     of bare concrete frame with open floors possible a parking
     structure for this massive redevelopment

     the heavyset man steps onto an open steelcage construction
     elevator and hits a button  the elevator rises climbing the
     outside of the halfcompleted building

     the elevator stops on the fourth level  the heavyset man gets
     off disappearing into darkness  theres the dimmest glow of a
     worklight up there  probably a temporary office

     max flinches as he hears the latches pop on vincents briefcase
     he turns almost afraid to look  vincent has just pulled out a
     chrome 357 smith  wesson jframe revolver  the gun is almost
     absurdly small

               late

     he grabs the ignition keys shuts maxs door strolls away

     max watches in the sideview mirror as vincent vanishes into
     darkness toward the halfcompleted building

     max is left alone trapped in his own cab

     he looks around  the cab is parked at the periphery of the
     construction zone on this otherwise dark and eerily deserted
     street  some trucks nearby a skiploader some more rows of
     chemical toilets pallets of sheetrock but thats about it

     max jerks and strains against the duct tape trying to free his
     hands  he gives up breathing hard

     he glances in the sideview wondering where vincent is
     straining for a glimpse

     nothing  just darkness back there

     except the construction elevator startsdescendingvincent
     has pressed the call button

     mind racing max looks to the construction site  theres over a
     hundred guys out there all within shouting distance

                         max
               hey  hey  over here  im in the

               help  goddamn it  theres a man with
               a gun  hes gonna kill somebody

     the work continues unabated  max glances in the sideview
     again

     and sees the construction elevator nowrisingslowly
     climbing floors  vincents on his way up

     max thrashes wildly against the duct tape screaming with
     frustration  he starts headbutting the carhorn

     beeeeep  beepbeeeeeeeep  beeeeep  beepbeepbeeeeeeeeep

     he raises his head checking the construction site  life goes
     on  bulldozers keep chugging

                         max contd
               oh fuck me

     he shifts low on the seat getting his knee under the dashboard
     he slams his knee up hitting the red emergency light button
     concealed there  emergency strobes start flashing at the front
     and rear of the car lighting up the street

     and still nobody notices

                         max contd
               goddamn it im flashing like studio
               54 over here

     he throws a look to the sideview mirror sweaty and tense
     knowing hes out of time

     the sideview mirror

     pushing in slowly on maxs reflected eyes  seconds ticking
     breathlessly away

     and angle shifts in the mirror leaving maxs eyes and
     bringing the halfcompleted building into view becoming maxs
     pov of it  all the construction sounds seem to drain away
     becoming a faint background hum

     all we really hear now is maxs breathing

     and a muzzle flash lights up the fourth floor like a
     flashbulb going off throwing concrete columns into stark
     relief  a second flashthen nothing  just darkness

     max

     gazes into the sideview mirror  stunned  knowing hes just
     witnessed another murder

     he slowly becomes aware of voices  he looks up and sees

     teenagers  white kids  four of them  coming up the street
     approaching from the front of the cab shielding their eyes
     against the flashing strobes  noticing him there

                         max contd

     max pulls himself up by the steering wheel trying to get his
     butt off the seat to give the kid access  the kid gropes for
     maxs back pocket trying to get the wallet pressing the gun to
     his face the other kids swarming past him

     off after his friends

     max is gasping shaken  he cant believe what just happened
     he looks in the sideview mirror

     sideview mirror

     and sees the reflection of kid 1 sauntering off cocky as
     hell about to vanish into the night

     when a shadow detaches from the darkness and steps forward
     arm raisedboooma muzzle flash two feet long and a sound
     like a cannon  its a very large bullet coming out of a very
     small gun  the kid flops to the ground like a rag doll

     vincent moves into the light crouches next to the kid  he
     rifles the kids pockets retrieves the briefcase then rises
     and walks toward the cab disappearing from the reflection in
     the sideview mirror

     max

     is frozen in utter horror  waiting  the front passenger door
     opens  vincent gets in next to max hefts his briefcase into
     the back seat

     vincent sits for a long moment staring off not even looking at
     max  maybe ready to kill him

     vincent finally sighs raises something into view  maxs
     wallet  he tosses it in maxs lap  softly

                         vincent
               some people have no respect for other
               peoples property

     he reaches to his belt pulls something else  he twirls his
     hand fast clickclacking it open for max to see a butterfly
     knife blade gleaming and razorsharp

     vincent leans over and slices the duct tape freeing maxs
     hands  beat

                         vincent
               you mind turning it off

     max doesnt move for a moment then reaches under the dash and
     turns off the strobes

     vincents riding in back again  max is driving away from the
     construction site  through the back window we see the dead kid
     receding behind them

     vincent looks drained but max is positively shellshocked

     they turn  a female tech is examining the alley floor with a
     handheld blacklight wand picking out dark brackish swirls in
     the disgusting guttery water

                         female tech contd
               diluted with water and gunk but

     they glance up  a plainclothes cop is leaning out ivans broken
     window dangling a clear plastic baggy  he drops it  it comes
     sailing down six floors

     right into hellers grasp  he glances down at it then
     dangles it in front of muldoons face

     tight on muldoon

     revealing two spent 9mm cartridges in the bag

                         muldoon
                   turns
               okay we got a homicide  whos got

     heller and muldoon turn as two uniformed cops approach from the
     street  the first cop black middleaged has his little
     notebook out  he gestures over his shoulder

                         cop contd
               old guy across the street lives above
               the deli  says he saw a car parked
               here earlier tonight  said there were
               two men working under the hood

                   off hellers look
               it was a taxi cab

     suppressing a smile the cop tears the page from his little
     notebook hands it to heller  we hear stifled laughter in the
     alley

                         muldoon
               a yellow cab in new york  by all
               means lets put out an apb

     and the laughter grows  instead of it bothering him heller
     takes a thoughtful beat walks from the alley

     street in front of the building

     and pauses at an unmarked car staring at the small notebook
     page  muldoon comes up questioningly behind him

                         heller
               remember that thing a few years back
               that thing with the cab

                         muldoon
               what thing

                         heller
               cabbie drove around all night  three
               people got killed

                         muldoon
               oh right  the guy flipped out or
               something  killed some people then
               put a gun to his own head

                         heller
                   nods
               they found him dead in his own cab
               down by the port authority

                         muldoon
               so  it was a random thing

                         heller
               i never bought that

                         muldoon

               cabbie had no criminal record no
               history of mental illness  suddenly
               he just wigs out and pops three
               people then himself  plus the
               victims werent random solid citizens
               they were all lowlives  wiseguys
                   off muldoons look
               ive always wondered if there was
               someone else in the cab

     blowing trumpet onstage with a jazz combo

     customers are clustered at small tables or crammed into curved
     leather booths  the walls are lined with old playbills and
     framed photos of jazz greats

     at one of the booths we find vincent and max  vincents
     enjoying his whiskey sour while max is barely touching his
     vincents caught up reveling in the music

               the rest

     a frozen moment  an endless pause  max not even breathing
     just staring at vincent waiting

     a beat of regret from vincent

     and vincent jerks the gun up so fast max doesnt even see it
     happening theres just an enormous muzzle flash and a soundlike a cannondaniels head snaps back recoiling  he goes
     facefirst onto the table leaving a red mist of blood swirling
     in the air

     max is stunned beyond words or thought halfdeaf from the
     concussive blast of the jframe at such close quarters

     silence now  blood spreading slowly across the table  softly

                         vincent

               would come out and sell them stuff
               rags  bottles  whatever

               of course

     he turns to find max gone  he looks down eyes wideningso is the briefcasevincent races out into

     the hallway

     and spins around frantically trying to see where max went
     nothing but a few patients and hospital staff

     and a door marked stairs swinging shut at the end of thehallway he runs in that direction

     hospital stairwell

     vincent bursts through the door into the stairwell hearing
     running footsteps below  he peers over the railing

     and sees max three flights down  max freezes looking up
     clutching the briefcase  a moment of eye contact

                         vincent contd
               you take one more step ill kill her

                         max
               youd do her a favor

     and max keeps going vanishing from view  vincent takes off
     after him plunging down the stairs at breakneck speed

                         vincent
               ill tell her the truth

     moving with max

     careening dizzily down the steps with the briefcase hurtling
     from one landing to the next footsteps echoing on concrete

     moving with vincent

     racing down the steps like a madman yanking his sigsauer from
     under his jacket

     int  hospital laundry  night

     max comes through the stairway door racing like crazy along a
     row of huge roaring industrial washers trying to make it to the
     exit door at the far end

     and vincent bursts from the stairwell in pursuit pausing to
     whip his sigsauer up in a twohanded grip activating the laser
     sight aiming down the length of the laundry room

     just as max vanishes through the exit room at the far endvincent
               shit

     ext  hospitalfdr drive  night

     max reaches out the back of the hospital which faces fdr
     drive  beyond that the east river

     max reaches the guard rail above the highway breathing hard

     its a fifteen foot drop down to the traffic lanes  fast
     traffic raging in both directions

     max looks back sees vincent  makes his decision in a
     heartbeat  he vaults over the guard rail

     and hits the pavement hard rolling into the first lanea
     truck horn blares headlights glaring  max rolls out of the
     way an instant to spare almost crushed as the bigrig blows by
     him in a hurricane backwash of wind

     max glances up sees vincent arrive at the guard rail  max
     dashes into the next lane as cars swerve wildly to avoid him

     vincent vaults the guard rail also plummeting down into the
     traffic

     various angles

     and the two men make their way across the fdr in a
     breathless lifeanddeath game of dodgethecars darting this
     way and that playing chicken with the traffic avoiding death
     by inches vincent whipping his sigsauer up desperately trying
     to pin max with the beam losing his aim cars and trucks
     hurtling between them vincent damn near getting run over max
     making it alive to the other side and vaulting over the railing
     pressing on toward

     the east river

     max runs up exhausted  the lights of queens glitter on the
     water  he swings the briefcase back preparing to hurl it

                         vincent
               dont

     and a glowing red laser dot finds max dances up to his ear
     max looks back sees vincent in silhouette gun aimed

                         vincent contd
               redlightgreenlight max

     a heartbeat  a hesitation  and then

                         max
               bullshit

     max hurls the briefcase with all his mightvincent watches
     in horror as it spins lazily through the air and takes a plunge
     into the icy water

     vincent runs over to max just in time to see the briefcase
     bobbing under vanishing with the current

     a frozen beat  vincent doesnt even know what to say  he
     closes his eyes desperately trying to visualize

                         vincent
               shit the address what was it
               hundred east forty no forty east a

               what the fuck wasthatmax
               jazz

     vincent launches himself at max and knocks him to the ground in
     a blind fury  the gun comes up the muzzle pressed to maxs
     face the hammer being cocked a heartbeat away from

     vincent pauses breathing hard  the two men staring at each
     other  in a hoarse whisper almost proud

                         vincent
               i didnt know you had it in you

     oddly enough this revelation seems to be giving vincent an
     idea  he eases the hammer down draws the gun aside

                         vincent contd
               lets see what else you can do

     and drags max to his feet as we

                                               cut to

     int  hospital morgue  night

     muldoons at home perched on the edge of his bed rubbing the

     muldoon hangs up hauling himself off the bed as we

                                              cut to

     int  maxs cab  traveling  night

     max drives in semiconscious silence feeling vincents gaze on
     the back of his neck

                         vincent

     ext  little russia pool hall  bar  night

     a diveylooking place on the lower east side  a desolate
     setting  streets mostly deserted at this time of night

               weve both run out of options  if it
               helps take comfort in knowing you
               never had a choice

     max draws a deep breath lets it out slowly

                         max
               how long have you been a hit man

                         vincent

               blowing your head off  quit stalling
               and get out of the cab

     max hesitates opens the door gets out

     ext  street  night

     and starts slowly across the street  the two men in front of
     the pool hall tense up watching him approach

     high wide angle of street

     we see max a tiny figure crossing the street below

                         fed 1
               so now who the fuck is this

                         fed 2
               beats me

     and we hear a still camera clicking and whirring snapping a
     few shots  angle pulls back

     int  top floor of tenement  night

     to reveal federal agents clustered loosely at a row of arched
     windows watching max cross the street below  the room is
     littered with surveillance equipment and pizza boxes

     senior agent frank pedrosa stands at a pair of highpowered
     binoculars mounted on a tripod tracking max

                         pedrosa
               mark the time

     a soft knock on the door  heller and muldoon are ushered in
     pedrosa glances at them motions hang on a second keeps
     peering through the binoculars

     ext  pool hall  night

     as max hiding his terror steps up to the two men

                         man 1
               closed

                         max
               im here to see dmitri  tell him its
               vincent

     the two men trade a surprised look  suddenly cautious and
     respectful  they lead max inside

     int  top floor of tenement  night

     pedrosa watches the group go into the pool hall then turns to
     heller and muldoon for quick introductions

                         muldoon
               captain walt muldoon nypd

                         pedrosa
                   shaking hands
               federal agent frank pedrosa

                         muldoon
               thanks for letting us sit in

                         pedrosa
               long as you dont get in our way

                         heller
               something going on

                         pedrosa
               pretty quiet down there  a cab just
               pulled up aside from that

     heller trades a surprised look with muldoon  acabthey rush
     to the window see the cab in the street below  fast

                         heller
               hoods all beat to shit

     muldoons fumbling his cell phone out already dialing

                         muldoon
               whats the medallion number

     heller swivels the binoculars to the cab pulling out his
     notebook and scribbling down the number

     int  little russia pool hall  night

     as max is led into cavernous multilevel pool hall  theres
     an enormous bar scattered tables and chairs rows of pool
     tables stretching into the gloom  dangling chinahat light
     fixtures throw extreme pools of light watching a pall of cigar
     smoke and deepening the shadows

     men are grouped loosely about drinking and smoking playing
     pool  hardeyed flinty killers  a few tired usedup women
     keeping them company

     everybody goes silent staring at max

     one of the men with max pats him down checking for weapons
     the other one goes upstairs

     max just stands there not knowing what to do  suddenly a
     trail of cigar ash trickles down from above along with a deep
     voice with a russian accent

                         dmitri
               i thought youd be taller

     max turns looks up to see

     dmitri gusunov a russian gangster built like a beer truck
     hes unshaven sweaty looks like he was rolled in grease  an
     evil dangerous fucker

                         dmitri contd
               perhaps its my perspective  things
               change when you look at them from a
               different point of view dont you
               think

     he descends the stairs slow and deliberate inspiring dread
     with every step  he comes to a stop before max

                         dmitri contd
               no  it seems some things stay the
               same from every angle  like you
               here  tonight  any way i look at it
               i see only one thing  i see only
               trouble

     dmitri pulls up a chair sits at a table  gestures

                         dmitri contd
               sit

     max sits forces himself to meet dmitris gaze  a bottle of
     vodka is brought along with two shot glasses

                         dmitri contd
               so  vincent  why are you here  i
               cannot wait

     int  top floor of tenement  night

                         dmitris voice filtered
               to find out why you would risk your
               life like this

     the reaction in the room is electric  fed 3 on headphones
     turns from the reeltoreel recorder with a stunned look

               you understand my surprise yes  long
               time now weve had an arrangement

     int  pool hall  night

                         dmitri
               i do not meet you  i do not see
               you  i do not even speak to you
               that made good sense  but now you are
               here and i must ask why

     for a moment it looks like max isnt even going to get the words
     out  then

                         max
               i lost the list

     pause  dmitri raises his vodka knocks it back lays the shot
     glass down

                         dmitri
               i see
                   beat
               that was an important list wouldnt
               you say  the people on that list are
               being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal
               judge  and you lost it

                         max
               im sorry

                         dmitri
               sorry

     dmitri abruptly pulls a scuffed browning hipower 9mm handgun
     from the back of his belt slams it down on the table before
     him  he leans forward hand resting lightly near the grip

     max is nearly pissing himself  dmitris gesture is too
     reminiscent of vincent preparing to kill daniel

                         dmitri contd
               tell me vincent  do you believe in
               santa claus

                         max
                   finds his voice
               cant say that i do

                         dmitri
               neither do i  but my children theyre
               still young  do you know who they
               like even more than jolly old saint
               nicholas  his helper black peter
               an old russian fairy tale tells of how
               santa got so busy looking after all
               the good kids he had to hire a helper
               to punish all the bad kids  that was
               black peters job  he was given the
               list of all the bad children and he
               would visit them in their homes late
               at night  and if he caught them not
               saying their prayers he would leave a
               bundle of wooden switches outside
               their door  that was a warning  if
               they continued to misbehave he would
               swoop down and take the children away
               and they would never be seen again

     dmitri picks up his gun and racks the slide loudly jacking a
     round into the chamber

                         dmitri contd
               now if im santa claus then you are
               black peter  and what do you think
               would happen if peter showed up in
               santas pool hall one night and said
               hed lost his list of all the bad
               children  how fucking furious do you
               think jolly old saint nick would be

     he brings the gun up pressing the barrel solidly to maxs
     forehead

                         dmitri contd
               tell me vincent  tell me what you

     dmitri tosses a look to arkady behind the bar  arkady turns to
     a hidden wall safe dials the combination  as they wait in
     silence dmitri pours vodka for himself and max

     room  his eye on the prize  his sigsauer in his hand
     watching nikolyais table  waiting for his chance

     nikolyai scurries from one table to the next taking cover
     trying to get the hell out

     controlling his breathing blocking out all distraction

     nikolyai breaks from cover again darting wildly as we track
     him dropping from view behind another table

     and we pan down the table to a pair of loud checked socks and
     wingtip shoes visible just below the table cloth where nikolyai
     crouches ready to make his break for the door

     eases his finger onto the trigger

               thank you for bro  and i never saw
               it that way

     the cab goes blasting through an intersection on a red light  a
     los angeles times delivery truck slams on its brakes as max
     swerves barely avoiding a collision

                         vincent
               that was a red light

     max glances in the rearview

                         max
               til now

     vincent pulls his sigsauer and snaps off the safety aiming at
     maxs head  max almost laughs

                         vincent
               slow the hell down

                         max

               trigger  kill us  go ahead manshootmy ass

                         vincent
               slow down

                         max
               vincent

     their eyes meet in the rearview mirror  vincent is stunned by a
     look in max that has never been there before  its the look of
     a man with nothing to lose

                         max contd
               go fuck yourself

     max slams on the brakes and cranks the steering wheel hard

     ext  street  night

     sending the cab slewing through an intersection a few other
     cars veering wildly to avoid him

     as the cab goes into a violent roll flipping down the
     street smashing itself to pieces on the blacktop shedding
     parts spewing glass rolling at least a dozen times

     and then settling upsidedown car revolving slowly to a
     creaking stop antifreeze drizzling across the pavement

     and then everything goes silent motionless still

     pushing in

     on the wreckage  steam billowing from the ruptured radiator
     crumpled metal  missing hood  disintegrated windshield

     and we find max trapped upsidedown in his seatbelt harness
     one side of his face streaked with blood  alive but dazed

     he hears movement in the back  moans  sharp intake of breath
     then a voice

                         vincent
               well  that was brilliant

                         max
               was your seatbelt fastened honey

     max lets out a dry laugh starts painfully trying to unclasp his
     seatbelt

     and a bloody hand shoots from the darkness behind himwhipping a gleaming butterfly knife right at his facemax jerks
     his head aside and the knife misses him by inches ramming
     solidly into the headrest instead

     max throws the buckle on his seatbelt dropping and hitting the
     ceiling of the cab suddenly in a violent struggle for survival
     as vincent lunges forward a dark avenging shape from the back
     seat trying to slice maxs throat max fighting wildly back
     trying to keep the knife at bay

     and we hear a police siren swelling  vincent pauses eyes
     glittering like an animal sniffing the air for danger

     and hesgonevanishing like a shadow  max looks out the
     window

     maxs pov

     and catches a glimpse of vincents ankles running off into
     the nightthe jframe is lying on the pavement ten or fifteenyards away where it skidded in the crashvincent scoops it up
     on the run shoes crunching on broken safety glass as he
     vanishes into darkness  the siren grows louder

     max crawls from the wreckage emerging on the drivers side
     pushes painfully to his feet  looks around

     a surreal moment  max standing by his overturned cab the empty
     city all around him breathing the cool night airaliveit strikes him in that moment  hes survived the night  the
     blood pumping through his veins is afactundeniable
     intractable blissful  it stuns him  overwhelms him

     a sound escapes his throat starting as a laugh building toward
     a scream  whatever it is itsreleaseblessed release and he
     howls it at the rooftops because the goddamn sirens are coming
     theyre almost here and how good islifean nypd cruiser screeches to a stop  two uniformed cops a
     black driver and his hispanic partner  the hispanic cop grabs
     the mike off the dash muttering an urgent call

                         cop 2
               code 85 request ambulance east 39th
               between fifth and madison

     while cop 1 jumps out stunned at all the wreckage

                         cop 1
               holy shit you okay

     and the mundane beauty of the question makes max laugh even
     harder though hardly any sound is coming out now its more
     like a hitching sob and there are tears streaming down his
     face  cop 1 approaches max gentle but firm

                         cop 1 contd
               okay my man just relax  youve been
               in an accident and youre in shock
               helps on the way  you understand
               what im saying
                   max nods
               anybody else in the cab

     max shakes his head  the cop pulls his flashlight briefly
     checks the passenger compartment to make sure returns his
     attention to max  meanwhile cop 2 emerges from the cruiser
     circling around to inspect the wreckage

                         cop 1 contd
               you dizzy  you want to sit down

                         max
                   finds his voice
               imfine  fine

                         cop 1
               you sure  you look pretty shaky

     cop 2 now at the rear of the cab suddenly freezes his
     flashlight beam finding

                         cop 2
               oh christ  a body in the trunk
               hes been shot

     a heartbeat  cop 1 stiffening hand dropping to his holster
     max glancing back the trunk hanging open from the crash the
     corpse of ivan petrov in a sprawled heap

     cop 1 steps back drawing his handgun shouting

                         cop 1freezehands where i can see em
               on your knees  slowly

     max does as hes told hands in the air getting to his knees on
     the pavement and the whole thing strikes him as so insane so
     fucking silly that he cant help laughing again

                         max
               arrest me take me in please

     and hes on his knees cop 1 coming up behind him cop 2
     hanging back and leveling his pistol covering his partner

     push in on max slomo

     kneeling  one arm being brought down and wrenched behind his
     back handcuffs flashing as they descend

     maxs pov

     pushing slowly across the pavement  debris from the wreckage
     granules of shattered safety glass  vincents scattered files
     a black and white photograph of a familiar face  nikolyai the
     guy with the bad suit and checked socks now deceased

               it or ill shoot

     but max just jams the gun tighter to his hostages throat  for
     some insane reason hes feeling clear almost steady

     cop 2 pulls his cuffs puts his arm through the window frame of
     the open squad car door cuffs himself to his partner  they
     toss their cuff keys  trapped

     a tense silence  max hefts the cops gun in his left hand
     almost embarrassed by it  he tosses it bends down to the cab
     pulls annies card off the visor starts backing away from the
     cops

     into the darkness

     stripped of everything now  operating purely on instinct
     vincents gun in his right hand handcuff dangling from his left
     wrist

     running

     lungs starting to burn  the city silent around him  the only
     sound his ragged breathing his feet hitting the pavement

     running

     two cop cars rocketing through the intersection a block or so
     behind him sirens wailing  max veering for cover not breaking
     stride pressing on

     sirens swelling all over the city now police units responding
     max spinning around trying to pin the sound what direction to
     go knowing he was only blocks away when the cab flipped

     cutting onto park avenue racing up the middle of the street
     toward the met life building ducking some predawn traffic

     seeing a man ahead striding along muttering into a cell phone
     max grabbing the phone right out of his hand as he sails past
     him the man spinning around to come after him

     breath catch in her throat  eyes wide

     vincent stands there for what seems an eternity

     taut with both hands

     vincent straining  annie on her hands and knees strangling
     mouth opening and closing for air that isnt there not even a
     breath fingers prying in vain at the phone cord wrapped around
     her throat

     dying  shes dying  and she knows it

     vincent

     teeth bared  sweat breaking out on his forehead from the
     sustained effort  moments away from finishing the job

     when a tiny glowing red dot suddenly appears travels up his
     arm settling on the spot just behind his ear

     vincent slowly turns

     a silhouette in the doorway  aiming a gun  for a moment
     vincent cant quite bring himself to believe

                         vincent
               max

                         max
               let her go

     vincent laughs once harsh like a dogs bark

                         vincent
               what are you gonna do shoot mblama muzzle flash  its like vincent just got kicked in the
     head  he grows sprawling

     max rushes to annie  shes pulling the cord from around her
     throat gasping in great lungfuls of ragged breath

                         max
               are you all r

     they hear a groan  max goes stiff pulls her to her feet  both
     of them backing away maneuvering toward the door max with the
     sigsauer poised

     vincent

     sits up eyes glittering hand clasped to the side of his head
     blood coursing through his fingers

                         vincent
               jesus max  you shot my fuckin ear
               off

     he pulls his hand away and laughs in amazement staring at the
     sheet of blood on his palm  he looks to max

                         vincent contd
               good one

     max keeps the sigsauer aimed pulls annie out into the
     corridor  she slams the glass door moving quick locking it
     from the outside  vincent gives them a tight smile

     and his hand thrusts downyanking his jframe from an ankle
     holster arm coming up stiff and straight max and annie
     running vincent tracking them as he rapidfires 

     corridor

      andboom  boom  boom  boom  boomcome the gunshots
     punching a ragged line of fractures in the glass max and annie
     barely one step ahead the bullets

     and then theyre gone cutting around the corner toward the
     elevators

     and a moment later the glass wall explodes into the corridorvincent crashing throughlanding in painful sprawl pushing
     to his feet

     in the elevator

     max hits the ground floor button the doors taking about a
     million years to close  just as theyre sliding shut he sees
     vincent running up the corridor slapping fresh bullets into the
     jframe with a speedloader raising the gun

     max throws himself on annie both to the floor as bullets punch
     through the doors  but the elevators moving now

     7th floor hallway

     leaving vincent behind  he pounds on the doors screaming

                         vincent contd
               goddamn max good for you  youfuckhe darts down the hallway for the stairs

     in the elevator

     max and annie on the floor breathing hard staring at each
     other in wordless shock  they reach the ground floor

     building lobby

     and max drags her to her feet as the doors open the two of
     them racing across the open lobby for the exit

     building stairwell

     vincent careens down the steps the entire side of his head
     bloody his ear mostly gone  he slams through a door into 

     the lobby

      where he finds the elevator standing empty  he turns sees
     the shattered lobby door runs out of the building 

     outside the building

      and pauses hearing footsteps running on concrete  he
     catches a glimpse of max and annie running across east 42nd
     street toward grand central  he takes off after them

     max and annie

     make it across the street rushing into

     int  grand central station  night

     the magnificent rotunda quiet as a cathedral  max and annie
     race in footsteps echoing in the silence

     hardly a soul in sight except for an old black flower vendor
     setting up his cart for the morning rush  max and annie keep
     running knowing vincents not far behind max yelling

                         max
               call the police

     the old man stares at them like theyre nuts  they run across
     the rotunda toward the boarding ramps  suddenly vincent comes
     through the same entrance they did raising his jframebooooomthe jframes never been louder echoing like a cannon
     in the rotunda  the old man throws himself behind his cart as booooom  booooom  booooom  booooomvincent fires four more
     shots as annie and max disappears down the boarding ramp bullets
     chewing huge holes in the wall at their backs

     vincent goes after them reloading on the run footsteps
     ringing across the marble

     int  boarding ramps  night

     neonlit and eerie tubes flickering overhead

     max and annie run turning this way and that trying to decide
     which way to go

     the sound of a train grows disembodied drawing nearer and
     nearer wheels shrieking on steel until itsdeafening

     int  subway tunnel  night

     and the train pulls in headlight glaring  max and annie run
     into the tunnel down the platform ducking into

     the third subway car

     where they collapse catching their breath waiting for the
     doors to close and the train to pull out

     and waiting

     the train sits there for only seconds but it seems like hours
     like fuckingforevertheyre riveted to the ramp entrance
     praying vincent doesnt appear hoping theyve lost him

     the doors start to close sliding irrevocably shut

     and vincent sails into the tunnelgoing for the first car
     slamming his hand into the closing doors  the train starts to
     move vincent running alongside trying to force them open
     train picking up speed

     third subway car

     max and annie are at the sliding door which adjoins the cars
     peering through the window into the car ahead not sure if
     vincent made it or not  then down at the far end










       note  pages 106  107  the subway chase scene 
        are missing from the script









     vincent turns his head slightly watching max draw cautiously
     nearer  max stares down seeing the blood spreading across the
     floor beneath vincent  turning into quite a pool

     vincent tries to speak cant quite manage  max sits next to
     him  annie appears bg from the last car watching them

     vincent and max

     just sit there riding the train  softly

                         max
               were almost at the next station

     vincent smiles faintly  he leans his head toward max as if
     conferring a secret  in a halting whisper

                         vincent
               guy  gets on a subway  dies
                   off maxs look
               think anybodyll notice

     vincent leans back gazing straight ahead now  rocking gently
     with the motion of the train

     and suddenly much to maxs amazementvincent starts tolaughit comes out as a soft rasping wheeze but its laughter
     all the same

     max just stares at him  he has no idea whats so funny but
     vincents exhibiting a lot of mirth for a dying man  vincent
     raises his hand points  look

     max follows his gaze  there right across the car among all
     the advertisements lining the wall near the ceiling is

     an ad

     the whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine  a dream place
     limitless horizon  sailboats dotting the blue  a cheerful
     blurb advises us tovisit the beautiful caribbeanmax

     gazes at the ad  it dawns on him that vincents no longer
     laughing  in fact vincents no longer doing anything  ever

     annie comes to max and sits  takes his hand  they ride the
     train together side by side both staring up at the ad
     hypnotized by all that blue neither saying a word  for now

     the wheels shriek as the train pulls in to a station

     wide angle of subway car

     and max pulls annie to her feet  the doors open  they
     silently get off

     the doors close again  the train pulls out

     we hold on vincent for a while  riding the train by himself
     head back as if sleeping

     just another dead guy on the subway

                                              fade out
