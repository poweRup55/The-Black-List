               ext  back alley  night present

               dumpsters overflow with the days garbage a pillar of steam 
               rises from an underground grate its the dark place between 
               buildings that a reasonable person avoids

               we see jake vig a guy in his late 20s whose fashionable 
               suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the 
               surroundings  at first glance youd think he could run 
               for congress some day at first glance

               jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees execution style 
               his face gives away nothing  he could be kneeling in a 
               strawberry field

                                     jake vo
                         and i think its because of this 
                         redhead

                                     butch os

                         no im not the antichrist or the 
                         prince of darkness im just a guy 
                         looking for some answers

               theres the loud unmistakable click of a gun being cocked 
               the barrel of a gun slides gently along jakes ear and comes 
               to rest at the base of his skull

               the voice and the gun belong to butch 40s with his suit 
               and conservative looks youd make him out for a steve or 
               roger more than a butch

                                     butch

               the same alley the door of a building bursts open as lionel 
               dolby late 40s dressed in a cheap suit stumbles out 
               breathing heavy the dim light of a bare bulb glares off the 
               sweat on his forehead

               a moment later jake emerges from the same door carrying a 
               large black revolver

                                     jake

                         happens sometimes

               in the distance a police siren wails growing louder

               jake takes a tentative step forward lionel sees a blood 
               stain on jakes shirt and recoils

               the siren grows louder jake turning his head towards it

                                     lionel

               int  the euclid bar

               a dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar

               a single overweight patron sits at a corner table with face 
               buried in his hands as he whimpers jake and lionel dolby 
               pass him as they emerge from a back hallway

               miles late 20s wipes blood off the bar placed at the 
               edge of the bar are two briefcases both open both filled 
               with neat stacks of blood splattered money

               a dead guy lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood

               jake grabs the dead guys legs as lionel watches in disbelief

                                     jake
                         come on grab his arms

               lionel stands frozen jake drops the dead guys legs with a 
               thud

                         me do it help me grab his arms

               the police sirens grow louder

                                     miles
                         ticktock

               miles lets out a little chuckle its just enough to set 
               jake off again

               jake pulls the gun and points it at miles

                                     miles
                         oh please

               miles nonchalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under 
               the bar

                                     miles

               the police sirens sound like theyre right outside

                                     lionel

               jake cocks his gun never taking his stare off miles

                                     jake
                         then go

               lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money

                                     lionel
                         what about the money

                         think i can answer that question 
                         right now

               lionel again looks at the briefcases then the shotgun leveled 
               at jake then at the direction of the police sirens he 
               runs for the door without a second thought

                                                                    cut to

               ext  the euclidcity sidewalk  night

               lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar to 
               streetlevel just as a police car screeches to a halt in 
               front of the bar lights flashing siren wailing on the 
               door is the emblem for the new york police department

               lionel does his best to look casual as two uniformed officers 
               jump out of the car and rush the euclid one of the officers 
               catches lionel looking over his shoulder

               the last thing lionel hears before he turns a corner 

                                     officer os
                         everybody freeze

               as soon as hes turned the corner lionel breaks into a full 
               sprint down the street

                                                                    cut to

               int  the euclid

               officer walter sobozinski a middle aged cop with a couple 
               of spare tires stands by the front door with his gun drawn 
               in a dramatic stance

                                     sobozinski

                         cocksucking scumbags

               the second middle aged cop officer richard rottovich comes 
               calmly down the stairs behind sobozinski

                                     rottovich
                         were clear

               rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him

               the king begins to gently trace between jakes fingers with 
               the nail file

               jake remains rigid against lupus and harlin as the nail file 
               scrapes along the soft fleshy webbing between his fingers

               jake shuts his eyes then opens them to find the king now 
               gently stroking his hands  almost a loving caress

                         well typically corporate loans are 
                         relatively simple matters but you 
                         do need to demonstrate a capacity 
                         for gross fund recovery

               lily arches an eyebrow at ashby

                         right the guys who started that did 
                         what a lot of companies in the valley 
                         do they get a good idea shop it 
                         around raise some capital then 
                         sell it off to a bigger company 
                         microsoft intel oracle whatever 
                         the beauty of it is theyve pretty 
                         much sold the company before theyre 
                         even real the bigger company is 
                         already set to buy it all they want 
                         to do is make sure that the idea 
                         actually works so they get some 
                         start up capital make it work then 
                         sell it for like five times the 
                         initial loan

                         exactly but the catch22 is that 
                         you cant tell anyone about the offer 
                         because if its public you could 
                         start a bidding war and thats 
                         considered a breach of etiquette it 
                         could kill a deal but wait too 
                         long and youre not considered hot

               lily takes a swing harlin easily grabs the bat and backhands 
               lily she goes flying back into the far wall bounces off 
               and lands with a thud at harlins feet where she finds the 
               butter knife

               harlin reaches down and pulls lily up by the hair the egg 
               sizzles in the pan

               lily takes a stab at harlin but the knife just bounces off 
               his coat harlin slaps lily again sending her flying into 
               the stove smoke starts to rise from the burning egg

               harlin steps closer but lily throws her hands up in 
               surrender

               a spoon rattles in a cup as the rumble of a subway train

                         no problem

               she grabs the smoking pan from the stove and whacks harlin 
               across the head the burned egg lands on the floor

               lily watches as he sways and teeters on his feet like a 
               drunk she raises the pan again but before she delivers 
               the final blow harlin steps on the egg causing his leg to 
               shoot out from under him he lands flat on his back out 
               cold the wood floor creaks with his weight

               lily wipes the blood from her nose and turns the hot plate
