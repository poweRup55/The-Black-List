        another angle

        jerry stops at a light  a road crew are at work ahead
        a white strobe light warns motorists that theyre here

                                cynic
                  she feel the same about you

        jerry cant take his eyes off the stroke  as he blinks

                                jerry
                  i dont know

                                                   flash cut to


        subjective pov

        looking down as a mans arms are strapped to the arm of a
        chair  the pov jerking up as the same is done with the
        head  a kaleidoscope of flashing lights ahead then
        darkness as eyes are shut  theyre forced open  we see
        the reflection of blue eyes in glass as theyre taped
        open  as bright lights strobe


        back to taxi

        jerry stares at the light transfixed

                                jerry
                  i never told her

                                cynic
                  why the hell not

                                jerry
                  i uh i have some problems

        the traffic light glows green jerry doesnt see it  the
        sound of conspiratorial whispers fill the taxi

                                                   flash cut to


        subjective pov

        the contents of a syringe pumped into the strapped arm
        the walls begin to melt  the whispers continue
        garbled but their tone is perfectly clear  threatening
        cabalistic  human forms appear  stretched impossibly
        long melting along with the walls

        we close on the reflection of a dozen pair of the same
        tapedopen eyes  the whispering cuts short  ominously
        the eyes dart from sidetoside as footsteps approach
        the eyes suddenly widen in agony  as jerrys scream of
        pain becomes the blare of a horn we find ourselves back
        in the


        taxi

        going about 60 mph  jerry snaps to just in time to avoid
        a headon collision with a car coming the other way

                                cynic
                  are you crazy

                                jerry
                  the guy came right at us

                                cynic
                  you turned up a one way street

        jerry watches in a sweat as he passes a one way sign
        pointing the opposite way  he mutters to himself

                                jerry
                  i was only going one way

                                cynic
                  drop me off here

                                jerry
                  look im sorry 

                                cynic
                  just drop me off


        another angle

        jerry pulls to the curb  the meter at 360  the cynic
        slides a twenty through the slot and is out the door
        jerry watches over his shoulder as the cynic disappears
        down the street  jerry rubs his eyes tries to regroup

                                jerry

        ext fifth avenue manhattan  night

        welldressed man steps off the curb flags jerry down


        cab

        jerry slows stops  as the welldressed man starts over
        jerry sizes him up  the man seems suddenly sinister

        as he reaches for the door locks click down  jerry guns
        the cab away  the confused man stumbles back shouts
        apparently not a threat at all


        ext apartment building uptown  night

        headlights out the cab pulls up to the curb


        int cab  night

        jerry glances at a lit 2nd floor apartment window then
        settles in with a bologna sandwich  about to take a
        bite he pauses removes a slice of bologna  he regards
        it a beat then carefully peels off the edge  jerry
        holds the narrow casing up against the glow of a
        streetlight like it was encoded  then something catches
        his eye  he trades the sandwich for binoculars focuses
        on the window


        binocular pov  window

        liza sutton  in a yale sweatshirt stretching earphones
        on  she forces her head past her kneecap and holds it
        there  driven is the word to describe liza  when she
        sleeps she tries to do it better than anyone else does
        we cant hear her but as she finishes stretching she
        sings along with the music on her headset


        jerry

        captivated he sighs  the sound of love  then he gets
        an idea  still watching he fumbles for the radio
        turning it on he scans radio stations


        binocular pov  liza

        her lips dont match anything  counting crows  david
        bowie  the traffic report  a rap tune


        jerry

        elusive number  he finds annie lennox singing blue

                  blue moon you saw me standing
                  alone

        intercut between them  without a song in my heart
        without a love of my own  blue moon  in a weird way
        its a duet  a sweet moment  then liza stops

        she gets on a treadmill and cranks it up  walking a few
        moments before shes jogging before shes running  no
        easy pace here  liza gets grim cranks up the speed and
        goes hard  shes punishing herself


        jerry

        his voice trails off as he watches  sad he lowers the
        binoculars doesnt want to watch her do this  throwing
        the car in gear he takes a last look and drives away

        jill keeps a protective eye from the outer office

        at a framed photo on a credenza

        liza 20 in full riding gear gracefully jumping a horse
        over a set of rails

        picture he pulls out a map unfolds it on lizas desk
        a seismic survey map  he points as he talks

        liza sighs  on another day jerry might have been

        jerry smiles looks away embarrassed in an appealingly
        boyish way  if he wasnt crazy the answer might be yes

        approaching from the hall


        close on jerry

        without warning one of the figures grabs jerrys head
        from behind straps it to a slat he attaches to the back
        of the chair

        jerry struggles but his head is immobilized  the second
        man goes about taping jerrys eyes open

        waits  a new set of footsteps in the hall  jerrys eyes
        follow someone into the room and across from him  jerry
        frowns

        jonas

        standing opposite jerry  genteel looking professorial
        theres something calm oddly soothing about him

                                jonas
                  have you ever been in a place from
                  which hope has gone  all thats
                  left is patience  everywhere
                  like a fog

                  could you be a little more
                  specific

        jonas doesnt answer  instead he methodically loads a
        syringe  jerry watches with grave apprehension

                                jerry
                  whats that

                                jonas

                  a little kicker of my own  surely
                  it must be coming back to you by
                  now

        theres nowhere to go but jerry still tries to go there
        as the needle descends  and then the plunge

                                jerry
                  what do i know

        jonas switches on a row of strobe lights  they flash
        into jerrys face  in between them on a screen images

        brain stimulation  reagan catching it under the armpit
        a slaughterhouse  and interspersed between it all a
        rather officiallooking photo of a middleaged man well
        call mr s  then 


        jonas

        is dancing back and forth before jerry  the strobes
        freeze him like some club from the 70s

        but jonas isnt really dancing  hes directly across
        from jerry  profiletoprofile

                                jonas
                  who else knows what you know

        slackjawed jerry doesnt answer  jonas holds an
        electrode to jerrys leg touches a second to his side
        jerry arches back as current flows


        jerrys pov

        as the ceiling melts and drops in heavy globs around

        jonas cuts the flow

                  who else knows what you know

        jerrys only answers are the tears running down his
        cheeks  jonas hits him again

        jerry jerks back so hard the chair snaps right off the
        floor and topples over backwards  jerrys left wrist and
        right leg burst through the straps which were holding
        them down  a wisp of smoke rises

        jonas sighs  he looks down at jerry who moans
        whispers

                                jerry
                  ill tell you

        jonas smiles paternally steps over  jerrys mouth
        moves but we cant hear him  mr s flashes on the
        screen

                                jonas

        as jonas leans in his nose looks enormous

        grabbing jonas shirt with his limited left hand jerry
        uses the only weapon hes got  he bites jonas on the
        nose  blood pulses as jerrys teeth find an artery
        howling jonas tries to scramble out of reach

        jerry kicks him in the stomach with his free leg and then
        keeps kicking  its inarticulate roughshod work but he
        connects and jonas feels it and each new kick as a
        little more fury than the last

        finally jonas rolls away  jerry halfcrawls halfrocks
        his way to a crouched position  rising he staggers into
        the window the top of the chair smashing through the
        glass  jerry stares down to the ground below

        as the earth rises and falls like a wave  the distance
        down is impossible to gauge

        as jonas staggers to his feet piper and clark charge in
        they move forward but without warning jerry gathers
        what balance he has and heaves himself out the window

        partially obscured by trees jerry does a halfgainer
        from exactly two stories above the ground  the chair
        back takes the brunt of the landing  wood splinters

        blood spurts between jonas fingers  clark and piper
        draw their guns and rush to the window

        away jerry dashes grabs hold of a handle on the rear


        ext street two  some blocks away  day

        we see the truck approach  as it turns right the 
        centrifugal force flings jerry off the back and into the
        oncoming lane  several taxis slam on their brakes to
        keep from running him over

        all jerry sees is yellow

        flutter

                                jerry
                  switch em

        a long sigh and jerrys out  liza starts out then
        stops laughs at herself as she realizes what she needs
        to do  stepping over she switches the chart at the foot
        of jerrys bed with that of his unconscious roommate

        motions her forward so he can whisper  she leans in

        at that moment  a gunshot

        wine in one hand a popped cork in the other  the
        source of the sound  jerry looks back to liza

        jerry doesnt answer as he locks the door picks the
        empty beer bottle up off the floor

                  i keep the beans in the fridge
                  they stay fresher that way

        as jerry removes one of the stainless steel containers
        liza reads some of his magnetic poetry off the door

                                liza
                  must language produce a thousand

                  i love the delicate shadow of she
                  wanting me to be

        liza smiles at jerry who looks up sheepishly from the
        container  hes having trouble with the lock

                                jerry
                  forgot the combination you want

        jerry enters with liza  the photo of lennon gives her
        pause  she looks at the surrounding files then watches
        as jerry turns the mimeograph drum starts printing
        something

                                jerry
                  if my universe had a hub

                                liza
                  this would be it

        jerry nods  liza steps to the drafting table where jerry
        has done several rough but competent sketches of horses
        in motion  theres a book open to a photo of a horse and
        rider jumping a rail  liza closes it reads

                                liza

        jerry nods embarrassed  as he staples some papers
        together liza stops short  in the margin of one of the
        drawings are two small profile sketches of her  eyes
        closed it looks like shes sleeping

                  stone is their spokesman  you
                  think if someone really had all
                  that information and a national
                  podium to shout it out from that
                  theyd let him do it  stones a

                                liza
                  can you prove any of this

                                jerry
                  absolutely not  a good conspiracy

                  you can figure it out they

        a brief look between them before jerry hits a switch
        which kills the lights then pulls her down alongside
        him

                                liza
                  it probably fell by itself

        painted montage  one image dominates  in fact its
        arresting

        bliss  liza in full equestrian fear hands outstretched
        head thrown back  astride a winged horse  it soars over
        a gate and up into the heavens

        moments pass before we hear her front door open and then
        close as jerry leaves  lizas eyes flicker over to the

        a drizzle has started to fall  for a street lined with
        parked cars it has a rather desolate feel  theres a
        certain car  a crown victoria  a silhouette behind the
        wheel  lizas apartment is being watched


        crown victoria

        its agent lowry  and in the back seat agent murphy
        they sit in silence a relaxed practiced state of alert
        murphy frowns at the raindrops which splat the rear
        window

                                murphy
                  im gonna take a piss in the alley
                  before it starts to pour

        lowry nods keeps his eyes on the entrance to the
        apartment  murphy opens the door  as he climbs out of
        the back seat we see a black 9mm in a shoulder harness

        a few moments pass  agent lowry leans forward to look up
        to the dark window of lizas apartment  behind him he
        hearts the back door open agent murphy slide in the back
        seat  as lowry leans back

                                lowry
                  hows your bladder

        the barrel of murphys black 9mm is pressed squarely
        against the side of lowrys head

        its jerry in the back seat  but lowrys a pretty cool
        customer  he regards jerry evenly in the rearview

                                lowry
                  lot of folks are looking for you

        lowrys hand inches toward a 45 on the front seat

                                jerry
                  then you must be the smart one
                  hands on the steering wheel

        a little nudge of the 9mm and lowry does as hes told

                                jerry

                  might show up

                                lowry
                  it seemed like a possibility
                  what about your intentions  are
                  they honorable

                                jerry

                  hurt liza in any way ill kill
                  you  does that seem honorable

                                lowry
                  well i dont know if 

        jerry creases the back of his head with the gun barrel
        as lowry slumps unconscious jerry starts out then
        pauses

                                jerry
                  are you pretending

        it sure doesnt seem so  till jerry cocks back the

                                jerry

        jerry pulls lowry over to the passengers seat then
        climbs into the drivers seat  he starts the car then
        rolls out after her

        at his feet  he stops slowly looks up as he hears the
        helicopter

        black no running lights equipped with a sound damper
        it descends quickly over the intersection  silky black
        cords drop  traffic snarls as cleet commandos slide
        down

        four of them  plainclothed with discreet comheadsets
        wearing jackets we catch glimpses of the equipment slung
        on their hips including machine pistols  each has a 2x3
        piece of paper taped to his wrist  like nfl quarterbacks
        with the plays except the papers are photos of jerry

        the helicopter is gone so fast some people havent even
        noticed  the commandos disperse into the crowd refer to
        their wrists as they advance in jerrys direction

        jerry hightails it the opposite way tries not to
        attract attention  he pulls up in front of a movie
        theater as a second chopper swoops in to drop four more
        commandos at the south intersection  the street has been
        sealed off

        jerry stands there a beat not sure what to do
        something makes him look across the street where cleet 1
        pulls up looks over at him  as cleet 1 refers to his
        wrist photo jerry dashes into the theater

        nervously looking back over his shoulder watching the
        aisle

        four cleets appear silhouetted at the entrance  as they
        start down checking faces

        as the manager drones people head for the aisles  jerry
        moves for the emergency exit  sticking out like a sore
        thumb as the emergency door opens and a shadowy figure
        steps inside the alcove  a cleet commando

        he spots jerry starts forward

        theres a cleet in the alley  checking faces  not
        looking jerrys way yet  jerry keeps close behind
        another patron then darts out swings the cleet face
        first into the wall

        as the cleet draws his machinepistol jerry slams his
        face once twice into the wall  as the cleet drops
        jerry makes eye contact with a woman who watches aghast

                                jerry

        into a commuter then another  jerrys lost in the
        crowd

        the subway is about to leave  as jerry gets on liza
        spots him  the doors close  the train rolls  she moves
        alongside tries to get his attention but he wont look
        over


        subway train

        jerry finally looks back  he sees liza an instant before
        entering the tunnel then a row of white strobe lights on
        the tunnel wall  jerry tries to blink them out as the
        sound of conspiratorial whispers fill the train  he
        looks about  its all suddenly unreal  certain
        passengers turn their heads leer at him

                                                   flash cut to


        subjective pov

        mr s  mr sutton  lizas father  standing at a white
        horse fence  his back to us as whoever it is comes up
        from behind  as a pistol is raised into frame the
        whispering grows in volume  mr sutton turns and
        somewhere along the way it becomes a scream


        int 7th avenue subway station  day

        liza stands there curses herself as the last of the
        train is swallowed by the tunnel  this isnt how she
        meant things to turn out  then her cell phone rings
        she takes it from her pocket flips it open

                                liza

        finger

                                jonas
                  years ago i worked for the cia

                  an ordinary man and turn him into
                  an assassin  that was our goal

                  mk ultra was terminated in 1973
                  but not the research it was
                  renamed  ex catcher

                                jonas
                  i am impressed  we used the
                  distinctive cover as a sort of
                  mental flash card

        jonas steps over his tone growing more confidential

                                jonas
                  we experimented with
                  hallucinogens  we used electro
                  shock to produce a vegetative
                  state  we conducted terminal
                  experiments in sensory
                  deprivation

                                jonas
                  as in resulting in death  we
                  pushed the envelope until it
                  wasnt even an envelope anymore

                                liza
                  if i had any idea what to charge
                  you with or how to prove it id
                  arrest you right here

                                jonas

                  heretic really  but where else
                  could a redblooded american boy
                  lie cheat steal and kill with
                  the sanction and blessings of the
                  allhighs  besides now im
                  trying to pay my penance

                                liza
                  missionary  penance  you talk
                  about it like it was a religion

                                jonas
                  it was  it was

        jonas says it almost sadly

                                liza
                  jerry told me he bit your nose

                                jonas
                  and what did i say

                                liza
                  a dog

                                jonasmy dog  one i intend to put to
                  sleep  extrapolate from there

                                liza
                  these things youre talking about
                  you did them to jerry

                                jonas
                  yes thats right

        liza looks at jonas with revulsion  a moment

                                liza
                  why dont you continue with your
                  religious experiences

        jonas smiles nods in acquiescence

                                jonas
                  mk ultra ex catcher it all
                  ended the moment john hinckley
                  shot ronald reagan

        he sees her eyes widen

                                jonas
                  it wasnt us  the science had
                  been sold  pandoras box opened
                  my children were taken from me and
                  employed by the private sector
                  jerry was one of them

        a long beat as they consider each other  we hear the
        clock tick on the credenza

                                liza
                  im still listening

                                jonas
                  jerry is dangerous  jerry has
                  killed 

                                liza
                  i dont believe you

        jonas looks a bit melancholy as he smiles shrugs

                                jonas
                  belief is immaterial  whats
                  important is the truth its
                  been my job to find jerry  im
                  very much responsible for him

                                liza
                  if this was a spy novel your next
                  words would be something like i
                  now know too much to live  why
                  are you telling me all this

                                jonas
                  so youll believe what i tell you
                  next  because i need to find
                  jerry  and i dont think i can do
                  that without you

        jonas reaches into a file on his desk hands liza a worn
        creased walletsized photo

                                jonas
                  do you recognize this

        its a smaller version of the photo of liza and her
        father that liza keeps behind the treadmill  lizas
        stunned

                  whered you get it

                                jonas

                  his wallet  he was murdered 

                                jonas
                  i know the story  a federal
                  judge  he denied a man in prison
                  an appeal for a new trial

                                liza

                                jonas
                  walters had nothing to do with
                  your fathers murder

                                liza
                  you sound so sure

        jonas doesnt answer  liza looks at the photo  jonas
        watches  the observer

                                liza
                  when they found him he was
                  holding his wallet
                  but he hadnt been robbed
                         to jonas
                  the only thing missing was this
                  photo  where did you find it

        jonas picks up a keyring holds up an oddshaped key

                                jonas
                  in jerrys safety deposit box

                                liza
                  i dont understand

        jonas is coldly paternal as

                                jonas
                  jerry killed your father liza
                  and hes been obsessed with you
                  ever since  its not even really
                  his fault  the blame is mine
                  im sorry

        liza looks up at the ceiling the walls  like a bird in
        a cage as it sinks in  she blinks out a tear  another
        no place to hide  jerry

                                liza
                  it all makes sense  oh god  he
                  killed him  jerry killed him

        liza gulps a breath covers her mouth with her hand
        shes going to be sick

        jonas sees it  like hes done it before he turns his
        trash can over dumps the contents hands it to her
        empty

        tears himself  shes not afraid of him anymore  but
        more important than that

        lift off the ground  in the doorway jonas waves goodbye

        the helicopter rises  revealing cleet 5 clark and
        piper standing beyond  they hold 9mms

        it was done on  liza shines the light  shes as taken
        with it now as the first time

        the more she stares at it the more frustrating it
        becomes  fighting back tears growling back her anger
        liza grabs a corner and tears then tears again trying
        to destroy this thing which affects her so

        when shes done the wonderwall hangs in tatters  and as
        liza tries to get a hold of herself she realizes

        theres a second painting behind the first

        liza pulls down the tatters of brown butcher paper which
        made the first  the second is the pov of a room  in
        fact its entitled  in my room  in the bg a

        flashing light partially obscures a face reflected in a
        mirror  jonas

        the whole effect is unnerving but tells liza nothing
        more  until she takes a second look at the window
        its blocked by three redandwhitestriped bars  as
        liza runs her hand over them

        the sound of love  he smiles sadly lowers the
        binoculars

                                jerry
                  shes okay
                         to lowry grim
                  lets go

        liza gallops out into the sun  feeling it remembering
        realizing just how much she missed this  but now she has
        it again  a gift

        head back she holds her arms out in hope and faith very
        much like the painting on jerrys wonderwall
