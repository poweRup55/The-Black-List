universe  eight billion light years from earth

the cosmos on the grandest scale we know  clusters of
galaxies strewn like sea froth whorls and smudges of
light representing hundreds of billions of stars each

milky way galaxy

a view from the edge  we drift above the majestic
spiraling disk tens of thousands of light years across

ring nebula m57  constellation lyra

a local group of stars the brightest of which is a point
of hot bluewhite light

vega

rings of glowing gas and debris surround the giant blue
white star and then we notice something ahead of us in
polar orbit

closer

an immense worldsized construct gleams in vegas blue
light  far too big to be artificial by human standards
 but this wasnt built to human standards

bowlshaped transmitters cover the quicksilver gellike
surface of the polyhedron forming then vanishing again
we descend into one vast bowl as it deepens 

 then silently convulses  a lost chord  we swing
around assuming a breathtaking moving pov 

a message begins its journey

								    dissolve to

subterranean darkness

shadows appear dark and murky  slowly we become aware of
a muffled pulsing sound like a distant booming
heartbeat

suddenly a bright light unzips the amniotic darkness two
great hands reach in to assist what we now realize is a
caesarean birth

ellie arroway

age five seconds opens her eyes wide  in the bg we
can see a nurse methodically giving cpr to the unseen
mother the decor beyond tells us we are in a smalltown
doctors office  the doctor holds ellie as he calls
softly to the nurse

					doctor
		you can call it nan  mark time of
		birth as 1204 am
			   looking down at the
			    baby
		happy new year little lady
			   to the nurse
		tell ted he has a girl

ted arroway stands watching through the window in the
office door  numb

babys tiny hand

clasps its mothers finger

ted holding his newborn daughter sitting quietly next to
the bed where his sheetcovered wife still lies

ext  main street nehalem oregon  dawn

ted carefully holding little ellie walks down the empty
street his footsteps echoing

deep space  message

rockets through a black dust cloud where young stars are
just beginning to glow  an icy worldlet evaporates
releasing gasses which blow away in spectral bursts of
iridescent color

surface of alien world

we are moving over an exotic technological landscape
strange alien squelches and squeals become audible 

 and then a childs hand reaches in and twists a giant
dial on what we now see is an old shortwave radio

					ellie vo

int  arroway house  night

sixyear old ellie leans in towards a large microphone

					ellie
		cq wr2 gfo do you copy
			   calls
		im not getting anything

ted joins his daughter at the workbench where she sits in
front of the shortwave her feet dangling from the stool
he puts his hands on her shoulders

					ted
		small moves captain small moves

					ellie
		i cant move any smaller

					ted
		try again between the static and
		hey jude thats where theyre
		hiding

ellie bites her lip tries again  her little hand slowly
turns the dial  suddenly

					ellie
		what do i do

					ted

finger traces the gulf of mexico stopping at pensacola

ellie breathless with wonder  contact

ext  arroway bedroom  night

the house in the woods dwarfed under the immense dome of
night

int  ellies bedroom  night

now in her pajamas ellie sits hunched over in bed
working intently on her latest masterpiece  a crayon
behind her ear

					ellie
		could we hear to china

					ted
		on that old shortwave  maybe on a
		clear night  come on now under the
		covers

					ellie
		could we hear to the moon

					ted
		big enough radio i dont see why
		not

					ellie
		could we hear god

					ted
		mmm thats a good one  maybe his
		echo
			   then
		okay no more stalling

					ellie
			   coloring frantically
		okay okay there

she hands ted the drawing  as he holds it up to the lamp
we see it shows an idealized beach palm trees  it glows
in the light

					ellie
		pensacola

					ted
		thats a beauty captain
			   kisses her on the
			    forehead
		now get some sleep

he carefully pins the drawing on the wall turns out the
light  as he starts out she says softly 

					ellie
		do you think therere people on
		other planets

ted pauses smiles at his daughters inexhaustible
curiosity  he returns sits on the edge of her bed now
lit by starlight

					ted
		well lets see the universe is a
		pretty big place and the one
		thing i know about nature is it
		hates to waste anything  so i guess
		id say if it is just us an awful
		lot of space is going to waste

he tenderly brushes a stray lock of her hair behind her
ear

					ted
		time to sleep now captain  but you
		can ask more questions in the
		morning okay

					ellie
			   sighs
		okay

he kisses her again rises goes to leave stopping at the
door to watch her  ellie looks out the window at the
stars

a comet blows by  we chase it riding its luminous tail
of evaporating ice

teds callused hand

careful as a safecracker slowly turns the dial on an
ancient am radio  finally landing on an old hank
williams tune

int  teds truck  moving  day

ted sits up smiles in satisfaction

ext  truck  day

the old red ford trundles through the pines along a
mountain road

int  arroway kitchen  day

nineyear old ellie throws her schoolbooks on the table
and goes to the refrigerator  as she starts to take out
items we see her handdrawn chart taped to the side of the
fridge mondays and thursdays say ellie cooks

ext  mountains  day

a fawn is feeding  cut wide to reveal it standing in the
middle of an empty road nibbling at the grass growing out
of the old blacktop  the twitter of a bird the wind in
the trees and then far in the distance we hear an
engine straining

logging truck

heads up the mountain road its driver humming along to
the same hank williams tune

int  arroway kitchen  day

a stew of some sort bubbles on the stove  ellie hums as
she experiments with every spice on the rack

series of shots

a  ted sings to the radio as he eases off the gas to
    take a bend in the road 

b  the fawn continues to graze oblivious  we can now
    hear the radio in the distance

c  ted look up as he rounds the bend  sees the deer 

d  the logging truck roars around a blind curve 

e  ted swerves onto the wrong side of the road misses
    the deer sighs in relief 

f  the truck driver looks up sees the ford coming at
    him ted still looking over his shoulder at 

fawn

who suddenly looks up at the os sound of a horrible
crash 

 then bounds off into the woods

int  arroway kitchen  dusk

the table is set  a stubby candle and some wildflowers in
a peanutbutter jar

ellie sits at her place frowning  she glances up at the
wall clock  and then slowly stands as she sees something
else through the kitchen window

a sheriffs car is pulling up lights going siren silent
the sheriff looks up  their eyes meet  push in on
ellie

ext  countryside  night

little cones of light illuminate the darkness as neighbors
search with their flashlights calling

ext  arroway house  night

the sheriff stands in front of the house shaking his head
as he talks to a minister  voices continue to call

we start to crane up higher and higher until we clear the
house  revealing ellie lying on the roof staring up at
the stars  her fingers grip the shingles

ext  country cemetery  day

the minister kneels next to ellie watching her knead
another piece of bread into a ball before tossing it into
a small fish pond  in the bg we see the sheriff and
several relatives watching

					minister
		im so sorry ellie  more than i
		can ever say

ellie keeps watching the pond  the clouds overhead are
reflected in the patches of water between the lily pads

					ellie
		those lily pads must look like
		clouds to that carp dont you
		think

the minister frowns  gently

					minister
		ellie this life doesnt last
		forever  some day you and your dad
		are going to be together again in
		heaven

					ellie
			   turns to him
			    equally gentle
		he isnt in heaven hes in the
		ground  we just put him there
		remember

off the astonished minister 

int  arroway house  night

relatives townspeople the minister and sheriff mingle
quietly  the kitchen table and counters are covered with
a sea of casseroles

ellie watches the gathered from a doorway then slips
away

int  arroway house  workshop area  night

ellie slowly approaches the darkened bench area where the
shortwave is set up the pindotted map above it  she
turns it on the dial glows

she reaches out for the microphone holding it tightly in
both hands  pushes the button

					ellie
		cq wr2 this is gfo do you copy

ext  house  high angle  night

tiny ellie is visible through the window and as we begin
to pull up and away her emotionchoked voice continues
small and faraway

 rockets through the rosette nebula a vast cloud of
glowing red hydrogen illuminated by young hot stars a
hundred times brighter than the sun  their solar wind is
blowing out an immense cavity in the interstellar gas and
dust

palm leaf

lies on the streetlamplit sidewalk

we hear the sound of a bus pulling up its door opening
after a moment a pair of sneakered feet tentatively step
into frame  a suitcase is set down next to them as we
hear the bus wheeze off into the night  a hand reaches
down picks up the palm leaf

22yearold ellie examines it then looks up in
apprehension at the old prewar spanish structure of cal
tech

int  campus building  corridor  night

ellies footsteps echo as she walks down a corridor its
walls hung with portraits of galileo copernicus hubble
she pauses at a photograph of einstein standing outside
the entrance we just saw  sound up cut  the ramones i
wanna be sedated 

int  dorm corridor  night

an altogether different sort of hallway reflecting the
imagination and individuality of its occupants  the walls
are covered with whimsical graffiti anthropocentrism is
a 17 letter word  watch for flying potatoes and 3
am paintings of alien sunsets the music is coming from
behind a door covered in tolkien and comic book art

as ellie enters this strange new world she begins to hear
animated voices coming from a room at the end of the hall

					voice 1 vo
		 radio luminosity

					voice 2 vo
		i dunno maybe a postspectral
		starburst or something

					everybody vo
		right right 

					voice 3 vo
		ea is an elliptical  how can you
		tell its being lensed  pass me the
		fruity pebbles

					voice 4 vo
		well i guess youd have to check
		other elliptical galaxies mr
		wizard 

int  dorm room  night

as ellie peers around the corner we see six or seven
students mostly male of mixed nationality and race
passing around cereal which they eat from the box  a
primitive circa 1980 homebuilt personal computer glows
in the bg a door opens onto a terrace and the
california night beyond  they stop look up at ellie 

					ellie
		i  uh 
			   clears her throat
		i was looking for koestler hall

					guy student
		this is it  hey do you know the
		average radioluminosity of an ea
		elliptical galaxy

					ellie
		um im not sure
			   hesitates
		maybe you could deduce it from
		lensing a postspectral
		starburst

					guy
			   beat then to his
			    friend
		see i told you
			   to ellie
		want some fruity pebbles
		carcinogenic but totally worth it

ellie takes the box and as she tentatively enters the
room  nibbles on the cereal  she slowly sits  smiles
the argument rages on  shes home

ext  mojave desert  day

david drumlin 42 fit sardonic  and the worlds
foremost radio astronomer  leads a group of grad
students past the first jet propulsion lab radio
telescopes at goldstone  ellie lags behind talking to
peter valerian who is about as goodlooking as an
astronomer should be allowed to be

					ellie
		 drumlin said youre been down at
		arecibo for the last year

					peter
		its beautiful but it does get a
		little lonely  sometimes i think
		the reason we build these things in
		such godforsaken places isnt to
		avoid excess radio traffic but
		because were all such pathetic
		antisocial misfits speaking of
		which  howre you getting on with
		the old man

					ellie
		hes an incredible prick but i never
		learned so much in my life

					peter
			   smiles
		thats what they all say

in the bg we can see the majestic twin dishes tilted up
toward the hard blue sky  an awkward moment which ellie
fills by extending her hand

					ellie
		ellie  arroway

					peter
		peter valerian

					ellie
		sounds like a russian general

					peter
		yavol

					drumlin
			   calling back
		youre out of shape valerian
		whats the matter eat too many
		tacos down there in puerto rico

he pronounces it tackos in his distinctive montana
twang

					ellie
		i read your paper on etis  its
		brilliant

					peter
			   embarrassed but
			    pleased
		keep it down okay  drumlin thinks
		im enough of a flake as it is
			   then
		look  everyone here has their
		little fetishes  caven goes to
		topless bars vernons got his
		carnivorous plants mine just
		happens to be extraterrestrial
		intelligence

					ellie
		what a coincidence  it happens to
		be my fetish too

a brief but electric moment between them  they both feel
it  drumlin calls back from the head of the group

					drumlin
		you two coming along or you just
		gonna do it right here in the sand

the other students laugh goodnaturedly  ellie and peter
rather than being embarrassed seem to be considering the
idea

ext  mojave cliffs  late afternoon

a dusky orange sun hangs over the mountains the goldstone
telescopes visible in the distance  ellie and peter walk
along a windswept cliff overlooking a vast desert lake

					ellie
		 im just so sick of feeling
		defensive about the things i care
		about  or being lumped in with the
		lunatic fringe by people like
		drumlin when if theyd just put
		aside their preconceptions for two
		seconds and look at the facts

					peter
		they cant  i think its against
		human nature to admit to that level
		of insignificance to not see
		yourself as basically the center of
		the universe

					ellie
		its like the precopernicans who
		swore the sun revolved around the
		earth or the victorians at the end
		of the last century who concluded
		that all major discoveries had now
		been made  i mean try to imagine
		civilization a thousand years ahead
		of us  then imagine trying to
		explain i dunno a microwave oven
		 to someone even a hundred years
		ago  i mean the basic concepts
		didnt exist

					peter
			   murmurs
		any sufficiently advanced
		technology

					ellie
			   finishing it with
			    him
		 is indistinguishable from
		magic

a moment and then peter takes her hand like its the
most natural thing in the world

					peter
		i dunno  i know i should be
		objective icecold hardassed
		scientific about it but just on an
		intuitive level  whats the point
		of a universe so vast if were the
		only ones it it  itd just be such
		a waste of space

ellie stops looks at him  and then slowly carefully
leans in and kisses him  a pleasantly awkward beat

					ellie
		sorry

peter laughs

ext  desert  night

a million stares blaze overhead as peter and ellie make
love on an indian blanket in the middle of the desert
ellie looks searchingly up into peters face and then
her gaze drifts upwards to the canopy above

squirrel

gnaws on a beechnut as two enormous pair of feet walk by

					ellie vo
		 but ive already submitted my
		proposal

ext  cal tech campus  day

ellie and drumlin walk briskly in heated discussion

					drumlin
		im sorry miss arroway not only is
		it too speculative a subject for a
		doctoral dissertation at this point
		in your career itd be tantamount to
		suicide

					ellie
		im willing to take that risk

					drumlin
		im not  youre far too promising a
		scientist to waste your considerable
		gifts on this nonsense 

					ellie
		dr drumlin we are talking about
		what could potentially be the most
		important discovery in the history
		of humanity  there are over four
		hundred billion stars out there 

					drumlin
		and only two probabilities  one
		there is intelligent life in the
		universe but theyre so far away
		youll never contact it in your
		lifetime 

					ellie
		youre 

					drumlin
		two  theres nothing out there but
		noble gasses and carbon compounds
		and youd be wasting your time

					ellie
		what if youre wrong
			   as he starts to
			    speak
		no  ill grant you probabilities
		but as a scientist without all the
		evidence  you cant deny the
		possibility  and i believe even
		the remotest possibility of
		something this profoundly
		profound is worth investigation 
		and worth taking a few risks

					drumlin
		i disagree

					ellie
		then disagree but dont stand in my
		way

by this point theyve gathered a small crowd  drumlin
regards her for for a moment then softly

					drumlin
		what is it that makes you so lonely
		miss arroway  what is it that
		compels you to search the heavens
		for life when theres so much of it
		being neglected right here at home

body blow  ellie just stares stunned  finally

					drumlin
		i will approve a general thesis on
		the detection of radio signals from
		space but thats all  no etis
		enough

flushed overwhelmed ellie nods  enough

same  few minutes later

peeling paint a few steps down from your average dorm

					ellie os
			   calls from the

		 i keep telling myself okay
		thats just the price you have to
		do your time doing shitwork before
		youre allowed to get to the good

		one more quasar
			   sticks her head
			    out
		god ive missed you

					peter
		any luck on the grant money

					ellie
		please  any chance of that died the
		day david drumlin was appointed head
		of the nsf  i have been in
		contact with a few other seti
		people weve been trying to find
		backing from private investors
		ive even managed to scrounge a
		couple of hours of telescope time
		here and there

		far nothing  still weve barely
		started

					ellie
		 weve been going after some of
		the big multinationals but without
		much luck got a donation from a new
		york dowager weve even been
		thinking about selling tshirts

					peter
		ellie even if you do manage to
		raise the money have you thought
		about what it would really mean to
		follow through on this  i mean a
		college fetish is one thing but
		were talking about your career
		you wont be publishing  you wont
		be taken seriously and you could
		spend your entire life looking and
		never find anything at all

ellie pauses looks out at the endless ocean of green
quietly

					ellie
		if we lived at any previous time in
		human history we wouldnt even have
		the option of failing  wed have
		to wonder our whole lives unable to
		do anything about it  this time
		right now is unique in our history
		in any civilizations history  the
		moment of the acquisition of
		technology  the moment when contact
		becomes possible  weve already
		beaten incredible odds by being
		lucky enough to be alive now

					peter
			   pausing
		how close are you to getting this
		funding put together

					ellie
		its almost there  the hardest part
		is getting someone to sell us the
		telescope time

					peter
		what if i said i could get drumlin
		to agree to sell you time in new
		mexico

					ellie
			   stunned
		the vla

					peter
		thirtyone linked dishes  you could
		search more sky there in a day than
		you could in a year here

					ellie
		peter  if you can get him to do
		that for me hed obviously do the
		same for you  we could  

					peter
		actually 

					ellie
		we could be together again 

					peter
		 im moving to washington

					ellie
			   confused
		greenbank

					peter
		im going on staff at the nsf  to
		work for drumlin

					ellie
		but what about your research  

					peter
		this is a chance to be of enormous
		help to other peoples research 
		to have the power to be a real
		advocate where davids got blind
		spots 

					ellie
		but the work 

					peter
		the work jesus ellie cant
		there just once be more to life than
		the work  okay maybe thats the
		only way to get the recognition win
		the prizes 

					ellie
		please youre just as ambitious as
		i am more 

					peter
		maybe thats the problem  i want
		a family ellie  i want kids  a
		townhouse on l street instead of
		still living like a college kid  a
		real life  maybe that makes me a
		sellout but i dont care anymore
		its what i want

					ellie
		and you think i dont want those
		things  you think i dont stay up
		half the night wondering if ive
		made the right choice living half a
		world away from you wondering if
		any of this is worth what im giving
		up for it everyday
			   as peter is silent
			    suddenly
		lets get married

					peter
		jesus 

					ellie
		right now  well drive down to
		ramey and get the base chaplain to
		marry us

					peter
		ellie 

					ellie
		im serious about this peter 

					peter
		ellie  im getting married
			   off a stunned
			    silence
		her names laura  she came up to
		owens valley to do her postdoc
		about six months after you left

					ellie
			   stares
		you sonofabitch

					peter
		that is true  but its also true
		that if i really thought we wanted
		the same things id follow you
		anywhere but the truth is i dont
		think you want the company
			   softly
		be honest el  theres nowhere
		youd rather be than sitting out at

		searching for the answers to the
		mysteries of the universe  and call

the sedan pulls up  willie climbs out of the drivers
side and comes around to get the bags as david drumlin
emerges formidable and patrician as ever  kent fisher
millington curtain and a number of other scientists are
there to greet him

					drumlin
			   hand at his back
		now i remember why i went into
		theoretical work  kent

					kent
		glad to have you david  hows the
		new office

					drumlin
		still settling in really
			   looking over the
			    group
		wheres dr arroway

int  vla control room  afternoon

kent and fisher lead drumlin through the complex his
conservative suit out of place among the jeans and
tshirts other scientists either smile obsequiously or
avert their gaze

					fisher
		 not that theres a whole lot in
		the way of entertainment around here
		but i guess it beats communing with
		washing machines

					drumlin
		whats that

					kent
		nothing
			   looking at fisher
			    hesitates a long
			    beat
		okay  some of us have been a
		little not concerned exactly
		but

					drumlin
			   almost gently
		tell me

					kent
			   hesitates again
			    finally
		last week about 3 am fish  dr
		fisher  was on a late shift and
		he found her doing laundry

					drumlin
		so

					kent
		so there wasnt any clothes in
		the machine  she was just sitting
		there on the floor with her ear
		pressed up against the maytag
		listening

					drumlin
		no thanks

he sits on the corner of the unmade bed  ellie pops open
a soda unselfconscious

					drumlin
		peter sends his regards

					ellie
			   a little too
			    nonchalant
		oh  hows he doing

					drumlin
		very well since my appointment hes
		been made interim director

					ellie
		really  congratulations by the
		way

					drumlin
		im surprised you even knew it was
		an election year

					ellie
		presidents science advisor  so
		what you just spend all your time
		jetting around on air force one
		now

					drumlin
		now exactly  its complicated

					ellie
		no doubt

					drumlin
			   a beat then
		ellie

					ellie
			   avoiding the
			    inevitable
		did i tell you weve expanded the
		search spectrum  were including
		several other possible magic
		frequencies  not just the hydrogen
		line anymore  i was trying to get
		inside their heads yknow  and i
		started thinking what other
		constants are there in the universe
		besides hydrogen and then suddenly
		it was so obvious  transcendantals
		right  so weve been trying
		variations of pi

					drumlin
		you know why im here

					ellie
		its not enough having my search
		time systematically cut down  you
		know im down to three hours a week
		now

					drumlin
		ellie i should have done this a
		long time ago certainly before i
		left the nsf but i wanted to
		give you every benefit of the
		doubt 

					ellie
		you cant just pull the plug david

					drumlin
		its not like youve given me much
		choice

					ellie
		meaning

					drumlin
		meaning i have to go defend a budget
		to the president and to congress and
		youre out here listening to washing
		machines

					ellie
			   quietly
		im searching for patterns in the
		noise thats all  order in the
		chaos  im practicing listening 

					drumlin
		the point is this isnt just
		scientific inquiry anymore  its
		turned into some kind of personal
		obsession

					ellie
		the difference being what  that i
		refuse to adopt the standard line
		that i dont care about the results
		of my work  well i do care  of
		course any discovery has to be
		verifiable of course it must be
		subject to all rigors of scientific
		method but i refuse to go around
		pretending im some kind of
		dispassionate automaton when its
		obvious to anyone with a brain im
		just not

					drumlin
		no youre not  but the price has
		just gotten too high

					ellie
		goddamnit they are out there
		david 

					drumlin
		then why havent you detected any
		signals  if as you claim there
		have been thousands millions of
		advanced civilizations out there for
		millions of years then why hasnt
		one signal gotten through
			   rising
		itll take a month or two for the
		paperwork to go through youre
		welcome to stay until then

					ellie
		david 

					drumlin
		it was a worthy experiment  worthy
		of you i was wrong about that part
		but its over now

a faint irregular pulsing fading in and out of reception

ellie slowly swims up to consciousness  after a moment
her eyes open  she sits up 

tight on boombox

still playing reggae  a hand reaches in and turns it off

		if its attention you want id say
		youve got it
			   as ellie turns to
			    him
		just one thing  why vega
		everyones looked at vega for years
		with no results and now yesterday
		they start broadcasting primes
		why

					ellie
		its hardly yesterday the signals
		been traveling for over twentysix
		years  as for why
			   meeting his gaze
		im hoping your own expertise in
		decryption algorithms will help us
		find out  to see if theres
		another message buried deeper in the
		signal

drumlin frowns effectively neutralized for the moment

					kitz

					drumlin
		michael kitz national security

					kitz
		dr arroway let me first say 

					ellie
		before you do could you please ask

		wait outside  this is a civilian
		facility

kitz pauses  then gives a signal to dismiss the berets

					ellie
		oh and if you could ask them not to
		use their radios  interference
		thanks so much

drumlin warns her with a look which she conveniently
avoids

					kitz
		ill come right to the point
		doctor  your sending this message
		all over the world may well be a
		breach of national security

					ellie
		this isnt a person to person call
		mr kitz  i dont really think the
		civilization sending the message
		intended it just for americans

					kitz
		im saying you might have consulted
		us the contents of this message
		could be extremely sensitive

					ellie
		you want to classify prime numbers

					drumlin
		mike because of the earths
		rotation were only in line with
		vega so many hours a day the only
		way to get the whole message is to
		cooperate with other stations  if
		dr arroway hadnt moved quickly we
		could have lost key elements

					kitz
		okay fine theyve got the primes
		 but if youre right about there
		being another more significant
		transmission still to come 

					ellie
		 which well also need the
		networks help to receive and
		decode

					kitz
		you dont seem to understand that
		its your interests im trying to
		protect  

suddenly the steady beeping of the message stops replaced
by terrible static  on the various displays the prime

		my fellow americans citizens of the

		standard time yesterday morning
		american scientists detected a radio
		signal from space  this message was
		largely mathematical and in spite
		of some of the headlines ive seen
		today so far seems to be completely
		benign in nature  to better explain
		the extraordinary events of the last
		24 hours im turning you over to
		doctor david drumlin

ellie looks up in surprise  drumlin doesnt miss a beat
as he strides to the podium

					drumlin
		good morning  in 1936 a very faint
		television signal transmitted the
		opening ceremonies of the olympic
		games as a show of german superior
		technology  that signal left earth
		at the speed of light and twentysix
		years later arrived on vega which
		they then sent back to us hugely
		amplified  as evidence of
		intelligence this is indisputable 

as drumlin continues we see fisher ease onto the dais from
behind approach ellie and surreptitiously hand her a
note

					drumlin
		whoever or whatever they are
		theyre clearly move advanced than
		we

					president lasker
		oh my god

		i think we just hit the cosmic

					kent
		its incredibly rich  weve been

					ellie
		it could be anything  the first

					kitz
		 instructions to acquaint us with

					kent
		moses with a few billion new

					kitz
		ms president in the interest of

		recommend we militarize this project
		immediately 

					ellie
		pardon me but you cant do  

					kitz
		if at some later date the message
		proves harmless we can discuss
		sharing it with the rest of the
		world but until then 

					ellie
		thats terrific but theres one
		problem  we dont have the means to
		receive all the data on our own

					president lasker
		is that true

					drumlin
		the only way would be if we had a
		radio telescope in orbit

					president lasker
		we dont  why dont we

					ellie
		because you cut it from the budget
		three years running

					president lasker
		how soon will you be able to decode
		it

					lunacharsky
		theres no way of knowing  without
		a key  a primer to help us maybe
		never

					ellie
		maybe itll be at the end of the
		data when the message recycles

					president lasker
		well  that would seem to decide it
		like it or not for the moment
		anyway it looks like were all in
		this together

					kitz

					president lasker
		thats it mike  last time i

stepped up to the podium in front of ellie  a gnarled
hand pushes a button on a console and the image enlarges
 we see ellies expression of shock and hurt over and
over  over and over

on the next monitor over is live cnn coverage of the scene
outside the vla  we begin to push in on it 

					wolf blitzer vo
		 there had been speculation on
		the part of psychologists that the
		proliferation of depictions of
		aliens in movies and on television
		in recent years might make for an
		almost blase acceptance of the news

								    match cut to

ext  desert new mexico  day

the road leading to the vla is jammed with vehicles rvs
vans busses as far as the eye can see  more people walk
on the side of the road

					wolf blitzer vo
		but the truth is it turns out is
		far stranger than anything hollywood
		might have dreamed up  and here
		today the prospect of
		extraterrestrial intelligence if no
		longer science fiction  its the
		best show in town

the view climbs revealing campfires bbqs tents of all
shapes and sizes littering the plains surrounding the
telescope array  signs and banners reading watch the
skies and there are aliens among us  woodstock 1998

					voice os
		 i know youre angry  were all
		angry  about the lies  the
		corruption  about the cancer of
		despair spreading through every
		aspect of our lives  but rome will
		fall my friends everywhere now are
		the signs of closure  even now the
		end begins

ext  vla entrance  continuous action

various preachers and new age gurus speak to gatherings
all along the new cyclone fence surrounding the vla  we
become aware of a crowd concentrated around a young man
speaking on a small stage  joseph  he has the appeal of
a rock star albeit a compelling wellspoken one  his
amplified voice rings out

					joseph
		the millennium is upon us  god has
		fulfilled his promise sending us
		this herald to warn the faithless 
		the scientists who tell us he
		doesnt even exist  and to promise
		us the faithful we will be saved

beyond joseph we can see through the shiny new cyclone
fence to the vla building now surrounded by tents and
temporary structures

					joseph os
		i dont know what this voice from
		the sky says  but i do know that
		if history has taught us anything
		its that the politicians and the
		scientists are lying to us right
		now for their own good  are these
		the kind of people you want talking
		to your god for you  

int  vla control room  day

outside the panorama window searchlights fan crowds
chant frightening rhythms  inside the numbing never
ending pulses of the signal and scrolling numbers

the former loungecafeteria has been turned into
decryption central  dozens of personal workstations
populated with silicon valleys finest assortment of
technowizards crashed out on cots in a roundtheclock
effort to break the code

ellie sips her coffee as she walks briskly through the
chaos drumlin matches her stride for stride

					drumlin
		 arrangements also have to be
		made for the vips coming in
		mostly religious leaders

					ellie
		what  why

					drumlin
		the theological ramifications of all
		this are obvious the president
		feels we need to include religious
		interests rather than alienate them
		shes also named palmer joss as
		their liaison hes requested a
		meeting with you

					ellie
		with me

					drumlin
		apparently hes genuinely interested
		in science  this could be a chance
		to win him over

					ellie
		im going to convert mr scienceis
		therootofallevil  this is
		absurd david  we have work to do
		here i dont have time to play
		babysitter to the god squad

					drumlin
			   low and dangerous
		ellie 

ellie looks at him in surprise as he grabs her by the
elbow

					drumlin
		i want you to listen to me
		carefully  the minute the
		implications of this message became
		clear this stopped being simply a
		scientific matter and became a
		political one  an extremely
		complex extremely volatile one
		there are forces at work here you
		dont understand i can help you up
		to a point but only up to a point

					ellie
			   in innocent wonder
		are you threatening me

					drumlin
		its not a threat ellie its a
		fact  if youre not careful you
		may find yourself out in the cold
		very quickly  play ball  really
		its good advice

ellie stops as she notices through the windows
lunacharsky stepping out of the decryption area  hes
looking right at her

					ellie
		excuse me

angle

as ellie approaches lunacharsky something in his eyes
tells her theres more to his weary look than just
fatigue

					ellie
		what

					lunacharsky
		weve repeated  a few minutes ago
		the message cycled back to page one

					ellie
		and

					lunacharsky
		no primer

					ellie
			   incredulous
		how can that be

					lunacharsky
		i dont know  maybe there is a
		fourth layer in there somewhere but
		if there is i sure as hell cant
		find it

ellie stares at him  turns to look at drumlin  then
walks out of the room

int  ellies room  night

blearyeyed three days with no sleep ellie sits at her
terminal staring at the hieroglyphics more impenetrable
then ever  in the corner the tv drones

					bernie shaw vo
		 and with church attendance at
		record highs a coalition of
		religious leaders are using their
		increased political capital to
		challenge the very legality of radio

a cnn special report logo  the message dazzlingly
vulgar with its own graphics and there

a commercial continues in the bg

ellie chin on forearms stares at her screen willing
herself to find a pattern

suddenly she blinks  something is changing  a dot
appears in the middle of the screen  it begins to grow
revealing a complex fractal shape  it splits enlarges
splits again the shapes finally revealing themselves
as english letters  which read

take me to your leader

ellie stares 

					ellie
		someones broken into the system
		someones compromised the
		fucking  

she quickly type in  who are you

the fractals reform  ive got a secret

ellie types again  who are you

the fractals reform  your place or mine

ellie stares  more fractals form as she grabs a pen and
paper 

ext  vla  night

national guardsmen have established a perimeter around the
compound soldiers are posted on the main road as well
as ellie roars through the gate in her 1967 tbird our
view rises  the new woodstock nation is for the moment
asleep

ext  highway new mexico  night

ellies tense face lit by the dash  she picks up a piece
of paper with scribbled directions on it  turns onto a
dirt road

ext  highway new mexico  low angle pov  night

of ellies car roaring by swings to reveal a jackrabbit
sitting at the side of the road its nose twitching

ext  desert  night

ellies car approaches a small private airstrip a black
unmarked helicopter is waiting

high above utah  dawn

the strange rock formations of southeastern utah almost
resemble another planet

ext  larger airstrip utah

as the helicopter sets down we see two lear jets and
another helicopter service vehicles for the enormous
russian transport plane that sits beyond them

a darksuited japanese major domo helps ellie out of the
helicopter

					major domo
		you should be flattered  he hardly
		lands for anyone

int  transport plane

the major domo leads ellie down a corridor of the planes
custom interior  through one door we can see into a room
where several very beautiful very young women sit
watching tv with vacant eyes  ellie only catches a
glimpse before the major domo nods for her to enter the
main room and takes his post outside

ellie cautiously enters the interior of what appears to be
a flying dascha dark heavy on the chintz  bookshelves
an exercise machine and a wall of monitors filled top
to bottom with scrolling hieroglyphics  ellie reaches out
to them 

					hadden os
		dr arroway i presume

ellie turns to see sr hadden  thick glasses wearing a
cardigan he stands by a silver samovar

					ellie
		sr hadden
			   beat
		you compromised our security codes

					hadden
		once upon a time i was a hell of an
		engineer  please sit doctor  i
		have guests so rarely its
		important to me they feel welcome in

			   turns to the
			    samovar
		did you know this was once yeltsins
		flying dascha  that dent is where
		he threw a bottle of vodka at the
		pilot  at least thats what the
		people who sold me the plane said

as he speaks he slowly and with great effort raises a
glass to the samovar fills it with tea

					ellie
		you live here

					hadden
		i find it convenient to keep my
		interests mobile  anyway ive
		had my fill of life on the ground
		after spending much of this century
		pursuing the evils and pleasures the
		world has to offer  after
		outliving three wives and two
		children
			   a bare flicker of
			    emotion
		i find ive had quite enough of
		planet earth

					ellie
		why am i here mr hadden

					hadden
			   smiles
		the infamous unfashionable
		bluntness
			   turning
		youre here so we can do business
		i want to make a deal

					ellie
		what kind of deal

					hadden
		the powers that be have been quite
		busy lately falling over each other
		to position themselves for the game
		of the century if not the
		millennium  perhaps youve noticed
			   as ellie reacts
			    hadden smiles
		perhaps i could help deal you back
		in

					ellie
		i didnt realize i was out

					hadden
		oh maybe not out  but definitely
		looking for you coat
			   beat
		i understand youve had some
		difficulty locating the  what are
		you calling it  the primer that
		will make decryption possible
			   he turns to her
			    simply
		ive found it

					ellie
		youve found it
			   catching her breath
		what could i possibly have that you
		would want mr hadden

					hadden
		ive had a long time to make
		enemies dr arroway  there are
		many governments business
		interests even religious leaders
		who would like to see me disappear
		and i will grant them their wish
		soon enough but before i do i
		wish to make a small contribution 
		a final gesture of goodwill toward
		the people of this little planet
		whove given  from whom ive taken
		so much

					ellie
		if i knew you any better id say
		that doesnt sound like you

					hadden
			   a dazzling smile
		thats my girl
			   then
		lights

the lights dim  the wall monitors take center stage

					hadden
		forgive the theatrics its a
		weakness

hadden pulls on a pair of gloves for an imaginary vr
keyboard  he gestures for ellie to sit beside him facing
the monitors  he begins to type as the monitors scroll
hieroglyphics 

					hadden
		page after page of data  over
		sixtythree thousand in all if im
		not mistaken and at the end of
		each

					ellie
		a pagebreak signal  a period

					hadden
		not if you think like a vegan

					ellie
		youre saying there is no
		separate primer in the message 
		because its on every page so the
		recipient can decipher it wherever
		he is 

					hadden
		 even if he doesnt receive the
		entire transmission  heaven is the
		mustard seed

hadden ghosttypes a series of commands  the monitor wall
syncs into a giant vidscreen 

the hieroglyphics begin to enlarge  an almost invisible
dot in the lower right corner of the screen  the page
break signal  grows larger and larger until it reveals
a level of complexity and detail greater than that of the
hieroglyphics themselves

					ellie
			   breathless
		holy shit

these new symbols begin to mutate change something is
happening hadden leans in to ellie

					hadden
		youll like this part  a little
		flashy

on screen

the symbols metamorphose into strange fractal shapes
like crystals they begin to grow and shift interacting
in a stunningly beautiful and intricate ballet 

					ellie
		some kind of circuitry

					hadden
		very good doctor  ive also
		detected structural elements back
		references a general movement from
		the simple to the complex  all of
		which would seem to indicate
		instructions  an enormously
		complicated set of instructions 
		for building something

					ellie
		a machine
			   off haddens nod
		but a machine that does what

					hadden
			   smiles
		that would seem to be the question
		of the hour
			   turning to her
		i want to build it doctor  of
		course im already lobbying through
		the usual channels of influence and
		corruption  but as i said my
		colorful past has made many of those
		channels difficult to navigate
		i need someone on the inside

					ellie
		and in return

					hadden
		in return you get the primer 
		and with it the power to stay in the
		game  do we have a deal

ellie pulls herself away from the hypnotic display

					ellie
		mr hadden im a scientist i dont
		make deals but  if you wish to
		give me in good faith access to
		your information i can assure you
		that i will exert all reasonable
		efforts to promote your cause
		wherever it doesnt conflict with
		the best interests of science or
		my better judgment

					hadden
			   delighted
		thats my girl  done

ellie turns to watch the screens as the fractals continue
to coalesce  dazzled 

								    cut to

ext  camp david  aerial shot  day

the snowcovered presidential retreat in its forest
setting

int  camp david  briefing room  day

charts display a decoded periodic table the slice of
circuitry monitors scroll through hundreds of decoded
pages

					ellie
		 and while its function remains
		for the moment a mystery my best
		guess is that it represents a
		transport of some kind

					president lasker
		a transport  so are they coming or
		are we going

					kitz
			   interrupting
		the transport theory is only one
		hypothesis ms president and in my
		view a rather naive one  it could
		just as easily be some kind of
		trojan horse  we build it and out
		pours the entire vegan army

					chairman of joint chiefs
		why even bother to risk personnel
		why not send some kind of doomsday
		machine  every time an emerging
		technological civilization announces
		itself by broadcasting radio waves
		into space they reply with a
		message  the civilization builds it
		and blows itself up  no
		expeditionary force needed

					ellie
		ms president this is communist
		paranoia right out of war of the
		worlds  there is no reason
		whatsoever to believe the etis
		intentions are hostile  we pose no
		threat to them  it would be like
		us going out of our way to destroy
		microbes on a beach in africa

					drumlin
		interesting analogy  and how guilty
		would we feel if we happened to
		destroy some microbes on a beach in
		africa

					kitz
			   turning to ellie
		i hope youre right doctor  but
		right now my job is to protect
		american lives from any plausible
		threat and in that regard i have to
		assume the worst

					richard rank
		from a nonsecular perspective im
		forced to agree

all heads turn to richard rank a surprisingly young and
wellspoken spokesman for the religious right

					rank
		my coalitions phone lines have been
		flooded with calls from concerned
		families wondering if this message
		signifies the end of the world or
		the advent of the rapture
			   smiles
		we feel that us policy in this
		matter wants to be extremely
		conservative  if theres any
		chance of danger or threat to our
		way of life perhaps the message and
		its contents should simply be
		disregarded

					ellie
		this is absurd

drumlin shoots her a warning look rank ignores her

					rank
		the bible states that god made man
		in his own image  from everything
		ive been told its highly unlikely
		the creatures who sent this message
		resemble human beings in any way
		shape or form ergo they are not of
		god and therefore by definition
		evil  my constituents simply want
		to know what their government plans
		to do to protect them 

					ellie
		ms president forgive me but i
		thought this was to be a serious
		discussion of policy and technical
		issues not a war council against
		satans minions 

					president lasker
		mr ranks organization represents
		the point of view of tens of
		millions of families dr arroway
		feel free to disagree but there
		wont be any suppressing of opinions
		here today

					ellie
		yes  of course  all im saying
		is this message was written in the
		language of science  mathematics
		 and was clearly intended to be
		received by scientists  if it had
		been religious in nature it should
		have taken the form of a burning
		bush or a booming voice from the
		sky

					joss os
		but a voice from the sky is just
		what you say youve found

palmer joss sits forward in his chair

					joss
		i agree with mr rank that there are
		unavoidable religious implications
		here  but i dont think it
		justifies taking an alarmist
		position  dr arroway is right 
		their chosen means of communication
		was a scientific one and a
		scientific approach is probably
		appropriate at least until the
		theological dimensions of the
		problem become more apparent

					ellie
		and where exactly does that put your
		position

					joss
		id have to say i dont know enough
		to have one yet  for the moment i
		dont believe the two approaches
		have to be mutually exclusive

ellie looks at him impressed in spite of herself

					president lasker
		whats the status of the decryption
		effort

					ellie
		well 

					drumlin
		were continuing around the clock
		but the amount of data is enormous
		its difficult to tell when well
		find the key that will tell us the
		machines purpose  maybe tomorrow
		maybe next year maybe never

					president lasker
		i want to know the minute you find
		anything

					drumlin
		of course ms president  well
		keep you fully informed

thats the cue most of the gathered begin to rise make
their way to the door  as ellie collects her things
drumlin accompanies her out  then starts to shut the
door behind her 

					drumlin
		the president wants to discuss a few
		matters in private

as ellie looks beyond she sees that kitz the chairman of
the joint chiefs and joss still remain

					ellie
		but 

but its too late  the door closes on the inner circle

int  national science museum  reception  night

captains of industry social editors minority leaders
at least for tonight scientists are the hottest show in
town

ellie stands with a group of dignitaries straining to
make small talk  as she glances up a familiar face
catches her eye  peter valerian

he looks up sees her too  a beat he whispers
something to the young woman hes standing with she looks
up too  they excuse themselves to drumlin make their way
over

					peter
		ellie

					ellie
		peter

peter extends his hand  they shake

					peter
		my wife laura

					ellielaura
		nice to meet you

					peter
			   an awkward pause
			    then
		you look wonderful

					ellie
		you dress up pretty good yourself
			   another awkward
			    silence
		hows the baby

					laura
		wonderful  shes almost four now

					ellie
		really  well  thats wonderful
			   a really horrible
			    silence
		well  if youll excuse me  im
		paid to mingle i dont believe i
		just said that

peter and laura laugh  some of the tension is diffused
some

					peter
		its good to see you ellie

					ellie
		you too

she manages a smile quickly hurries away

at the bar

ellie has never needed a drink more in her life

					ellie
		champagne please

					joss os
		make that two

ellie turns to find joss looking terrific in his tux

					joss
		want to fight some more

a long extremely complex pause then 

					ellie
		yes

int  another part of museum  night

their voices and footsteps echo as they walk past old
spacecraft  they sip their champagne

					joss
		 what im curious about are the
		wilderness years  youre out there
		all alone no money mocked by the
		skeptics  it must have taken
		tremendous faith

					ellie
		id say logic more than faith  the
		odds were on my side

					joss
		and what would you have done if the
		odds had gone against you

					ellie
		i guess i wouldve felt sorry for
		the universe

					joss
		spoken like a true believer

					ellie
		what about you  doesnt all of this
		shake your faith at all

					joss
		how do you mean

					ellie
		well its been a while but i dont
		recall the bible saying too much
		about alien civilizations

					joss
			   thinks then
		my fathers house has many
		mansions

					ellie
		very smooth  its palmer right
		where i came from a palmer was a
		person who cheated at cards
			   as joss laughs
		really though the bible describes
		a god who watches over one tiny
		world a few thousand years old  i
		look out there and see a universe of
		hundreds of billions of galaxies
		each with hundreds of billions of
		stars i mean burn me for a
		heretic but your god seems awfully
		small

joss looks at her  challenged intrigued  slowly

					joss
		who was it who said  it was a
		scientist i think  that ones
		sophistication is determined by the
		ability to tolerate paradox  to
		hold contradictory ideas at the same
		time

they approach a circular brass railing surrounding a
circular mosaic below at its center is a foucault
pendulum a basketballsized iron sphere suspended from
the ceiling  they lean on the railing

					joss
		 which i suppose is as good a
		definition of faith as any
			   getting an idea
			    smiles
		care to test yours

he takes her champagne glass sets it down on the floor
alongside his then climbs under the rail  at her
surprise 

					joss
		its okay  im a preacher

he offers her his hand  she takes it climbs under the
railing  joss helps her down into the circular space
below

					joss
		your faith tells you that the
		distance a pendulum swings from the
		vertical can never get bigger only
		smaller

					ellie
		thats not faith its physics  the
		second law of thermodynamics

joss places his arms around the metal ball and walks it
over to the outer rim of the circle right in front of
ellies nose

					joss
		and you believe this law with all
		your heart and soul

					ellie
		and mind yes  what are you 

					joss
		so if i let the pendulum go when it
		swings back you wouldnt flinch

ellie pauses  then almost curiously

					ellie
		no

joss lets go  we see the ball fall away and reach the
opposite railing  as it slows and then reverses direction
it appears to approach much faster than we expected

					joss
		dont lean forward  not even a
		hair

as it careens towards her the ball grows alarmingly in
size  we understand completely when the pendulum almost
reaches her and she instinctively moves  but ellie cant
believe it

					ellie
		i flinched

					joss
		only a tiny bit  even the most
		devout believer is allowed a little
		doubt

					ellie
		thats not doubt  thats four
		hundred years of science fighting a
		billion years of instinct
			   studying him
		i always wondered what you religious
		types did with your free time

					joss
		now you know

ext  national science museum  night

stars shine down as ellie and joss walk along the portico
the party continues inside  the mood is subdued
intimate

					joss
		 its an old story  i grew up in
		south boston more or less on the
		streets  by the time i was thirteen
		id tried my first hit of heroin by
		fifteen id stopped using but i was
		dealing fulltime  by the time i
		was nineteen i decided i didnt want
		to live any more at least not in a
		world like that  one day i got on a
		bus i got as far as ohio before my
		money ran out and after that i just
		kept walking  didnt eat didnt
		sleep just walked  i ended up
		collapsing in a wheat field  there
		was a storm i woke up
			   beat
		and thats about as far as wordsll
		go

					ellie
		can you try

					joss
		i had an experience  of
		belonging  of unconditional love
		and for the first time in my life i
		wasnt terrified and i wasnt
		alone

					ellie
			   delicately
		and theres no chance you had this
		experience simply because some part
		of you needed to have it

					joss
		look im a reasonable person and
		reasonably intelligent  but this
		experience went beyond both  for
		the first time i had to consider the
		possibility that intellect as
		wonderful as it is is not the only
		way of comprehending the universe
		that it was too small and inadequate
		a tool to deal with what it was
		faced with

					ellie
			   a beat then
			    softly
		you may not believe this but
		theres a part of me that wants more
		than anything to believe in your
		god  to believe that were all here
		for a purpose that all this
		means something  but its because
		that part of me wants it so badly
		that im so stubborn about making
		sure it isnt just selfdelusion
		of course i want to know god if
		there is one but it has to be
		real  unless i have proof how can i
		be sure

					joss
		do you love your parents

					ellie
			   startled
		i never knew my mother  my father
		died when i was nine

					joss
		did you love him

					ellie
			   softly
		yes  very much

					joss
		prove it

ellie stops and looks at him truly disarmed

and then inside a commotion is heard

int  national science museum  night

the party is suddenly and dramatically breaking up
senators on cellphones getting their coats  something
has happened  ellie finds drumlin in the chaos also on a
cellphone he hangs up as she approaches

					ellie
		what is it  whats happened

					drumlin
		weve cracked it  lunacharsky found
		it

					ellie
		you mean 

					drumlin
		you were right ellie  you were
		right all along

as ellie stares at him

ext  un plaza  day

media onlookers crowd control  and delegates from over
100 countries swarm as the world machine consortium is
called to session  tv lights and demonstrations  huge
banners read dont build satans chariot and who will
speak for earth

int  un general assembly hall

full house  from various headsets and monitors we hear
the polyphony of a hundred simultaneous translations  on
a large screen behind the secretary generals podium and
on monitors all over the darkened room we see a single
striking image  a human figure inside a rotating
dodecahedron

					secretary general

in the darkened hall we find the us delegation  kitz

		who will that person be  how will

we see it in her eyes  she wants to go more than
anything

int  un  later

an indian delegate concludes her remarks  in the audience
ellie deep in thought isnt paying attention

					indian delegate
		 of course none of us would be
		here if it werent for the scientist
		who first discovered the history
		making message and who has led this
		effort from the very beginning 
		dr eleanor arroway 

ellie

looks up in surprise  the applause grows becoming
deafening  people motion for her to stand  dazed she
does so  the ovation continues  ellie leans over to
speak into her mike

					ellie
		um thanks thanks very much
		im not sure what i did to earn that
		response i just happened to pick up
		the phone when they called

a big laugh more applause  ellie squints into the
lights

ext  un plaza  dusk

floodlights illuminate the building if anything there
are now more onlookers and media  the woman bbc reporter

		ellie

					ellie
		do you have a minute  

					drumlin
		actually im running late 

					ellie
		itll just take a moment

drumlin reluctantly stops ellie takes a deep breath

					ellie
		david i know weve had our
		differences but ive always
		thought of you as a fair man even
		when weve disagreed  and its in
		that light im hoping youll
		consider my request

					drumlin
		i dont understand

					ellie
		im asking for your help david  i
		want to go
			   quickly
		theyll need someone relatively
		young unattached  and probably a
		scientist  as the presidents
		science advisor you have enormous

		support my candidacy

					drumlin
			   slowly
		ellie you should know that im no

		advisor

					ellie
		what

					drumlin
		as of three oclock this afternoon
		i submitted my resignation

ellies eyes open wide as the depth of his betrayal dawns

					ellie
		you

					drumlin
			   hesitates then
		excuse me im late for a meeting

he turns and walks away leaving ellie to stare after him

					president lasker vo
		 and as our parents did a
		generation before us

int  un general assembly hall

packed to the rafters  president lasker makes the speech
of her lifetime her booming amplified voice going out to
the world

					president lasker
		 i believe we should dedicate
		ourselves by the end of this decade
		 to build this machine that our
		brothers from across the vastness of
		time and space have asked us to
		build  

in the darkened hall the american delegation sits
watching  push in on ellie  drumlin  the crowd roars

three apache helicopters

fly low over the endless texas landscape bluegray in the
light of predawn  below a convoy of military vehicles
moves down an empty road

					president lasker vo
		to meet with courage and
		determination the challenges of this
		new day  

the crowd roars louder in voice over

moving with the convoy

afs berets sit stonefaced barely visible  up ahead the
twinkling lights of an installation becomes visible

the convoy passes through a security gate in the first
perimeter  afs officers check id and cargo  as the
convoy continues our view begins to rise revealing three
more checkpoints beyond 

					president lasker vo
		to greet with hope the dawn of this
		new century

out view continues to climb revealing an immense sprawl
of lights and buildings  concentric electric fences
surround the rambling facility new roads are still being
added to old ones  encircling the installation is a vast
graveyard of discarded aircraft  the detritus of
twentieth century warmaking  and in the center of it all
lies an enormous open area its very emptiness full of
danger and promise  orange surveying flags ruffle in the
breeze

					president lasker vo
		and to raise our voices to the
		heavens as one world one people in
		one ringing defiant declaration 
		bring on the millennium

the roar of the crowd is deafening

the sun begins to rise over the new los alamos

int  observation facility machine texas  day

an enormous multitiered room bustling with activity  the
main floor consists of tables devoted to various
constituents of the international selection committee
each area devoted to a different discipline  medical
psychological philosophical religious
diplomaticpolitical and militarycommunications

the room is dominated by ten enormous overhead
viewscreens each monitoring the activity of one of the
ten machine candidates while also displaying telemetry
readouts of their vital signs  one candidate is
undergoing a psychological evaluation another is visible
via infrared camera in a sensory deprivation tank another
on a treadmill another sleeping eeg displayed we also
catch brief glimpses of ellie and drumlin  all are
watched with great interest by the committee members
swarming on the floor

a level above the floor and looking out over it through
large floor to ceiling windows is the pool media area a
group of reporters and camera crews allowed limited
access with bluebadged machine security carefully
monitoring their every word  as we move through the
maelstrom we come across a familiar face

					reporter
		im here with peter valerian
		recently named david drumlins
		replacement as science advisor to
		the president  doctor there were
		loud complaints from the
		international community last week
		when it was announced that three of
		the ten candidates  were to be
		americans  how do you defend that
		decision

					peter
			   a bit nervous
		i believe the response was somewhat
		disingenuous when it was determined
		that national interests would be
		represented on a pay for play basis
		it was understood that the us by
		shouldering close to one third of
		the financial burden would be
		entitled to commensurate
		representation

insert  tv monitor

					reporter vo
		youve addressed the political side
		of the coin but what about the
		larger issues  on what basis do you
		choose a human being to represent
		humanity

we begin to widen revealing our location in the back of a
news van crammed with broadcasting equipment  an
engineer monitors the signal

					peter vo
		its a good question  who do you
		send  an athlete  a religious
		leader  a philosopher  a soldier
		if you dont know what the olympic
		event will be you send a decathlon
		champion 

					reporter vo
		and if the event turns out to be
		chess

					peter vo
		yes well ultimately it was
		decided that the representative
		should be somebody fluent in the
		language the message was sent in 
		science  if youll excuse me    

we have continued to widen finally pulling out the back
of the van and craning up to reveal 

ext  media city machine texas  day

a vast encampment of vans tents reporters and satellite
dishes print and video journalists from every nation

competing twentyfoot high skyboxes from various networks
overlook the action  our view continues to climb until
finally in the distance wavy and hard to make out through
the long lens we can see a structure beginning to rise
our first glimpse of the machine

		just see the superstructure
		beginning to take shape

for drumlin its not quite that but he takes it
stoically

a flaxenhaired male candidate  the french semioticist

ellie seems to be enjoying her self tremendously

int  corridor  day

ellie drumlin and the eight other candidates several
still a bit wobbly follow the commander down a corridor
jeanclaude wipes his face with a towel as he sounds off

					jeanclaude
		you realize how absurd this is
		there are no precedents here all
		training models are useless  trying
		to turn us all into astronauts is a
		pathetic waste of time

the commander turns to him

					commander
		you know what sir  youre right
		we have no idea whatsoever what one
		of you may encounter  that leaves
		us with two options  we can sit
		around and do nothing and hope for
		the best even if that includes a
		few things that feel a little silly
		and if one of these silly
		exercises ends up saving your life
		ill have done my job

jeanclaude raises an amused eyebrow smokes his gauloise

flashes on the screen followed immediately by another and
another  a rapid series of images of creatures waving
grotesque stalked appendages horrific and bizarre

intercut with

the members of the philosophical committee watch make
notes argue passionately  the discussion continue on

					drumlin vo
			   on screen
		 two years is still a hell of a
		long time  and as far as we can
		tell there arent any provisions in
		the machine design for storing food
		water even air

					ellie
		 i cant believe they wouldnt
		take something as basic as our
		biological needs into account

					russian candidate
		based on what evidence  as far as
		we know all they know about us is
		what theyve learned from watching
		three minutes of german
		television even if they do not
		mean to do damage they may do so
		inadvertently  look at the impact
		theyve had on the world by simply
		sending the message

					ellie vo
			   on screen
		 were not looking at this from
		their point of view  its the first
		time this has happened to us but
		its highly unlikely thats true for
		them as well  chances are theyve
		been doing this for thousands if not
		millions of years

								    cut to

same  real time

					drumlin
		they knew our level of development
		if as you say theyve done this
		many times theyd be well aware of
		the implications

					ellie
		maybe they are  maybe this is all
		part of the package  the building
		of the machine has demanded
		international cooperation on an
		unprecedented scale  maybe
		requiring us to come together in
		this way was in effect part of the
		plan

					jeanclaude
		very well  assume this is true
		assume they have only the best of
		intentions  suppose they decide to
		just step in and solve all our
		problems for us  you have no
		objection to them so flagrantly
		intervening in human affairs

					ellie
		weve just lived through a century
		of incredible violence and self
		destruction  do you call it
		interventionist when you stop a
		toddler from walking in front of a

before anyone can reply an outofbreath assistant enters

		clear bay twelve 

we find ellie  drumlin and the rest huddled around a
large monitor  also present is team leader  cool
levelheaded solid  the ultimate line producer

					team leader
		this just came in from systems
		integrations in hokkaido

he presses play  the monitor shows a large apparently
empty lucite chamber  a clock showing tenths and
hundredths of a second is inset into the screen

					team leader
		the chamber contains an exotic
		substance manufactured according to
		message specifications  in its
		normal state it appears as you see
		it a transparent gas which is
		apparently breathable  as youll
		see it also has some other
		unusual properties

a japanese technician places his hand inside a waldo
picks up a revolver  he aims it into the chamber
fires 

 as then we see the bullet slow coming to a dead stop
in midair  we see the same thing again this time in
slow motion  as we watch the air in the chamber seems to
thicken around the bullet changing from a gas to liquid
from gellike colloidal to diamondhard solid in a tenth
of a second

					team leader
		the substance appears to have
		intelligent multiphasic properties
		able to shift states at will  we
		believe it may function as some sort
		of transport medium

					drumlin
		now i know why the japanese gave up
		having a candidate in exchange for
		licensing rights

					ellie
		how does it work

					team leader
		we have no idea  according to all
		known physical laws it shouldnt

					ellie
			   murmurs
		magic

					team leader
			   looks at her then
		what you havent seen is what
		occurred when a technician went into
		the chamber to retrieve the
		bullet as i said the substance
		had already been deemed breathable
		after extensive tests on laboratory
		animals

					drumlin
		what happened

the team leader pushes play  we see the action as he
describes it

					team leader
		there was apparently an aqueous
		residue covering part of the chamber
		floor  the technician slips  as he
		falls the substance hardens around
		him breaking his fall

we see the technician as his fall slows  and then he
suddenly convulses  and then stops suspended at an odd
angle slightly above the ground  he doesnt move  ellie
drumlin and the other candidates watch in horror

					team leader
		 and solidifying in his lungs and
		bloodstream killing him instantly

					ellie
			   shaken
		maybe maybe it was an anomalous
		reaction  maybe when its correctly
		integrated with other components of
		the machine

she looks again to the eerie sight of the suspended dead
technician  team leader snaps off the monitor

					team leader
		maybe  unfortunately thats all we
		have is maybes increasing
		exponentially every day  this
		machine is now building itself as
		much as were building it  almost
		as if its growing evolving

they all take this in then instinctively look out the
hanger doors at the structure taking shape in the field
beyond now rising to a height of twelve stories  we push
in on it

					team leader os
		its scary folks  were like
		cavemen building a nuclear warhead
		we are constructing the most
		advanced dangerously powerful
		whateveritis in the history of the
		planet and we dont have a fucking
		clue how were doing it

		15000 degrees isnt that a

					project leader
			   hesitates
		well sir the thinking was

a project official at the back of the room steps forward

					project leader
		the thinking was that even if the

		there still might be a chance to
		retrieve the helmet

					project official
		you have a question dr arroway

					ellie
		i question the thinking behind
		sending the first ambassador to
		another civilization in armed 
		basically announcing our intentions
		are hostile

					project official
		its designed purely as a defensive
		device  call it a reasonable
		precaution

					ellie
		call it xenophobic paranoia  dont
		you see the absolute absurdity of
		this  this isnt about them its
		about us  our violence our fear
		and mistrust 

					project official
		dr arroway you are entitled to
		your opinion  but we feel quite
		strongly that it would by both
		irresponsible and naive to send a
		human being into a completely
		unknown completely uncontrollable
		situation absolutely defenseless

					ellie
		yknow what  fine  i guess if we
		want them to know the truth about
		who we are theres no quicker way to
		show them

int  ellies quarters  predawn

ellie walks out of the bathroom in her robe brushing her
teeth  she sees an envelope slipped under the door  she
picks it up and opens it glances over the typed agenda
her eye comes to something that stops her

int  small briefing room

dark windowless a single lamp on  ellie waits at a
small table not sure what to expect

after a moment the door opens as a physician enters 50s
paternal

					physician
		good morning dr arroway

					ellie
		good morning

he sits down opposite her  looks her over for a moment
then carefully removes a small pillbox from his jacket
pocket  he opens it removes a small red pill and sets it
down on the table  ellie looks up at him

					physician
		weve been giving them to the
		astronauts since the first days of
		the mercury program of course its
		never been made public  its fast
		and painless  as soon as it hits
		the oral mucosa it starts to work 
		a matter of seconds really

int  monitoring room  day

joss and the other members of the committee all study
ellies reaction intently on the monitor  the same scene
is playing out simultaneously with the other nine
candidates on other monitors

					ellie vo
			   on monitor dryly
		you want me to travel all the way to
		vega to commit suicide

					physician vo
			   on monitor
		doctor despite your enduring faith
		that the civilization in question
		has only our best interests at
		heart even you have to admit
		theres a possibility they might
		turn out to be less than benign

back to room

					physician
		and even if they arent something
		else may go wrong  there may be an
		unforeseen mechanical failure  you
		may be marooned unable to return
		there are a thousand reasons we can
		think of for the occupant of the
		machine to have this with them 
		but mostly its for the reasons we
		cant think of

back to monitors

joss  watching  we leave him and onscreen ellie and move
to captain russells monitor  he is also looking at the

a beautiful meadow a trickling stream  ellie and joss
walk

					ellie
		so  is this kosher fraternizing
		with the enemy like this

					joss
		some of my best friends are

					ellie
		i was referring to the selectees
		mingling with the selectors

					joss
			   pausing
		some of my best friends are
		scientists
			   as ellie smiles
		theyre saying the machine is alive

					ellie
		not exactly  it has organic
		qualities but we dont really
		understand how theyre integrated
		with the mechanical systems

					joss
		maybe youre creating a monster

					ellie
		i dont think so

					joss
		why

					ellie
		its too elegant  the degree of
		economy is extraordinary its
		really the next logical step even
		on earth technology has always
		aspired to a condition of nature
		dna outclasses any computer we
		can come up with the human body is
		the most exquisitely designed
		machine imaginable

					joss
		in other words god is one hell of
		an engineer

					ellie
			   sideways smile
		in other words

they sit under a tree pick at the grass

					joss
		relativity  explain this to me one
		more time even if you traveled
		near the speed of light when you
		came back 

					ellie
		if you came back

					joss
			   after a beat
		if you came back youd only be
		four years older  but over 50
		years would have passed on earth

					ellie
		something like that

					joss
		and everybody you care about would
		be dead and buried

ellie looks up at him

					ellie
		if you came back  if you survived
		at all  which its pretty certain
		you wouldnt

					joss
		youre willing to die for this

					ellie
		its what my whole lifes been
		aimed at the only thing thats
		given it a sense of purpose

she looks away  a beat then

					ellie
		i read your book

					joss
		really

					ellie
		losing faith  the search for
		meaning in the age of reason
		catchy

					joss
		whatd you think

					ellie
		im more interested in the story
		behind the story how a young man
		goes from living on the streets of
		south boston to being the best
		selling media figure rubbing elbows
		with the president

					joss
			   after a pause
		i wont deny i was ambitious  when
		i had my experience i wanted
		to tell my story to as many people
		as possible  im the first to admit
		that process included making some
		compromises
			   still seems
			    troubled then
		you didnt answer my question

					ellie
		i thought it was wellwritten
		heartfelt  and a little bit
		naive but thats just the enemys
		perspective

					joss
		i dont consider you the enemy
		ellie  im not out to get
		technology  i only ask the
		question  does it have to have all
		the answers  i look out there and i
		see so much emptiness people are
		so starved for meaning and its
		something they just dont seem to be
		getting from science

					ellie
		did you ever stop to think that
		maybe that isnt sciences fault
		but meanings

					joss
		i dont follow

					ellie
			   quietly
		maybe the reason people are having
		trouble finding meaning isnt
		because science has obscured it
		maybe its just revealed it isnt
		there

now its joss turn to be disarmed  he looks at her
softly

					joss
		do you really believe your life is
		meaningless

					ellie
			   looking away
		i dont know  but as a scientist i
		have to consider that possibility

					joss
		and yet youre willing to die for
		this cause the one thing thats
		given your life a sense of purpose
		dont you see the contradiction
		here  

					ellie
		its getting late

					joss
		what are you so afraid of ellie

					joss
		youre shaking
			   fascinated
		youre the paradox here ellie  so
		incredibly brilliant and yet
			   softly
		what does it feel like to understand
		everything in the universe except
		yourself

she stares at him  joss instantly regretting his
words 

					joss
		ellie 

					ellie
		its late  we should go back

she stands and starts walking briskly down the hill

int  main auditorium machine texas  day

ellie is seated alone at a long table opposite the entire
isc  the atmosphere is formal and tense

					ellie
			   reading from her
			    notes
		 another question i would ask
		would be a very simple one  how did
		you do it  how did you evolve as
		far as you have and not destroy
		yourselves

					joss
		an excellent question doctor  but
		what if we dont like the answer

					ellie
		how do you mean

					joss
		what if their answer is oh thats
		easy  a thousand years ago our
		world was in terrible shape our
		population out of control violent
		crime no food so we called a
		general council and decided to
		eliminate the anitsocial  the
		weak  the sick  the unwanted  and
		ever since weve been doing great

					project official
		i think reverend joss raises an
		excellent point  i believe we
		should discuss the formation of a
		panel to review any potentially
		delicate communications before am
		i amusing you dr arroway

ellie is smiling grimly to herself shaking her head

					ellie
		you kill me you really do  the
		first truly global apolitical
		event in history and you cant wait
		to spin it

					project official
		how would you propose we handle it
		doctor

					ellie
		i guess id say i trust us enough to
		believe our response would be
		something to the effect of thanks
		for the advice but no thanks  but
		to dilute or censor the truth for
		whatever reason 

					project official
		nobody is proposing we censor the
		truth here doctor  were simply
		talking about putting a mechanism in
		place 

					ellie
		for managing the truth  but the
		truth wont be managed sir  it
		stops being the truth the moment you
		try

off joss 

same scene  later

ellie is making her final prepared remarks to the
committee

					ellie
		i dont claim to be a perfect
		example of the human species far
		from it  but i think paradoxically
		thats my strength as a candidate
		because i think we need to share the
		truth of who we are with them  our
		strengths 

her eyes suddenly fall on joss looking at her from his
seat on the panel  a timeless beat 

					ellie
		 and our weaknesses  to go to
		them openly nakedly and say these
		are our dreams these are our fears
		what im saying ladies and
		gentlemen is that i believe we
		should make this journey with
		honesty and integrity or not at all

the words are spoken with passion and conviction but
something tells us this isnt playing in peoria  ellie
looks uncertain

same scene  later

drumlin in the chair  reassuring smooth  statesman
like

					drumlin
		ladies and gentlemen i come to you
		today not only as a scientist but
		as a politician  an occupation
		for which i make no apologies
		with all due respect to doctor
		arroways talk of naked honesty and
		integrity  high ideals to be
		sure  i believe it would be
		foolish and in fact dangerous to
		ignore the fact that what we are
		dealing with here is a political
		situation  the most political of
		situations  and one that must be
		examined in that context

int  air force one 40000 feet  day

the president watching drumlin on closed circuit  an
aide hands her a cup of coffee  she sips it her eyes
never leaving the screen

					drumlin vo
			   on screen
		the image we put forth the
		impressions we give may determine
		precedent for decades if not
		millennia to come

back to auditorium  tight on drumlin

					drumlin
		we must be optimistic enough to hope
		for the best  and wise and
		experienced enough to prepare for
		the worst

a murmur of assent from the isc  drumlin continues

					drumlin
		ladies and gentlemen  im proud of
		what weve achieved as a species and
		a civilization  i would hate to see
		all that we stand for all that
		weve fought for for a thousand
		generations slighted taken
		advantage of or god forbid done in
		by the fact that at the final hour
		we chose to send a representative
		who didnt put our best interests
		first

ext  machine texas  dusk

ellie walks out  she stands looking at the machine in the
distance  it is almost complete the enormous gantries
partly obscuring the gigantic sphere that is the machines
outer benzel  another figure stands nearby smoking in
the shadows

					jeanclaude
		i am become death the destroyer of

			   takes a puff
		i wonder if this is how oppenheimer
		felt on the eve of the first abomb
		test

ellie steps closer  the frenchman smiles at ellie offers
her a cigarette  she shakes her head

					ellie
		id say this is slightly different

					jeanclaude
		perhaps  but on the offchance that
		it is a doomsday device of some
		kind i plan to be very far away
		from your lovely texas when it is
		activated

					ellie
		i thought you were here because you
		want to go

					jeanclaude
		i do  more than anything  but i am
		also a realist  soon this what
		is your charming term    dog and
		pony show will finally be over and
		i will go home

					kitz
		its not even close  arroway may be
		a good even great scientist but
		shes politically tonedeaf and a
		loose cannon  she leaked the
		message without so much as a nod to
		the dod or nsc and i dont
		think anybody here would say
		diplomacys her strong suit
		drumlin may not be as glamorous a
		choice but hes reliable
		patriotic sound  he has impeccable
		scientific credentials  and i think
		hed be perceived by the public as
		the safer choice

the president taps her cigarette turns to peter

					peter
		its her discovery ms president
		she deserves to go

the president frowns  turns to joss  slowly

					joss
		ive been watching and getting to
		know eleanor arroway for some time
		now and i can say unequivocally
		that i have never before met a human
		being with such extraordinary faith
		in humanity and in our right to a
		place of importance in the cosmos

peter watches joss as he speaks and as he listens we
hear too  theres more than simple admiration for ellie
in joss voice

					joss
		i believe that the person were
		selecting will play a crucial role
		in humanitys future  i believe
		that when this person comes back 
		if they come back  they will be
		seen as being anointed by a higher
		intelligence and may well emerge as
		one of the most important people on
		earth  it may be true that eleanor
		arroway is not a perfect human being
		 but i believe her honesty her
		purity and her integrity to be
		unimpeachable  ms president 
		arent those qualities that this
		representative should embody  are
		we seriously considering choosing a
		man who openly claims that he stands
		for nothing more than political
		selfinterest to be the one person
		to represent the human race

		ellie we both know that if i was

		more then anyone else on the planet
		shes earned this  and that she

red and blue stars orbit each other while a pair of
yellowgreen dwarfs orbit them

ellie swallows hard hyperventilating 

					ellie
		quadruple system incredible
		dont recognize any background
		constellations hundreds possibly
		thousands of light years from earth
		now  so beautiful  so

ellie growing woozy trying to snap out of it

					ellie
		the physics must be a thousand ten
		thousand years beyond us but oh
		god oh god somethings
		happening

ellie is overwhelmed with emotion  we think shes about
to cry but then she bursts out laughing 

					ellie
		its beautiful  its beautiful  i
		keep saying that but i cant my
		mind cant words shouldve
		sent a poet  im a poet and dont
		know it
			   sings
		ground control to major tom
			   struggling
		relativitistic sideeffect  or 
		induced by the transport medium
		the gas

now ellie is crying sobbing uncontrollably

					ellie
		oh palmer i wish id had a baby

the dodec plunges into another insideout sphere this one
larger and glowing blood red 


series of shots

a  a giant red star

    as it engulfs an earthlike planet  we watch the
    planets oceans boil away the surface chars sears
    dead 

b  supernova

    tidal waves of gas clouds rush away from the exploding
    sun  shock waves tumble debris at us  at the center
    of the cataclysm a rapidly rotating neutron star
    flashes like a lighthouse ten times a second

c  large blue gas giant

    circling an emerald green star  on the night side of
    the planet are huge glowing jellyfishlike shapes the
    floating cites of an alien civilization  millions of
    glowing gold particles connect them in elaborate
    swirling patterns a dance of golden glitter

d  last wormhole

    choked with multicolored pinprick flares  a sense of
    tremendous acceleration finally erupting into 

center of galaxy

so many dazzling multicolored stars they almost touch
millions more stars than are visible from earth on the
clearest night

an immense spiraling river of gas and dust millions of
miles long pours into the maw of a black hole of
staggering dimensions  flashes of radiation leap from the
center like summer lightning 

					ellie
		the center of the galaxy

the dodec suddenly rotates  swimming into our field of
view

galactic grand center station

it fills half the sky  a vast vast artificial planet
immeasurably immense liquid clouds drift in its
atmosphere punctuated by planetsize holes columns of
mist thousands of mile high

the dodec gently plunges into an atmosphere of blue night
below we can make out thousands of yellowlit openings in
the gellike surface each a different geometric shape

					ellie
		docking ports those are docking
		ports for other machines hi
		everybody

as the dodec continues to lower toward a hexagonal
receptor the panels grow opaque blocking out all light
ellie fights to remain conscious as it grows dimmer and
dimmer

					ellie
		now arriving grand central
		station floating down
		floating
			   like a little girl
		twinkle twinkle little star
		how i wonder ellemenopee
			   shaking her head
		 have to stay awake stay
		awake
			   slipping
		please please

she passes out

								    fade to black

in black

nothing  still nothing  finally a gentle familiar
sound

fade in

ellie

lies in a fetal position  after a long moment she opens
her eyes  the familiar rhythmic sound is louder  her
eyes widen

ext  beach  dawn

ellie sits up on a pristine white beach  huge ranges of
cumulus lit redgold by the dawn silhouette clusters of
palm trees the sound of gently rolling surf squawking
gulls

ellie stands  the dodec is nowhere to be seen  she looks
around in disbelief

she takes a few halting steps like a child learning to
walk  she kneels scoops up some sand  frowns in
confusion

ellie digs her hand into the sea almost loses her balance
again  she tastes the water  normal  her confusion
grows

					ellie
		i remember this

she steps further into the water letting its warmth
soothe her wipes the furrows from her brow  closes her
eyes as she lets the water take her

ext  beach  later

the sun is higher now  the surf crashes

					ellie os
		recording check check
		recording is this on  i think this
		is on

ellie sits against a palm tree looking out at the sea
she seems a little more cogent

					ellie
		okay  ive traveled thirty thousand
		light years give or take a few
		parsecs to go to the beach  so
		either theyve created this
		environment or the illusion of
		this environment to make me feel at
		home or else somehow i am at home
		 or else this is my cage at the
		intergalactic zoo and the tour bus
		will be along any minute

a distant figure becomes visible down the beach  as it
approaches ellie continues unaware

					ellie
		or else of course im completely
		insane  this should not be
		discounted as a possibility 
		although the fact that im
		questioning my sanity should be a
		pretty good indication that i am in
		fact sane unless of course
		unless

ellie stops as if sensing something  the figure grows
closer now clearly humanoid  ellie turns to look 

 and stares in utter disbelief  she rises to her
feet

ellies pov

ted arroway is walking easily toward her  he smiles

					ted
		morning captain

ellie

tears come to her eyes she approaches staring he
takes her hand 

					ted
		ive missed you

its too much  ellie throws herself into his arms holds
him tight

					ellie
		dad

she sobs  he holds her

					ted
		its okay

ellie recovers a bit wiping away her tears 

					ellie
		i used i used to dream you were
		alive and then id wake up and
		lose you all over again

					ted
		im sorry i couldnt be there for
		you sweetheart

					ellie
		dad but tell me how did i
		mean how can

reality returns like a cloud passing over the sun
softly

					ellie
		youre not real  none of this is

					ted
			   smiles sadly
		thats my scientist

					ellie
			   struggling to
			    breathe
		so  are you an hallucination  or
		are little gear trains and circuit
		boards under your skin

					ted
		am i artifact or dream  you might
		ask that about anything

					ellie
		but youre so i mean how could
		you possibly
			   realizing
		when i was unconscious  you
		downloaded my thoughts my
		memories even
			   realizing
		this beach  ive never been here
		but i remember its how i always
		imagined
			   softly
		pensacola

					ted
		we thought this might make things a
		little easier

and in the blink of an eye they are no longer standing on
a beach but on the rim of the grand canyon looking out at
a spectacular sunset

					ted
		 although this is nice too

ellie tries hard to swallow her amazement as ted begins to
stroll along the rim she walks with him

					ellie
		so who  what  are you

					ted
		originally just another species like
		yourselves  well not like you at
		all actually but

					ellie
		can you show me

					ted
		small moves captain small moves

					ellie
		why did you contact us

					ted
		you contacted us  we were simply
		listening  weve been listening for
		millions of years

					ellie
		and those other docking ports i
		saw i mean there are others

					ted
		many others

					ellie
		and they all travel here through
		this wormhole subway system you
		built

					ted
		oh we didnt build it  the transit
		system has been in place for
		billions of years were just its
		caretakers

					ellie
		so who

					ted
		we dont know  whoever they were
		they were gone long before we ever
		got here

					ellie
		the scale its just
			   catching her breath
		so all the civilizations you detect
		they all end up coming here

					ted
		not all  some choose to stay at
		home and dream their dreams
			   sadly
		some never make it this far

					ellie
		so we passed some kind of test

					ted
		you have your mothers hands
			   beat
		there are no tests ellie  we dont
		sit in judgment  think of us more
		as librarians  curators of the
		universes rarest and most valuable
		creation

and now they are walking through a familiar forest
sunlight streams through the tall trees

					ted
		as many civilizations as weve
		found compared to the vastness of
		space

he seems momentarily overcome with a terrible sadness
and then he recovers smiles

					ted
		 life is unspeakably rare  so
		whenever we do find another
		civilization especially one
		thats struggling we send a
		message  sometimes we can offer
		help  sometimes we cant  but we
		always try  life is simply too
		precious not to

					ellie
		can you help us

ted hesitates  they are now standing in the middle of a
vast alien desert stretching to the horizon  the dome of
the sky darkens revealing a view from outside the galaxy
the milky way hangs like a pinwheel in the blackness of
intergalactic night

					ted
		youre an interesting species an
		interesting mix  capable of such
		exquisite dreams such horrifying
		nightmares  technologically youve
		advanced very quickly  some think
		too quickly and yet

close on ted

he turns to ellie puts a loving hand to her face
softly

					ted
		youre so lost  so cut off and
		so sad

and suddenly ellie is standing on the sundappled cal tech
campus  she turns to find herself standing opposite david
drumlin

					drumlin
		what is it that makes you so lonely
		miss arroway

ellie stares at him  instinctively backs away turning
around 

 to find herself high atop the radio dish at arecibo
looking into peter valerians face 

					peter
		be honest el  the truth is you
		really dont want the company

peter shakes his head  then begins to melt morph into
palmer joss 

					joss
		what does it feel like to understand
		everything in the universe except
		yourself

 the texas meadow instantly dissolves behind him to
become the darkness of the hokkaido night 

					joss
		ellie there is no reason you have
		to be alone

ellie stares at him he slowly morphs back into ted as he
and the space around them become infused with an unearthly
golden light his voice echoing and resonating into
infinity 

					ted
		we are alone  for millions of years
		weve searched the cosmos and
		after all the suffering after all
		the chaos and desolation of the void
		 the one thing weve found that
		makes the emptiness bearable is each
		other  thats why i sent the
		message  thats why i made contact

ellie moves closer staring into his eyes and catches a
glimpse of infinity  she holds her breath 

					ellie
			   whispers
		who are you

we begin to move through them into 

another dimension

					ted
			   reading her mind
		am i one or many

					ellie
		the librarian or the library

we are lost inside an unimaginable realm an infinity of
nested realities turning inside and within each other in a
staggering visual paradox that dazzles and overwhelms
that builds and soars until 

 the soft crashing of the surf

ellie is back standing with her father on a perfect beach
in the glow of twilight  a gentle breeze blows  ellis is
overcome

					ellie
		 all those voices you gather
		them all together  millions of
		intelligences in one consciousness
		and now were a part of it

					ted
		you always have been  were all
		descendants of the same stars
		ellie  all made of the same
		primordial atoms

					ellie
			   overwhelmed
		so  what happens now

					ted
		now you go home

					ellie
			   instinctively like
			    a child
		no
			   as ted smiles
		i mean why so soon

					ted
		if we dont engineer a consistent
		causality itll work itself out on
		its own and thats almost always
		worse
			   seeing her
			    confusion
		ellie according to your physics
		none of this is possible  a lot of
		it youre simply not capable of
		understanding not yet  no offense

					ellie
		none taken but  do we get to
		come back  others of my kind i
		mean

he tenderly brushes a stray lock of hair behind her ear

					ted
		eventually youll get here on your
		own  this was just the first step
		in time youll take another

					ellie
		but  other people from our planet
		should see what ive seen  they
		should witness this for themselves

					ted
		that isnt the way it works

					ellie
		but you said you wanted to help 
		dont you see what it would mean

					ted
			   gently
		no more stalling captain

					ellie
			   intensely
		please  if you downloaded
		everything about us you know the
		problems we face the impact it
		could have  it could make the
		difference 

					ted
		ellie this is the way its been
		done for billions of years

she looks at him pleadingly and as the part of him that
is her father look into his daughters eyes he
hesitates 

					ted
		 but well consider your request

a breeze blows stronger now

					ted
		its time to go home now

					ellie
		no  please

					ted
			   smiles sadly
		childhood is over ellie  its time
		to grow up

a whoosh of air  ellie spins around 

the dodec sits incongruously on the beach

she turns back  ted has vanished

					ellie
		no

and as ellie finally and fully mourns her lost father we
leave her crying alone on an empty beach 30000 light
years from home

								    fade to black

fade in

ext  machine hokkaido  night

the hum dies as the benzels slowly come to rest

ellie emerges from the machine  her expression composed
the opening solidifies behind her 

 and then we hear a sudden burst of static followed by
a cacophonous barrage of voices  ellie instinctively
puts her hands to her helmet 

					controller vo
			   filtered
		 got her

					peter vo

		thank god  when we lost contact i

					peter vo

		its all right the important thing

					peter vo

		what day

					ellie
		how long was i gone

int  command control  continuous action

peter stands at the command console just as we left him

					peter
		ellie we saw you enter the
		machine  the benzels spun up
		generating some sort of atmospheric
		disturbance  the benzels spun down
		and then just now you stepped
		out  we were out of radio contact
		exactly seven minutes and thirty
		five seconds  the machine never
		went anywhere

int  medical bunker  immediately following

a team of physicians examine ellie hooked up to various
medical equipment 

					doctor
		are you experiencing any flulike
		symptoms  aching joints  fever

					ellie
		im fine 

					doctor
		headaches  swollen glands

					ellie
		no  could somebody please just 

the doctor checks a series of monitors turns to an
official

					doctor
		vitals identical to prelaunch

					another scientist
		no sign of radiation or biological
		contamination of any kind  shes
		clean

peter enters the room briefly confers with the official
 then approaches ellie who sighs in grateful relief

					ellie
		peter what is going on  has
		everyone gone completely insane

					peter
		thats one way of putting it  kitz
		the president the isc have shut
		down all official communications
		thereve also been reports of riots
		flaring up across the us and
		europe  until we figure out what
		went wrong things may get rough
		especially for you 

					ellie
		but the machine worked  thats

		everyone
			   in utter
			    frustration
		the tape  its all there if

			   seeing peters grim
			    look
		 the tape

and as ellie realizes with sickening certainty 

								    cut to

staticfilled monitor

colored snow  nothing


int  debriefing room

kitz turns off the monitor turns to ellie still in her
hospital gown and robe  peter stands nearby as do a
group of frighteningly expressionless isc and pentagon
officials

					ellie
		 i dont understand it  all i
		can think is that maybe because the
		video gear wasnt accounted for in
		the original plans it somehow
		violated the integrity of the
		design

					kitz
		is that your official response

					ellie
		i dont have an official response
		michael  all i have are the same
		questions you have

kitz pauses and then he turns to her his intensity
increasing as we push in on him 

					kitz
		im afraid thats not a satisfactory
		answer doctor  we spent two
		trillion dollars  you walked into
		that machine with the hopes and
		prayers of an entire planet with
		you and you stepped out with
		nothing  those people are going to
		want more than idle speculation and
		conjecture  theyre going to want
		answers  and i hope for all our
		sakes you can come up with them

ext  machine hokkaido  night

ellie surrounded by a phalanx of security moves quickly
through the nightmarish mob scene  disorienting tv lights
glare illuminating a flurry of drift snow 

as ellie is hustled toward a van she glimpses a figure 
an oasis of stillness in the mob watching her  joss
their eyes meet for the briefest of moments  and then
ellie is swept into the van and away  joss watches her go
 looks at the chaos the madness around him  then
slowly looks up to the sky 

								    dissolve to

ext  washington dc

a hard rain falls  we find a government sedan follow it
through burnedout slums

		i have mr kitz for you ms

the sedan approaches the capitol building  the steps are
mobbed with a surreal menagerie of the fanatical and the
dispossessed  a huge bonfire has been built images of
ellie on the cross

					kitz vo
		 as have all attempts at internal
		analysis  weve tried sonargrams

int  oval office  continuous action  day

the rain pours down  the president slowly hangs up the
phone

int  sedan  continuous action

ellie looks out the window at the mob descending on the
car all fighting desperately to catch a glimpse of her 
faces filled with hope hate desperation  ellie shrinks
back 

int  senate anteroom  day

the clock ticking on the wall reads five to nine

ellie sits alone in the small room  waiting

a knock on the door  ellie looks up nervously 

palmer joss stands in the doorway  a moment and then
ellie slowly rises and goes to him  embraces him  he
holds her

					joss
		oh ellie

ellie finally pulling away wiping her eyes

					ellie
		hi

					joss
		hi

					ellie
		im assuming you read my deposition

					joss
		it was quite a page turner

					ellie
		pretty ironic huh  i had to go all
		the way to the center of the
		galaxy just to find you

she takes his hand kisses it  he touches her face

the clock ticks

					ellie
		so  im assuming they sent you here
		to administer last rites

					joss
		im not sure its come to that

					ellie
		they dont believe me

					joss
		i do

					ellie
		youre sure you want to  in the
		universe i saw were not exactly the
		stars of the show  what happened to
		me makes us all seem pretty damn
		small

					joss
		it also makes god enormous  i think
		of the scope of your universe
		ellie and it takes my breath
		away  as it will everyone elses

					ellie
		i dont have any proof palmer

					joss
		ellie youre the proof  you tell
		them your story  ultimately theyll
		have no choice but to believe you

					ellie
		its not enough dont you
		understand  i know it happened 
		but by every standard of science by
		every standard ive lived my life by
		that fact is utterly beside the
		point  it may be true but it
		doesnt matter because i cant prove
		its real

					joss
		ellie the only one holding you to
		that standard is you  the people
		want to hear your story they need
		to hear it

					ellie
		but 

					joss
		have you seen whats happening out
		there  the terror the despair
		the world is on fire ellie  people
		need something they can believe in
		something worthy and you can give
		it to them

					ellie
		i want to palmer  more than
		anything  but it has to be real
		it has to be true

					joss
			   hesitates
		ellie if you go out there like
		this  if you admit to even the
		possibility that what you
		experienced didnt actually happen
		 im afraid they really will
		crucify you  please  for your own
		sake for the sake of the world
		tell them what you know to be the
		truth  tell them it really
		happened

ellie looks up at him  and then the door opens and an
aide enters

					aide
		theyre ready for you

int  us senate

every corner of the cavernous senate chamber is jammed
with media politicians onlookers  the world stage  the
big show

the international committee is composed of eight men and
two women including kitz  occupying the center seat is
the committee chairman an asian american senator in his
sixties

sitting all by herself at a long table opposite them
ellie looks very small and alone

					senator
		you were in the machine for seven
		minutes thirtyfive seconds is
		that correct doctor

					ellie
		earth time yes

					senator
			   pausing
		earth time

					ellie
			   a deep breath
		senator i believe i traveled
		through a series of wormholes
		wormholes are a phenomenon deduced
		by einstein theyre essentially
		tears in the fabric of spacetime
		because of the effects of relativity
		what i experienced as a period of
		approximately eighteen hours passed
		almost instantaneously on earth  to
		you i seemed to depart and arrive
		back at the same moment

					kitz
		doctor isnt it true that wormholes
		are merely predictions of relativity
		theory  that theres no evidence
		they actually exist

ellie hesitates  looks up at joss in the gallery  then

					ellie
		there is no direct evidence no

					kitz
		and current theory holds that to
		sustain the sort of wormholes youre
		talking about even for a fraction
		of a second would require more
		energy than our sun produces in a
		year is that correct

					ellie
		i dont have the figures in front of
		me but yes that sounds about
		right

					kitz
		in fact by all the laws of physics
		we know what you claim to have
		experienced is simply impossible

					ellie
			   beat then softly
		by our standards yes

palmer joss sitting in the gallery closes his eyes

same scene  later

the chairman flips slowly through a file as he questions
ellie

					chairman
		 and this is how the
		extraterrestrial presented himself
		to you  as your father

					ellie
		yes sir

					chairman
		he died
			   looks at file
		 in 1972

					ellie
		yes sir

					chairman
			   pausing
		dr arroway do you think its
		possible you had some kind of
		delusional episode

joss leans forward in his chair

					ellie
		is it possible

					chairman
		all the elements are there  a
		woman orphaned young under a great
		deal of stress  the failure of a
		project shes staked her selfworth
		and very sense of identity on 
		induces a fantasy of reuniting with
		her father in heaven as it were
		is it possible

ellie is silent

					kitz
		please answer the question doctor

					ellie
			   a long silence
		is it possible  yes  but 

					kitz
		thank you doctor  now 

					ellie
			   overriding him
		 but i dont believe it to be the
		truth

					chairman
			   peering at her
			    intrigued
		you dont believe it to be tell
		me something doctor  why do you
		think they would go to all this
		trouble bring you tens of
		thousands of light years and then
		send you home without a shred of
		proof  sort of bad form wouldnt
		you say  what was their intent

					ellie
			   hesitates
		i dont know  ultimately their
		motives may be as incomprehensible
		as their technology

the crowd murmurs  committee members exchange glances

					chairman
			   sigh
		dr arroway you come before us with
		no evidence  no records no
		artifacts  only a story that  to
		put i mildly  strains credibility
		over two trillion dollars was spent
		hundreds of lives were lost many
		more may be in jeopardy due to the
		almost incalculable worldwide
		psychological impact are you
		going to sit there and tell us that
		we should simply take this all on
		faith

the word rings out like a shot  silence

					kitz
		answer the question doctor  as a
		scientist  can you prove any of
		this

joss

holding his breath

ellie

closes her eyes  finally almost inaudibly

					ellie
		no

the room is silent  almost gently

					kitz
		so why dont you admit what by your
		own standards must be the truth
		that this experience simply didnt
		happen

					ellie
			   pauses then
			    simply
		because i cant

the crowd reacts

ellie looks up to the gallery and finds joss

as she speaks with great emotion and restraint she seems
to be talking directly to him

					ellie
		i had an experience  i cant
		prove it  i cant even explain it
		all i can tell you is that
		everything i know as a human being
		everything i am  tells me that it
		was real

the room grows quiet

					ellie
			   softly
		i was given something wonderful
		something that changed me  a vision
		of the universe that made it
		overwhelmingly clear just how tiny
		and insignificant  and at the same
		time how rare and precious we all
		are  a vision that tells us we
		belong to something greater than
		ourselves that were not  that
		none of us  is alone

joss

moved beyond words

ellie

looks lovingly at palmer then shifts her gaze to
michael kitz  softly

					ellie
		i wish i could share it  i wish
		everyone if only for a moment 
		could feel that sense of awe and
		humility and hope  that
		continues to be my wish

the emotion in her voice compels the room to silence

kitz

joss

ellie

int  capitol building  corridor  night

spilling out reporters closing in  as kitz emerges he
sees ellie  she meets his gaze

a moment and then he nods walks briskly off  ellie
turns  to find joss standing by the door waiting for
her  a timeless moment

 and then she silently crosses to him and lets him fold
her into his arms

ext  capitol building  night

the rain lashes down unabated  a sea of press crushing in
on ellie and joss as they grimly make their way through
police clearing the way  a zealot intones in the bg 

					zealot
		 he dreamed and behold a
		ladder was set up on the earth and
		the top of it reached to heaven
		surely the lord is in this place
		and i knew it not  this is none
		other but the house of god

as ellie moves through the crowd people in wheelchairs
fight to approach people with terrible deformities 
they call to her

					people
		ellie bless me ellie heal
		me

ellie torn between wanting to help these suffering souls
and not wanting to lie whispers

					ellie
		im sorry im sorry

and then the reporters descend shouting out questions 
one in particular rings out 

					reporter
		reverend joss do you think the
		failure of the machine is gods
		rebuke to science

joss stops  he turns to the crowd slowly

					joss
		as a person of faith i am bound
		by a different covenant than dr
		arroway  but i believe our goal is
		one and the same  the pursuit of
		the truth  i think today dr
		arroway continued that pursuit under
		the most trying of conditions

he puts his arm around ellie and hurries away  the
crowds the media watch as the messiah who failed
disappears into the rainy night

series of shots

a  hokkaido

    the entombment of the machine has begun  scaffolding

		 but it is a good question and i
		suppose ill always wonder about the
		answer  why would they send me back
		without proof

					joss
		maybe what you experienced cant be
		reduced to images on a videotape
		maybe they still plan to grant your
		request only in their own way in
		their own time or maybe its just
		like you said  ultimately their
		motives may be as incomprehensible
		as their technology

					ellie
		in other words god works in
		mysterious ways

					joss
			   smiles
		in other words

they stop look out at the water

					ellie
		i dont know  if it was a god it
		was searching for a greater one  it
		was still searching for meaning

					joss
		does that mean you think it doesnt
		exist

					ellie
		im not sure
			   looking up
		maybe it simply exists in the search
		for it  maybe its something we have
		to make for ourselves

					joss
		meaning

					ellie
		something my dad  they  said
		after all the suffering after all
		the desolation of the void  the
		one thing that makes the vastness
		tolerable is each other
			   looking up at joss
		the one thing that makes it bearable
		is love

she takes his hand and then they look up at the sky
where the first stars are coming out

		 and while the riots here in
		london continue for the fourth night
		in a row on the other side of the
		atlantic the news is equally grim

					reporter 1 vo
			   overlapping
		 thousands of starving refugees
		fled the area as the bloody fighting
		continued

					reporter 2 vo
		 a massive book burning took
		place in downtown berlin today

					reporter 3 vo
		 and on this last night of the
		old millennium and the eve of the
		new one looking back on a past
		racked by violence and chaos we of
		the human race look ahead to an
		uncertain future  a future which
		at least for now seems to promise
		only more of the same

ext  hokkaido machine  dusk

the machine stands entombed silent inscrutable

all is still

then the first sign  small insects crawl from cracks in
the pavement

a stirring  a slight breeze  a subtle humming sound 

a monk stirs in his bed in the nearby monastery if not
awakened by the strange vibration then by the shrieking
monkeys outside

a vibration  something is happening at the core of the
concrete edifice  it begins to crack 

from inside comes a sound a terrible otherworldly
roar 

the next transformation has begun

from two miles out at sea

the island of hokkaido is shrouded by an ominous
microclimate a vortex out of which radiates an awful
vibration like the shockwave of a bomb  a japanese
fisherman smoking a cigarette on his shrimpboat looks up
in awe

machine

is lifting spinning  dissolving into itself  leaving
only the vortex of a prodigious wormhole 

downtown tokyo

a thousand neon signs go dark  new years revelers look up
in fear

ext  san diego zoo  night

and the keepers have never known the animals to be so
disturbed

virginia suburb

peter valerian steps out of his front door and stares up
at the sky  his wife joins him he silently puts his arm
around her 

washington office

michael kitz turns to look out the window at the dc
skyline  fear on his face as he looks down at a picture
of his family wife and two kids 

balkans

guerrillas look up at the terrifying sky as the gunfire
dies

on serengeti

stampeding wildebeest wheel around seemingly to form a
vast circle

somewhere in pacific

great swirling pod of dolphin swim in a frenzied circle

india

a circle of dung beetles in the dust

earth

from haddens darkened viewport  the land obscured by a
rapidly growing cloud that fills the ecosphere

ellie and joss

stand outside a lakeside cabin transfixed

a wind picks up  grows stronger

a deep rumbling sound felt more than heard  a sound too
vast to be any sound at all  the wind grows stronger
the lightning crackles flushing birds from trees 

and then everything becomes perfectly still  the
rumbling stops 

 a deafening silence  then 


soundless concussion of violet light

high over times square  kitzs office  a solitary
farmhouse under the nebraska sky  downtown tokyo  a
lonely freighter in the middle of the pacific 
everywhere 

ext  earth orbit  250 miles up

looking toward the earth past the deserted mir station 
the brilliant violet flash 

egypt

the valley of the kings  the faces of the long dead
pharaohs bathed in the violet light

sahara

children stare up in wonder at the same light

time squarepiccadilly circus

people stand frozen in awe

washington dc

at the lincoln memorial the great man looks down as the
homeless crawl out from their cardboard shelters bathed
in the brilliant light

ellie and joss

stare up at the sky at an impossible view

it is the view from the center of the galaxy  through the
mouth of the enormous wormhole we can see the machine
returning to grand central station as a dazzling aurora
borealis fills the sky 

various shots  all over the world

all over the world faces of every race and ethnicity stare
up at a billion blazing multicolored suns lighting up the
heavens brighter than the brightest day

the citizens of the earth look up and wonder as the chimes
of midnight ring out all over the world 

ellie

her eyes filled with tears of wonder and joy smiles
shes found what shes been searching for

			   bring on the millennium
