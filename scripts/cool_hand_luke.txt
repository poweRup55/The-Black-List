               with chain link the door from the barracks up to the compound 
               passes a small area enclosed by a woven metal strap cage in 
               this usually sits the wicker man whom we generally see as a 
               heavy short shape moving about his own business which is 
               making an endless series of rings or jewelry by hammering 
               coins with the back of a heavy spoon

               the door to the barracks locks by the tongue of a strap iron 
               bar that is thrust through a hole in the wicker where the 
               wicker man locks it by padlock thus he can always see them 
               but they cant reach him the single big room is filled with 
               two and even threetiered bunks bare bulbs hang from the 
               ceiling

               man and camera in following him shows us the room at the 
               same time the wicker man is moving about the barracks 
               tapping the floors and bunk posts with a broom handle for 
               signs of tampering carr pays no attention to him addressing 
               the newmeat

               mightily attempting to bring the axe over his head and down 
               on the chains

               luke severs the chain from one shackle ben appears with an 
               armload of spices

               he moves off toward the trucks with the turtle and we hold 
               on the disappointed reactions of the men featuring dragline

               then there is the sound of a motor starting

               on the group new angle

               as they turn to look as one man

               the truck

               as luke tries to get it in gear there is the sound of gears 
               grinding and as the truck begins to move the bed of the dump 
               body begins to raise the truck begins to move past the 
               prisoners away from the guards

               on the guards

               as they begin to run toward the truck raising their guns

               on dragline

               on his feet

               he starts to run like hell toward the truck coming past

               angle on guards

               stopping to fire but bullets ricochet off the rising bed of 
               the dump body

               moving shot paralleling truck

               dragline running alongside trying to grab the door handle 
               inside luke grinning fiercely as he drives shots sounding 
               dragline gets hold of the door swings inside hold and pan 
               the truck off down the road until all we can see is the steel 
               dump body

               reverse the road

               it is littered with tools and equipment dumped from the truck

               him still smiling as he is pushed into the captains car

               luke int the car

               as it begins to move out in the bg across the road we see 
               the negro villagers watching silently the window of the 
               car is up and the reflections on the glass make luke already 
               dim a little distant

               moving shot the car dawn

               as it moves down the road over the trestle it is the mystic 
               hour of dawn the suns rays just diffusing as we watch the 
               car until it disappears over the rise in the road

               ext road close on yoyo day

               the yoyo is swinging in the sun as the shot widens we see 
               it is dragline wearing chains wielding the yoyo and now we 
               see the others working around him godfrey is gone boss 
               paul is now the walking boss the music gains strength and 
               speeds as

               dragline works with strong certain grace and determination 
               and the others also seem more vital and free as imperceptibly 
               the camera pulls back and rises slowly to

               helicopter shot

               as the men grow smaller in the limitless field of gold 
               stretching in all directions as far as the eye can see 
               intersected by four roads that reach out to infinity now 
               the men are specks now invisible in the fields and there 
               are only the roads lines in the gold going on forever 
               over this superimpose the picture of luke now scotchtaped 
               together hold and

                                                                  fade out
