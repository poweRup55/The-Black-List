	the hall is full  on the stage dr helen hudson is
	speaking  helen is a forensic psychologist  behind her is
	a projected diagram predisposition dissociation trauma
	fantasy violent fantasy facilitators murder and
	traumareinforcement which she can point to with a laser
	pointing device  we see her from a considerable
	distance the back of the balcony  her voice is crisp and
	assured

				helen
		our society creates these socially
		and psychically disenfranchised
		men and their revenge on society
		is terrible  they are hard to
		catch  they are the nice guy next
		door their employers  if they
		work at all  find them quiet and
		uncomplaining  early abuse and
		rejection have taught them
		passivity  only in their violent
		fantasies do they feel alive  what
		they seek in their frenzied
		assaults on their victims is relief
		from passivity  for these men ten
		minutes relief is worth far more
		than the life of another human
		being  torture the pain they
		inflict the screams of the victim
		are all part of the ritual that
		gives them a brief respite from
		their own psychic pain  and then
		the depression the forgetting the
		feeling of sadness and despair
		begins the cycle all over again
		like addicts seeking their drug
		albert desalvo bianchi and buono
		berkowitz dahmer bundy  they
		seek out their next victim

	during the second half of this speech the eye of the camera
	has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
	balcony railing

	closeup helen

				helen
		the cycle is endless until they are
		caught  and they are caught by
		chance  they run a red light and
		a body is in the trunk  a leaking	
		pipe brings a plumber to a basement
		where they is the smell of death

	her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
	the balcony her voice chokes off  she stares

	helens pov

	sitting in the front row of the balcony a young redheaded
	man daryll lee cullum leans forward resting his tattooed
	arms on the railing  he smiles intimately at helen

	helen cuts her eyes to the left  she sees

	backstage an overweight cop in plain clothes  instantly
	alert to helens alarm he jumps up comes within an inch of
	exposing his presence to the audience  a second cop in the
	wings on the other side of the stage also springs to
	attention  first cops eyes follow helens

	their pov  the balcony  young redheaded man is no longer
	there

	helen  can she believe her eyes  resumes

				helen
		at any time right now as you
		listen the fbi estimates there are
		30 to 35 serial killers stalking
		their victims  the serial killer is
		a plaque that must be addressed not
		only by the law but by science
		florida spent eight million dollars
		to execute ted bundy  it would
		have been better spent building a
		forensic penal facility devoted to
		research

	once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
	that the smiling man is not there

				helen
		confined for life without parole
		and subjected to scientific study
		these mens lives might finally in
		some small measure educate and
		thereby protect society  thank
		you

	applause as helen warily checks for the two cops  they are
	carefully casing the crowd

								cut to

	later

	the crowd is breaking up  first cop walks helen to the
	ladies room  people reach to shake helens hand she copes 
	as well as she can with her fear  they leave the stage
	through a door opening to a corridor leading back to
	dressing rooms and a ladies room

								cut to

	int ladies room  day

	the cop clearly embarrassed pokes his head in and looks
	around  under one stall he sees a womans high heels  he
	hastily ducks back into hall and signals an okay to helen
	before the door behind her closes we see the cop prepare to
	stand guard outside  helen walks past the stall with the
	high heels to a stall several doors down

	close up high heels

	and a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
	ankles  the shoes are kicked off  the feet disappear from
	view as

	helen a few stalls away methodically places toilet paper
	around the seat before raising her skirt  a faint noise
	makes her freeze  her hand reaches for the door  she is
	just able to unlock it but no more before a noise comes
	down from the next stall

	like a lariat it falls over helens head and is violently
	yanked tight  she kicks at the stall door

	corridor cop leaning against outside door smoking hears
	the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open he
	reacts

	int ladies room  continued

	the redheaded man is struggling to secure the rope around a
	hook inside his own stall  knocking os

				cop os
		doctor hudson  are you okay in
		there

	the man lets slip a little slack

	helens fingers thrusting between the rope and her neck
	get just enough air for helen to let out a strangled little
	scream

	corridor cop not certain what to do about the ambiguous
	sounds from inside  women stands nearby inhibiting him for
	a split second from going in the ladies room door  now
	there is more sound from inside

	int ladies room  continuous

	cop steps into the room gun down  over the cops shoulder
	we see helen hanging in open booth her hand fluttering at
	her throat  she has one slippery shoeless foot on the
	toilet seat

	cop takes a couple of steps forward  behind cops back we
	see a broom closet door opening

	helens pov close up the cop taken from behind  in a
	second his throat is slit  in a gush of  blood he falls
	his gun still in his hand

	redheaded man standing over the fallen cop smiling at
	helen

	cops body is twitching jerking  the violent contractions
	in his fingers cause the gun to go off one two shots
	the sound reverberating against the tile walls

	stage area

	the audience and second cop react to the gunshots
	helen her eyes bulging struggling against the rope

								slam cut

	int helens apt  san francisco  night

	as helen in bed bolts up from the nightmare her hands try
	desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck  she is now
	pale her hair is dirty there are deep circles under her
	eyes  this is a woman in the throes of a breakdown

				helen
		andy  andy

	she races through this loft apartment the walls are eight
	feet under a twelvefoot ceiling to study opening off a
	hall  she looks in gasping for breathing

	int study  continuous

	the room is neat  nobody there  we will later see that it
	is used on and off by her computer andy

	helen whimpers in frustration she is alone  she talks to
	herself as she turns back and moves past a living room
	where she turns on lights and the tv flicks on court tv
	the sound comes up loud she moves on trying to calm
	herself with the sound of her own voice

				helen
		it is october twelfth 1994 in the
		city of san francisco california
		usa the strongest richest
		most stable and happiest country in
		the world  that is the sole place
		of life in the universe  under
		god

	close xanax bottle  two pills are shaken out into a palm
	others scattering from the nervous haste

	close helen  watching herself in bathroom mirror as she
	tosses down the pills gulps water  she regards her haggard
	reflection with a certain detachment

				helen
		good god  what happened to you

	she barks a rueful laugh we are seeing a woman will
	herself from nearhysteria to relative calm

								cut to

	hall  as she exits the bathroom  and moves into her office
	she pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers
	of the sidebyside computer screens one is blank  the
	other shows a chess setup  flashing on the bottom of the
	screen comes a command

				chessmaster
		its almost seven  make a goddam
		move

	she studies the chess setup for a moment then makes a
	move  she has not even hit the keyboard of the other
	computer before chessmaster sends another message

				chessmaster
		lousy move  not really into this
		game helen  lets drop it  ive
		got a feeling about you  lets
		meet  like a date

	helen types the following to chessmaster

				helen
		im a terrible date  id mess up your
		life

				chessmaster
		another romantic dream gone all to
		hell

				helen
		maybe its better to just dream
		on avoid the disappointments of
		life  come on move

	she pushes a button on the remote and we see the window
	curtains open  bright sunlight streams in  we see that the
	tshirt helen wears says shrinks r us  she crosses to
	the window with her glass of cognac looks out

	view

	a sweeping view of the bay and across to marin county  the
	morning sun is dispelling the last of the nights fog
	helen opens window puts a hand outside trying tofeelthe
	air the freedom  feeling quite restored from the dream
	horror of the night

	os the phone rings  helen  a frisson

	close phone  her hand comes into frame and picks up the
	handset and carries camera to closeup helen

				helen

	over credits

	home movie of a young woman dressed in a seat suit  it is
	morning and she is jogging on a park path  her hair is in
	a long braid  she is sweating breathing heavily clearly
	near the end of a satisfactory run

	the film reverses the film starts up again in extremely
	slow motion  we are now aware there is another point of view
	at work here

	now the frame freezes at a point where it makes the joggers
	openmouthed deep breathing look like

	a scream

	end title and credits

	int rifle range  day

	muzzle of semi automatic pistol blasts nine shots almost
	directly into camera  a beat of silence

	the target it is a silhouette of a mans head and torso
	centered in the right side of the upper chest near the
	shoulder is a small red circle  still smoking the holes
	from the bullets are scattered all over the chest and none
	in the circle

				mj vo
		my third grade teacher at the
		convent shot better than that

	the shooter ruben goetz and partner mj

				ruben
		yeah but she had divine guidance

	we now take in the shooter ruben and his companion mj
	halloran  mj is a small deceptively vulnerable looking
	young woman  she is neat buttoned down crisp  mj
	appears to be about twentyfive  she is in fact
	thirtyfour and a homicide inspector with the rank of
	sergeant  she is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
	sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
	even smaller and younger than she is

	ruben goetz is also in homicide about twentysix and junior
	in authority to mj  ruben is goodlooking goodhumored
	and laid back  he has a cellular phone attached to his
	belt

	mj pulls the line that dollies the target back to them
	and ruben replaces it with another as they talk

				mj
		id feel a wholelotsafer with
		sister loretta for my backup  look
		at this guy you shredded him

				ruben
		well hes dead he cant hurt me
		now

	the target is rigged they pull the line that dollies it back 
	to shooting position

				mj
		its sloppy shooting  its in
		character ruben but unnecessary
		and bad for your career

	ruben lets off three quick shots they cluster nearer the
	circle  mj looks at him in surprise

				ruben
		ive been practicing  now can i
		kiss your tummy

	mj hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn

				mj
		perps holding a hostage the

		day

	he hits the end button

				mj
		you hit the brachial nerve

	she fires  the shots make a perfect heart around the circle
	inside his looser pattern  one final shot strikes exactly
	in the middle

				mj
		youre good enough youll never
		have to kill anyone  i joined the
		cops to save lives not waste them

				ruben
		you know mj when i watch you
		shoot i realize ive got a little
		problem with my stance could you

		legs

	he slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be
	she is unloading her weapon

				mj

		you told your shrink about that

	she is unloading and cleaning up  ruben doing the same

				ruben
		i tell my shrink aboutyou

	same walk she took at the beginning and suddenly at the
	door to the ladies room she seems to see the fat cop  she
	shakes her head and the vision is gone

	replaced by int ladies room  the cop is now held from
	behind by daryll lee  smiling at helen  in reverse we see
	for the first time that helen has the rope well away from
	her neck  we realize she has ample time to warn the cop
	but she is paralyzed fascinated by what is happening in
	terribleslow motionintercuts between daryll lee grinning
	at her helens helpless horror the cops appealing look to
	her and back to daryll lee as below the frame he slits the
	cops throat and lets him fall to the floor

	helen flashback at last begins to scream

	close helen present recovering  she hasnt screamed at
	all  she pulls rubens gun from her pocket and shoves open
	the door into the ladies room

	as the door opens  the lights are on it is brilliant
	blinding in here  she steps in  there is a sound that
	draws her round her gun coming up back of the door is the
	broom closet she fires two rounds into the closet door
	it springs open and mops and pails fall thunderously out
	onto the tile floor

	she whirls to cover her back faces the stalls

	ext saks roadblock  night

	they react to echoes of the gunfire

				swat
		oh man  let us in there

				saks
		go  go  go

	men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows
	toward the auditorium

	int ladies room

	helen moves along the stalls pushing doors open  until she
	shoves one open and sees

	mj is hanging by a noose dangling the same way helen did
	in the opening sequence  she is alive holding the noose
	from her neck by one hand

	helen starts to rush to her assistance when the lights go
	out  peter takes her from behind swiftly disarming her
	regarding the gun with amazement

				peter
		you cheated  you said youd come
		die with me

	without pause he pumps two bullets into mj where she
	hangs  her body jumps from the impact of the bullets her
	head flies back and she slumps the noose tightens the door
	of the stall swings slowly shut as peter turns on helen
	where she lies on the floor horrorstruck

	ext auditorium  night

	with efficiency and caution fbi swat types move toward the
	auditorium  a grappling hook is thrown high over the roof
	they prepare for an assault  a helicopter swoops in bathing
	the scene in its brilliant light

	int auditorium stage  night

	peter has helen on the stage where chairs are randomly
	scattered and pushed her to a seat facing him almost knee
	to knee helen will use her psychological wiles to try to
	take away peters control of the situation peter looks up
	at the sound he is proud and thrilled

				peter
		listen to them  well be on all
		three channels

				helen
		kill me peter do it now

				peter
		no  not yet

				helen
		do it  if thats what all this
		carnage is about then do it  have
		enough guts to do it

				peter
		dont talk to me about courage  i
		know death what its like to kill
		youre not a killer  you watched
		daryll lee kill that cop and you
		didnt make a peep because you
		were paralyzed with fear  you
		chocked  i know somethingelseabout
		you

	peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy he pops a
	pill into his mouth and swallows

				peter
		you want one  no  there was
		something in you that was
		fascinated that wanted to see what
	it was like for a man to die
		everybody feels it  like every
		person who slows to see a bad
		accident or runs to see a fire
		thats true  i see it in you
		youre the same as me

	there is noise outside like someone breaking in

				peter
		oh no

	he grabs her and she moves with him without resistance as
	he turns out the lights inside

	floodlights suddenly illuminate the facade outside
	increasing the brilliance of the light streaming in and
	darkening the shadows further  german expressionism

	he leads her back to the stage he pushes her into a chair
	facing him he looks into her face and smiles

				peter
		well keep talking  until they get
		here  then
			smiles

				helen
		i have no life anymore  i ruined
		your life make me pay for it

				peter
		why did you do that  didnt you
		have any idea how hard it was for
		me to get that far  i worshipped
		you  you inspired me  i thought
		you could understand me the way you
		understood the others  i knew that
		about you  the ones you admired
		were the great murderers they
		fascinated you

				helen
		thats not who i admire  i admire
		people who are good at what they
		do great artists writers
		thinkers

				peter
		i dont have the talent for any of
		those things  all i have a talent
		for is death  and i am one of a
		kind  what do you think of your
		student now  i have made you
		famous i am your creation and your
		monument

	behind him a shadowy figure darts from hiding spot to a
	vantage point we cant make out the figure helen sees
	but peter does not

				helen
		if you let me i can make you more
		famous than any of them

				peter
		oh please  i know whats coming
		now  let me help you

				helen
		do anything you want to me  i give
		myself to you  only put the knife
		down  isnt this what you always
		wanted  i know its what we all
		want to love and to loved  i
		could love you  you could work
		together in some safe place learn
		to really understand you help you
		give you some peace of mind some
		happiness

				peter
		back in the drivers seat again
		doctor  that old dream  study us
		to see what makes us sick  so you
		can find a cure  theyd name it
		after you  death is the only cure
		for people like me

	he leans toward her with the knife  this might be the
	moment  his gun lies on the floor beside him

	her eyes have flicked to the shadow behind him he sees it
	and stoops to pick up the gun and fires into the shadows
	two or three quick rounds  he turns back to helen dropping
	the gun to reach for the knife

	helen head butts him with astonishing strength knocking him
	backward  she stands he comes up with gun and aims at
	her

	behind him mj steps out of the shadows having now a clean
	shot

	helen doesnt give a clue just looks into peters eyes as
	mj and peter in slow motion details as she lines up her
	shot she could kill him or go for the exposed shoulder

				helen
		do it  for gods sakenow

	mj fires

	peter is spun away from helen by the impact stands there
	shaking with the shock of the hit he stares at her

				peter
			surprised like a
			 child
		you hurt me

	mj holds her gun on him ready to shoot again but he just
	goes down on one knee his body violently shuddering as

	there is a huge sound of breaking glass and then an enormous
	explosion that throws them to the ground

	the big front doors are blasted open and the flak vested
	swat team swarms through smoke from the concussion
	grenade swirls in the chiaroscuro of floodlights and
	shadows

	out of the smoke come skimasked swat men

				mj  helen
		no

	peter turns to the swat team offering himself as the women
	scream to the swat mens wounded and harmless

	a pattern of red dots from laser beam sights on the swat
	team rifles dapple peters head and torso

	swat team

	like a firing squad the team fires

	peters body flies through the air from the impact and
	slides sprawling across the stage to a stop

							cut to

	int auditorium  later

	mj sits as paramedic gently pull off her shirt and the
	bullet proof vest that saved her life

				mj
		jesus that hurts  you think the
		rib is busted

				paramedic
		that looks like just a bad bruise
		ill tape it up if you want to

				mj
		ill take some tylenol and codeine
		instead how about a lot of number
		six

	the medic turns to his medicine bag  cops swarm around
	them  helen sits down next to mj  mj begins to put on
	her shirt wincing at the movement  helen helps her

				mj
			it hurts
		oh god

	saks and quinn emerge through the chiaroscuro of smoke and
	light and shadow  when mj sees him she takes out her gun
	and hands it to him  it is what he expects but she
	misunderstands  she is offering it to him as her
	resignation from the cops  he takes it only as a part of
	officer related shooting routine  she looks into his face
	as he smells the muzzle knows she fires it approved

				quinn
		ill take it kid  you take two
		weeks paid leave  dont waste a
		second thinking about that shitbag
		then come back  youre a cop mj

	he nods to helen

				quinn contd

		statement tonight

				quinn
		no she can come in tomorrow
		gonna want to know a lot of
		things

	bg the cops have pulled peters body by the feet letting
	him bumpity bumpity bumpity down the steps from the stage
	and lifted him onto a gurney  the body is wheeled past
	them as

				helen
		the only one who could tell you
		what you really need to know is
		dead

				quinn
		yeah its a thought

	of no importance to him he turns away

	int auditorium  night

	in the lobby area between the auditorium proper and the big
	exterior doors now the worse for wear from the concussion
	grenades  outside through the glass we see a media circus
	under the bright lights put up for the assault  mj and
	helen squint against the light and turn

	the auditorium pov

	the cops and technicians are working away at one side is a
	small door  easy escape  they run toward it

	ext mccluskey auditorium  night

	it is dark where they step out into the night  around the
	corner of the building we see the light from the media
	circus  then helen steps off down into the dark campus
	mj looks at her realizing helen is no longer afraid
	she catches up to her  hold on their backs as they walk
	away

				mj

		know that  you better get somebody
		to drive you home

				helen
		why cant i drive home  i will

	the two women continue down toward helens car just outside
	the circle of media  camera rises and rises to a high full
	shot

	the mouth and the haircut spot them and race toward them
