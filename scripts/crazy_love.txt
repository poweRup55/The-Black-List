          fade in

          int bedroom  apartment  day

          the sweet silence of slumber suddenly an alarm clock on a
          nightstand shrieks the operatic tones of maria callas

          a wellmanicured hand nails painted pink slaps the snooze
          button and mutes maria a few seconds reprieve

          then another clock stationed on a dresser broadcasts the
          fortissimo pounding of the william tell overture toes
          also painted pink swing out of bed and run to the dresser

          letty mayer late 20s and beautiful turns off the music
          she opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
          arranged by color from white to beige to black behind the
          panties are rows of bras also organized by color letty
          pulls out some taupe undergarments checks them against her
          nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties

          letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored pink linen
          suit she lays it on the bed beast her cat jumps on the
          bed and settles into the jacket letty swoops the animal off
          her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit

                              letty
                     listen beast what have i told
                     you about linen

          the scolding is cut short by an urge overkill song that
          screams out from another room on cue letty heads down the
          hall dressing as she goes she clucks for beast to follow

          int kitchen  same

          letty turns off the alarm clock that blasts urge overkill
          from the counter and checks the time against her watch

          she swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food
          arranged by type seafood on the left chicken in the
          middle then naturally beef letty reaches for a can

                              letty
                        looking at beast
                     its liver saute

          letty considers the cat a moment and chooses another can

                              letty

                     fine then chicken in gravy but
                     youre going to have to eat the
                     liver tomorrow

          int bathroom  same

          letty puts the finishing touches on her makeup and pulls
          back her hair plastering an errant curl into place with hair
          spray yet another alarm clock sounds this time blaring the
          voice of shock jocks mark and brian

          int entry hall  same

          letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock which is
          mounted near the front door she bends down to kiss the cat
          goodbye grabs a briefcase and leaves

          ext hallway  chasen elementary school  day

          a school bell buzzes gradeschoolers clutching lunch
          pails scurry past letty who stands outside an office door
          she straightens her jacket takes a deep breath and starts to
          turn the handle

          letty is stopped cold when chandra 7 the victim of a bloody
          nose runs up to her bawling

                              chandra
                    miss mayer miss mayer

          letty looks quickly at chandra her watch the door

                              letty
                        to chandra

          she bends down and pushes back chandras head chandra off
          balance places one very bloody hand on lettys jacket lapel
          staining it for all eternity

          letty grimacing takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and
          guides chandra down the hall coaxing the child as she goes

                              letty

          the door bursts open letty stumbles into the room she
          clutches her briefcase to her chest trying to cover her
          bloodsmeared lapel

                    like the program

          ruth stares around the restaurant a shiteating grin
          plastered across her face

                              letty

                              letty
                    well my theory is that people can
                    really enjoy math but they lose
                    interest

          ruth cant hold it a moment longer without bursting

                              ruth

          mrs mayers eyes immediately fill with tears ruth leaps up
          and hugs her mother other diners glance toward the table

          one woman in the restaurant taps the side of her glass with
          her fork and raises a silent toast to ruth other diners
          follow suit ruth grins back and starts to giggle

          mrs mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin

                        to letty
                    can you believe it

          ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse
          she slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of letty and
          her mother who peers at it with approval

                              letty

          and the students look toward the window

          its ruth shes been crying   she waves to letty    chandra

          letty puts up her finger to signal just a minute to ruth

          ext hallway  chasen elementary school  same

                              ruth

          letty looks again at the classroom where the students are
          lobbing the turtle back and forth

                              letty

          int classroom  same

          letty strides into the classroom pulls the turtle away from
          bobby and drops it in the trash

                              letty

          zach approaches the board and begins to write i am    he
          doesnt get any further before letty cuts him off

                              letty
                    neater zach

          zach begins again but letty stops him when he reaches am

                              letty
                    zach you know the line by the a
                    has to come straight down or it
                    looks like an o

          zach looks back toward his classmates for help

                              letty
                    whats wrong zach

          letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an a she
          erases it furiously and works at it until the a is perfect

                              letty
                    try again zach    like that

          letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk zach freezes
          he sees lettys shoes her arm her contorted face and
          above all else that perfect a staring right back down at
          him

          letty grips zachs arm guiding the chalk to form what looks
          like a pretty good a

                              letty

                    i dont believe it    you still

                    to college on ok

          lettys fingers press into zachs arm a tear slides
          ominously down his cheek

                              letty
                    it has to be good zach   do you
                    understand me

          zach wrests free of letty hes in full cry now he backs
          away stumbles then makes a run for his seat bobby
          snickers at zachs misfortune other children glance around
          unsure confused

          letty looks vacantly at the children stares at the board and
          looks at the children again

          she sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands
          lettys fists clenched at first slowly relax she takes a
          deep breath and raises her head

                              letty
                    im very very sorry zach

          zach continues to cry letty looks down at her desk she
          grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste

                              letty

          letty jumps up she slaps the paper on the wall with some
          paste she motions for the students to join her

          the children slowly approach her zach lags behind

                              letty

                              paul
                    of course it will remember the
                    big talent show you planned last
                    year and what about the christmas
                    benefit when santa canceled at the
                    last minute but you still pulled
                    it off

                              letty

                    you just need to get more
                    organized l

                              letty

                    maybe

                              paul
                    lets make a list of the things you
                    need to do ok

          letty nods her head and paul grabs a legal pad from his
          briefcase

          int classroom  chasen elementary school  night

          mr and mrs anderson overeager parents sit across the
          desk from letty who stares at the legal pad in her lap as
          the andersons talk letty twists a lock of hair tighter and
          tighter

                              mrs anderson
                    so at home weve started our own
                    little library for chandra

                              mr anderson
                    we thought it would be a good
                    project for her to set up her own
                    cardcatalogue

                              letty

                    i see

          letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her
          hair

                              mrs anderson
                    but what im wondering is whether
                    we should also be spending more
                    time on her computer skills at
                    home what do you think

                              letty
                    well

                              mr anderson

                              mrs anderson
                    and she went on and on about the
                    collage that seems very
                    inventive miss mayer

          letty stares blankly at the couple

                              mr anderson
                    miss mayer

          int living room  lettys apartment  night

          the room is a mess of scattered papers and the math twister
          game letty sits on the ground crying she makes a pyramid
          out of the waddedup tissues that surround her

          int bridal shop  day

          the upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots
          of signs announcing sale day frenzied women pick through
          dresses as pachelbels canon plays in the background

          letty is wedged into a corner sipping coffee a clerk
          approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries

                              clerk
                    more coffee

                        rooting through the tray
                    no more bear claws left

          ruth bounces into the shop

                              clerk

                        to ruth
                    danish

                    oh no thanks im too excited to
                    eat

          the clerk gives ruth an approving smile as letty rips into a
          sweet roll ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns

                              ruth
                        to letty

                              letty
                    she said shed be here at 10

          ruth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up

                              ruth
                    what do you think of this one

          ruth looks closer at letty

                              ruth
                    have you been crying    your eyes
                    are all puffy

          letty selfconsciously touches her eyes

                    things have been kind of stressful
                    lately

                              ruth
                    but everythings ok

          ruth is trying on a veil at this point

                              letty
                    yeah everythings under control

                              ruth

          letty sighs moves to the racks and pulls out a dress

                              letty
                    you better start trying on before
                    the vultures get all the good ones

          int dressing room  later

          ruth twirls around in a taffeta gown as letty picks up
          discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up

                              ruth
                    what about this one

          a bedraggled letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at
          dresses they are bumped and jostled from all sides

          letty emerges from the dressing room

          the doorbell rings letty greets her father a mid 50s
          business type and his wife monica a younger version of
          lettys mother

                              letty

          the two mrs mayers make appropriate murmurs lettys
          parents stare each other down ruth shifts from foot to foot
          silence falls in the room with a thump

                              letty
                    dad mother youve met before

          ruth takes a dramatic gulp of air the evening hangs in the
          balance finally

                    from your father letty

          uncomfortable silence falls on the party monica wipes the
          edge of mr mayers mouth with her napkin

                              letty
                    ruths narrowed the dress hunt down

                    i remember how hard it was looking
                    for my dress i must have been to

          fleck rise from the olives then swim to the tops of the
          glasses

          dr emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding
          chairs michael who sits next to emlee practices rolling a
          quarter back and forth across his fingers

          letty sits across from michael and emlee her legs and arms
          crossed tightly the group concentrates on mrs hallstrom

                              mrs hallstrom
                    i cant stop thinking about the
                    things i did wrong when my daughter
                    was little

                              dr emlee
                    and hows that make you feel

                    experiments at stanford back in the
                    70s

                              marie
                    we really miss doing things with
                    you mrs hallstrom

          michael sitting next to mrs hallstrom squeezes her arm

                              mrs hallstrom
                    maybe when i hit my manic phase
                    again

          group members smile

                              john
                    ive noticed letty doesnt much
                    like to do things with us

          the group looks expectantly at letty

                              letty
                    oh no of course i do

                              john
                    then why are you so defensive

                              michael
                        to john
                    i dont think we need to sacrifice
                    letty to pep up a slow session

                              john

                        to michael
                    youre the one who told everyone
                    about her panties

          michael grimaces at john   lettys head is bent down

                              dr emlee
                    maybe youd like to share some of
                    your feelings about ocd or
                    depression with us letty

          letty eyes the doctor   shes dangerously close to tears

                              letty
                    do we have to talk about this

                              dr emlee
                    i think in the spirit of group
                    therapy its beneficial for each
                    of us to open ourselves up to the
                    others

          michael reaches his hand behind dr emlees head catching
          lettys eye in the process michael pulls a silver dollar out
          of emlees ear

          letty looks but doesnt respond the other patients ignore
          michael emlee is oblivious

                              dr emlee
                    you never know letty how the
                    person sitting next to you may be
                    able to shed light on one of your
                    problems

          michael goes for a bigger trick reaching again behind the
          doctors head he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers
          letty almost against her will smiles

                              dr emlee
                    by revealing something thats
                    going on in his or her own life

          michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctors
          head lettys smile broadens

                              dr emlee

                        responding to her smile
                    there now i knew youd feel
                    better once we discussed group
                    process lets talk a little about
                    your ocd

          and moves away michael sidles up next to her

                              michael
                    looking for a romance

          michael reaches behind letty she pulls away he produces a
          scarf from behind her back and presents it to her she
          doesnt take it

                              letty
                    you keep the book   im looking for

                    hey if you take the magic book
                    ill feel like maybe you accept my
                    apology and dont hate me anymore

          letty hesitates

                              letty
                    i havent heard an apology

          michael drops to one knee

          letty takes the book from him and walks away

          int rec room  hillview psychiatric hospital  day

          letty sits in an arm chair staring out at the garden her
          attention is drawn to a nearby couch where michael sits
          opposite mrs hallstrom apparently playing cards

          michael lays a card down

                              michael
                    mrs hallstrom im pretty sure you
                    could use that

          she shakes her head slowly back and forth   michael places it
          in her hand of cards

                              michael

          dickinsons poetry letty picks it up runs her hand over
          the cover and starts reading

          overlooking the garden paul pulls up a chair for letty and
          stares out at the scenery

                              paul
                    i think we need to talk about some
                    things

                              letty
                    yes i suppose so

                              paul
                    this has been really difficult
                    this whole thing
                              more

                              paulcontd
                    these past few weeks its made me
                    really go back and examine our
                    whole relationship
                        beat
                    i mean weve been going out for

                              paul
                    especially this last year

                              letty
                        softly
                    especially now

                              paul
                    so ive been thinking a lot

                              letty

                    i have too paul

                              paul
                    i talked to ruth a little bit and
                    i think its about time

                              letty
                    i know we cant just keep going
                    through the motions

                              paul
                    exactly its time to make
                    decisions

                              letty
                    you dont have to say anything
                    else ive known for a while that

          paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on
          lettys finger she stares at it mesmerized

                              paul
                    i had to smuggle it in here i

                    emeralds around it but this was
                    simpler more classic in its lines

                     i think its a problem that you
                     never told me about michael i had
                     to hear it from another patient

                              letty
                     i couldnt really say anything

                     well letty this does present a

                     im a grown woman dr emlee   i
                     can take care of myself

                              dr emlee
                     what about michael do you know
                     the extent of his

                              letty
                     i know michaels a schizophrenic
                     and mrs hallstroms manic
                     depressive and john lockyer has
                     episodes of psychosis and i heard
                     a rumor that you suffer from
                     delusions of grandeur

                              dr emlee
                     go ahead and put the guard back up
                     letty but you need to know what
                     youre dealing with

                              letty
                     i dont need a lecture   i care
                     about michael

                              dr emlee
                     then thats even more reason to
                     listen look schizophrenics tend
                     to withdraw from reality they
                     experience emotional disturbances
                     that result in personality changes
                              more

                              dr emleecontd
                        beat
                    you could be lying next to michael
                    in bed one night and he could have
                    a hallucination or a delusion it
                    might happen when youre driving
                    or

                              letty
                    look i know hes almost through
                    with treatment here and hes on
                    medication

                              dr emlee
                    drugs can help suppress symptoms
                    but lots of patients stop taking
                    them when theyre on their own
                    because the side effects are so
                    harsh
                        beat
                    and michaels condition is often
                    worsened by periods of stress hes
                    been in and out of

                              letty

                    whats best for you really think

                        beat
                    when i was 18 my mom came home and
                    found me sitting naked on the
                    kitchen table i thought i was god

                              letty
                    sure but i took out a whole
                    grocery store

                    everyones crazy to some extent

                              michael
                    my grandma rosa says that some
                    trees get planted in rich top soil
                    and they grow right up to the sun
                    tall and straight other trees
                    they start as seeds in the crevices
                    between rocks so they have to twist
                    and bend to reach the light
                        beat
                    but even though they end up
                    crooked theyre still trees just
                    like the straight ones

          lying on their backs michael and letty stare up at the
          leaves overhead

                              michael
                        with a start
                    why in the world did you let me
                    start talking in metaphors thats
                    no way for us to break up

                              letty
                    break up    they wish

          stocking cap she starts to dispense erasers

                    whats she doing

          mrs hallstrom practically skipping zeros in on grandma

                    mrs hallstrom join us please

          but by this point mrs hallstroms already bounded away
          divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered
          parents and delighted children

          she clambers onto a table in the middle of the room marie
          gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help

                              mrs hallstrom

          michael pushes back his chair   hes trapped between the
          table and the wall

                              mrs hallstrom
                    my goodness its so very warm in
                    here so warm

          she takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking
          man but she doesnt stop there with haphazard abandon she
          begins to disrobe first her blouse then her skirt

                              mrs hallstrom

                    way way way too warm for

                    bells jingle bells jingle all the
                    way

          the group looks on in horror mesmerized by her behavior
          then almost as one the patients spring into action

          michael bolts over his dining table and runs to mrs
          hallstrom he jumps onto her table trying to restrain the
          dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her

          by this time john thomas and letty have surrounded her in a
          protective enclave michael sets mrs hallstrom on the
          ground she looks up at the group and continues belting out
          jingle bells

          int linen closet  hillview psychiatric hospital  night

                              principal gail

                    i didnt have any choice but to
                    include the parents letters in
                    your file

                              letty
                    well i understand     i know my
                    behavior was poor

                              principal gail
                    so in light of how the parents
                    feel and the fact the students are
                    doing so well with the substitute
                    i dont think i can put you back in
                    the classroom just yet

                              letty
                    look gail ive been a good
                    teacher

                    i know letty but the incident
                    with zach was frightening for the
                    children
                        beat
                    now if youd come to me explained

                              letty
                    ive already thought about how to
                    tell the kids where i was

          letty hands the principal a letter

                              letty

                    this letter of explanation with
                    your support i think they can
                    accept me

          the principal reads the letter

                              principal gail
                    its a very nice letter but i
                    have to go with whats best for the
                    students

                              letty
                    what does that mean
