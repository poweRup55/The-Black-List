     ext house  night

     a wealthy neighborhood of paris off the champs elysees large
     homes line the secluded street we see the silhouette of a man in
     a peugeot we move in closer to see raymond gayet 30s waits
     nervously

     int dark room  night

     dark daniel foray lights his zippo lighter he is late 30s
     tall handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the
     flame beside him is julien labesse 30s hyper daniel places
     the lighter on a small table and moves over to a painting on the
     wall daniel stops at one removes a pen knife and starts to cut
     the canvas from the frame
     daniel rolls up the canvas

                         daniel
               lets go

     julien starts to pick up the zippo

                         daniel

               be careful its

     too late julien has already picked it up it burns his hand ans
     he flicks it away it flies through the air and lands in the corner
     of the room the curtains catch on fire

                         daniel
                hot

     julien panics he grabs the canvas out of daniels hand and begins
     beating the flames with it daniel looks at him with disbelief
     julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames he
     turns to daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the
     fire but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire a beat
     julien sees the flames and puts them out daniel just stares at
     him he opens the canvas the painting is ruined

     ext street  night

     a mercedes parks in front of the peugeot boxing it in between it
     and a car behind it the driver gets out and walks away

     int house foyer  night

     daniel and julien move through the darkness

                         daniel

               anything and try not to burn down
               the house

     with light julien stares at the flame amazed

                         old mans voice

     they turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in
     his bathrobe he is frail his face pasty white he is holding a
     very long doublebarrel shotgun
     julien looks to daniel with a what now expression the old man
     slowly moves down the stairs he loses his balance and falls down
     the stairs tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom
     daniel and julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the
     floor motionless

                         julien
               is he dead

                         daniel

               i dont know     he looks dead

                         julien
               he looked dead before he fell

     the old man groans then opens his eyes    he grabs his shotgun
     daniel and julien run to the door

     ext house  night

     and get in the back seat
     raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between
     the mercedes in front and the car behind like a pinball stuck
     between two bumpers the peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth

     int peugeot  continuous

     daniel and julien stare angrily ar raymond

                         julien
               you didnt think to move the car before
               we came out

     daniel looks out his window and sees
     daniels pov  the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun
     and heads towards the car
     raymond is desperately trying to get the car free they all slide
     down as the old man fires the windows on the left side of the
     car shatter

                         daniel
               raymond get us out of here

     raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man
     opens the breach of the shotgun to reload
     raymond floors the peugeot keeping his foot on the brake the
     engine revs he turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake
     the peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the mercedes
     and pushing in out into the street before the old man can take
     aim the peugeot is speeding down the street

     int peugeot  moving  night

     raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives    julien finds the
     whole thing amusing daniel leans forward

                    to raymond

               qualities my analyst says positive
               reinforcement is a much more productive
               way of relating with people

               off last night some thief a regular
               black panther

               a black panther was a member of an african
               american militant group in the sixties

                         marcel

               communicating with my dick

               shut up both of you    youre giving me
               a fuckin headache

     a beat raymond and marcel stare at one another     we hear a muffled
     groaning sound in the bg

                         daniel

                    a beat referring to
                    the painting
               that it

     daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk
     bastaldi removes the painting to him it is not a work of art
     just a commodity to be sold he opens his desk drawer removes
     several large stacks of money and hands them to daniel

                         bastaldi
               okay   now ive got something i want to 

     we hear the groaning sound again bastaldi looks irritated he
     gets up and walks over to a closet he opens to the doors to reveal
     a man in his underwear his wrists tied behind his back his mouth
     taped shut a wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand
     on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself

                         bastaldi
               do you mind im trying to do some
               business here

     the man looks at bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles
     something

                         bastaldi
               one more sound out of you and im going
               to cut your fuckin tongue out

     bastaldi closes the door   daniel looks at him inquisitively

                         bastaldi

               you take someone in give them a steady
               job and how do they repay you by
               claiming to misplace a shipment of your
               merchandise

                         raymond
               maybe he did misplace it

                         bastaldi
               you misplace your car keys   you misplace
               your cell phone

               this is a considerable move up for you
               daniel the temptation of having so
               much money might be too much for you

     comes to renaud singing des que le vent souffera he leans back
     in his seat bobbing his head to the music marcel doesnt like
     it he changes the station we hear johnny hallyday singing que

     zero doesnt like it he pushes the button returning to the renaud
     song and stares at marcel marcel not to be outdone returns the
     hallyday song like two children they click the buttons of the
     radio switching back and forth between renaud and hallyday
     bastaldi has had enough

                         bastaldi
               stop it   both of you

     he turns off the radio a long beat marcel like a child who
     has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly but
     loud enough for zero to hear

                         marcel

     chicago board of trade building grant park then with each
     successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are

     buildings graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned
     cars line the street the taxi driver leans out his window

                         marcel
               yes   we are sure

     the taxi speeds off leaving them standing on the sidewalk their
     bags in a pile suddenly from out of nowhere three black toughs
     appear and walk over daniel looks behind him and sees another
     two approaching from the rear zero calmly sits down on one of
     the suitcases

                         sami
               let me handle this

     lamar 30s the leader of the group steps forward

                         sami
               hey brother     whats happening man

     sami raises his hand as if to greet lamar

                         lamar
               dont you brother me motherfucker

     sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air   he casually
     lowers it lamar looks over the group and grins

                         lamar
               whats in the bags

                         julien

               want i what or im gonna bust your heads
               open

     raymond steps forward and places his hand on lamars arm

                         raymond
               lamar violence is never an answer to
               settling disputes i can see you have a
               lot of anger but this is not the way
               to get it out

                         lamar

               get outta my face

     lamar removes a knife the others in his group bring out an
     assortment of clubs chains and pipes

                         lamar
               now are you going to give me the
               suitcases or are we going to have to
               take them

     zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases

                         zero
               va te faire foutre

                         lamar
               what did he say

                         daniel
               he said to go fuck yourself

                         zero
               we are tired and bored with your bullshit
               so put that stupid little knife away
               before zero shoves it up your ass

                         lamar
               who is zero

                         julien
               he is

                         lamar
                    to julien
               he speaks about himself in the third
               person

     julien shrugs his shoulders

                         lamar

               maybe zero would like to get off his ass
               and take my knife from me

                         zero
               if you insist

     zero stands up and raises his hand   he is holding a 9mm glock
     he aims it at lamars head

     lamars brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down
     the barrel of the gun the rest of his gang turns and runs away
     zero aims the gun at his groin

                         zero
               leave now before zero shoots off those
               little raisins you call balls

     lamar runs away daniel and the others smile at zero as they pick
     up their bags and walk towards a building

     zero is left with sami who stares at him with disbelief

                         sami
               you put a loaded gun in your bag and
               brought it through customs how stupid
               is that

                         zero
               zero did not put it in his bag    he put
               it in yours

     zero grins and walks away

     very large man a biker type leather jacket full beard several
     long earrings hanging from his ear he is holding a beer bottle
     behind him are two other roughlooking men

                         raymond
                    cheerfully loudly
                    over the music
               hello my name is raymond i am visiting
               next door and i was wondering if you
               could make your music a little less loud

     the biker takes a sip of his beer

                         biker
               no

                         raymond

     before raymond can finish his sentence the biker pours his beer
     over raymonds head

                         biker
               fuck off

     he slams the door in raymonds face

     int sophies warehouse  moments later  afternoon

     steps into the room he walks over to a chair and sits down his
     head hung down embarrassed marcel is angered by this he glances
     over to daniel who subtly nods to him marcel leaves the room

     ext side of warehouse  moments later  afternoon

     marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building he
     reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves
     he slips them on as he approaches the door then knocks a beat
     the biker opens the door

                         biker
               listen asshole i told you 

     marcel head butts him slamming his forehead into the bridge of
     his nose the biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose
     marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several
     times  each punch backing the biker into the room

     int bikers warehouse  continuous

     on the last punch the biker falls backwards crashing through a
     large glass coffee table

     biker 2 moves in behind marcel and throws a hard punch as marcel
     turns around marcel bends his head down so that his attackers
     fists slams into the hard crown of his skull

     biker 2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles marcel knees him
     hard in the groin biker 2 turns to his side and doubles over
     marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around
     and down on his knees

     in a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head  biker
     2 falls face forwards and is out cold
     marcel turns to the third biker who is standing by the stereo he
     is smaller than the others and has seen enough he quickly turns
     off the power dead quiet

     together they spark before hadley can say a word sami touches
     them to his hand hadleys body jerks violent as he screams
     sami removes the wires hadley winces in pain from the burn mark
     on his hand

                         agent hadley
               okay okay weve been investigating
               zammito for years but weve never had
               enough evidence for a warrant to search
               his house we got word through a snitch
               that zammito was planning on taking

               to do something like that our informant
               told us that zammito was talking with
               other bosses and recording their
               conversations in case they later claimed
               they werent involved look at these
               tapes the guy has recorded every
               conversation hes had for years

     word so he can read his lips

               get that and add it to my inventory

     the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to daniel they walk
     out of the room lamar stands there stunned then quickly runs

     the vinyl intro we hear the intro to jerry vale singing amore
     scusami

     series of quick cuts
        raphaels eyes burn into zammitos
        a gangbangers eyes dart from side to side
        a wiseguy bites his lip
        nicky the rake twitches his fingers nervously
        sweat glistens on the forehead of joey two tons

     at the bar eddie reaches behind for something without looking he
     knocks over a bottle it falls to the floor and breaks the noise
     is enough to push things over the edge

                         jerry vales voice
               my love forgive me

     raphael goes for his gun   all hell breaks loose people dive for
     cover as shots rings out   in the close quarters its like shooting
     fish in a barrel

                         jerry vales voice
               i didnt mean to have it end like this

     eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang
     member another gang member kills him
     its a massacre bodies drop like flies the room is so thick
     with smoke you cant see two feet in front of you finally it is
     quiet

     we move through the room past the carnage smoke swirls blood
     covers the floor raphael is dead along with joey two tons
     and nicky the rake on the floor zammito is against the bar
     he sits up amazed that he is untouched he gets to his feet and
     makes his way to the front door

     ext south side social club  afternoon

     music continues zammito staggers outside and into the street
     he laughs a nervous laugh at his good fortune

                         jerry vales voice
               my love please kiss me

     zammito turns around to see
     zammitos pov  a lincoln town car speeding towards him through
     the windshield he can see the smiling face of half tooth tony
     the front of the car slams into zammito lifting him into the air
     he flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over
     the car he lays in the middle of the street dead
     the lincoln speeds off down the street

     is no sign of them

     peers through the window at bastaldi who is still trying to figure
     out where they went they are all amused with bastaldis
     bewilderment

     away a light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black
     canvas there is a flash of color another gust of wind turns

     twelve sunflowers

     follow his stare

     their pov  of the priceless painting
     they stand there too shocked to move at first then rush forward
     they have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them
     the wind kicks up the painting blowing it over the railing they
     reach out to grab it but it is too far away they stand there
     watching as it slowly floats down to the river below
