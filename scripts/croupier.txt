                         to begin with he put the odds at 2 
                         against 7 for he checked a random 
                         selection of bills at a bank they 
                         were all good

                         fact that the notes were good gave 
                         him one less negative 2 minus 1 
                         at the same time mathematically he 
                         had one more positive 7 plus 1
