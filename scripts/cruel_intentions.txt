     we circle around the island of manhattan moving closer and
     closer till were looking down on fifth avenue as the
     melody continues to play we move towards a building and zoom
     into a window

2    int therapists office  day                              2

     a fiftyyear old female therapist dr greenbaum sits at
     her desk frowning as she takes notes books of jung and
     freud line the shelves

     a young man sebastian valmont sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient

     the therapist continues to write notes

                              dr greenbaum
               jesus weve been at this for six
               months

                              sebastian

                              dr greenbaum

               progress

                              sebastian

     sebastian takes out a cigarette

                              dr greenbaum
                    not looking up
               theres no smoking in my office

     sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away dr
     greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him shaking
     her head

                              sebastian
               what do you want me to say that im
               supposed to feel remorse because i act
               the way i do the truth is i dont

     dr greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes

                              sebastian contd
               look im not like all the other kids
               in high school i dont care about book
               reports and extracredit teachers
               are idiots anyway the only challenge
               out there for me is women you see a
               girl you like you pursue them you
               conquer you move on its exciting

                              dr greenbaum

               chicks love a guy with a bad rap

               mean it they all think that theyre
               the ones that are going to save me
               the trick is to let them think its
               true

                              dr greenbaum

                              annette
               i dont know relationships seem too
               distracting id rather concentrate on
               my studies

                              sebastian

     she bends over to pick up the saddle

                              sebastian
               nice

     she sighs disgusted then turns toward him

                              annette
               are you often this offensive on a first
               encounter

                              sebastian
               i was just being honest you happen to
               have a nice ass sorry

     she shakes her head and continues with her chore

                              sebastian
               i read your teen beat manifesto

                              annette
               you did

                              sebastian
               i must say i found it rather appalling

                              annette
               thats a first most people praised me
               for it

                              sebastian
               most people are morons i mean who are
               you to knock what youve never experienced

                              annette
               i wasnt knocking anything its just my
               belief that people shouldnt actually
               experience the act of love until they are
               in love and that people our age are too
               immature to be in touch with those
               emotions

                              sebastian
               oh really

               women are you happier because of it

                    pissed
               well maybe you should get to know the
               person before you judge them instead of
               listening to some bullshit gossip

                              annette
               im sorry i didnt mean to upset you
               but you still didnt answer the question

     an uncomfortable silence falls between them

                              sebastian

               letters spreading this shit about me
