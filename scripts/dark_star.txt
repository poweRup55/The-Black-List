               we are watching a filmed tape doolittle has just turned it 
               on and is staring into the camera crosshairs and blipping

                         deteriorate

               pinback leans into view and whispers into doolittles ear  
               doolittle nods and pinback withdraws

                                     doolittle
                         the short circuit in the rear seat

                         it continues to bother pinback
                              glares at pinback  
                              then

               as talby begins to eat

                         just glow as they drift around the 
                         universe imagine all the sights

                         seething with light and gasses and 
                         dust there are little pebbles 
                         drifting around planets no one on

                         here somewhere

                                     doolittle
                         i cant talk to the others but with 
                         time to myself i think about back 
                         home back home at malibu i used to 
                         surf a lot talby i used to be a 
                         great surfer

                                     talby
                         lieutenant doolittle im getting a 
                         definite malfunction on one of the 
                         closedcircuit computer systems

                                     doolittle
                         the waves at malibu and zuma were 
                         fantastic in the springs talby i 
                         can remember running out on the beach 
                         early spring mornings with my board 
                         and a wet suit

                                     talby
                         i cant seem to locate the malfunction 
                         exactly

                                     doolittle
                         waves would be peaking really high 
                         and glassy hit that water ridin 
                         the wall just perfect

                                     talby
                         somewhere in the autonomic relay 
                         circuits

                                     doolittle
                         i guess i miss the waves and my board 
                         most of all

               talby turns in his seat and addresses doolittle directly

                                     talby
                         ah doolittle i do have a malfunction 
                         on this readout but i cant seem to 
                         pinpoint exactly where it is

                                     doolittle
                              snapped out of his 
                              daydream
                         dont worry about it well find out 
                         when it goes bad

                                     talby
                              chagrined
                         i really think i should try and locate 
                         it immediately might be something 
                         important

                                     doolittle
                         i wish i had my board with me now 
                         even if i could only polish it once 
                         in awhile

               the room is dim and eerie banks of dimly flickering lights 
               and the hum of aircooling machinery

               talby is seated before a glowing screen he punches several 
               buttons and the screen comes to life a schematic cross
               section of the ship appears in glowing green lines

               talby punches more buttons and the screen flashes through 
               the levels of the ship finally it shows level 6 there is a 
               small red light pulsing in the emergency air lock

               talby punches another button the emergency air lock is 
               magnified fifteen times until it fills the screen the red 
               light is pulsing in a small area labelled communications 
               laser 17

               talby picks up a microphone

                         but how do you know you exist

                                     bomb 20
                         it is intuitively obvious

                                     doolittle
                         intuition is no proof what concrete

                         hmm well i think therefore i 
                         am

                                     doolittle
                         thats good very good now then 
                         how do you know that anything else 
                         exists

                                     bomb 20
                         my sensory apparatus reveals it to 
                         me

                                     doolittle
                         right

                                     bomb 20
                         this is fun

                                     doolittle
                         all right now heres the big 
                         question how do you know that the 
                         evidence your sensory apparatus 
                         reveals to you is correct

                         what im getting at is this the 
                         only experience that is directly 
                         available to you is your sensory 
                         data and this data is merely a stream 
                         of  electrical impulses which 
                         stimulate your computing center

                                     bomb 20
                         in other words all i really know 
                         about the outside universe relayed 
                         to me through my electrical 
                         connections

                                     doolittle
                         exactly

                                     bomb 20
                         why that would mean i really 
                         dont know what the outside universe 
                         is like at all for certain

                         intriguing i wish i had more time 
                         to discuss this matter

                         to explode of course

                         and you can only do it once right

                                     bomb 20
                         that is correct

                                     doolittle
                         and you wouldnt want to explode on 
                         the basis of false data would you

                                     bomb 20
                         of course not

                                     doolittle
                         well then youve already admitted 
                         that you have no real proof of the 
                         existence of the outside universe

                                     bomb 20
                         yes well

                                     doolittle
                         so you have no absolute proof that 
                         sergeant pinback ordered you to 
                         detonate

                         i recall distinctly the detonation 
                         order my memory is good on matters 
                         like these

                                     doolittle
                         yes of course you remember it but 
                         what you are remembering is merely a 
                         series of electrical impulses which 
                         you now realize have no necessary

                         true but since this is so i have

                         concepts are valid wherever they

                         you may be doing so on the basis 
                         of false data

                                     bomb 20
                         i have no proof that it was false 
                         data

                                     doolittle
                         you have no proof that it was correct 
                         data

               there is a long pause

               the field of spectral shapes with talby in their midst 
               begin to drift away into the distance

                                     talby
                         theyre taking me with them with 
                         the phoenix going to circle the 
                         universe forever im with them now 
                         be back this way again some day 
                         doolittle before its too late 
                         theres one last thing i want to 
                         tell you

               talbys signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into 
               the depths of space

               doolittle is hanging onto a long thin chunk of debris

                                     doolittle
                         hey talby ive grabbed a piece of 
                         the ship and i think ive figured 
                         out a way

               he pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet and stands 
               on it

               crouching and extending his arms doolittle surfs down into 
               the atmosphere of the planet banking and planing as he 
               disappears to a small dot

               end titles and music over

                                         the end
