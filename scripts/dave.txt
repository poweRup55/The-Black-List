          reed smiles at dave who musters a little smile in return

                                reed

                    job wed like to extend things a little 
                    bit

          he places a hand on daves shoulder and motions toward the 
          desk  dave hesitates  then follows him over

          different angle

          reed pulls out the presidents chair and motions to it

                                reed
                    try it out

          dave looks down at the chair in wonder

                                reed
                    go ahead

          dave pauses for a moment then sinks down into the soft brown 
          leather   he stares out in awe across the oval office

                                different angle
                    reed looks over at bob who nods at 
                    him    he takes a deep breath

                                reed
                    dave something has happened to the 
                    president

                         whirling

                                reed
                         soothing him
                    i know  i know
                         pause
                    its difficult for all of us  but 
                    sometimes we have to put our personal 
                    feelings aside and focus on the gqod 
                    of the country

                                dave

                    exactly a condition

          dave nods but still doesnt understand   reed hesitates when 
          bob glares at him again

                                reed
                    its actually kind of serious dave

                                reed

          jumps out of the chair

                                dave
                    hey   wait a second

          reed fishes through his pockets and comes up with a coin  he 
          moves to the mat slipping it to dave

                                dave
                         leaning forward
                    okay   what can run all day without 
                    getting tired

          the kid looks at him baffled  dave reaches out slowly and 
          taps the side of his nose  dave

                                gently
                    well its not your ear

          she watches in amazement as her husband reaches out and 
          magically produces a quarter from the side of the childs 
          nose  dave looks up at her with a smile and their eyes lock 
          as a hundred shutters fire at once

                                                                 cut to

          steam billows up in the shower while dave scrubs shampoo into 
          his hair  he massages it vigorously into his scalp while the 
          humming continues

                                dave
                    bum bum da dum

          he rinses it out and reaches for the soap   its a small 
          soap on a rope designed to look like the presidential seal

                    how could you

          dave jumps with a start then turns away from her quickly 
          bashfully facing the tile   he looks back at ellen over his 
          shoulder

                                dave
                     how could i what

          dave steels himself then turns slowly around to face her  he 
          strikes a stoic pose

                                ellen
                         trembling slightly
                     you know if you want to be the 
                    same old bastard thats fine  i can 
                    handle it   but dont pull

                                dave
                         frozen feeling  very 
                         exposed
                    i dont understand

                                ellen
                         exasperated
                    thats not just a works bill you vetoed  
                    that would have given these kids 
                    homes
                         losing it a little
                     when i think about that little 
                    spectacle you pulled with those muppets 
                    and that magic trick

                                dave
                    whats wrong with a magic trick

                                ellen
                    you made their funding disappear

          dave recoils a little

                                dave
                    look  if there was some mistake

                                ellen
                         in a rage
                    theres no mistake bill   if you 
                    veto their funding its not a mistake 
                    if you hurt someone intentionally 
                    its not a mistake

          she turns and leaves through the steam disappearing as suddenly 
          as she came  dave hesitates for an instant then starts right 
          after her

          int hallway

          duane is seated at his regular post when ellen comes stalking 
          out of daves suite he looks up in amazement as dave runs 
          out a moment later   hes dripping wet and clutching a bath 
          towel around his waist

                                dave
                         turning to duane

                    but its tenthirty at night

          dave turns and gives him a presidential glare

                                duane
                         backing off
                    yeah sure you got it

          int oval office  night

          dave is seated at his desk hair still wet dressed in the 
          presidential jogging suit the door bursts open  its bob 
          and reed

                                bob

                    what the hell is this 

          bob and reed cross over toward the desk as dave slams down a 
          copy of rolled up newspaper

                                bob
                         looking at it

                         the front page
                    no

          bob glances at the paper then hands it to reed

                                reed
                         looking at it shrugging
                    president vetoes works bill

                                dave

                    dave these things get awfully 
                    complicated sometimes

                    that shelter was in this bill

                                bob

                                bob
                         moving toward him
                    listen you little

                                reed

                    thing  even i dont understand it

                    to make some cuts and

                                dave
                    but we went there  we saw those kids

                                bob
                    yeah and if you can find a way to cut 
                    three hundred and fifty million dollars 
                    from the federal budget then you can 
                    keep your lousy shelters okay

          dave just looks at him for a moment

          ext white house  day

          a small ford escort with a thrifty rentacar sticker pulls 
          up to the east gate of the white house  it stops just short 
          of the guard station then rolls forward a few feet and stops 
          again

          angle  murray

          he leans out of the window squinting into the sun  murray 
          holds a mangled map of washington in his hand

                                murray
                         terrified
                    im here to see the president

          the guard looks at him without responding

                                murray
                    he asked me to come

          the guard reaches for the phone and dials a few numbers  
          murray jiggles nervously in his seat

          int oval office  night

          he sits in the exact same chair that dave occupied on his 
          arrival  murray stares across the oval office with a terrified 
          look on his face

                                murray
                         urgent whisper
                    im serious dave  you could get in 
                    a lot of trouble for something like 
                    this

                                murray
                    they could put you in jail

                                dave
                    why would they do that  they hired 
                    me

          murray just stares at him

                                dave
                    its kind of a national emergency thing   
                    i cant really talk about it
                         confidentially
                    paying me big money too   cmere

          he leads murray from the chair to the other side of the desk  
          dave reaches down opening the bottom drawer

                    he looks at it wideeyed  frozen by 
                    what he sees

                                murray
                         whispering indicating 
                         the walls
                    are we being taped

                                dave

          murray turns and looks at his best friend speechless   he 
          stares at dave for a couple of seconds when a strange look of 
          wonder crosses his face
