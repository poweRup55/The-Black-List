day
of
the
dead
the original script
by george a romero



	fade in

1	ext the empty street of a city  day

no people a few cars and trucks are parked at odd angles abandoned 
a title fades in one phrase at a time

five years
since the dead first walked

2	ext the city  day

we hear the sound of a strong wind debris flutters through the 
streets a large alligator slithers into frame stops and looks 
around

montage as more gators explore the empty streets knocking over 
garbage cans upsetting the mannequins in a department store window 
a gator crawls out through the open doors of an abandoned bank loose 
bills are dragged along under the animals tail they flutter away on 
the wind

3	ext the city  day

gators crawl over a 79 cadellic a female skeleton sits slumped over 
the steering wheel in the back a babys bones are strapped into an 
infants safety seat one of the gators thumps its tail maddeningly 
against the windshield another title appear

florida  1987

4	ext the city  day

close on a section of pavement as we hear the sound of sluggish 
footsteps approaching a shadow appears at the bottom of the frame 
it gets longer and takes on the shape of a man

tight on the afternoon sun blinding us into the foreground lurches 
the figure which cast the shadow glare obscures all facial detail 
until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball 
in the sky then we see its hideous dead eyes its bluegrey colour 
the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped 
away this is a zombie a music chord sounds and the main title 
appears

day of the dead

5	ext the city  day

head credits roll over a montage the city streets are now populated 
by the walking dead in every shape size and colour they wander 
without purpose up and down the avenues in and out of buildings 
the city is theirs they have inherited the place man in his human 
form seems to be gone

as the credits end we cut to

6	ext a main street  day

we are looking down from a high angle the corner of a tall building 
is in the foreground a corpse is dangling from a noose its been 
dead for some time its mostly bone now its blackened flesh picked 
clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats a sign flaps against its 
chest cavity its hurriedly scrawled message reads take me lord i 
love you

the rope breaks suddenly and the corpse falls out of frame

7	ext the street  day

were at ground level nowsmack the corpse hits the pavement and 
shatters as though made of potters clay bones bounce over a wide 
area the sign is carried off by the wind

8	ext an abandoned marina  day

the sign gallops across the grass of a harbour park towards the water 
where a few derelict boats sway in the wind

slowly the sound of a motor fades in

9	ext the marina closer angle  day

a fishing boats old and seaworn chugs into the harbour

10	ext the marina close on the fishing boat  day

there are people on board three men and two women they look like 
guerilleros from somewhere in latin america theyre heavily armed 
unshaven covered with months worth of jungle crud they are 
obviously exhausted they gaze up to the city their deepsunken eyes 
are too warweary to show much emotion but we can read their despair

tony

out to the islands

miguel
the radio signals were coming from this 
area

tony

same dead lets get out to the barrier 
islands if there are survivors sending 
those signals thats where well find them

miguel

miguel is drifting the sight of the dead city has pushed him a few 
inches closer to the brink of insanity he catches himself and comes 
back toward reality

miguel

came all this way were gonna check it 
out

11	ext the marina at the docks  day

close on the open gasoline receptacle in the hull of an abandoned 
boat a womans hands shove a length of hose down into the hole

the woman maria puts the other end of the hose to her mouth and 
sucks the air out

at another derelict boat tony sucks on another hose

tony

lets get outa here

miguel
check them all and check the tanks under 
the pumps
	
miguel and the other two guerilleros sarah and chico start to walk 
up the dock towards the harbour park toward the city miguel has an 
electronic bullhorn in one hand his automatic rifle ready in the 
other

12	ext the harbour park  day

the trio of refugees move across the grass the wind blows debris 
around them as they stare towards the downtown buildings miguel 
lifts the bullhorn to his mouth

miguel
hello is there anyone there hello 
hellooooooo

13 	ext the city  day

montage as the walking dead hear that human voice throughout the 
city they turned towards the sound at once confused and excited

miguel os
hellooooooooooo

the dead start to groan hungrily almost pleadingly all over the 
city their voices rise

14	ext the harbour park  day

it comes to miguel and the others as a massive wall of noise the 
sound of hundredsofthousands of damned souls moaning on one solid 
voice the sound of hell on earth

15	ext the marina at the docks  day

tony and maria hear it as well and feel the familiar grip of cold 
fear maria makes the sign of the cross

maria
dios mia

tony
i tol him i tol him this is a dead 
place like all the others

cut to

16	ext the city from the water  day

we see the place from a great distance in the foreground the fishing 
boat with all five refugees back on board chugs into open waters

cut to

17	ext	a small private dock  day

away from the city this dock is wooden rickety derelict boats rust 
at their moorings the fishing boat is tiedon at one end of the pier 
and the guerilleros are moving through the area scavenging this 
time chico helps maria with the siphon hoses tony lingers sullenly 
near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling

marias siphon hose is stuffed into the gas tank of a large trawler 
she sucks on the hose and unexpectedly foul tasting liquid fills 
her mouth

maria
ay gasolina gasolina

without warning a figure pops up from behind the side wall of the 
trawler he reaches out and grabs the woman pulling her against the 
boat his arm around her neck a pistol to her head

tony sees the action he dives into the fishing boat crawls over to 
his rifle and scrambles towards the pilots controls

with a lightning move maria pulls a knife from her belt she 
wrenches around and plunges the blade into her attackers chest the 
man staggers back screaming maria breaks away and runs across the 
dock the man fires his pistol wildly

maria is hit in the arm she tumbles forwards onto the decking

tony reacts opening fire with his automatic

bullets rip into the attackers chest he falls out of the trawler 
onto the dock but two more gunmen appear behind him meanlooking 
desperadoes with rifle spitting lead

tony ducks as low as he can he grabs the controls and pilots the 
fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman

18	ext the private dock  day

miguel sarah and chico react to the gunfire they draw their weapons 
and look for cover

they are at the far end of the dock their backs to the sea there is 
a work shed nearby bullets whiz past them as they charge towards the 
wooden structure they make it there safely and they begin to return 
fire a gun battle ensues between the two groups

19	ext the private dock  day

maria her arm bleeding rolls off the dock and into the fishing 
boat tony guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water

the attackers try to fire at the escaping boat but they are forced to 
duck bullets which ricochet off the trawler pinning them down

20	ext the private dock  day

miguels rifle is in his right hand his left hand clings to the 
frame of an open window on his side of the shed theres a sudden 
startling music sting and with it a zombie appears inside the open 
window grotesque and drooling dark saliva its hungry mouth lunges 
at miguels left arm its teeth tear a large strip of flesh out of 
the arm six inches above the wrist

miguel screams he pulls away from the creature his terrified eyes 
staring at the bleeding wound a zombie bite means infection and 
almost certain death

the zombie leans out through the open window its hands clawing the 
air trying to reach miguel sarah pulls a giant 45 from her holster 
belt bullamn bullamn bullamn she fires three rapid shots

the skull of the zombie indents in front like a hardboiled egg shell 
thats been whacked with a spoon bowl blackened blood and brain 
matter flies out of the back where the bullets exit the creature 
falls destroyed

21	ext the private dock  day

sarah acts quickly she lunges towards chico and snatches a machete 
out of his belt chico shows concern but hes busy returning fire at 
the attackers on the trawler

sarah
i have to stop the infection querrida
	
miguel looks into sarahs eyes he has started to tremble a cry of 
primal panic is gurgling up in his throat with a sudden move sarah 
slams her rifle butt into the side of his head with all her might he 
reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall his eyes roll but 
he stays on his feet still conscious

chico steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of 
miguel whap he slugs him with a powerhouse rightcross miguel 
still stands whap he slugs him again whap again finally miguel 
collapses into the mans arms and chico lays the limp body down on 
the deck

buddablam rattatattatattatatt the enemy sensing an upper hand 
starts firing with more intensity chico steps away from miguel and 
sends some lead back their way

22	ext the private dock  day

sarah is crying its not weakness shes crying for miguel crying 
for his pain but she doesnt hesitate in what she has to do she 
crouches over the bitten arm and raises the machete over her head

thuck she chops at the elbow joint with all her strength the blade 
bites deep but doesnt cut through she lifts it and chops again and 
againthuck thuck then she digs around searching for the joint 
the way she might on a turkey drumstick finding the spot she pushes 
down with both hands leaning all her weight on the top edge of the 
blade tears are running down her cheeks when the big knife 
finally thummmpppcuts through to the decking

repulsed angry sarah sweeps the severed forearm away with the blade 
the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat blood is spurting 
out of the stump at an alarming rate sarah has to act quickly again

while chico continues to return fire at the enemy sarah swings 
herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears 
inside the place

23	int the boathouse  day

the place is dark and cluttered oars bait buckets fishing gear 
life preservers tools paints varnishes sarah snatches up an axe 
handle

the zombie that bit miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open its 
hand is jogged startingly when sarah grabs a bottle of paint 
thinner from the floor beside the corpse

from out of the shadowsa hand it grabs sarahs ankle she kicks 
violently and pulls away another zombie is crawling across the 
floor one of its legs is missing and the other is badly damaged

sarah draws her 45 and bullamm bullamm she pumps two rounds into 
the creatures brain

24	ext the private dock  day

chico ducks the enemys ricocheting bullets

chico
hey  what are we doin this for we can 
stick together we can use each others 
guns

at the trawler one of the attackers shouts a response

attacker 1
you could use our guns maybe we cant use 
yours unless you can get yer boat back 
here

chico
you got a boat

attacker 1
shit man we can drift this tub into the 
baytow her around with a dinghybut 
she aint gonna get us nowhere evry boat

back here

chico
i dont know where they went man i dont 
know i swear

attacker 1
then like i saidwe cant use you we 
aint got the food nor the patience to put 
up with you

the man fires a long burst from his automatic

chico
youyou motherfuckers

he reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and fires 
blind in return sarah clambers out through the shed windows having 
wrapped a large piece of cloth around the end of the axe handle
	
she reaches into a shirt pocket and produces a wooden match she 
strikes the match and touches the flame to the thinnersoaked cloth 
phooooomph the axe handle becomes an angrily flaming torch

25	ext the private dock  day

as the gun battle continues sarah crouches over miguel blood is 
still fountaining from the stump of his left arm the woman slaps the 
flaming end of her torch onto the stump theres a sizzling sound as 
the raw flesh there cooks

the pain reaches miguel even though his unconscious state he starts 
to breathe heavily his head shakes from side to side silently 
pleading no no no the flames do their job the flesh crusts over 
and the bleeding stops

miguels shirt catches suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams 
like the man on fire he is he lurches away from the flame his body 
slamming against the shed wall sarah flings the torch into the water 
and dives on top of the man

sarah
miguelito mi vida miguel mio

miguel trying to scream but needing to vomit is doing neither his 
body is convulsing in the womans arms she rubs the sparks on his 
shirt until they disappear then she caresses him holding his head 
against hers rocking him back and forth

26	ext the private dock  day

chico is still busy returning fire bullets whiz through the air 
around his head one knicks him on the shoulder a superficial but 
painful wound

chico
jesus christ get up here woman get the 
hell up here

sarah has no choice but to help in the fight she lays miguel as 
gently as she can on his back hes gone into deep shock shivering 
violently rubbing tears away from her eyes sarah jumps to her feet 
takes up a post and begins to fire at the attackers

the attackers are grinning like oldfashioned pirates as their guns 
chew up the dock suddenly just behind the trawler we see a flash 
of colour speeding by

its the fishing boat the wounded maria is steering tony is 
standing on the prow with his rifle firing 
rattatattatattatattatatt

one of the attackers is hit from behind his back turns solid red and 
he pitches forwards falling between the boat and the dock into the 
water below

the other attacker 1 turns and fires in response tony is hit in 
the stomach he falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but 
he keeps firing

the attacker pivots against a mast for a moment he doesnt realise 
that his neck has been ripped open by a line of bullets he tries to 
scream cant a plume of red shoot out of his mouth then he 
realises he realises that hes a dead man he falls

maria

tony
pull in get the others

tony is clutching at his bleeding belly as maria in pain from her 
own wound circles the boat towards the edge of the dock

27	ext the private dock  day

behind the boathouse sarah slings her rifle onto her shoulder and 
she leans over miguel who is now catatonic

sarah
help me get him to the boat

chico
leave him

sarah calmly raises her 45 and aims it directly at chicos head

sarah
help me or die

reluctantly the man moves towards miguel and the two survivors drag 
his limp body over the decking

dissolve to

28	ext the private dock  sunset

the fishing boat is gone orange light from the western horizon 
paints the scene figures are moving about on the dock slumped 
lumbering figureszombies

theyre clustering around the trawler around the corpses of the 
attackers

they begin pulling those corpses apart and eating them hungrily

one creature has found miguels severed forearm it pulls a big chunk 
off the thing with its teeth it chews for a time its drool turning 
red then it spits out miguels wristwatch as though it was a 
bothersome bit of bone

29	ext the fishing boat in deep water  sunset

the two women hover over their wounded tony and miguel chico steers 
the boat suddenly tony arches his back and screams in pain

tony
aaaaaaahmy godmy godi am heartily 
sorryfor having offended 
theeoffended thee

maria
shhhhhtony rest rest

tony
i detest all my sinsbecause because 
of thy just punishment because of 
thyjustpunish

a coughing fit interrupts his act of contrition from across the open 
cabin from within sarahs arms miguel stares his eyes have the 
glaze of a madmans eyes despite that and despite the physical 
trauma he has endured he seems remarkably in command

miguel
he is dying i will end his pain

miguel draws his pistol

maria
nooooooooo

tony

thee my godwho art all goodand 
deservingdeserving of all my love

miguel

maria

miguel

will live i will live

tony
i firmly resolvewith the with the 
helpthe help ofof thy grace

tony collapses a long gurgling breath of surrender spills out of 
him and blood trickles from his lifeless mouth

maria
tonytony

the woman folds tonys corpse into her arms as though trying to give 
it life from her own wounded body for a long moment there is only 
the chugchugchug of the tired engine then the woman sensing 
something turns back towards miguel his pistol is raised aimed at 
tonys head

maria
no you cant

sarah
it must be done you know this it must by 
done to keep him from

maria
it wont happen to him it wont happen to 
him you heard his prayer his prayer will 
save him he could never become one 
ofone of those devils

miguel
prayers have no power to save the knife 
can save it can cut the disease away the 
bullet it can shatter the brain where the 
evil takes seed these are savioursour 
new savioursour only saviours

maria
we must wait one day the curse will pass 
one day a dead man will will

miguel
one day a dead man will refuse to return 
and that man will be a saint the first 
saint of our century thats a prayer too 
a catechism something the priests tell us 
to believe

maria

if you shoot we must wait illill do 
itill do it myselfwhen it needs to 
be done

miguel

rise he will rise and you you will die

that madmans glaze is wet in miguels eyes again a grin curls his 
mouth into an odd shape he freezes staring waiting sarah shows 
concern

30	ext deep water with the fishing boat  night

a crescent moon lies on its back below on the pitch black water 
its reflection a vertical stripe breaks open as the boat passes 
through itchugchugchug

31	ext the fishing boat in deep water  night

chico has fallen asleep at the tiller sarah is asleep as well and 
so is maria

a silent shadow moves over the side rail hands reach out and grip 
marias shoulders lifting her up up from sleep her eyes flutter 
open

tonys face is bluegrey in the moonlight it takes the woman a 
second or two to recognise that he is one of the living dead his 
hungry mouth lunges towards her neck his drooling teeth sink deep 
the woman screams

sarah wakes with a start miguel is already awake hes been watching 
all along now he watches still his pistol idle in his one good 
hand his mouth curled in that strange grin as marias screams 
shatter the quiet night

at the tiller chico sees whats happening he fumbles for the 
automatic rifle thats strapped over his shoulder

a porkchopsize chunk comes out of marias neck in the clenched 
teeth of the tonycreature blood squirts upward in a fivefoot arc

sarah lifts her rifle from her lap she is the first to fire an 
instant later chico fires as well

the head on the tonycreature is hit by rapidfire loads from each 
gun and it come apart above the eyes its body staggers stiffly into 
maria she tries to stand tries to pull away screams still bubbling 
in her torn throat she topples backward over the side rail the 
corpse taller and heavier flips rigidly over its feet kicking 
skyward and splashes in to the deep black gulf 

maria the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail 
grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board sarah 
springs forward she reaches the other woman a second too late their 
hands brush but dont catch maria slips over the side a loud splash 
cuts off her screams

chico brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible he and 
sarah stare out over the water the blackness out there is absolute 
visibility zero

silencebut for the chugchugchug of the boats engine

miguel slowly raises his hand and aims his pistol at a large turtle
shaped splotch of blood on the hull across the cabin the spot where 
tony died with that odd grin still on his lips he begins to fire 
one shot at a time in deliberate slow rhythm

the bullets punch holes through the wooden sidewall most of them 
hitting squarely in the blood stain

sarah looks over toward chico who returns her look with frightened 
eyes

32	ext gasparillas island est  day

it looks like a tropical paradise greatly separated from the other 
smaller islands on the horizon its vegetation is dense and lush 
theres no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place no power 
lines no buildings what meets the eye is all natural and inviting

the fishing boat chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side 
of the island

33	ext the fishing boat in the basin  day

chico
it looks uninhabited what do you think

miguel
i think we should burn the church kill the 
priest and burn the church its the only 
way the only way

miguel is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold flies are 
buzzing in a cluster around his wrapped stump hes over the edge 
now insane and worse than that the infection from the original 
bite is spreading the amputation was not done quickly enough to 
prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and 
elsewhere

sarah turns towards the madman once her lover her heart is too 
callused for emotion to reach it she just stares her eyes dead cold 
like the eyes of a shark

chico
im pullin in

34	ext the island with the fishing boat  day

the boat noses into a swamp water backwash tall reeds and cypress 
moss camouflage it completely its at though the boat is sailing 
right onto dry land

35	ext the jungle near the inlet  day

thwock close on a machete the blade chops into the top of a 
coconut

chico drinks the milk sarah sits on a nearby rock her rifle and a 
backpack full of supplies strapped over her shoulders

miguel his madmans eyes wide with excitement is trotting urgently 
from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of subtropical plant 
grows there are hundreds of them sixfeet tall and flowering their 
redgold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells 
down

miguel

chico

36	ext the inland jungle  day

the guerilleros hack their way through thick undergrowth with 
machetes miguel is ineffectual he lags behind the others who are 
doing trailblazing the sounds of wildlife excited by the intruders 
fill the close humid air sometimes beautiful sometimes grotesque 
sometimes startling

37	ext a swampy area  day

alligators lurk and snakes slither among the reeds a fourteen foot 
gator opens its jaws wide making a sound like escaping steam chico 
draws his pistol but sarah reaches out to grab his hand

sarah
no no shooting not until were sure were 
alone on this island

miguel
no no thank you no ice straight up 
please no ice thank you

miguels eyes roll up into his head his knees buckle sarah grabs 
him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the 
muddy swamp water chico comes to help

38	ext the swamp  day

the two drag miguel to the edge of dry land they flop him onto his 
back and sarah puts her canteen to his lips

miguel
no ice i said nooooo ice

he slams his good hand against the canteen knocking it away it 
plops into the marsh water its contents lost

miguel
burn the church kill the priest and burn 
the church burn

his mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out he squirms 
for a moment then he seems to fall asleep

chico looks down at him unable to help he moves off towards solid 
ground and disappears in the thick brush after a time sarah follows 
after him

39	ext the cave entrance  day

chico is at the edge of a clearing when sarah reaches him his eyes 
are wide frightened by what they see

in the ground before them theres an enormous iron plate fifty feet 
by ten all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns

sarah
what is it

chico
i dunno landing pad for a helicopter i 
dunno

suddenly theres a great rumbling like the giant gears and pistons 
of a drawbridge being activated the iron plate shudders and starts 
to move downward into the earth sarah and chico duck into the 
nearby jungle

40	ext the jungle near the cave entrance  day

they take cover in a thicket both their guns up and ready other 
sounds can be heard now clunking sounds of metal on metal and a few 
heavy thuds there are also voices on the wind but their words are 
indistinguishable

chico
its some kind ofelevator there must 
be something under the ground 
heremaybemilitary

sarah
look

41	ext the cave entrance their pov  day

several figures are rising up in to view a dozen maybe fifteen 
details are obscured by foreground foliage but we can read helmets 
heavy armaments packs utility belts the impression is of a ghostly 
cadre of soldiers rising from hell

sarah os
jesus christ

chico os
it is military i dont believe it

42	ext the jungle near the cave entrance  day

chico
what do we do letem know were hereor 
what

sarah
lets justwait a minute get a better 
look

she moves to another spot a few feet away chico follows

43	ext the cave entrance their pov  day

the platoon of soldiers still obscured by foliage moves off into 
the jungle carrying a collection of paraphernalia

there are three soldiers who do not move off with the others they 
are standing still with their shoulders slumped their heads lolling 
listlessly from side to side they have the body attributes of 
prisoners yet theres something menacing about them we hear a series 
of electronic beeps something like computer beeps and as though in 
response to that signal the three slumped figures start to walk 
they move slowly stiffly their feet shuffling their arms dangling 
lifelessly at their sides

sarah os
ohoh my god

44	ext the jungle near the cave entrance  day

sarahs eyes are wide in their sockets with disbelief revulsion 
horror beside her chico also astonished makes the sign of the 
cross

sarah
oh my god

45	ext the cave entrance  day

as we cut in closer we see that the three slumped figures are 
zombies they are wearing khakis and they are armed with rifles and 
pistol belts their helmets have been painted an identifying bright 
red and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour

all the others in the platoon are humans they too wear vests but 
theirs are not red but white with large orange circles emblazoned 
front and back two of the men wield long electric cattle prods for 
use should the zombies misbehave but the creatures amazingly are 
shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily co
operatively even somewhat excitedlythe kind of excitement seen 
in a puppy thats just learned a new trick

46	ext the jungle near the cave entrance  day

chico
it cant be are we truly in hell

sarah
come on

stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket crouching 
all the while chico hesitantly follows

47	ext a clearing  day

the mysterious platoon begins setting up their equipment which 
includes tripod machine guns two men don black rubber gloves and 
long black laboratory aprons they strap large refrigerated cartons 
around their necks and open the sealed lids vapour mushrooms out 
like dryice vapour out of good humour wagons on a hot day

48	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

sarah and chico watch suddenly the huge fullthroated sound of a 
siren startles them they look around up into the trees sarah spots 
something and points

close on a siren horn high in the cypresses its wires running down 
to the brush and disappearing under ground

49	ext the clearing  day

first one comesthen two morethree more zombies are shuffling 
out of the jungle and converging on the platoon

they seem to come from everywhere soon there are twenty or more 
most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests the same type as 
worn by the platoon these are solid colours some white some blue 
none are red and none have orange circles

as the zombies push in closer they seem to get agitated they start 
growling and reaching out the men with the cattle prods poke at the 
more unruly creatures and zapping sounds can be heard

the creatures form a kind of ragged queue lining up in front of the 
good humour men from inside their freezer cartons those men 
produce great bloody chunks of raw meat the zombies docilely take 
the handouts and go lurching out of the queue some starting to eat 
immediately others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a 
more private supper

50	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

sarah
what is that could that be

behind her chico gets the dry heaves he slams his hand into his 
mouth to keep from making noise

sarah
no they must have gotten them to 
acceptother things they wouldnt be 
feeding them withthey wouldnt

51	ext the clearing  day

the man in command of the platoon is obvious strutting around while 
others do the dirty work this is captain rhodes hes 
conscienceless the low of the low and a weaselylooking guy to 
boot he watches the operation almost hoping for trouble he loves 
to torture disobedient zombies

behind him their automatics ready are several troopers especially 
assigned to protect the captain one of these troopers is toby tyler 
a good guy toby is revulsed by the scene in the clearing he drops 
his head almost gagging rhodes notices

rhodes
youll get used to this tyler its the 
only way they dont bite the hand that 
feeds
	
toby looks up he cant conceal his contempt for the captain rhodes 
reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a sound 
distracts him

one of the ragtag zombies is running amok the zappers poke at the 
creature but that just makes it angrier

rhodes
get that thing away from the others
bring it here

one trooper has a long pole with a wire noose on the end he drops 
the noose over the wild zombies head and the wire tightens biting 
into the dead flesh on the things neck the pole is long enough to 
control the creature while keeping it out of reach

52	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

sarah watches repulsed but fascinated chico is still fighting the 
heaves without warning a zombie looms up directly behind chico the 
man jumps forward terrified he crashes into sarah who spins and 
sees the danger

two more zombies appear then a third these have no vests theyre 
ragtag bad ass and hungry as hell one of them grabs sarah she 
manages to pull away but behind her chico panics he raises his rifle 
andrattatattatatt

53	ext the clearing  day

rhodes hears the gunfire he seems pleased he grins

we have visitors lets go men

he moves slowly towards the thicket followed by toby tyler and 
several other soldiers he reaches down to his belt and pushes one of 
three buttons on a unit that resembles a pager electronic beeps 
like the ones we heard earlier come from the unit this time in a 
different pattern

the red coat zombies respond quickly they draw their pistols and go 
marching off after their leader grunting and snorting like bull 
apes rhodes grin breaks into a wideopen laugh

rhodes
hah if only the rest of you ladies would 
obey orders the way they do

54	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

their cover blown sarah now raises her rifle buddabudda

the second zombies head turns to red pulp and the thing pitches 
forward dead

chico fires and the third zombie is destroyed

suddenly there is distant fire from the clearing bullets whiz 
through the brush the guerilleros duck for cover

55	ext the clearing  day

the red coat zombies shuffling forward abreast in a line have 
opened fire its a grisly parody of footsoldiering the creatures 
are unsteady on their feet their hands shake when they squeeze the 
stiff armyissue triggers bullets fly this way and that most of 
them grossly off target

rhodes
thats it you wormeaten slime  you foul
smelling pussfaced maggots i told you 
id find you real action didnt i you 
corruption you filth youre learning 
youre getting bettergetting 
bettergetting better you scum

the trooper beside toby is another young man whose nickname is 
tricks he and toby exchange glances as they trudge along behind the 
captain and his zombie red coats their eyes tell us that they both 
think rhodes to be insane which of course he is

56	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

sarah moves to retreat but chico lifts his rifle and fires wildly 
into the clearing

chico
no nooooo noooooooooooooooo

57	ext the clearing  day

two of the red coats are hit but not in the head their brains keep 
functioning and they march on
	
rhodes
spread out men open fire

whatever else he is rhodes seems fearless he stands in the open as 
his human soldiers fan out he notices that the red coats are out of 
ammunition he pushes another button on his belt unit and more beeps 
sound the red coats stop in their tracks they dump the spent shells 
from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts 
their fingers are stiff three bullets fall to the ground for every 
one that finds its way into a gun chamber

the soldiers have opened fire now they are closing in on the 
thicket

58	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

chico is hit high on the right side of his chest sarah fires a quick 
burst out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into 
the jungle

suddenly from right behind sarahs back comes a blood curdling 
scream a dark figure looms up startling us all

miguel
burn the church kill the priest

its miguel sweating his eyes sunken into deep black sockets he is 
charging toward the clearing with his automatic blazing in his one 
good hand he thunders right past sarah almost knocking her down

59	ext the clearing  day

miguel breaks out of the thicket into clear view of the soldiers 
rhodes sees the onearmed wild man and his grin dissipated slightly 
he draws his own pistol an enormous magnum an elephant stopper

soldiers taken by surprise scatter toby and tricks among them 
miguels bullets draw a line across one soldiers chest he dies 
instantly

miguel
kill the priest burn the church
burn burn burn burn burn

now miguel is hit but he keeps coming his gun spitting

another soldier goes down hit in the mid section

the platoon returns fire

miguel is hit squarely in the chest he falls to his knees his rifle 
fires a line of bullets into the earth and the kicking of the gun 
knocks him back on his ass he sits there bewildered for a moment 
then he looks up to find himself directly facing captain rhodes

rhodes lifts his magnum but miguel is faster with his rifle in the 
next instant the muzzle is aiming straight for the captains stomach 
rhodes smile disappears replaced by a sudden flush of fear he 
freezes

miguel
kill the priest

miguel squeezes the trigger and his weapon clicks sharply its 
empty

the captains smile slowly returns he pushes the attack button on 
his belt unit

the red coats advance their pistols reloaded they fire stiffarmed 
and fumblefingered at miguel he sees them moving towards him 
something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what 
they arewalking dead

the first few bullets miss then one hits him in his stump and 
reality gets even clearer he starts to scream

the read coats walk closer their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the 
sport blam blam blam blam

another round hits miguel in the stomach another creases his head 
he tries to stand up but hes too weak a bullet in the neck stops 
his screaming then hes hit in the heart a ball of blood projects 
out of his mouth and he plops onto his back dead

the read coats keep firing until their guns are empty again rhodes 
calmly pushes the reload signal and the creatures obey

miguels corpse twitches for a short time then goes rigid

60	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

sarah sinks against a cypress when she sees miguel die

chico in a state of blind panic takes off along the edge of the 
thicket his wound bleeding profusely

61	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

chico breaks through some brush to find himself facetoface with 
toby tylers group of soldiers he stops reverses course and ducks 
into a cluster of palms one of the soldiers fires 
rattatattatattatatt

bullets rip the palm fronds apart theres a scream and chico 
somersaults out into view new wounds bleeding across the center of 
his chest

62	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

sarah realises that this is her last chance to escape she takes 
advantage of the confusion and the noise and bolts into the jungle at 
a full run

63	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

chico is still alive he fumbles for his holstered pistol but before 
he can draw it three troopers are on top of him tricks tromps a boot 
on his hand toby tyler aims his rifle squarely at his sweating brow

chico
yesyes do itpleaseyou cant let 
me die this wayplease destroy me a 
bulletin the headi dont want to 
becomeone ofone of them

toby looks down at the man at his terrible wounds clearly fatal 
ones toby clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his rifle his 
finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when captain rhodes 
strides up behind him

rhodes
take his weapon tyler

toby is startled by the voice at his back he turns towards the 
captain then he looks back down at the guerillero hesitating

rhodes
take his gun ass hole he still has the 
strength to pull a trigger

reluctantly toby obeys reaches down for chicos pistol

chico

rhodes

thenmaybei can help you out string 
him up

the third soldier reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under 
the arms tricks stoops to help chico screams in agony when he is 
moved toby lunges in to help the others thinking to ease the mans 
pain

rhodes

buckin for a shit detail lately so heres

toby grimaces but doesnt speak he turns and moves briskly towards 
the clearing rhodes watches him go

64	ext the clearing  day

toby nears the spot where miguel lies sprawled in a pool of blood 
rhodes calls from the edge of the thicket

rhodes

toby looks down at the remains of the onearmed guerillero

rhodes

really had the chance to get acquainted

65	ext the clearing  day

close on chico hes dangling from a rope which is tied over a tall 
tree his feet ten feet off the ground

zombies wander here and there theyve all received their rations 
the picnic is breaking up now occasionally one of them gets surly 
but it doesnt amount to anything soldiers stand ready with electric 
prods others with guns

paraphernalia is being packed away men carry equipment in the 
direction of the elevator

rhodes walks up beneath where chico is hanging hes careful not to 
step in too close he doesnt want to get any dripping blood on his 
uniform

chico

the man collapses unconscious

66	ext the clearing  day

close on the disembodied head of one of the dead soldiers tricks is 
dropping the thing into a large plastic bag which obviously already 
contains the second head toby wraps the mouth of the bag and begins 
to walk off rhodes stops him

rhodes
where are you going tyler

toby

heads

rhodes

toby
justfollowing procedure sir theyre 
entitled to burial

rhodes
i said ill take care of them just leave 
them there go help with the rest of the 
gear

rhodes has it in for toby well find out why later and of course 
the feeling is mutual toby sets the bag down on the ground and 
seething he trots off towards the rest of the platoon tricks 
follows

after a moment rhodes motions with his head the soldier with the 
long noose pole steps into view with the captive zombie the one that 
ran amok earlier the man follows rhodes towards the jungle dragging 
the gurgling creature along the wire noose digging into the things 
neck

67	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

close as rhodes gloved hand jams a hand grenade into the captive 
zombies gaping mouth the soldier with the pole releases the noose 
and the two men take off running

68	ext the clearing  day

they run to the middle of the clearing where they turn around to 
watch rhodes lifts a pair of binoculars that are strapped around his 
neck he stares through the lenses focusing grinning

69	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

through the binoculars we see the zombie staggering in the bush 
clawing desperately at the thing jammed in its mouth

70	ext the clearing  day

toby and tricks are the only ones who seem to notice what rhodes has 
done toby drops the crate he was going to carry off he stares in 
disbelief hatred on his face

71	ext the jungle near the clearing  day

wide shot as the head of the zombie disintegrates when the grenade 
explodes

72	ext	the clearing  day

rhodes grins as he watches the spectacle

suddenly a loud gunshot startles the captain he drops the 
binoculars and spins around he sees

chicos body dangling on the rope chicos head is bloody hes 
deadand wont come back to life hes been shot through the brain

rhodes
who fired that shot who fired that shot

soldiers stand around dumbly those with rifles in their hands 
quickly sling them onto their shoulders theyre all afraid of the 
captains wrath rhodes walks towards the line of men with fury in 
his eyes

rhodes
goddammit somebodys gonna tell me who 
fired that shot or ill have every last one 
of you chopped up for feed

his eyes spot toby standing behind the crate he dropped earlier his 
rifle slung

rhodes
step up here tyler

toby

toby shouts the word like a west point cadet and he bravely steps 
forward rhodes stares him down his anger turning sinister

rhodes
you fired that shot didnt you

toby
no sir

rhodes
let me see your weapon

toby hands over his rifle rhodes feels the barrel sniffs it

rhodes
its been fired

toby
in the battle sir

rhodes is sure hes found the guilty man and hes glad it turned out 
to be his favourite whipping boy his body relaxes visibly

rhodes
it may be that none of these chickenshits 
will talk while the whole troop is 
presentbut i know some of these men 
well im sure that a few private 
conversations will tell me what i already 
know you may have earned yourself some 
time in the stalag tyler
rhodes glances over at chicos body
cut him down thats another head for you 
to chop off leave it with the others take 
the rest of his body down to the freezers 
move it shit hill

toby moves off rhodes grin returns

cut to

73	int the cave entrance  evening

theres that giant sound again the rumble of the elevator were 
inside the place called the cave in a huge underground concrete 
bunker technicians and armed guards bustle around enormous 
hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from 
the surface riding on board rhodes and his platoon prepare to 
unload their paraphernalia

74	ext the jungle  evening

sarah sweating exhausted bleeding from cuts made by jungle 
branches wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve she has 
dipped it into a jungle stream cautiously she tastes the water 
decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth

the night birds suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes sarah 
look up standing across the stream only ten feet away is a 
particularly grotesque zombie vultures stand on the marshy ground 
beside the creatures legs their sharp beaks picking bloody holes in 
its ankles and feet

sarah jumps to her feet fighting back exhaustion one more time she 
unslings her rifle aims it then thinks better of firing grabbing 
up her supply pack she runs into the darkening jungle

75	ext	the jungle  evening

wham two big hands grab sarah by her shoulders she starts to scream 
but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth

john
its alright its alright dont be 
afraid were friends

sarah looks into the strong good face of john a tall muscular man 
a caribbean islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes 
that seem instantly trustworthy

john
there are soldiers near here guards ill 
take my hand away if you wont scream

sarah nods and john lets her go there are two other humans standing 
behind the big man theres bill mcdermott wearing the grease
covered jumpsuit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy 
from a hip flask and theres a smallish woman with a sensitive face 
who apparently out of character is armed to the teeth shes a deaf 
mute nicknamed spider and she is urgently signing come on lets 
get outa here with her hands

john
right we better get away from that bee he 
might have friends

the group starts moving sarah follows voluntarily we notice that 
all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw 
on the foot soldiers the ones with big orange circles

76	ext the jungle  evening

the group trudges through thick brushland occasionally needing to 
chop a path with their blades john speaks in low tones as they move

john

walking deadhere on gasparillas island

 sarah

john

long ago his name is bein borrowed these 
days by the long lost henry dickerson

spotted it couldwell it could be the 
end of everything

spider is signing for everyone to be quiet they all stop in their 
tracks bill mcdermott swigs some more brandy with the stealth of a 
mohican spider pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and 
peers through

77	ext entrance two  evening

theres a hatchway in sight built into a concrete bunker like 
structure four or five soldiers are coming up out of the ground 
theyre armed with prods and rifles

behind the men lurching on unsteady feet come a halfdozen of the 
living dead all wearing vests of white and blue

behind the lumbering creatures come a woman and a man both wearing 
white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards the woman is mary 
henried one of the top behaviouralists in the cave well learn a 
lot more about her later

the zombies are pushing through the undergrowth right in the 
direction of sarah and her friends sarah shows some alarm at this 
but john calms her with a strong hand

spider has seen the approaching danger she silently draws a farmers 
sickle from her belt with her other hand she draws a pistol for 
good measure bill mcdermott unarmed nervously takes another 
swallow from his flask

the zombies are getting closer too close for comfort

finally mary henried and the others turn and disappear into the 
bunker the last man down pulls the hatch shut

the moment the coast is clear spider and john jump up from cover 
the others follow their lead but its too late the zombies have 
spotted them the creatures begin to growl and make agitated ape
like sounds spider brings her blade up chesthigh ready to repel an 
attack sarah lifts her own machete but john reaches over and takes 
it away from her

john
give that to me get behind me stay behind 
me

sarah resists not understanding somewhat 
insulted

you aint wearin a vest they been taught 
not to touch the ones with the circles 
there aint no hundred percent allatime 
rules with the bees but mostatime they 
leave us alone the colour on their vests 
tell ya how much schoolin they got its 
the ones without colours you gotta watch 
out for

sarah gets behind john his orange circle acting as her shield he 
reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his 
back

the zombies snarling and showing teeth move through the thicket 
one shuffles right past spider and mcdermott it gets stuck in the 
bramble changes course and moves on without attacking

another zombie a white trudges within arms reach of john 
growling all the while suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes 
two angry steps towards the humans who back away

the zombies charges things happen quickly john pushes sarah away 
and swings the machete the blade sinks into the creatures skull 
blackened blood flies an instant later spiders sickle punches in 
beside the big knife the zombie twitches for a moment its eyes 
rolling then it falls lifeless to the ground

mcdermott trots up beside sarah he takes a huge swallow from his 
flask then offers some to her she puts the flask to her lips but 
nothing comes she holds it out neck down to show that its empty

mcdermott
sorry guess i dont know my own strength

john wipes sarahs machete on some thick leaves cleaning off most of 
the gore then he returns the weapon to the woman

sarah
thanks i can fight my own battles

john
i know you can like i said we been 
watchin you

mcdermott
we better get as far away from here as we 
can we can work the other side of the 
island tonight

john

cave so far and we aint got the whole 
thing near charted yet thats what we was 
doin out here today huntin for 
entrances

mcdermott
come on they find a bee done like this and 
theyll know somebodys been out walkin 
where they shouldnt have been

john bows his head over the downed zombie he mumbles softly we 
cant hear the words but we can tell that hes praying reciting the 
good words over the corpse of the whitecoat

sarah
the man i was withuntil today 
believed that praying was for blind men who 
couldnt see the truth

john

prayer or two

sarah

john

sarah
its a disease its aa buga parasite 
that infects the brain

john

john

yourself a trail

sarah is stopped by this she stares at the big man suspiciously not 
sure whether to believe him

john
we didnt see the exact spot but we know 
about where you landed but we aint ready 
to take you there not yet you seewe

sarah looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas she thinks 
for a momentnot very longthen she turns and starts off into the 
jungle

sarah

far

john
farther than you think youll get lost 
you will and theres bees all through the 
jungle i aint lyin to ya religiosos

sarah

sarah plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over 
her shoulder she disappears

mcdermott

john

mcdermott

the commotion well meet up at number six 
and go back home together

mcdermott
god save us and me with me flask dry ill 
never make it

the group splits up moving off in two different directions through 
the darkening underbrush

78	ext somewhere in the jungle  night

darkness has fallen the jungle is as black as the background on a 
velvet painting

sarah is moving cautiously she bumps into something jumps back her 
machete high and freezes cautiously she moves aheadone 
stepanotheranother

splash she steps down off a hidden ledge into a kneedeep river 
she manages to keep her balance but her machete falls into the water 
and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt slowly she bends 
down and reaches into the water a snake swims past just inches away 
sarah recoils before she can reach down again she hears a loud 
animal snort followed by a great splashing sound then another she 
squints to see

shapes approach on the black water alligators big ones just their 
very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman

she backs up feeling for the shore for the ledge behind her the 
first zombie grabs her shoulders she spins and sees the thing it 
has one eye dangling out of its socket and theres a brokenoff 
length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the 
left breast

sarah smashes her rifle butt into the things head again again it 
keeps coming so do the gators theyre getting to within a few 
yards sarah swings a fourth time the zombie grabs her rifle she 
pulls with all her might and the creature hanging on to the gun 
topples off the ledge and into the water

when sarah starts to climb up on the ledge another zombie lurches 
towards her from dry land she spins around looking for options the 
gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and the zombie 
that fell into the river is rising up again covered with moss and 
slime and looking pissed

sarah faces the zombie on the bank she has no choice she aims her 
automatic shes just about to fire when something flashes out of the 
darkness its a machete it cleaves open the zombies skull from 
out of the night big john appears he struggles to free his blade 
from the dead creatures head

sarah scrambles up onto the muddy ledge the gators are still moving 
in and the zombie its mosscovered arms reaching out rigidly like 
the arms of frankensteins monster is growling ferociously almost 
swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process

sarah
are you gonna pause to say words over the 
dead this time or can we be on our way

without answering john steams off through the bush pulling sarah 
along behind him his big hand tight around her arm

79	int the cave  night

close on a television screen first there is only video noise then 
an image blinks onto the screen

montage other video screens on monitors in various places throughout 
the huge underground facility zombies watch the screens gathered in 
groups of four six and eight like children in ranked classes

the screens show scenes of zombies taking food from humans in orange 
circle vests guns are pointed at orange circles then lowered 
harmlessly guns are pointed at humans without orange circles and 
fired the images repeat and repeat and repeat the zombies watch the 
scenes with dumb curiosity

80	int communication center in the cave  night

this is the central area for all varieties of communication there 
are radio consoles both intercom and outgoing there are video 
control panels and there are large computer terminals reflecting the 
panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck much 
of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in wires run 
every which way bare antennas and loose connectors clutter the 
place engineers scurry with tool boxes constantly repairing 
patching trouble shooting

most of the personnel are technicians but there is a group of 
scientific types obvious in their white lab coats among these is 
mary henried who we caught a glimpse of outside entrance two

at a security station a guard notices something on one of his own 
video screens which monitor key locations inside the cave

guard
theres activity in the dormitory

mary and one of her assistants julie grant a younger girl move 
over to the video console one screen there shows what looks like a 
prison corridor cells with heavily barred doors run down both sides 
we can see the distinct movement of shadows in the corridor mary 
reacts instantly stepping over to an intercom and pressing a send
button

voice os  filter
gate twentythree

mary
this is mary henried did anyone enter the 
dormitory

voice os  filter
yes mam captain rhodes

mary clicks off infuriated she hurries towards an exit followed by 
julie grant

81	int the dormitory in the cave  night

close on the mouth of a large plastic bag a hand wearing a black 
leather glove pulls a human head out of a bag by its hair its the 
head of one of the dead soldiers from rhodes platoon the hand 
belongs to rhodes himself

in the darkness of a cell a red coat zombies takes a hesitant step 
forward rhodes tries to shove the head through the bars but it 
sticks when rhodes lets go it stays there wedged at shoulder 
height

rhodes
take it friend take it its a present 
from me to you

the red coat steps forward and lays its hand on the head

rhodes
just remember who gives you favours

the zombie pulls hard and the head pops through onto its side of the 
bars the creature lurches off towards a cot in the shadows at the 
rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to ravish the head 
tearing flesh off eating it hungrily

on the cell door we notice a plaque with a number 5 and written in 
marker the red coats nickname bluto

rhodes moves past other cells each holding a nicknamed red coat 
grumpy stands way back in the shadows tonto stands near the bars 
growling fatso is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old 
who needs to pee

rhodes stops at a cell marked bub inside we see a silhouette 
tall erect not moving a muscle rhodes grins

rhodes
well bub ive heard about you miss 
henrieds pride and joy

rhodes steps closer and bub snarls warningly

rhodes
surly sonofabitch i want to make friends 
bub friends i have one more goodie in my 
sack here

a loud clanging sound interrupts rhodes turns to see

82	int the dormitory  night

mary henried and julie grant have entered through a steel door with 
electronic locks the zombies send up a chorus of moans and growls 
the women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass 
suddenly they stop in their tracks their horrified eyes staring into 
a cell marked samson

samson is nibbling on another head much of the flesh is already 
gone but we can still recognisechico the zombie turns the thing 
upsidedown reaches way inside through the neck and pulls out 
grey matter

julie backs away fighting nausea a spasm rises in marys stomach as 
well and she reels away from the hideous sight

rhodes
come come miss science youve seen 
worse

mary
goddamn you rhodes

rhodes
god has damned us all are my atrocities 
worse than yours

mary
you have ruined weeks of work here weve 
been trying to wean these specimens onto 
alligator meat

rhodes
no wonder theyre sohungry

suddenly julie screams her hands flying to her mouth

the plastic bag is still dangling from rhodes gloved hand inside 
pressed into the thin plastic we can see the rough outline of the 
final head the thing is squirming causing the whole bag to wiggle

rhodes drops the bag instantly to the floor taking care he grabs 
the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard the head rolls out 
and settles against a wall its eyes are open and darting crazily 
its mouth is chewing grotesquely on the air

mary stares in shock julie runs towards the exit trying to scream 
but gagging on her own acids shes hysterical

rhodes calmly draws his pistol cocks and fires the squirming head 
is shattered by the powerful bullet

83	int marys office in the cave  night

a 9 by 12 cubicle with a small computer terminal a desk and three 
chairs theres a lightbox on the wall displaying groups of cranial 
xrays

mary guides julie grant into a chair rhodes stands cockily in the 
open doorway

julie
i didnt realise those were decaps i 
didnt know thatdecaps revived

rhodes
any dead whose brains are intact will 
revive

julie
butwe bury the heads oh god it must 
be torture for them

rhodes
they are brutes without feeling though i 
admit that ive requested cremation for 
myself burial is an archaic tradition 
even more ridiculous now than it ever was 
to say nothing of thespacing 
problemon a small island like this

julie
i thought the purpose of decapitation was 
toto

rhodes
the purpose of decapitation is to preserve 
as muchfoodas possible the purpose 
for feeding is to keep the beasts on our 
side the fact that they can be taught to 
clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a 
convenient side benefit not the primary 
goal the primary goal is to keep ourselves 
from becoming their supper keep them fed 
and they behave keep them hungry and they 
revert back to being the animals that they 
have always been you saw them in there

mary
you gave them a fresh taste of blood

rhodes
they will never be satisfied with anything 
else miss henried they want human flesh 
im prepared to take whatever steps are 
necessary to see to it they dont get mine 
not while im still using it

julie has calmed herself down now she feels angry betrayed she 
looks at mary accusingly

julie
did you know about the decaps

mary
id never seen it before

julie
but you knew

mary nods in the affirmative tears form in julies eyes

julie
what else is there doctor what else do 
you people know that the rest of us dont

they stare at one another whatever bond once existed between them 
has been severed forever

84	int a conditioning room in the cave  night

there are cardiographs eeg monitors and all sort of physical 
conditioning devices on tables lie symbology cards and coloured 
blocks for dexterity testing there are large cutout shapes on the 
walls triangles squares and familiar orange circles

mary storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her rhodes 
catches it with his black leather gestapo boot

rhodes
you cant run away from the planet miss 
science you cant even run away from the 
island heh heh

mary
leave me alone youcocksucker

rhodes laughs loudly mary faces him hatred boiling away her 
vocabulary she cant think of word that are adequate

mary
youreyoure disgusting 
yourefilth

rhodes
and youre the one who builds the bomb and 
they says i hope itll never actually be 
used

mary is stoppedby her own guilt she turns and busies herself 
gathering books and papers then she clicks off a light and moves 
toward the doorway where rhodes stands

mary
calmer with method julie grant is a 
behaviouralist shes not medical she 
hasnt been asexposed toto 
thingsas some of the rest of us shell 
be alright ill talk to her shell be 
alright

rhodes
oh i have no doubt

mary
recognising threat in his voice if you 
put her on the shit list because of her 
reaction here tonight ill go to dickerson

rhodes
ah yes our noble gasparilla does seem to 
favour you lately i understand he assigned 
you a roommate of your choice the rest of 
us have to pick names out of a hat 

mary
reading his jealousy rhodes you and i 
had a roll in the hay together when i first 
got here it was a wholly unsatisfying 
experience which i do not want to and 
which i never will repeat so give up 
mister im going hometo that roommate 
you mentioned

mary pushes past rhodes into the hallway

85	int the hallway outside the conditioning room  night

mary starts down the hall but rhodes grabs her from behind he leans 
in close lusting pressing his lips against the back of her neck

mary
take your hands off me right now

an evil grin returns to rhodes flushed face he stares at the woman 
for a long moment then he lets go mary walks away bristling 
rhodes calls after her

rhodes
maybe youll change your mind when it 
starts getting too lonely for you

mary stops dead she turns back to see him gloating

rhodes
im not entirely without influence myself 
miss science i had your roommate 
assignedby gasparilla to my platoon 
whats his name tyler yes toby tyler

a bubble of fear pushes up in marys throat but she is only letting 
her anger show her stare is fierce her eyes daggers

rhodes
i had an unfortunate little runin with him 
today in factyou might say that mr 
tyler is in big trouble with 
theauthorities

mary
you better not mess with me rhodes id 
love to serve your balls to those red coats 
for lunch think about it

rhodes
no miss science youre the one who needs 
to do some thinking

he turns and walks away mary stands still for a time the sound of 
rhodes clicking bootheels surrounding her swallowing her in the 
deep background we can hear the moans of the caged dead

86	int the central chambers of the cave  night

montage as mary walks through huge open areas carved out of natural 
rock we are stunned at the enormity of the place jeeps and trucks 
rumble back and forth storage areas hold mountains of crates 
cartons water and gas canisters fork lifts shift loads from here to 
there

mary comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to manmade 
walls she enters past two security guards showing her id

87	int the residence  night

mary moves down a corridor with numbered doors on both sides we hear 
the sound of life music blasting voices laughing arguing crying 
people move by a man and a woman are fighting she slaps him he 
punches her she kicks him in the balls three hookers pound on a 
door the door is opened by a naked man wearing a dildo on his nose 
other men behind him laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke
filled room

mary stops in her tracks when she sees that outside a door numbered 
83 the door to her quarters there are two of rhodes soldiers with 
rifles in hand the door itself is open and shadows move inside

mary turns quickly before she is spotted and starts back through 
the hallway as she turns a corner she is grabbed by toby tyler

mary
tobythank godwait here i gotta find

toby

mary
some of rhodes men at the door

toby

monstermaker says

mary looks into tobys eyes shes hurt yet angry the kind of anger 
that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive 
guiltnerve

toby

anything ill send word ill let you know 
a time and a place to meet we probably

she grabs him holding him tightly against her they kiss hard and 
long toby pulls away looks at her lovingly then turns and starts 
toward the guarded apartment mary follows

toby
walking i dont know what theyre gonna 
do to me i figure theyll just send me out 
to stalag seventeen but ifif its worse 
than thattricks will know stay in touch 
with tricks

as they approach the door to number 83 the soldiers there raise 
their rifle to ready positions

soldier

toby

toby hands over his rifle and begins to unbuckle his pistol belt two 
more soldiers appear from inside the open apartment

mary

the charges

soldier

mary

she gives up she looks into tobys eyes

toby

said take care of yourself

the soldiers escort toby down the hall without force mary watches 
their backs for a time then she flings her books and papers angrily 
into the open apartment she begins to cry

88	ext entrance number six  night

hatchway number six is surrounded by protective fencing and from it 
a fenced alleyway runs off through the brush towardwe dont know 
what yet

the hatch opens and toby along with two other prisoners also 
disarmed troopers is led down that alleyway by three guards

john sarah and bill mcdermott peer out from nearby foliage they 
watch the procession john whispers

john
the fences make a safe pathway to stalag 
seventeen thats where we live thats 
where you gonna live too hells half 
acre its not a nice place them boys 
there is prisoners whats their 
punishment they sent out to the stalag for 
a few weeks thats punishment enough

spider seems to appear from nowhere she motions and the others 
follow her through the thick jungle

89	ext entrance to stalag seventeen  night

the running fence leads to a gate in a bigger fence this one is 
electrified we know this because we see a collection of zombies 
mostly civilians with no vests clambering there hands and faces 
sparking when they touch the chain links

the zombies send up wild moans and gurgles when toby and the other 
prisoners are led through the gate

inside the compound is a scattering of opensided military tent
buildings resembling those on mash theres a din coming off the 
place a mixture of music and voices that forms a disturbed blanket 
of noise the place seems to seethe like a hornets next

the soldiers head back for the cave as posted guards shut the gate 
behind the prisoners toby and the other captives move toward the 
village

90	ext stalag seventeen main street  night

people wallow in the mud one man has just taken a shit and is wiping 
his ass nearby a drunk lies unconscious several men are fighting 
its a brutal fight with bottles and pipes and lengths of chain the 
men are really hurting each other people smoke and snort and shoot 
up in wide open disarray

a huge pregnant woman plants herself right in tobys path

pregnant woman
how bout it baby im big but im 
beautiful

toby pushes past her and bumps into a surly drunk

drunk
hey you fuck you fuck

he grabs toby and flings him violently against an upright on one of 
the long huts the other two prisoners move on abandoning toby 
disappearing into the crowd the drunk pulls a rusted homemade 
knife

drunk
i oughta slice you up you fuck you cant 
push me around like push me 
aroundlike

suddenly vomit rises in the mans throat and he doubles over toby is 
aware of sounds behind him at his back in the hut a hairy fat man 
still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots is whambam
bamming a whore who is wearing everything but underwear and boots 
there are needle tracks on the womans arms and her face looks as 
though shes been beaten brutally she purses her deep red damaged 
lips and blows toby a kiss thats meant to be seductive

toby moves on down the street the place is a cesspool full of human 
dregs stinking with refuse filled with the fury and desperation of 
man in his last days

91	ext entrance to stalag seventeen  night

john leads his followers to within sight of the stalag gates zombies 
still claw at the electrified fence bluewhite sparks fill the air 
like flashbulbs

john

dont make the grade us that aintgood 
enough to live inside the cave we grow a 
little food do a little light 
manufacturinlike these here vests we 
make these for the massers we live in our 
own filth with bugs and snakes and disease 
and jungle feverall the time waitin to 
become breakfast for the bees

john is doing a sales job on sarah but everything he says is truth 
she hears it all softening to johns cause

spider has silently lifted a large wooden round out of the weeds 
its a camouflaged tunnel entrance

john
its a tunnel its a couple hundred yards 
just keep goin til you reach the end 
ill be right behind you

sarah starts down into the hole john and the others prepare to 
follow jungle sounds cover the noises they make

92	int the hospital in stalag seventeen  night

we see rows of homemade cots each with a body lying on top what 
faces we see are gaunt showing the boils and lesions of consumptive 
diseases and tropical fever insects buzz and there is thunder in the 
air

an oriental orderly lukey moves through the maze of bodies he 
lifts the wrist of a woman who looks dead and he discovers that she 
is dead indeed he hurries off

93	int hospital operating room  night

this is a room with walls an operating room with juryrigged 
appointments on a table under a halfdozen light bulbs lies a 
corpse another orderly a nordic type names diesel an enormous man 
assists while doctor logan methodically saws off the corpses head

lukey rushes in out of breath

lukey
doc logan doc logan deres a lady dead 
out dere gotta hurry gotta hurry dunno 
how long she been dat way maybe she 
gettin ready to come back

the corpses head rolls away from its body doc logan picks up an 
electric drill with a long bit whzzzzzzzzz he drives the spinning 
bit into the disembodied head deep into its brain when he pulls it 
out matter flies as the motor winds down

logan is a middle aged man he looks exhausted demoralised a bit 
mad and he looks as ill as some of his patients there are open 
sores on his face and he hasnt shaved for days hes covered with 
two week worth of blood stains he starts around the table leaving 
diesel to dispose of the decap

logan
bury the head call the guard for the rest 
get it off the table for now well bring 
this new one in

diesel doesnt respond right away hes heard something

logan
what is it

diesel
the tunnel

logan hears it now a scratching scuffling sound he looks at his 
watch

logan
god its almost sunup

logan and lukey move to a spot at the back of the room they remove 
several of the planks in the floor sarahs head pops out gasping 
for air logan recoils his eyes wide and frightened

logan
who are you who are you

he stands up too quickly dizziness makes him reel he smashes into 
an instrument cart comes up with a longbladed scalpel and holds the 
thing threateningly aimed at the stranger

john
its ok its ok doc shes with us

in the next moment sarah and the others climb out of the tunnel

john
this heres the hospital thats diesel 
over there the big guy this heres lukey 
and thats doc logan whos about to cut 
your tonsils out

spider the last one to climb into the room quickly begins 
collecting weapons what few the rebels have

john
this heres all the weapons we got thats 
why your fancy automatic looks so good to 
us we gotta stick it over here with the 
others for now they catch us with any kind 
o weapon and its death without even askin 
your name

sarah lets spider take her gun the deaf mute signs something which 
sarah cant decipher

john
ammunition you got ammunition in your pack 
there i hope you do or the gun aint worth 
much

sarah roots through her supply pack and produces three loaded clips 
and several boxes of loose shells john notices some tins of food 
medicines a knife a compass

john
we better just hide the whole pack 
darlin that stuff is just shoutin out 
that it come from the mainland the shit we 
get is all cd rations aspirins and 
crackers from 1958

spider snatches the pack away rather roughly sarah is a little 
disturbed by the action the material is stashed under floor boards 
beside the tunnel entrance

john
lets go you look like you could use some 
shut eye me too we can all get acquainted 
tomorrow

lukey escorts john and sarah out of the operating room into the main 
hospital area bill mcdermott pulls out his empty flask

mcdermott
doc i need a fill up ill help mself if 
its alright with you

logan nods distractedly and bill moves to a supply cabinet which 
contains among other essentials several bottles of brandy he fills 
his flask eagerly

logan
how do we know shes alright how do we 
know

mcdermott
shes alright christ rhodes and his 
cossacks wiped out her whole party dan 
near got her

mcdermott pockets the refilled flask takes a long slug from the 
cabinet bottle before putting it back and moves out of the room 
logan is left alone with diesel and spider

logan
how do we know shes alright how do we 
know

logan repeats his question intoned identically as it was before 
hes twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face the 
thunder suddenly seems louder

diesel
are you alright doc you look you look 
real bad

logan
i have looked bad for four years everyone 
in the world has looked bad for four years 
thank god looks dont matter as much as 
they once did

logan a wild gleam in his eye moves out of the room following 
where the others went that longbladed scalpel still clutched in his 
hand the others follow

94	int the hospital  night

john sarah and lukey are facing out across the compound a teeming 
tropical rain has started to fall

john
this just aint your day is it darlin 
sarah

sarah cant help but snicker suddenly her head spins exhaustion is 
conquering her body as last john puts a big arm around her

john
three more minutes then you can sleep you 
gotta stay with it for three more minutes

mcdermott joins them and the group moves out into the rain lukey 
waddles back through the maze of cots

logan spider and diesel have moved to about the center of the big 
room the patients around them their eyes bulging look like lemurs

logan
how do we know shes alright how do we 
know

the same intonation again this guys wrapping is definitely coming 
loose

the zombie rises up behind logans back its the woman whose wrist 
lukey checked earlier its teeth are dripping with drool its hands 
reaching out wantingly

logan turns around calmly but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake 
he shoots out the hand thats holding the scalpel the blade sinks 
deeply into the zombies forehead logan pulls it out and strikes 
again and again and again like a swordsman thrusting thrusting 
thrusting finally the creature collapses logan wipes the scalpel on 
his already bloodcovered apron rain water drops onto him from holes 
in the roof above he doesnt seem to notice

95	ext stalag seventeen main street rain  night

the street scene is toned down due to the late hour and the rain but 
just as vile just as vicious john and mcdermott escort sarah john 
speaks softly and only when others on the street are far enough 
away

john
they supply us with disinfectant and dope 
sex drugs and rockandroll what more 
could anyone ask for most around here 
aint interested in changin their lives 
the folks you metme and them and a 
couple others is the whole rebel army 
nobody else gives a shitand theyre 
afraid o rhodes

they pass a structure with an overhead sign that reads joes corner 
tavern if there were walls theyd be pushed out by the mass of 
humanity inside music blares and voices form a wall of noise louder 
than the thunder a fight spills out onto the muddy street pushers 
selling all sort of delights accost john and his group
	
sarah
they seem to be havin a good time some 
punishment

john
you disappear in here darlin you get a 
knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer 
veins you get lost out here and nobodys 
gonna notice rhodes he counts on that it 
all makes for food in the freezers

they come to a long hut with a sign that reads the ritz

john
this is your hotel im not gonna stay here 
with you but ill always be close you 
gonna hafta take care o yourself like you 
said you was able to do

sarah nods john smiles at her his warm trustworthy eyes seem to 
glow in the dark

john
some may notice that youre new just deny 
it youll get away with it nobody really 
looks at each other around here go on in 
get some sleep

he squeezes her hand tightly then he turns away and moves off with 
mcdermott sarah moves into the ritz

96	int the ritz rain  night

it resembles the hospital there are rows and rows of cots some 
people sleep alone and in pairs others are awake drinking 
screwing shooting up sarah finds an empty cot and flops down 
beyond the open walls she can see the bluewhite flashes coming from 
the electrified fence rain leaks in on her but it doesnt keep her 
from falling asleep

97	int the conditioning room in the cave  morning

technicians are working with zombies while armed guards stand ready 
we focus on a blue coat under supervision the thing is fumbling to 
tie a shoelace its failing miserably but trying hard another blue 
is busy placing little wooden shapes into their proper holes in a 
board

two red coats sit at a table attended by human technicians weve 
seen these zombies before in the dormitory tonto isor wasa 
native american probably seminole in front of him is a plate 
containing several bits of meat he has a fork in his hand and he is 
idly stabbing at the meat

the other red coat bluto looks just like bluto from popeye bulky 
with a thick black beard tired of the jig saw puzzle hes working 
on he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on tontos plate he 
snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth as soon as he tastes 
it however he pulls it back out dribbling and spitting 
disgustedly

fisher a technician
they wont accept a substitute they want 
their alpo

tonto has succeeded in forking a piece of meat he moves it to his 
mouth and pops it in

fisher
alright way ta go kemosabe

mary henried has entered the room she pulls up and watches  tonto 
with a kind of dubious interest tonto stops chewing he looks up 
with exaggerated sadness on his face slowly his mouth opens and the 
chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips he throws his fork 
down angrily

mary
they wont learn to use forks if they dont 
like the breakfast youre serving ted

fisher
the fork is like a game to them if they 
get into the game maybe theyll learn to 
like the food

mary
it wont work

suddenly bluto jumps up from the table he flings his chair aside and 
tromps right over to mary his arms are outstretched and he is making 
a pleading karlofflike sound guards come after him but mary waves 
them off

mary
its alright leave him alone

mary extends her right hand to meet blutos right and they shake 
vigorously then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around 
his brain sends no signal as to what he should do next the guards 
lead him away

98	int the firing range in the cave  morning

blam a red coat is firing a pistol right at the lens

close on a target a flat cut out silhouette of a man black 
triangles painted on the instantkillzones brain heart bullets 
strike the neck the to torso some ricochet off the wall behind 
none hit the killzones

mary henried enters the place resembles a police department target 
range red coats stand in stalls and fire down long alleys at targets 
which pop up against the opposite wall the noise is deafening two 
technicians are watching the shooters and keeping score mary walks 
up to one of them

mary
have you seen julie grant this morning

technician
she should be in the behaviour rooms

mary
shes not hasnt shown up yet

theres an offscreen groan the sound of a zombie trying to 
communicate mary turns and sees the tall red coat names bub standing 
in the closest stall trying to attract marys attention he was the 
one rhodes referred to last night as marys pride and joy he is 
wearing westernstyle gun belts sixshooter hang in holsters on both 
his hips mary faces bub full with her body and delivers a military 
salute

mary
good morning bub

bub replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean 
something to him then he too salutes mary pulls away heading for 
an exit but bub calls after her he makes inarticulate sounds but we 
catch his drift

technician
i think he wants you to watch

mary
ok bub do your stuff

bub turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a 
western street theres a humming mechanical sound katchung a 
silhouette pops up bub slaps leatherfast lighting fast both 
gun come up blamkablamkablamblamblamblam

holes appears in the targetwopwoppetywhump all in the kill
zones or damn close

bub slaps one pistol back into its holster he clicks open the shell
chamber on the other dumps the spent cartridges and begins to reload 
from his belt

mary stares at the creatures back mixed emotions showing on her 
face bub turns to face her dropping a bullet he salutes again 
mary hesitates then salutes back

mary
very good bub thatsvery good

99	int a locker room in the cave  morning

spider

100	int the council chamber in the cave  morning

this is a large situations room that is serving now as government 
headquarters in a big stuffed office chair behind a desk flanked 
with flags sits governor henry dickerson former of florida now of 
the world aka gasparilla

at tables sit a dozen or so councilmen dickersons cronies from the 
old doral country club close friends who were offered asylum in the 
private underground shelter now they sit in council yessing 
everything the boss man says

a state prosecutor has a desperatelooking prisoner on the floor 
standing with his hands cuffed

wave transmitter in his quarters hes 
charged with the theft of that equipment 
from a government installation and with 
possession of an illegal radio

gasparilla munches on some fruit hes a fat man with a handlebar 
moustache that makes him look like pancho villa as an indication of 
rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a hawaiian shirt 
with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern around his neck nestled 
in the rolls of fat there is enough gold to stake a small business

prosecutor
i can only suggest that the court rule in 
favour of the ultimate penalty for this 
traitor

gasparilla

tommy lee you and rhodes

we now see that rhodes is present looking on with a smile

he takes a big wet bite out of a peach

gasparilla

guards drag the screaming prisoner from the room gasparilla flops 
back in his chair flustered but unscarred his skin is about a foot 
thick he pitches the peach and grabs up a mango mary henried enters 
the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair gasparilla checks the 
docket on his desk smiles and looks up at mary

gasparilla

hand miss henried shut the hell up

marys eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up 
gasparilla plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his 
fingers on his military jacket

rhodes

mary checks herself theres a perverse air of danger fuming off the 
fat general his attitude toward mary has clearly changed rhodes has 
been working on him mary seems to have lost this round she can only 
hope thats all shes going to lose

gasparilla

forms o physical therapy

mary shoots a hatefilled eye full at rhodes the captain responds 
with a phoney look of sympathy

101	int gasparillas gymnasium  night

the place is full of exercise equipment treadmills weights a 
nautilus etc there are other items which seem contradictory plush 
pillows a huge circular bed surrounded by mirrors delicacies of 
food and drink lie about on low tables the room is a cross between 
elaine powers and a harem chamber

a huge coffinshaped device opens and we see that the inside is lined 
with ultraviolet tubes which are covered with plexiglass gasparilla 
lounges inside the thing sweating having just taken a long dose of 
fake sunshine

all around are the councilmen some with countryclub type women 
conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery obviously 
wives left over from the good old days and some with scantily clad 
courtesans

other scantily clad bunny types are serving horsdoeuvres and 
pouring wine offering smoke and snort

mary henried is sitting on the floor lost in fluffy pillows her lab 
coat incongruous rhodes watches her from nearby

gasparilla
awrite cmon ladies off with it and on 
with itha ha ha

music blares and several of the courtesans spring up stripping off 
what few clothes they are wearing some strip naked others down to 
panties they hop onto various exercise machines and begin to 
workout tits flopping thighs pumpinggasparillas kind of 
entertainment

gasparilla
oh lordy lordyim drunk as a skunk 
look at thiswill ya jus loooooook at 
these lovelies say henried you ever try 
it with another woman

mary looks up at the general not knowing whether or not she should 
answer afraid of what he might try to make her do

gasparilla
ive tried it with boys too strenuous

four more women have brought in silver platters full of new hors
doeuvres prepared carefully and laid them out like sushi theyre 
distributed and people eat them

gasparilla
folksi just couldnt resist how dyall 
like those how do those taste

guests look up not knowing what to expect mary fears the worst she 
looks around to see rhodes grinning a knot comes up into her throat 
she tries to swallow it down

gasparilla
fresh from the freezers folks its 
whattheyeat

a few of the guests are revulsed one man starts to vomit and he runs 
from the room

gasparilla
just kiddin folks just kiddin would i 
do a thing like that i ask ya now would 
i hah ha ha ha ha

relief spreads and the bacchanalian atmosphere restores itself 
gasparilla spills himself out of the tanning coffin and flops down on 
some pillows near mary he grabs up a goblet and swills red wine 
which runs down his front

gasparilla
the great state of florida people came 
here fer years ta die retire and expire 
the rest o the country used ta think we

fogies hah now this heres the new 
capital o the world hah they came

gasparilla swallows another huge quantity of wine

dissolve to

102	int the gymnasium  night

the room is empty now remnants of food and drink clutter the place 
the fat general is asleep snoring loudly one of his pudgy arms is 
draped across mary henrieds lap she is trying to move out from 
under without waking the man she slides on the floora few 
inchesa few inches more gasparilla snorts and rolls over his 
eyes pop open focus on mary and a smile pushes his fat cheeks back

gasparilla
well hi there yall

mary looks down at the man repulsed and afraid suddenly he grabs 
her lab coat she pulls away and he crawls after her his belly 
bouncing along the floor buttons pop and the coat falls open he 
reaches for her blouse it tears away and for a moment he gets a 
chubby handful of bare breast he dives into her but hes unconscious 
before his face reaches her chest

mary pulls herself out from under his dead weight shivering she 
clutches her blouse together and hurries out of the room

103	ext entrance to stalag seventeen  dawn

light is just breaking through the trees when the gates are opened 
admitting five uniformed men into the compound outside the fence 
zombies clamber excitedly as always

104	int the ritz  dawn

against the upright of the sleeping hut

rhodes

rhodes is standing near the entrance four soldiers are doing the 
pounding stunned diseaseridden faces look up as citizens are 
awakened from sleep fear sweeps through the place like a tropical 
wind

two cot people who happen to be at close range they tumble to the 
dirt floor dead before they hit

rhodes scans the rest of the hut he spots a familiar face the 
prisoner from the council room the one gasparilla saved from a death 
sentence the man makes the sign of the cross knowing whats coming 
blam blam rhodes fires two rapid rounds and the prisoners chest 
turns red he flies off his cot into one adjacent landing on top of 
a screaming woman

rhodes and his men leave as abruptly as they entered sarah is 
stunned as people around her react with sobs and more screams she 
locks her eyes on rhodes

he is moving authoritatively down the street just outside the open
walled structure he passes within inches of sarahs cot which is 
right against the outside rail her emotions well up inside her she 
is about to jump out into the street when a big black hand grabs her 
arm its john who has pushed through the gathering crowd outside

liquid into a test tube the liquid is sweating slowly out of a 
mildewed and rotting stick of dynamite which has been softened to 
nearmelting by jungle heat

woman sally and a man jack each have their own dynamite stick 
each is transferring liquid sweatwhich is of course nitro 
glycerineinto a glass tube they work in tense silence on the 
operating table

suddenly his hands starts to tremble

logan

spider reaches over and as gently as possible takes the vial and 
the dynamite out of the doctors hands she sets the tube in the rack 
and returns the dynamite to an open crate years old and crusted with 
mildew and mud still halffilled with sticks yet to be drained the 
danger passed they all breathe a sigh of relief logan wipes the 
river of sweat from his face his hands are shaking quite violently

more

toby

the right to be their judges just like

john opens the door and toby exits sarah follows john looks around 
at the faces in the group then he leaves shutting the door behind 
him theres a long silence then logan speaks

logan

us in the bible they shall be driven from 
the land of the living down to the world of 
the dead that is the fate of those who 
care nothing for god

their bells down these are daturas nightshades indigenous to 
southern florida and parts of the caribbean

off the eighteeninch blossom and stuffing them into large leaf bags

shes sweating rivers her fists are clenched shes biting her lover 
lip so that it bleeds

suddenly a zombie lunges from the underbrush its face badly 
deteriorated and one of its hands lost during its human life 
replaced by a mechanical hook spider stumbles she holds her breath 
and stiffens all her muscles miraculously the nitro vials inside her 
do not explode logan throws himself quixotically in front of the 
zombie

logan
fallen angel this is the judgement day 
when you will burn for your sins the lord 
will cast you down to the lower reaches and 
you shall forever know

thwok the zombies steel hook sinks deeply into logans upper 
chest the mans eyes reflect no immediate sensation his speech 
falters but only slightly

logan
you shall forever know the pain the 
pain

the zombie pulls logan towards its drooling wide open mouth its 
just about to bite when diesel chops his machete into the center of 
the creatures skull the thing falls pulling logan still hooked 
to the ground with it

logan
you shall forever know the pain of hell 
the pain of hell

diesel frees the doctors shoulder from the hook blood flows freely 
diesel grabs a handful of dressings from logans pack and goes to 
work on the wound

to swing his upper torso completely down inside

116	int the vent  night

toby hangs upsidedown in a rush of air he tightens a hospital mask 
over his nose and mouth

toby
okay lemme have em

a leaf bag is passed in from above toby flags the bag open and bits 
of flower and pollen dust fly through the tight space sucked off 
into the duct

117	int the communication room  night

close on a grill near the ceiling bits of toxic pollen and an 
occasional piece of flower blow into the room

there are six technicians and two security guards posted at various 
stations a radio man looks up

radio man
whats that smell it

technician
dunno must be comin from outside kinda 
nice

118	int entrance number seven  night

there are only two guards posted at the sealed entrance one is 
eating from a can of spam the other is reading an old dogeared 
playboy a rifle barrel jabs suddenly into playboys back

julie
dont move

its julie grant marys disgruntled assistant a young man another 
behaviouralist in a white lab coat is with her they both have 
rifles

julie
open the outer door move it

playboy slowly gets up and starts towards a control panel at the 
last minute he spins around grabbing julies gun barrel and pushing 
it away julies young accomplice swings his rifle butt and knocks 
playboy cold then he trains the weapon on spam man again

julie moves to the controls examines them trips a toggle marked 
lock and pushes a large green button

the door to the outside swings open beyond is blackness with an 
occasional patch of moonlight on jungle growth julie walks slowly 
carefully toward the opening just as she is about to cross the 
threshold into the night a huge figure leaps at her grabbing her 
rifle and enclosing her in a strangle hold its diesel behind him 
comes jack his rifle sarahs rifle levelled off at julies young 
friend

spam man makes a break for it down the hall reacting nervously 
too quickly jack fires spam man is hit squarely in the back he 
pitches forward dead

the young scientist raises his gun

young man
hey what the hell

jack fires another burst and the orange circle on the young mans 
chest show a dotted line of red he flies back a surprised 
expression on his face and he flops dead right on top of the 
playboy guard who is lying near the control booth

logan
enough enough enough enough

the doc comes slowly out of the night guiding spider over the 
threshold and into the hall logan reminds us of a crazy john 
houston floating on air in a madmans bubble

julie
whatwhat is this who

logan
its alright its alright my dear youve 
simply helped us do the lords work

logans shoulder wound is bleeding through its dressings but the 
doctor on a holy mission seems to feel no pain he guides spider 
into the light and opens her shirt diesel shoves julie against a 
wall jack covers her with his automatic

logan removes redsoaked dressing from spiders skin all over her 
bare chest and upper belly we see long eightinch scars hastily 
stitched with suture showing beneath each is a cigarshaped bulge 
where a vial of nitro has been implanted the woman stands on 
crumbling legs her arms open outward a grotesque lampoon of a 
stigmatic

julie
whatwhat have you done to her

logan
god forgive us forgive us the pain we 
inflict as surgeons well be in heaven 
child soon well be with him in heaven

spider
nanaakaaaaaaaaaa

spider is trying to signal something she has seen that playboy is 
crawling into the control booth logan follows her alarmed gaze

logan
no you dont i cant let you do that i 
cant

logan charges toward the booth the guard is halfinhalfout of the 
glass chamber his hands reaching for the control panel inside logan 
starts to kick him again and again

jack
outa the way doc outa the way

theres vengeance on logans face hes kicking the guard brutally 
but that doesnt stop the man from reaching the controls he hits a 
red alarm button the panel buzzes and coloured lights blink the 
door to the jungle starts to swing closed diesel dives at it but 
cant stop the steel slab it slams with a loud thunnnnng

jack swings into another position to get a clear shot and he fires a 
long burst into the control booth playboy is struck by several 
rounds he bounces around in the booth and collapses to the floor 
dead

logan his shoulder wound pouring blood aggravated by his physical 
exertion falls to floor himself in a faint

jack
shit

diesel
keep the woman covered

jack levels off on julie again diesel moves over to spider pulling 
fresh dressing from logans bag the big man begins to pack them onto 
spiders bleeding chest

119	int the communication room  night

close on a blinking rectangle of red light written on its face is 
alarm  gate 7 a bell rings loudly in the room the shot widens and 
we see five men all slumped unconscious none able to react to the 
alarm

one of the security guards has made it to the exit he manages to 
push the door open but then he falls in a heap

a radio man staggers into a webbing of wires then he too falls

the other security guard inches his hand towards a lever with a 
protective cover he flips the cover up then collapses the falling 
action causes his fingers to trip the lever a huge klaxon sounds a 
blinking rectangle huge over the doors reads general alert

120	int gasparillas gymnasium  night

the usual scene here gasparilla and his courtesans entertaining the 
councilmen and their ladies the klaxon sounds over the loud rock 
music mary henried a prisoner for the evening again hears the 
sound her eyes widen she looks over at rhodes who jumps to his 
feet the party gradually goes silent

rhodes
dont be alarmed were impregnable stay 
where you are nothing will happen to any 
of you youre safe here men

this last word to a small unit of four troopers standing guard at the 
exit rhodes goes steaming through the doors two of the troopers 
follow the other two unsling their rifles and take up posts just 
outside in the corridor the steel door slides shut locking 
gasparilla and his court inside the gymnasiummary henried with 
them

gasparilla
well cmon ladies and gents who says we 
gotta let our evenin get spoiled simon 
sezget down

most of the guests are willing to let the party get back to full 
swing gasparilla grabs a topless courtesan and rocks his fat belly 
around in an attempted dance mary seems to be the only one concerned 
about the alarm

121	ext the jungle  night

even outside the klaxon can be heard toby and the rebels stop in 
their tracks

toby

the first guard hits a button and the big steel entrance door swings 
open the rebels storm in like an ocean wave taking the hapless 
guards completely by surprise they knock them unconscious and take 
their weapons toby pushes a button which causes the outer door to 
swing shut then he leads the band down the corridor

they go through a door about a hundred yards from the entrance

both directions mary henried is stopped by a nurse standing in an 
open doorway

rhodes and eight troopers turn a corridor and there before them is 
a sight out of draculas tomb moving through the lavastone arches 
between the giant earthen pillars is the army of blue and white 
zombies rhodes and his men cant possibly fight them there are too 
many rhodes spots a door with a caged red light overhead they can 
get to it by slicing through only a few of the advancing ghouls

rhodes
this way over here shoot shoot them 
shoot to kill in the head

their rifles blaze as they drive through the edge of the zombie 
horde several of the creatures go down their heads blasted open by 
rapidfire rounds

one grabs rhodes by the sleeve of his jacket the captain turns on 
his heels and stares at the thing with outraged disbelief he raises 
his magnum and pumps two quick shells into the creatures brain

the platoon finally reaches the door rhodes holds it open while his 
men run inside he holsters his pistol and unslings his automatic 
the zombies press towards him he selects a few of the closest ones 
aims and fires with a look of enjoyment on his face for a moment 
he resembles doc logan madness bristling inside him

the zombies fall their heads shattered one of rhodes men calls 
from inside the doorway

trooper
captaincaptain

rhodes fires another quick burst then he turns and moves through the 
doorway

141	int a corridor in the cave  night

corner nervous jack opens fire two soldier go down a gunfight 
erupts as the rest of the troops scatter in the hallway civilians 
are caught in the crossfire two are hit

diesel manages to steer spider around a corner to safety jack keeps 
firing but hes trapped in a hail of bullets a red line cuts across 
his chest and he flies back dead his gun still firing

out of the troopers sight diesel checks his map and moves into a 
doorway one of several on the area guiding spider through beside 
him

in grotesque harmony the song of the living dead that weve heard 
before

146	int the gymnasium  night

slabs wont budge suddenly gasparilla appears drawing a pistol from 
a holster he wears without warning he shoots one of the guards the

the children to an opposite exit

out target figures in the range the red coats are watching with 
curiosity cocking their heads

mary moves to fire again but bluto grabs her hand

grasps his hand and shakes vigorously when he finally lets go she 
aims her pistol again and fires at the vest several more times

mary

the zombies are confused exasperated mary tears off her own vest 
and tosses it down the alley the red coats look befuddled and a 
little angry mary fires at the vest she threw down two bullets hit 
it before marys pistol clicksempty

theres a pounding at the door its rhodes and his troop

suddenly bub steps into position whap one of his famous quick 
draws blam he fires the vest on the floor marys vest is hit

hit squarely in the center of its orange circle

she turns and hurries off bub joins his fellows in pursuit of 
rhodes and his men

153	int the gymnasium  night

a womans face is full screen she is screaming in agony as she is 
torn apart by zombies the creatures have invaded the gymnasium 
theyre clawing at the fatcat councillors mauling their women

gasparilla and two other men are rolling around crazily bumping into 
exercise machines knocking over wine bottles and tables full of 
horsdoeuvres the single vest they are fighting over rips apart 
into two pieces its orange circle severed into two useless halves

gasparilla backs across the floor his blubber bouncing he has a 
tattered piece of the vest clutched in his hands he tries to spread 
it out on his chest but its too late and the zombies are too 
hungrymuch too hungry

montage as all over the room they strike this is it gore fans the 
gross finale the intestinetugger the zombies get their supper 
they feast among the pillows like romans at an orgy music still 
plays over the gymnasium speakers rockabilly in a gleeful tempo

gasparilla has retreated into his tanningcoffin but a pudgy arm and 
a leg are dangling outside zombies chew hungrily on the juicy 
morsels from inside the coffin where ultraviolet glows brightly 
come the piercing agonised screams of the fat general

154	int the main chamber of the cave  night

diesel guides spider through the huge earthen archways zombies here 
are scattered now but they provide for delays diesel fires and 
zombies are hit but few are hit fatally diesels free arm cant fire 
accurately while hes trying to support the walking bomb beside him

diesel stops to check his map a zombie looms up behind him and takes 
a huge bite out of his shoulder diesel screams he lets go of spider 
who stumbles away from him almost falling but saving herself her 
eyes are bugging with pain

diesel fires point blank at the zombie blowing its head to bits 
more creatures are pressing in close diesel bats at one kicks 
another punches a third then he rushes to spiders side and scoops 
her into his arms again wincing in pain from the bleeding wound in 
his shoulder he manages to move out of immediate danger

the zombies lumber after the two groaning in chorus as they walk

155	int the corridor at exit five  night

sarah and john are waiting for them near the open door which leads 
out into the jungle toby and mary rush into each others arms and 
they flee with the others out into the night

156	int a corridor near the dormitory  night

rhodes and his men rush into another corridor where they are met by a 
crowd of drooling zombies the men open fire but the zombies are too 
close in they get the upper hand

rhodes fires his magnum his eyes insane his face boiling red with 
disbelief after two shots blast open the heads of the closest 
zombies the magnum just clickclickclicks rhodes is out of lead

hes grabbed by one zombie then another he fights to free himself 
but hes bitten oncetwice

bleeding he fights on he struggles to a doorway and pushes through

157	int another corridor  night

faces off ready to draw those sixguns that hang at his hips rhodes 
turns and runs

whap bub slaps leather blam blam blam rhodes turns a corner but 
one bullet bites him on the back of his shoulder terrified fighting 
pain he staggers on with the guntotin red coat following behind

the sign of the cross over the corpse then she stands to see that 
john is waiting for her he holds out his hand she takes it and 
follows the others

159	ext the backwater  night

the soldiers aboard the fishing boat hear noises coming from the 
surrounding jungle

soldier

john os

blast you

the soldiers hesitate looking around at the dark jungle

toby os

a sudden burst of automatic fire lights up the black foliage the 
soldiers react flinging their weapons over the side into the water

the refugees spill out of the undergrowth and scramble over to the 
boat lifting the children and the wounded tricks on board carefully

john pauses to look back into the jungle

john

worse

mcdermott

mcdermott tries to slug from his flask finds it empty with a shrug 
he tosses the thing into the backwater the engine starts as john 
climbs aboard sarah and toby giving him their hands

160	int the main chamber with diesel and spider  night

161	int the laboratory area with rhodes and bub  night

these two sequences will be intercut for parallel action

zombies are crawling all over diesel now he fights them off 
valiantly but his super strength is waning he is bitten again and 
again but he tries to keep himself between the clutching creatures 
and the little deaf mute who is stumbling along ahead shes getting 
very close to a huge set of concrete slabsthe doors to the powder 
magazine

meanwhile rhodes approaches another corner in the hallway near the 
conditioning room bub follows his boot heels clicking the way 
rhodes own heels once clicked

rhodes dives for the corner bub slaps leather and fires off all 
twelve rhodes rolls on the ground crazily hes hit several 
timesbut hes still alive he pulls himself in agony out of 
range calmly bub dumps out his spent shells and starts to reload

in the main chamber diesel is overcome dragged down by a mob of 
zombies they start to tear him apart bit by bit

spider walks on alone she is just a few feet from the powder 
magazine now a zombie grabs her from behind but just gets a handful 
of shirt spider reaches forward but the creature holds her back her 
shirt is running rivers of blood now where the vials are implanted 
underneath

rhodes crashes through a doorway into the conditioning room he 
realises too late that theres no exit bubs bootheels are getting 
louder rhodes crawls around behind the tables full of testing 
equipment wooden shapes flash cards scatter over near the large 
coloured symbols which are mounted on the wall theres a weapons 
cabinet rhodes grabs a chair and smashes open the glass

bub steps into the open doorway still reloading his pistols he 
stands there a golem his fingers slowly calmly working he drops a 
shell or two but soon the barrels are filled with fresh loads

rhodes reaches in through the broken glass and pulls out an 
automatic

bub slaps his pistols back into their holsters and face off

rhodes lifts the automaticaims

bub draws blam blam blam blam blam blam blam blam blam 
blam blam blam each one of the twelve bullets hits rhodes 
somewhere many of them in the killzones he screams when the 
first few rounds hit but his screaming stops about halfway through 
the barrage thats when he dies his leg bones support his corpse 
long enough for the last six bullets to reach him then as the sound 
of bubs gun echoes away down the corridors rhodes body slides down 
the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap leaving much of his 
blood on the orange circle thats mounted behind him

in the main chamber a zombie takes a bite out of spiders shoulder 
it pulls out a big chunk of flesh and with it stuck in the 
creatures teeth comes one of the nitro vials

several zombies are pulling at the woman she is still reaching for 
the powder magazine doors but the ghouls are pulling her away

the creature with the test tube in its mouth pulls the bothersome 
thing out from between its teeth it studies the vial curiously for a 
moment then it tosses it angrily towards spider toward the magazine 
door

kablooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom

162	int the main chamber efx  night

a hallacious fireball rips through the cave

163	int the conditioning room  night

bub stands in the open doorway staring at rhodes still twitching 
corpse he slaps his sixguns back into their leather holsters then 
he shoots off one of those military salutes of hisjust as the 
walls fall in on him

164	ext the fishing boat  night

the refugees stare toward the island as a huge booooom fills the 
night some of the younger children start to cheer as though watching 
fireworks on the fourth of july

body of tricks hes dead the woman pulls a blanket up over his 
head toby steps forward his pistol drawn he pulls the hammer back

in the jungle behind the sand its an eerie scene

sarah is sitting up her rifle ready in her lap watching the body 
john steps in behind and she startles

he settles easily down beside the woman the two stare together at 
the shrouded corpse

sarah

john

dust and blows away on the wind

the body lies silent rigid under the khaki army blanket that rises 
and falls rises and falls with the gulf breeze

its the movement of red letters that spin up off the head of the 
corpse and settle before our eyes

the letters read the end i promise
