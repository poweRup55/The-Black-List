	open to

	a flash of lightning rips the hollywood pictures logo away and we
	find ourselves in the middle of

1	ext stormy sea  night

	superimposed south china sea

	the dark blue waters roil and boil and foam thunder cracks lighting
	flashes

2	ext underwater  night

	an enourmous japanese bathyscaphe freefalls through the water an
	autonomous fifteenman submersible almost futuristic in its design
	the nose cone is an amazing ultrahighpressure plexidome lettering
	along the side tells us this is the shinkai 90000

	computer printed across the screen are the words

		assignment		geological exploration
					suboceanic seismic research
					tectonic plate surveillance

		addendum		about to break the worlds record
					for the deepest dive

3	int shinkai 9000  night

	the japanese captain watches a dld laser tracking system and barks
	oneword questions to his japanese crew the sailors work the consoles
	and give clipped monosyllabic answers

	the japanese science officers go over charts on the electronic
	position board a contiuouslyshifting graphic representation of the
	ocean contours below

	behind them is an elaborate depth gauge with computerized graphics
	read 34000 feet and dropping the crew works at a fevered pitch

	an alarm sounds as the depth gauge sounds 35000 feet all eyes on the
	depth gauge several science officers share excited looks

4	insert on the depth gauge 35100  35200  35300  35400

	the excitment builds even the captains weathered eyes widen and
	then as the depth gauge hits 35801 feet below sea level the entire
	crew breaks into cheers whoops handshakes and highfives

5	ext shinkai 9000  night

	as it continues its descent it passes corroding metal drums leaking
	toxic waste radioactive waste dumped in the depths away from prying
	eyes and populated areas

	the vessel drops into the sulu basin imagine the grand canyon under
	forty thousand feet of water but the sulu basin is ten times the size
	of the grand canyon down here ten thousand fathoms below the storm
	all is calm

	the dual turboprops on the ear of the submersible kick on the
	bathysaphe is now mobile it glides down the side of an enormous rock
	face carefully avoiding massive sandstone pinnacles which jut up from
	the ocean floor far below

									dissolve to

6	ext deep sea  night

	the shinkai hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate

	a robotic arm extends out from under the plexidome its hand is a
	hightech laser cutter it approaches the plate steadies then fires
	a direct blue beam at the bedrock burns the rock into magma and cuts
	a perfect round pattern

	another robotic arm reaches forward its claw rips out the cut rock
	from inside the pattern then takes the sample and sets it inside a
	hydrobasket on the submersibles port side

									dissolve to

7	ext mindinao deep  night

	a desolate barren spooky place nothing breathes nothing lives or
	so it would appear the creepy foreboding musical score tells us
	otherwise the shinkai enters a huge rock fissure

8	int shinkai 9000  night

	the captain and the science officers stare through the plexidome and
	out into the freezing cobalt blue of the palawan trough the music
	intensifies as they round each curve then dead ahead is the end of
	the trough which is halfblocked by a rockencrusted embankment the
	music builds

	the shinkai approaches the embankment slowly starts to glide up the
	side the captain and science officers seem mesmerized by all the
	lonely creepiness they crest the embankment

	and the plexidomed view fills with an unimaginable horror as far as
	the eye can see the entire murky landscape is filled with whale
	bones a valley of death cluttered here and there carelessly flung
	about are the rusting hulks of several ships seemingly ripped apart
	clusters of shark cartilage float through the water like white ghosts

	the captain the science officers and the entire crew just stare
	frozen in place by the strage horror before them

									cut to

9	int shinkai 9000  night

	the vessel cruises through the valley of death

	everyone is nervously taking readings making calculations and
	adjusting equipment gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record
	breaking several crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi
	dome giant skeletons everywhere

10	ext shinkai 9000  night

	the shinkai approaches an eerielooking rock formation the robotic
	arm comes out the laser cutter steadies aims then shoots out its
	blue beam and cuts into the rock

	whoosh a huge jet stream of inky blood blasts out of the formation

									cut to

11	int shnkai 9000  night

	the captain and the science officers recoil as the inky stuff
	envelopes the plexidome completely blotting out the view

									cut to

12	ext palawan trough  night

	the shinkai vanishes into a huge cloud of inky blood we hold for a
	long ominous beat and then like a slowmotion earthquake large
	boulders and giant crevices begin to shift in the murky waters whale
	bones topple and scatter several feet under the ancient silt
	something is coming alive

									cut to

13	int shinkai 9000  night

	everything outside the plexidome is still black everyone is staring
	at the position board which shows a large section of the ocean floor
	starting to move its contours incogruous with the rest of the graphic
	representation the science officers look stunned

	the captain barks commands the crew leaps into high gear then the
	captain reverses the trottle and petaltothemetal he starts to back
	out the inky blood swirls past the plexidome

	then suddenly and impossibly the submersible jerks to a halt
	everybody goes assoverteacups equipment shatters sparks fly glass
	breaks lots of yelling in japanese

	the shinkai starts to rock and shake something has a hold on it more
	equipment shatters men are thrown about

	then it stops rocking the sailors stop yelling everything goes dead
	quiet frightened eyes share terrorfilled looks a sound is heard
	coming from the exterior of the ship like feet runing across the
	outside of the hull very creepy the hull starts to moan and creak
	from an unseen pressure

	and then the sub begins to be crushed like its a beer can

	the metal hull torques on all sides rivets pop and snap water sprays
	and shoots more sparks fly the steel plating dimples crumbles and
	screams in agony chaos pandemonium and then the shinkai implodes a
	massive churning swirl of water metal and men

	where john t finnegan bathed in the last light of day all taut
	muscle and sinew all business with every one of his 38 years etched
	on his rugged good looking face is harnessed into the steering
	pylon wrestling with his steeringsticks holding the bouncing
	jetfoil steady as he can hauling ass propelled it seems by the
	music blasting out of four state of the art speakers bolted to the
	metal walls

	light from the laser imagers plays across finnegans face the face of
	a man in his element on the edge in control he barks commands into
	his radio headset

	through the windsheild we see leila a muscular filipina clambering
	over the foredeck shes dripping wet tough as nails she turns to
	finnegan and mouths something into her headset finnegan flashes her
	his most charming smile

					finnegan
			yes im very warm and dry in here
			thank you for your concern

	his headset comes alive withe the sound of leila bitching in an
	unitelligible foreign tounge

	he watches as leila fights the wind and seaspray and dogstight a
	series of hatchlatches across the foredeck

					finnegan
			missed one darling

	leila turns and gives him a jerkingoff sign with her hand

					finnegan
			i love you too

	nods for a mas of assie mean and muscle named mason to follow him up a
	ladder

					pantucci
			and some of its coming your way

	he quickly pulls out a wrench slaps it over a bolt and tightens it

	as finnegan is watching the sea ahead swathed in the shrieking
	clapton guitar solos the hatch opens hanover enters followed by
	mason who leaves the hatch door ajar finnegans eyes remain fixed on
	the sea his ears on the clapton hanover and mason hold onto any
	available rail as the boat slams over the waves

					hanover

			dont see you for all these years
			and youve still got the same tape
			stuck in the box

					finnegan
			you know what they saythe

	hanover looks at the topo imager holding onto the rail to keep his
	balance as the boat slams over the choppy sea

					hanover
			so where are we

	finnegan points to a spot in the middle of the map

					finnegan
			right heremiddle of nowhere

					hanover
			and where is our point of arrival

	finnegan points to another spot on the map

					finnegan

	finnegan looks at masonat the open hatchway just behind him

					finnegan
			the finnegan you heard about

	and jams the steering sticks full speed ahead the force of
	acceleration tumbles hanover into the console mason tumbles out the
	open hatchway down the stairs behind him

	as he rises hanover regards finnegan for a moment a smile flits
	across his face

					hanover
			thats why were sill around
