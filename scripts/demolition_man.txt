        night

        way up ahead amid the flames is a fortress  a square
        city block  walled  something out of the middle ages
        the walls are entirely made from stacked abandoned cars


        int blimp pod  night

        spartan is dragging a heavy bag up towards the door
        pilot 2 looks at him curiously

                                pilot 2
                  how come they call you demolition
                  man  are you with the bomb squad

        spartan gets his bag into position

                                spartan
                  i just
                         shrugs
                          apologetically
                   demolish things

        he checks out the window  theyre not quite there

                                spartan

        the pilot takes a thermogram of the building in the
        middle of the compound  we see a series of heatoutlined
        figures moving inside

                                pilot 1
                  six  one still in the middle

                                spartan
                         checking the thermo
                  whats that

        to the naked eye out the window tucked against the
        wall of cars a large tarp  to the thermo the still
        warm inner workings of the muni bus  faint outlines of
        the engine drive train even seats and frame  bingo

        spartan takes a deep breath  loosens up his right
        shoulder  loosens up his left  checks the gun on his
        right hip  checks the gun on his left  they both cross
        draw  reaches down to the bag at his feet  lapd in
        reflective letters on the side of a backpack  spartan
        yanks some kind of rope out of it

                                pilot 2
                  isnt that for getting peopleoutof burning buildings

                                spartan

        slaps a carabiner onto a big eyebolt by the door  theyre
        dead center now over the complex below  he opens the
        door  jumps out


        ext blimp  night

        spartan falls three hundred feet from the blimp  dead
        silent  the line runs free behind him  its a giant
        fireproof bungee cord  as the downward force of gravity
        and the upward pull of the bungee become exactly the
        same spartan stops dead in the air for just the briefest
        moment  whips out a bowie knife and slashes the cord
        above his head  falls free the last ten feet to the roof
        of the building  lands on his feet  lightning cross
        draw  a gun appears in each hand


        ext fortress  main building  rooftop  night

        a lookout pops up on spartans right  spartan clobbers
        him  another lookout pops up on spartans left  spartan
        ducks rolls quietly clobbers him too  listens  no
        ones taken notice  holsters the guns  moves in towards
        the roof hatch


        int fortress  main building  third floor  night

        stacked with armaments and stolen goods  m70s straight
        outta the national guard armory  crates of ammo  stacks
        of looted sony holosets still in the boxes

        spartan makes his way carefully along  ready  spins at
        a sound  nothing there  spartan crouches low  slips
        around the crates  at the far end a very large guard
        is doing just the same thing to peer at where spartan
        just was

        spartan launches himself at the guard  hammers his head
        against the floor  this guy is not getting up again for
        a long time  spartan spins at a sound  another equally
        large guard dives on spartan from behind  he never makes
        contact  spartan uses his momentum to fling him past and
        into the wall  this guy isnt getting up again in the
        near future either  now the room is clear  moves
        towards the stairs


        int fortress  main building  second floor  night

        simon phoenix snorts a long pale blue line up one
        nostril  a long pink line up the other  one blue eye
        one brown eye  blond hair  black skin  looks up at
        another thug  punches up the security cams on half a
        dozen slightly futuristic monitors  unconscious guards
        can be seen on all of them  and on the last spartan
        coming phoenix jabs a loaded orange syringe into an
        arm  the drugs all hit various lobes

                  motherfucker


        int fortress  main building  stairwell  night

        spartan creeps quietly down  looking watching
        listening  suddenly the stairs are racked with machine
        gun fire  chips of concrete fly from around his feet
        spartan flattens against the wall  half a beat  steps
        out firing  the machine gun stops  a body plummets by
        down the center shaft of the stairs

                                spartan
                  thats a warm welcome


        int fortress  main building  second floor  night

        phoenix is dumping can after can of gas all over the
        floor the walls everything


        another angle  stairwell and landing

        spartan steps onto the landing  checks high and low
        room is clear  he can smell the gas


        back to phoenix

        simon pries open the fuse box  flips off all the
        breakers  building is plunged into darkness


        back to spartan

        spartan quietly speaks into the lapd button mike on his
        lapel

                                spartan
                  how bout some light guys

        half a beat later blinding white light blows through
        the windows


        ext fortress  from above  night

        the blimp casts down a wall of light  32 million
        candlepower pours straight down


        int fortress  main building  second floor  night

        a wild melange of white white light and dark dark
        shadows  the gas fumes ripple refract in the air
        lights bounce off the pools of gasoline  spartan rolls
        into the room  both guns come up

        spartan keeps the guns trained on phoenix  simon
        scratches his arm  its a junkies twitch  or is it
        spartan cant see it but theres a kitchen match tucked
        behind simons ear  phoenix reaches up to scratch
        another itch  frees the match in one gestures strikes
        it and tosses it into the pool of gas  smiles  a
        friendly happy smile

        the room bursts into flames  he throws back his head and
        laughs  spartan dives on him  tries to hurl them both
        through the window

        but phoenix is either stronger or just far crazier and
        drugged up  smashes the two of them into the wall
        instead  they trade blows  the building gets worse
        ammo starts to explode downstairs


        ext fortress  main yard  night

        straight in the face  phoenix drops in a heap to the

        ground dive for cover  the secondary explosion kicks
        in  everything that didnt blow straight up in the air
        blows out what remains of the sides of the building
        nothings left standing


        ext fortress  main yard  night aftermath

        the dust begins to settle  flaming wreckage and embers
        are still dropping from five hundred feet up  a beat  a
        beam shifts in the wreckage  its a big beam  it moves
        aside  spartan emerges dragging his prisoner out behind

        healy continues to shake his head in consternation  no
        way he believes that spartan ignores him  wipes the
        soot from his face  shakes his head in disgust walks
        away

        the tactical fire response vehicles have arrived  fully
        armored firemen wearing bulletproof gear fight the blaze
        spartan continues to stride away  and then everything
        fucks up  one of the tfr officers in the wreckage calls

        woman holding the hand of a small child  about six
        spartan bends down to the little girl  unclenches his
        fist  his lapd badge inside  pins it on the little
        girl katie

        on the cheek

        wife  everything that can be said has been said  they
        kiss again

        behind him in front of two locked doors are a pair of
        prison guards in odd heavilyinsulated uniforms  tanks
        heater batteries guns  spartan heads towards the far
        doors  they follow  spartan steps through the doors
        the guards now at either elbow  and into 


        int cryo prison  main room  day

        the cryopenitentiary is a godelesque nightmare of
        architecturallyperverse layers and levels the
        guggenheim mixed with industrial meat locker  all still
        half under construction

        spartan is led along the middle ring to where a doctor
        two whitecoated technicians and a younglooking warden
        smithers are waiting

        above him prisoners are encased into the ground in
        massive glass hockey pucks contracted into pained fetal
        positions  their faces are hauntingly twisted into
        gargoyle expressions of tortured struggle

        the group arrives at an empty chamber  the technicians
        nod to spartan  he drops off the white overalls  steps
        free  stands naked  doctor injects him with luminescent
        blue fluid  the techies slap on sensor pads  head
        heart all over spraying him down with freon  mist
        everywhere we see the temperature dropping on the
        monitors  the warden looks at a crib sheet  clears his
        throat

                                smithers
                  john spartan  youve done great
                  deeds for the city of los angeles
                  so it is with some regret that i

                                spartan
                  skip it

        spartan shivers contemplating one of his stiffening
        hands

                                smithers
                  john spartan  youve been
                  sentenced to 70 years in the
                  california cryopenitentiary for
                  the involuntary manslaughter of
                  thirty

                  skip it

        spartan is beginning to shake from the cold  his lips
        turning blue before our eyes  color just drains away

                                smithers

        the technicians attempt to help spartan into the chamber
        he shakes them off to stagger down on his own  lets not
        kid ourselves hes scared

        titles begin as

        the casing door is closed over him  monitors down the
        lining of the circular chamber show a digital rap sheet
        a dropping thermometer a parole date and todays date
        november 20 1998  a superchilled clear goo flows in
        packing and preserving isolated michelangeloesque
        segments of the defiant statue that is john spartan

        but hes still conscious  still even struggling a bit
        on the arm above the chamber inside a vacuum bell a
        small vial is auto unscrewed  locked and safety lights
        cycle  we see a tiny white chip inside  the vial is
        moved into place by a tiny robot arm  bottom vent is
        opened  the chip is dumped into the chamber  its the
        opposite of watching ice shatter  instead the whole
        hockey puck goes solid in an instant and a half  the
        thermo readout drops in an instant to a half degree
        above 0 degrees kelvin  its done

        the viewer makes a gently dizzying journey around the
        chamber settling for a moment on spartans contorted
        intoadefiantsneer face


        int cryo prison  main room  day 2042

        the viewers viewpoint keeps pulling out to see that the
        date on spartans monitor now reads august 3 2042
        warden smithers now a bespectacled grayhaired old
        man in a peculiar uniform shuffles past the completely
        unaged spartan

        he grumbles by in a phone headset equipped with fiberoptic
        video gear and out of frame we see that the
        prison has become vaster stranger with multiple grated
        catwalks and more networks of artfullyengineered piping
        and heavily heavily stocked with prisoners

        smithers looks up at his holoset  hovering in front of

        inkfilled quadrants on a wheel inside  the yellow
        quadrant rotates into position

        a small sharp explosion  like an ink jet the yellow ink
        is flung through a nozzle against the wall in an 8 x 20
        foot swath  the red ratchets and fires the blue as
        well  now we can see the graffiti bomb has screened a
        message on the wall  life is hell  the black
        explodes  little deaths heads are sprinkled around the

        pedestrians gather and stare at the message  mouths
        open dumbstruck

        two shock poles emerge from hidden panels in the side of
        the building  a sheet of lightning flashes between
        them  the message turns to ash and falls to the ground

                          else

                          another
                  the problem is that these

                  need to spew hostility at the

        turn blue  steam bursts from the puck  fills the air

                  loving and understanding  and we
                  are quite frankly not equipped
                  to deal with this situation

        spartan creaks his head toward garcia spooking him back
        away  spartan vigorously scratches his hand as he
        speaks

                  and it has been deemed that
                  everything that is not good for

        stares out his window in amazement at the shiny happy
        people in the happy shiny city  meanwhile lenina and

                  the average l8yearold has
                  witnessed 200000 acts of
                  simulated violence  in our
                  society the number is closer to
                  four  if someone off the street
                  was to watch the three stooge men
                  and see the moeperson hammer the

        she trails off as she sees spartan staring out the

        zips back down the hole

        moment before following  garcia hands spartan a stun

        where a battered cannonball bouncing down the hall
        spartan hurls himself through the hole in the doors
        takes cover behind one of the exhibits

        simon unleashes a barrage from a tommy gun draped around
        his neck  keeps firing and firing and firing  empties
        it  not a very strategic move as he demolishes most of
        the cases in the room including the one directly over
        spartan

        a beretta falls at his feet  an old police belt as well
        spartan yanks out the magazine  loads it  collapses the

        before phoenix strafes the area with a hk91  dives for

        and rolls across the aisle

        saw before  spartan shaking off the fall finds himself
        weaponless  phoenix is spinning madly around acmag in
        one hand an ingram from his shoulder bag in the other
        strafes everywhere with the ingram  tosses it away

        pain  rattled and shaken by the charge  involuntary
        shudders  yanks himself clear with a wild grin

                  what a brave new world  sorry you
                  have to leave

        spots the beretta  dives for it  shoots back  its
        like a popgun compared to the acmag  anything but
        survival becomes completely out of the question  phoenix
        fires round after round  everything he aims at just
        explodes  that spartan lives through this at all is
        amazing

        himself into the dirt  cocteau turns to face a jazzed
        up phoenix still draped in weapons the acmag tucked in
        his belt

        phoenixs smile turns to a grimace  his gun hand
        quivers  he wants to kill but he cant  cocteau
        folds his arms

                  dont you have a job to do  dont

                                phoenix
                  yeah i do

        spartan comes crashing out of the wreckage  loading
        the beretta as he runs a crazed scowl on his face
        phoenix leaps the wall

                  phoenix could be anywhere but

                         whispering
                  salt is not good for you  hence
                  it is

        spartan glares her quiet pokes at his burrito supreme
        a beat  cocteau muses 

                                cocteau
                  so john spartan tell me what
                  do you think of san angeles 2042

                                spartan
                  i guess considering the way
                  things were going when i went
                  in  i thought the future would
                  be a sick decaying pit of
                  suffering and hate with a thick
                  foul stench

        cocteau gloats

                                cocteau
                  you should consider visiting new
                  yorkjersey after this

                                spartan
                         brightening
                  you mean nothings changed

        associate bob roars in appreciative empty laughter
        think ed mcmahon  spartan looks at him  it wasnt
        funny  pokes at his burrito  ugh

                                cocteau
                  look at you john spartan pouting
                  for the old cheeseburger  the
                  flesh of dying animals covered
                  with cholesterol laden butterfat
                  you miss the bad old days

                                spartan
                  yeah maybe
                         then
                  look i like vegetables  i even
                  ate tofu a couple times  but i
                  got to choose when i wanted it

                                cocteau
                  you think weve gone too far  you
                  werent here for the fourth and
                  fifth riots
                         harsh
                  civilization tried to destroy
                  itself  people just wanted the
                  madness over  and when i saw
                  the chance to make things right
                  i grabbed it  san angeles would
                  not be here  it would be your
                  pit of stench

                                spartan
                  yeah  maybe you can book me a
                  flight to new york when this is
                  done

        leninas shocked  cocteaus not thrilled with his
        attitude either

                                cocteau
                  for your crimes john spartan
                  you would have surely rotted and
                  died in jail by now  even you
                  have to appreciate the
                  persuasively tranquil humanity of
                  the cryoprison system

                                spartan
                  i dont want to piss on your
                  parade pal but my cryo
                  sentence wasnt a sweet lullaby
                  i had feelings  i had
                  thoughts  a 44 yearold bad
                  dream about thirty people in a
                  burning building  about my wife
                  beating her fists against an ice
                  bucket  it woulda been more
                  humane to stake me down and leave
                  me to the crows

                                huxley
                  you were awake  a person would go
                  insane

        spartan stares out the window  across the street he sees
        a scragly scrap on a sputtery patched together motor bike
        in front of a large food store across the street

                                cocteau
                  i am saddened and stunned  if
                  theres anything i can do

        spartan goes back to staring out the window  two three
        then four scraps loitering looking around theyve done
        nothing yet but to spartans eye its clear theyre up
        to no good

        the food truck approaches

                                spartan
                         standing
                  just call for backup  ill be
                  across the street

                                huxley
                  but john spartan why how
                  wha

                                spartan
                         calling out as he
                          leaves
                  one of those hunch things again
                  bad guys about to do bad things

        and spartan is gone


        ext court of stores  night

        the court of stores are located outside the restaurant
        spartan steps past the holographic images toward the food
        store

        no one can mistake him for an exiting patron  he
        radiates attitude  spartan picks up his pace  the food
        truck is just pulling in  the motorcycle scrap sees him
        revs the bike in a ferocious swerve towards spartan

        spartan looks around  beside him is a street sign
        murmuring third and alemeda third and alemeda
        third  spartan rips it from the ground


        int taco bell  table area  night

        lenina and the rest of the restaurant gather at the
        window to ooh in fear  cocteau scowls angrily at the
        scraps


        ext court of stores  night

        the scrap on the motorcycle has no time to dodge as
        spartan stands his ground jousts him clear out of
        his seat  the motorcycle skids by barely missing him
        hits the curb somersaults and explodes through the
        holograms  spartan doesnt even flinch

        still clutching the pole spartan makes a swift kempo
        swing into the three other attackers  and then all hell
        breaks loose

        explosive devices explode the concrete inside nearby
        stores  scraps come pouring out  sewer covers are
        blown asunder followed by chain and nunchuckwielding
        scraps

        an alarm screams strangely and melodically  the food
        truck is swarmed  inside the foodstore ten twenty
        thirty scraps attack and loot  spartan sees theres a
        lot of them here  a whole lot

                                spartan
                  great they brought the whole
                  team

        three more scraps come charging out of the store
        clutching packages  they hurl explosive devices towards
        spartan to make their escape

        lenina leads a round of giddy gasps  cocteau is not
        pleased with any of this


        ext court of stores  night

        spartan dodges the fusillade looks around takes stock
        of the whole situation  an oncoming trolley comes around
        the corner into the complex

                                spartan
                  now if we can just get them to
                  stay and play

        spartan dashes to the trolley car  he bounds up to
        the driver

                                trolley driver
                  be well

                                spartan

        spartan tugs the driver along with him out of the moving
        trolley  he javelins a mighty thrust with the street
        sign into the back wheels of the trolley


        int taco bell  table area  night

        the patrons grow dead silent in anticipation

        the trolley teeters into a savagely awesome derail  it
        goes into a squealing sparking skid right into the food
        truck  the slammingtoastop trolley neatly angles into
        the truck trapping scraps out front and inside


        int taco bell  table area  night

        the patrons unbridle themselves into actual cheering


        ext court of stores  night

        spartan bursts forth from the trolley into the melee

                                spartan
                  youre all under arrest

        the scraps freeze for a moment  this guy means business
        in a way theyve never seen before  but spartan is dis
        tracted for a moment by an excited yell 

                                scrap raider
                  protein  ive found protein

        this doesnt sound like hardened criminals to spartan
        more scraps rush over to help him carry this booty away
        a scrap appears beside spartan swinging a pair of
        nunchucks made from two knobby table legs

                                spartan
                         wearily
                  youre going to regret this for
                  the rest of your life  both
                  seconds of it

        nunchuck scrap thwaps spartan  spartan just looks
        annoyed not hurt  slams him again  still no reaction
        spartan latches onto a nunchuck in the air as it comes
        toward him  yanks it forward as he shoves the scrap
        backward into the food store window  the scrap bounces
        off the window like a nerf ball not remotely cracking
        it  spartan frowns to himself

                                spartan
                  maybe im losing my touch

        two other scraps attack him  spartan fends off one
        shotputs the other into the window this time shattering
        it competely

                                spartan

        up on the truck payne under an enormous load of food
        appears  takes quick stock of the situation  he sees
        spartan  has no idea who this guy is but hes trouble

                                payne
                  were outta here

        cocteau smolders at the sight of payne


        ext court of stores  night

        the hurled scrap stumbles out of the window wreckage
        falling to his knees  as spartan considers what the hell
        is really going on and should he deck this guy a bunch
        of cans of quirky food cascade out of the scraps jacket

                                hurled scrap
                         genuine pleading
                  please dont

        spartan stops  backs away  watches oddly as the scrap
        escapes  he lets them go  steps back away as the others
        escape  they dont know why he changed his mind but
        theyre not staying around to find out

        huxley and the restaurant patrons rush up to give him a
        blast of adulation  spartans attention stays on the
        fleeing scraps

                                huxley
                  such a reckless abandonment
                  looks like theres a new shepherd
                  in town

                  theyre nothing but thugs and
                  hooligans

        statement of his  in the bg a team of uniformed
        engineers are patching up a hole in the ground using a

                  was so so

                                spartan

                  the wild west wasnt even the wild
                  west  hurting people is not a

        is a monstrosity  a melange of 80s and 90s styles
        never quite seen together in this way

        she turns quickly to a cabinet and removes two strange
        hightech helmets and a towel  lenina all excited puts
        one of the helmets on his head and hands him the towel

        flicks a switch on the side of the helmet  readout
        lights come on activated  lenina sits upon a bed
        opposite spartan and repeats the operation on herself
        with the other helmet

                                huxley
                  now you have to relax  well
                  start in a few seconds

                                spartan
                  start what

                                huxley
                  having sex of course

        and she flicks on the switch on her own helmet


        virtual reality world

        lenina appears floating a diaphanous gown blowing
        gently about her  she floats slowly towards us as she
        begins to peel off and discard pieces of the gown which
        dissolve immediately away  as she approaches nakedness


        int leninas apartment  night

        a beat of openmouthed amazement and enjoyment and then
        spartan tears the helmet from his head and throws down
        his towel with a mixture of confusion and anxiety
        lenina is still seated across the room

                                huxley
                  whats wrong  you broke contact

                  contact  i havent even touched
                  you yet

        lenina removes her helmet with some confusion and hurt

                                huxley
                  but but i thought you wanted
                  to make love

                                spartan
                  this is like boning ms pacman

        lenina stands tossing her helmet down and faces
        spartan

                                huxley

                  produce higher orders of

                  waddya say we just do this the
                  oldfashioned way

        she looks at him backing away in shock and disgust

                                huxley
                  uuuugh  you mean fluid transfer

                                spartan

        spartan looks at her like shes out of her mind

                                huxley
                  exchange of bodily fluids  do
                  you know what that leads to

                                spartan
                  kids smoking a desire to raid
                  the fridge

                                huxley
                  the rampant exchange of bodily
                  fluids was one of the major reasons
                  for the downfall of society
                         trying to explain

                  after aids there was nrs  after
                  nrs there was ubt  one of the
                  first things dr cocteau was able
                  to do was outlaw and behaviorally
                  engineer all fluid transfer out
                  of societallyacceptable

                  i was a good kisser

                                huxley

        she points to the door  stamps her foot  some things
        never change  he wants to explain  she stamps her foot
        again  he leaves


        int spartans apartment  night

        in darkness spartan loudly bangs into something

                                spartan
                  ahh  lights

        lights come up  the place is well spartan  exact
        same shape and size as huxleys but stunningly sterile
        and unwarm  spartan tragically takes in the place
        pokes his head into a clinical bathroom a bathroom with
        no toilet paper and a strange shelf with three seashells
        shakes his head

        spartans hands start to quiver toward a knitting needle
        and a ball of red yarn  curiously furrowing his brow
        spartan plops into a strenuously uncomfortable futuristic
        chair and begins almost unconsciously knitting the red
        yarn  he stops himself in perplexed surprise

        suddenly a loud bopping noise fills the air  a beautiful
        nude woman casually brushing her teeth appears on a
        vidscreen before spartan

                                nude woman image
                  hi martin  i was thinki  ohmygod
                  im sorry wrong number 

        in a panic the nude woman reaches os and the image
        clicks off  spartan smiles then stops smiling  he
        awkwardly calls out to the telescreen

                                spartan
                  uh telephone directory

                                vidscreen computer vo

                  videophone directory accessed
                  spartan almost bails but finally 

                                spartan
                         a little worried

                         the thought hits
                          him
                   her mom might have even
                  reremarried  but shes passed

                                spartan
                  what happened then

        he cant believe hes having a dialogue with tv screen
        but

                  reason for no ref

                         after a beat
                  what number do you wish to call
                  hangs up on him

        the image blinks out replaced by clouds and the be
        well slogan  an annoyed spartan stares at the screen
        he picks up the strange box lenina gave him  inside it
        is a stack of petite laserdiscs  spartan sticks the
        first laserdisc in his television

        a surveillance camera shot shows the image of the explo
        sion at the museum  spartan pops the disc and puts
        another in  this time the surveillance village shows
        cocteau and associate bob walking through the courtyard
        then the gunshot  then finally spartan comes to the
        strange facetoface between cocteau and phoenix
        spartan backandforth watches the standoff with growing
        fascination  he almost unconsciously reaches out to the
        sewing needles and the red yarn


        int cocteaus office  night

        dark  cocteau steps in  trailed by associate bob
        nothing happens  he looks around wondering why

        lenina holds up her new sweater with a tickled blush
        spartan determinedly presses buttons to get the car
        humming off

                  to carry out whatever training
                  was assigned

        on the screen cutting her off  lenina gets into a
        little more furious computer playing until she gets a
        violent beep

        a sweet female computer voice chirps along with

                  provoke madness  hes always
                  been obsessed with one thing

                  but john spartan you must be
                  mistaken  you cant accuse the
                  savior of the city of being
                  connected to a multimurder
                  deathkiller like simon phoenix
                  its rude

                  i dont think i can access him at
                  this time

        spartan grabs him by the throat  pulls him inches away
        from his own face

                                spartan

                  but i do have an entire citygov

                  phoenixs rehab to turn him into
                  a terrorist  now that you wussed
                  out this entire society in a
                  tribute to yourself you needed
                  phoenix to handle the castoffs
                  who wouldnt listen to your
                  bullshit

        huxley cringes  the morality box beeps  cocteau stares

                  my only interest in simon phoenix
                  was in that of the creation of an
                  expert florist

                                spartan
                  florist  phoenix wouldnt know a

                  outside the museum why didnt he
                  blow your brains out  i saw the
                  security disc  phoenix had a
                  full ten seconds to think about
                  where to put the hole in your
                  head

                  john spartan this display of
                  barbaric behavior was not
                  acceptable even in your time

                                spartan
                  yeah  but it worked

        blam  blam  blam  shoots out three more  associate
        bob faints dead away

                                spartan
                  when a man like phoenix has a
                  gun to your head ten seconds
                  is nine and a half seconds longer
                  than you live

                         on the vid screen
                  not everyone is as eager as you
                  to resort to violence to solve
                  all the difficulties in life
                  even now i am beginning to wonder
                  if the fracas in the museum was
                  the result of mr phoenixs
                  presence or your own

        the beretta appears next to cocteaus head onscreen

        cocteau is in a corner of the room in front of a private
        vidhead  spartan stands with beretta pointed directly
        at him  nonetheless cocteau remains his arrogant self

                                spartan
                  wonder about this shithead  you
                  think you can control this guy
                  trust me you cant

                                cocteau
                         a beat unfazed
                  is there something specific you plan
                  to do with that archaic device

        spartans not going to shoot him lowers the gun

                                cocteau
                  now john spartan do you not query
                  yourself that this misplaced
                  hostility is the result of your
                  transference of self hatred and
                  personal loathing

                                spartan
                  what

                                cocteau
                  perhaps you blame me for my role
                  in the progenation of the cryo
                  process  that does not relieve
                  you of your burden of
                  responsibility for the commitment
                  of your initial crimes

        spartan looks at him a long time

                                spartan
                  fuck you

        huxley visibly recoils  the morality box braaaps  it
        never gets any further  spartan shoots it without a
        look dead center  his eyes never leave cocteau


        ext taco bellcourt of stores  dusk

        the scene of the scraps food truck attack  as on the
        cut spartan wrenches off one of the steel planks  it
        splits open with rush of air  earle had no idea how to
        stop spartan but he tries 

                                earle
                  please cease this madness
                  enhance your calm john spartan

                                spartan
                  ive had it with enhancing my
                  calm  im going to find phoenix
                  and enhance his calm instead
                  im the only one here who can
                  handle this situation

                                garcia
                  how will you accomplish this
                  john spartan

                  im going to blow his fucking

        in fear  its like hes opening up the mouth to hell

                  john spartan even if simon

                  contraband weapons  by forces
                  known or unknown  pray tell why
                  are you proceeding to the depths
                  of wasteland

        spartan wrenches off another plank  now the hole is big
        enough to enter  a set of rungs can be discerned
        stops looks at earle  how can they all not get it

                                spartan
                  the reason the citywide manhunt
                  didnt work was because phoenix
                  was down in the one place you a
                  cant monitor b are afraid to
                  visit and c dont give a shit
                  about

                                earle
                         then braver
                  whether phoenix is down there or
                  not you just cant drop in
                  resonate some understanding the
                  wasteland is filled with thugs
                  and

                  yeah  you might like it down
                  there

                  you made a joke  theres hope

                         then
                  hey how bad could it be

        nobody has a clue  it could be really bad

                                spartan
                  look you two dont have to do
                  this  i can handle phoenix

        they are in the wasteland which is surprisingly busy and
        crowded  people living in tents leantos whatever
        their ingenuity can provide  think third world refugee
        camp underground a souk  marketplaces food stalls

        the underbelly of the city lit from above by strand after
        strand of bulbs in construction cages and other fortui
        tously salvaged lights revealing odd tunnels of
        indeterminate former usage abandoned subway platforms
        natural caverns a cutway of fifty years of sanitary
        landfill the striations of decades of now useful trash
        being harvested  giant belt driven ventilation fans
        whirl in enormous airshafts overhead

        the three move along taking in the curious but
        unfrightened glances  more than one person recognizes
        spartan from the battle the night before  you can feel
        the buzz work down the street

                  told the only people down here were
                  savages who wanted only to

        spartan lenina and garcia find themselves starting to
        sniff the air  spartan grins while the others look

                                spartan
                  oh yeah oh yeah

        the trio drifts toward a large square hole in the sewer
        wall in front of which a smiling old woman is smoking up
        some meat and tortillas on a makeshift grill  other
        scraps sit in the space square behind smoking cigarettes
        and eating on ratty armchairs between shabby travel
        posters

                  oh my

        they turn and walk on  ignoring the very disreptuable
        looking cantina tucked into a carved out section of
        landfill  as they go by we push in with a seedy
        looking patron to find 


        int wasteland  bar

        further dragged down by the presence in the furthest

        int wasteland  large cavern  night

        spartan huxley and garcia step in  a meeting place
        of sorts  a machine shop  off to one side a giant
        belt driven machine shop out of 1900 taking its power
        from a water wheel attached to an enormous transmission
        spinning furiously  mechanics fix and combine various
        vehicles into working fashion  blow torches bellows
        another flume feeds a wildly churning wheel running the
        fans

        we can see stalls and houses around the rim  out of date
        cars are being used as homes  spartan takes it all in
        his eye catches a bright red 1969 pontiac gto beside the
        machine shop  hes drawn to it in admiration huxley and
        garcia in his wake

                                spartan
                  nice a 1969 pontiac lemans gto
                  convertible with rear spoiler and
                  hot wheel mags seriously beyond
                  the standard package

        a very large caliber revolver appears alongside spartans
        head

                                voice os
                  so are these  why dont you put
                  down the glow rods

        spartan does  the man with the gun is payne  six other
        scrap toughs have the drop on lenina and garcia with
        giant crude shotguns  one of them wears a familiar
        periscope around his neck

                                payne
                  your friends too

                  killer can you help  or just
                  bully us with these primitive
                  weapons

        spartan shakes his head in disbelief  payne shifts his
        aim  fires  blows a hole in the side of an abandoned
        car the size of a grapefruit

                                spartan
                  well maybe theyre not so
                  primitive

        payne cocks his pistol aims at spartan

                                spartan
                  but if its a bad time we could
                  come back later

                  are you down here

                  do you care

                  where im from id just kinda
                  like to know whats going on

        spartan still waits  a crowd begins to grow  payne
        despite the fact that hes the guy with the gun decides
        to answer

                                payne
                  some of us didnt tow the line
                  some of us didnt make the grade

        spartan stares past payne to wild pieces of graffiti on
        a wall behind him that includes i hate san angeles and
        suck my cocteau

                                payne
                  and some of us just got tired of
                  being told what to do

                                spartan
                  guess you people werent part of
                  the cocteau plan

                                payne
                  man this is the cocteau plan

                                spartan
                  next time you go shopping im
                  not going to be in your way
                         then
                  listen when the laws are wrong
                  men have to take it upon
                  themselves to change them

        payne stares at him  spartans sincere  payne lets his
        gun drop  the others follow

                                huxley
                         shocked
                  john spartan you must uphold the
                  law

        a goodlooking woman of about fifty looks up from the
        edge of the crowd with sudden interest at the mention of
        spartans name

                                spartan
                  its the old story give up a
                  little freedom for a little
                  safety and soon you have no
                  freedom and no safety

                                payne

                                spartan

                  date  but i do have another

                  all in trouble

        payne hasnt  looks to the others

                                tough scrap
                         nods to payne
                  scoped him yesterday

                                garcia
                         amazed
                  you were right


        view from distance

        suddenly the viewer is pulled out for a long view of
        spartan talking to payne  then one two three four
        five six bodies step into the fg  simon and his goons
        walking down the street


        simon

        cant believe his good luck  he chuckles

                                phoenix
                  you know i musta done something
                  right in a previous life
                         thinks this seems
                          really unlikely
                  dont know what that coulda been

        he turns and quietly starts dispensing instructions to
        the cryocons


        back to scene

        the woman who looked up with such interest steps over
        closer  shes got to know

                                katherine
                  john spartan  the demolition man

                                spartan

        he wraps his arms around her she him as well

                                spartan

                                spartan

                  you one day  i knew i would

        he holds her at arms length admiring her  then 

                                spartan
                  tell me everything  i want to
                  know everything about you

                                katherine
                         laughing its fifty
                          years
                  everything  all at once

        spartans grin though it seems impossible gets wider
        he kisses her on the forehead  holds her back out at
        arms length just looking at her with this great big
        smile

                                spartan
                  yes  absolutely everything
                  start where i left off  you were
                  six

                                garcia
                  spartan

        spartans busy

                                garcia
                  spartan
                         as spartan ignores
                          him still busy
                  spar

                                spartan
                  what

        garcia can only point  simon phoenix forty feet away
        giant grin acmag in hand taking aim

        spartan hurls katherine to the ground with himself as a
        shield as 

                                spartan
                  get down

        huxley garcia and the scraps who have a clue dive as
        the acmag fires with the resulting tremendous explosion

                                phoenix
                  spartan buddy i brought some
                  old friends

        the cryocons open up with all manner of weaponry on the
        crowd  mayhem and slaughter  huxley and garcia have
        taken cover as well  their stun batons look exceedingly
        useless  spartan is momentarily trapped under a
        collapsed beam  doesnt last long  growls  hurls it
        aside  comes up firing with the beretta

                                spartan
                  stay down

        phoenix fires again  the acmag round barely misses them
        spartans blasted brutally by the explosion  stays on his
        feet  keeps firing  albert goes down  hes not going
        to get back up again  payne rises to his feet firing a
        giant revolver  the other armed scraps follow his lead
        another acmag round goes off  the lights dim  spartan
        sprints for where he last saw phoenix

        spartan can hear phoenix clattering off up a culvert
        behind him  he bolts up after him


        int wasteland  culvert  night

        it forks upwards  sixty degree incline  flattens out
        splits again  spartan halts listens  follows the
        footsteps  same trick works backwards as phoenix stops
        dead hears spartan coming  fires the acmag  misses as
        spartan is just about to round a bend into range

        the culvert itself explodes blowing shrapnel everywhere

        fifteen feet of it are gone  its an ugly ugly jump
        two hundred feet down and no room to miss  off to one
        side one of the fans spins madly  spartan leaps  hits
        the other side grasping at shards of metal  pulls
        himself in  it heads back up

        spartan ascends  up  up  now almost and then
        completely vertical  he climbs spreadeagled after
        simon


        int wasteland  cross pipe  night

        the pipe ts at the top  spartan mantles up as phoenix
        clatters off  down below in the pipe the sound of
        someone else following as well  a gasketed porthole
        glints beside spartan he slams it open  looking down
        he is a hundred yards above the cavern floor  beside
        him the chain arcing up from the machine shop below
        ratchets around a joint and heads off into the darkness
        in the direction phoenix has fled

        half a beat  spartan reaches out way out and just
        manages to snag the chain  hauls madly  chain clatters
        and clatters  half a beat  a long low rumble
        phoenix stops a moment wondering what the hell it is  a
        giant blast of water tidals through the pipe  the acmag
        is swept away

        spartan looks up to see phoenix and a wall of water
        headed his way

                                spartan
                  oh shit

        simon smashes into him  the two are swept along  the
        force blows them off the side

        int wasteland corrugated conduit  night

        spartan and phoenix are carried along by the water into
        an aqueduct  phoenix heaves himself over the side
        spartan follows


        int wasteland  large cavernsupport grid  night

        every scrap can see  the two hang on a suspension grid
        of an old rusty rebar directly over one of the whirring
        ventilator fans  its not meant to take any weight
        slippery as hell from the spray above  the rebar creaks
        and moans

        no one dares move  below charlie lies dead  no other
        cryocons can be seen

        spartan and phoenix scrabble madly yet in slow motion
        as not to break the old joints as they stay on  hand
        over hand phoenix makes his way along as 

                                phoenix

                  catch me  they were already

                  touched the building  cold as
                  haagen dazs
                         simon grins his
                          scary grin
                  see ya

        simon swings himself back and forth gaining momentum
        the rebars about to give as he launches himself out
        into space just clearing the fan  a wild twisting
        fall ending in a clangorous landing through three levels
        of scrap leantos

        spartan feels the rebar starting to fail around him  as
        he tries to haul himself up it just gives way more  the
        whole fan structure is giving way  bits of metal fall
        hit the fan and are sent clanging off into space

        and then it gets worse  a noise from above  beppo
        appears  hangs from a firm support  he begins to stomp
        on spartans fingers  laughing wildly

        spartan moves he stomps them again  spartan moves
        again but this time seeing a heavier piece of rebar
        nearby  snags it  and as beppos foot comes down again
        grabs it  hauls  beppo starts to scream  his grip
        comes loose on the wet bar above  screams past spartan
        as he falls  theres a tremendous cuisinart sound
        blood flies up past spartan as he climbs up to safety

        he moves down the grid past the fan  sees below as
        phoenix scrambles to his feet starts to run  spartan
        doesnt want to do it  no choice  growls  leaps
        falls  falls  falls  smashes into a garbage heap

        simon pounds a rushing up garcia unconscious in a single
        blow  recovers and empties a tommy gun at the crowd

        green a horde of scraps armed to the teeth carrying
        the dead cryocons on two litters and emerging from
        their midst beside payne alfredo garcia

                                earle
                         mustering command
                  stun batons on

        spartan gives him a look are you out of your mind
        huxley ignores him completely as well  moves to garcia

                                spartan
                  you get a bump on the noggin and
                  youre pancho villa

                                garcia
                  who

                                spartan
                  never mind
                         to payne
                  loan me a gun  loan me two guns

        payne thinks about it for a half second  hands his gun
        over nods to someone else as well to follow suit
        spartan straps on two guns and a giant ammo belt 

                                spartan
                  what else you got

        the scraps unearth halfadozen large explosive devices
        spartan loads them into the gto  earle is ready to cry
        when he sees all this  a catastrophe averted but 

                                earle
                  you would have used these weapons
                  of mass destruction against the
                  men and women who upheld the law

                                payne
                  we would have used these weapons
                  to shop for groceries

        half a beat  earle gets it  theres kids in this crowd
        and a lot of hungry people

                                payne
                  look chief ive had it with being
                  a criminal  im not a criminal
                  think of me more as the head of the
                  peoples militia  were gonna go
                  dump the tea in the harbor ya
                  know

                                earle
                  thats good cause tea contains
                  caffeine

        spartan looks at him

                                spartan
                  youre joking again right
                         as earle nods
                  grin or something afterwards
                  people dont know

        earle nods seriously  spartan steps over to the dead
        guys on the litters pulls back a sheet  he stares at
        the first guy  cant believe what he sees

                                huxley
                  who are these swarthy strangers

                                spartan
                         stunned checks the

                                huxley

        he smiles at her gently  fortytwo years of pain washing
        clean

                  whattya mean  im an excellent
                  driver

        as he goes squealing out clipping and knocking over the
        one remaining wall of the police station 


        int cocteaus office  night

        cocteau bob simon and the remaining cryocons are there
        listening to cocteau warble on 

                                cocteau
                  i wasnt counting on this but i
                  must say youve worked out
                  beautifully  people are terrified
                  of you

                                phoenix

                  ah people have always been
                  terrified of me

        cocteau continues his eerie soliloquy feeding phoenixs
        amusement  phoenix walks behind him under this takes out
        a knife and behind raymonds back tries desperately to
        kill him  he cant

                                cocteau
                  but this time theyre truly scared
                  soon theyll want to take the next
                  step  security cameras in every
                  room stricter alarm systems against
                  misbehavior anonymous hotlines to
                  their neighbors infractions
                         gloating

                  create the perfect society
                  everyone will want it  an enzyme
                  injection for all citizens that
                  will insure everyone has the same
                  iq the same weight and the
                  same desire to think only happy
                  thoughts

        phoenix is back where cocteau can see him 

                                phoenix
                  im pretty happy now  i think ill
                  pass on that shot

        phoenix steps off to one side pulls an old airweight out
        of his belt  aims it at cocteau tries tries to pull
        the trigger  isnt going to happen  he grunts in
        frustration

                                cocteau
                         lost in his
                          own reverie
                  other cities will follow  san
                  angeles will be a beacon of order
                  with the purity of an ant colony
                  and the beauty of a flawless pearl

                                phoenix
                  nah  you cant take away peoples
                  right to be assholes
                         then its been
                          bothering him
                  thats it thats who you remind
                  me of  an evil mr rogers

        cocteau smiles  simon tosses the gun to elvin

                                phoenix
                  you try to kill him  this is
                  beginning to piss me off

        elvin empties all six shots into cocteaus very surprised
        face

        associate bob looks on from the corner  a little
        frightened but not giving a shit about cocteau

                                phoenix
                  so what shall i do with youbob

                                associate bob
                  i am an excellent associate sir
                  i could work for you
                         off phoenixs doubt
                          of this
                  dr cocteau actually had me
                  endocrinecologically altered to
                  never wish to be anything but
                  an associate

                                phoenix
                  what

                                associate bob
                  i believe the slang that would best
                  express it across our chronological
                  gap sir would be that he  cut
                  my balls off

                                phoenix
                  literally

        bob nods simon claps him on the shoulder

                                phoenix
                  bob its a sign of weakness to cut
                  the balls off the people who work
                  for you  im gonna get you a new
                  set

                                associate bob
                  why thank you sir

                                phoenix
                  can we do that now

        bob nods

                                phoenix
                  im gonna get a couple extra
                  myself  not that i need em  but
                  just for spares

                                associate bob
                  if i could interrupt

        phoenix looks at him this is not a good way to start

                                associate bob
                  but the police are here


        out window

        some ten stories down  sure enough spartan and huxley
        are exiting the gto


        back in office

                                phoenix
                  im gonna need to defrost more
                  guys bob  lots more guys  can
                  you do that

                                associate bob
                  indubitably  but the computer
                  codes will have to emanate from
                  this office  we will need a few
                  moments here before fleeing
                         sits at keyboard
                          types away madly
                  i might suggest that the uh
                  large gentlemen might be
                  considered ah
                         sotto
                  disposable  especially with
                  rather large supply forthcoming
                  perhaps they could be sent to
                  welcome mr spartan  if they
                  succeed so much the better if
                  not they will at least hinder
                  his progress

                                phoenix
                  i like you bob  you have no
                  heart

                  im gonna like running this place


        int cocteau complex  cocteau lobby  night

        the elevator slides open  danzig elvin and francis
        spray it with gunfire  its empty  spartan and huxley
        slip in through a side door around the corner

                                spartan
                  old trick

                                huxley
                  old criminals

        he looks at her  shes a little cocky  spartan steps
        out into the hall  sees a giant shadow

                                spartan
                  elvin

        elvin steps out  spartan shoots him through the chest

                                spartan
                  thought it was you

        danzig and francis look a touch more concerned  they
        split up

        spartan moves cautiously down the hall  huxley a pace or
        two behind  high above in an overly futuristic frieze
        looking much the modern gargoyle is danzig  grins
        dives on spartan

        spartan is slammed to the ground  we can feel the breath
        knocked out of him  tussles with danzig as 

        huxley pulls out her stun baton  pokes at them pulls
        back pokes again  unable with the twisting turning
        struggling bodies to be sure she wont get spartan

        and misses the fact that francis is coming up from
        behind  he slaps the baton out of her hand  grabs
        her around the neck lifts her in the air  begins to
        strangle her to death  she kicks and claws at him
        without effect

        spartans still busy with danzig  she starts to choke
        francis brings her closer to watch her die  a beat of
        this and huxley reaches down and yanks the gun out of
        his belt and shoots him repeatedly

        half a beat later spartan finishes with danzig  the
        crrrunnnch of his back breaking

        huxleys in a state of shock

                                huxley
                  this man has died at my hands  i
                  have taken all his future from
                  him

                                spartan
                  him or you huxley

                                huxley
                         somewhat mollified
                  there is that


        int cocteaus office  night

        spartan bursts in gun drawn  no ones there  spins
        checks everywhere  spots a very dead raymond cocteau
        huxley sees him a moment later

                                huxley
                  horrors  oh horrors  sic
                  transit raymond cocteau  oh john
                  spartan civilization as we know
                  it will come to an end

                                spartan
                  it does that every once in a
                  while

        the computer screen catches spartans eye

                                spartan
                  whats this

                                huxley
                         checks it out
                  ooh  this is bad  very bad
                         as spartan looks
                          over her shoulder
                  hes accessed the cryoprison
                  hes about to defrost the entire
                  multilifer wing

        ext cryo prison  night

        prison is ringed by a high circular fence  giant stainless
        steel gates in front of the prison a la the federal
        reserve are shut tight  a dozen futuristic squad cars
        strobe the area in red and blue  the gto rumbles up
        spartan gets out  huxley follows suit

                                garcia
                  hes inside already  and its
                  completely sealed

        spartan takes only the briefest reconnaissance look
        around  shakes his head sadly 

                                spartan
                  this is crime against nature

        leans into the gto  pushes in the cigarette lighter
        puts it into neutral  wedges the accelerator down  the
        gto bellows  the cigarette lighter pops out and spartan
        uses it to light the fuses on the explosive devices
        drops the car into gear  pulls his head out just in time
        as it roars off

        the gto smashes into the front gates  wedges itself in
        from the impact  half a beat later a long low
        thunderous explosion  smoke everywhere  smoke clears

        it aint much but a man can get through now  spartan
        loads the spent cartridges in the guns from his ammo
        belt  huxley doublechecks her stun baton

                                huxley
                         nervous as hell
                  okay look i wasnt at all pleased
                  to cause the fatality of that
                  deranged cryocon but i understand
                  now that sometimes under
                  particular circumstances that
                  violence is necessary

                                spartan
                  good

        takes the stun baton from her and nails her with it mid
        sternum

                                spartan
                  then youll understand this

        she falls into garcias arms

        spartan turns starts towards the cryo prison  as he
        walks  takes a deep breath  loosens up his right
        shoulder  loosens up his left  checks the gun on his
        right hip  checks the gun on his left  theyre both

        seventy pucks are stacked and loaded to be defrosted
        med techs scramble furiously


        int cryo prison  inner thawing room  night

        four pucks are being rapidly removed from around the
        cryocons inside by the cutting lasers  they go blue


        int cryo prison  outer thawing room  night

        the inner room splits open and the med techs rush in to
        the four thawed cryocons as associate bob steps away from
        a vidscreen with some concern 

                                associate bob
                  theres been a breach in the outer
                  gate  an intruder has entered the
                  cryofacility and i feel its safe
                  to assume its john spartan

        phoenix is momentarily taken aback by spartans relent
        lessness  then he looks at his four new recruits
        theyre still kinda dopey  turns to a med tech 

                                phoenix

        gunther lets out the kind of scream the nfl would be
        proud of  charges out the door others behind him


        int cryo prison  lobby  night

        a reception desk  a chaplains office  a be well bas
        relief  very quiet very still

        spartan moves cautiously through  a tiny rotating sensor
        picks up his presence  locks on  as spartan is looking
        the other way  dr raymond cocteau in holo suddenly
        appears in front of the display

                                cocteau image
                  greetings andbewell

        he never gets to say another word  spartan spins and
        ventilates the device with 40 mm slugs

        half a beat  realizes what hes done  in the next
        moment four insane megadrenalized cryocons come
        screaming through the door  barehanded barefooted
        spartan shoots the first two out of hand without a
        thought  but before he can fire again the second two
        are on him

        one gun goes flying  spartan beats on howie with his
        free hand  ignacious fights for control of his gun
        hand

        spartan bashes howie back for a moment continues to
        tussle with ignacious  finally hes had enough 

                                spartan
                  fine  take it

        he lets go of the gun  ignacious grabs it and still in
        shock over this turn of events begins to fumble with
        it  spartan reaches up with both hands and breaks
        his neck

        howie leaps on him from behind trying to do the same
        to spartan  spartan squat presses down with this three
        hundred pound behemoth wrapped around his neck retrieves
        the gun out of ignaciouss stiffening fingers  turns
        the barrel around towards himself  howie reaches
        desperately but its just out of reach  spartan
        fires over his shoulder  howie or whats left of him
        slides away


        int cryo prison  outer thawing room  night

        med techs scramble furiously  phoenix grabs the glowing
        compuclipboard from bob

                                phoenix
                  so whos left thats good
                  ooooh ramon gutieriz  we

                  come on

        simon jumps onto one of the cranes with a six clawed
        arm  stands at the controls

                                phoenix
                  go

        it does  moves too  bob has to trot to keep up


        int cryo prison  stark white corridor  night

        a pair of double doors slip silently open  spartan a
        gun in each hand slides in  he is back in the stark
        white corridor where he once said goodbye to his wife
        and daughter  looks at the empty alcove  it gives him
        the creeps  he makes his way to the door at the far end
        and steps in 


        int cryo prison  main room  night

        spartan prowls through the now depleted multilifer wing
        empty pods everywhere

        the displays all read  cryo prisoner exited  yeeesh
        theres a lot of them that way  a whir followed by
        trotting footsteps

        spartan whirls  a crane whirring by and associate bob
        trotting behind  spartan follows  creeps slowly
        around the corner  guns up comes around a turn to
        spot phoenix locking the arm into a puck  takes aim
        phoenix sees him at the same time  yanks a control on
        the crane  the puck pivots up as spartan fires

        the 40mm bullet lodges half in half out of the puck in
        front of phoenixs grinning face

                                phoenix
                  dont you understand the meaning
                  of give up  youre too late
                  john  ive got three more batches
                  in the oven

        spartan fires again  the puck barely vibrates  absorbs
        another round beside the unharmed cryocon

        phoenix unleashes an entire magazine from an hk91 slung
        over his back  spartan fires once dives for cover
        although unhit he gets seriously frosted from a pipe
        blow open next to him  forced to roll through the line
        of fire to avoid permanent freezer burn  there are
        pipes burst everywhere

        phoenix turns to find bob slinking away

                                phoenix
                  where the fuck you going

                                associate bob
                  i wish you good luck sir  this
                  is an activity that requires
                  testicles

                                phoenix
                         considers
                  true nuf

        ice is beginning to form on the surface of everything
        nearby

                                phoenix
                  take those stairs ill cover
                  you

        bob nods gratefully  does  phoenix shakes his head at
        bobs gullibility

                                phoenix
                         sotto to himself
                  no brains either

        spartan hears footsteps coming  whirls  fires  blows
        bob away  a momentary distraction but its enough
        phoenix is gone

        spartan turns slowly  guns out in each direction
        searching  a sound  fires  no simon  more pipes
        burst  its ten or twenty degrees below zero in there
        already  everything is coated with supercooled ice
        footing becomes treacherous

        phoenix crawls through a jungle of pipe  gets a bead on
        spartans lower body  starts to strafe the area  dh uh
        everything has become so slick the recoil drives him back
        across the ice into the open  spartan sees him fires
        the recoil slams him back against a wall  he fires again
        with something firm to lean on but the recoil from
        phoenixs sputtering weapon drives him right over the
        edge  he drops off into the center out of spartans
        sight  slipping and sliding spartan slithers down the
        stairs to 


        main level

        a familiar whirring  turns  half a beat later he is
        bodyslammed and smashed and grabbed by a sixarmed crane
        his guns go flying off into god knows where

        spartan is hoisted high in air smashed again and again
        against a pillar  phoenix slams him through a web of
        pipes  holds him in the freezing blast  ice forms all
        over spartan  he struggles  it cracks off reforms
        struggles again  it cracks off  reforms  struggles
        again  hes weakening

        reaches up  grabs the pipe wrests it over directs
        the blast at phoenix  holds it steady  phoenix is
        frozen in place  coats in ice  we can see the madness
        in his eyes  everything else is still  he roars
        breaks free  retreats from the blast  disappears as 

        spartan wrenches the pipe over to the claw arm  holds
        it directly over one joint  then clobbers it with
        the pipe  it shatters  he drops

        lights are beginning to explode from the cold  its
        dropped 30 degrees below zero in there by now  spartan
        spots phoenix on the far side of the room  hundred feet
        away

        half a moment to catch his breath in the freezing
        cold leans on exposed cryopuck  it slides effortlessly
        spartan hurls it across the floor at phoenix  a five
        hundred pound hockey puck  phoenix barely avoids the
        crushing blow  it rebounds back off the steel

        no point fighting the elements  spartan hurls himself
        across the floor  spins slowly twice along the way
        its like zero grav in two dimensions  no friction
        coefficient at all

        three quarters of a second across the floor  right
        hook into phoenixs surprised face

        phoenix goes flying a hundred feet back into the far
        side  crashes and falls

        the cryo prison creaks and screams in protest from the
        cold  lighting grids struts shatter fall about them
        they hurl themselves together again  spartan lands a
        horrific blow  all but drives phoenixs nose and eye
        sockets through the back of his head  spartans
        forearm is terribly cut

        the blood freezes solid as it sprays sealing the wound
        and leaving a giant six foot red feather spray  spartan
        brushes it away breaks off bleeds freezes again
        instantly

        they fly apart again  spartan comes to a stop near a
        tool cart  pokes at the tools  one is an mtl cutting
        laser  he has no idea what it is  nothing there he
        recognizes  picks up a four foot wrench  that he
        recognizes  he looks like a caveman  a very angry
        caveman

        the building complains loudly  falling apart around
        them  more and more pipes explode burst it gets colder
        and colder  50 degrees below by now

        phoenix on the far side also scrambles for a weapon
        he sees an mtl as well but he knows what it is

        fires it up  focused three inch cutting beam comes
        out  rips off the top cover pulls out five optical
        elements pulls out the choke tube rips the whole
        front off the mtl  doesnt look very sleek now

        fires it

        a thirty foot long spray of white white magnesium
        thermite flame comes flying out

        one swipe he clears the ice from a path he can walk
        towards spartan on

        metal bars melt away as the thermite flare crosses
        through them

        on the top level of the cryo prison the first batch
        of raving psychopath defrosted cryocons wanders in
        to watch john spartan die

        this is the most depraved frighteninglooking group of
        individuals youve ever seen in your life

                                angry cryocon
                  spartan

                                many angry cryocons
                  kill him  kill him

        spartan looks up at them  like he needs this shit

        simon continues to melt himself a path across the floor
        towards spartan

        the heat from the mtl is furious  the difference between
        the 2000 degrees plus and 80 degrees below is more than
        any metal can handle  fissures appear in giant lightning
        strike cracks in all directions where the mtl hits

        every bit of ice in the building melts  water boiling
        away instantaneously in the path of the mtl
        spartan has nowhere to run  and nothing but a big
        fucking club  to his left he suddenly sees an empty
        chamber  except this one was never filled  the display
        reads  ready for cryo

        theres a tiny white chip in the vial inside the vacuum
        bell  spartan looks at it  its like a very bad memory
        coming back  but he knows what it is and knows what it
        does  smashes the vacuum bell with the wrench

        simon grows closer

        spartan bashes the robot arm out of the way  picks
        up the vial  looks around desperately  no point using
        it if its going to kill him too  grabs the grid of
        the floor above him  heaves himself up

        simon lifts the mtl towards him  it almost reaches
        up to the landing above  spartan hurls the vial at
        simons feet

        it shatters  nothing happens  the heat from the mtl
        has boiled off all the water in a ten foot circle nearby

        the mtl flame comes closer  in a moment spartan will
        get cooked  instead of running away he moves closer
        stands up on the railing of the second landing  and
        just as his clothes begin to catch fire from the heat
        leaps 

        over the oncoming thermal flame as it arcs up towards
        him  and over and past phoenix

        spartan lands behind him coming around with an elbow
        into phoenixs kidney causing phoenix to drop the mtl

        outside their circle of heat the tiny chip hits the
        water  melts  and again like the opposite of watching
        ice shatter the water everywhere goes steel solid
        stuttering out in all directions

        phoenix still has a free hand  smashes a nerve center
        on the side of spartans neck  spartan twitches visibly
        from it  grunts

        spartan punches him right left right in the sternum
        phoenix coughs blood spits it away

        steps back to launch a mighty blow at spartan and 

        his heel just steps into a puddle of water  the tiniest
        rivulet drifts over connects it to the main ice solid
        locked water

        simon feels his foot stuck  and as he looks down in
        consternation realizes in shock whats happened and
        then looks up spartan hits him straight from the
        shoulder with everything he has left dead in the face
        as phoenix solidifies

        phoenixs head snaps clean off

        hits like a ball bearing on polished steel  bounces
        with a clang  rolls off  clang clang clang clang
        clang

        spartan reaches desperately for the still spewing mtl
        as the rivulets close in towards him

        grabs onto it just in time  spins melts off a
        protective circle around him
        looks up at the peanut gallery of cryocons

                                spartan
                  all right whos next

        nobody moves  nobody can move  every last one is
        dead  frozen in place

        the building continues to collapse around spartan  more
        lights blow out  a giant beam comes crashing down

                                spartan
                         a massive
                          understatement
                  i think its time to go

        carefully melting a path to the door spartan comes
        through 


        int cryo prison  stark white corridor  night

        mtl still blazing the hall bursts into flame around him
        as he leaves  he takes no chances  continues to melt
        and burn his way out


        ext cryo prison  night

        outside the building but still inside the gate  spartan
        pauses still holding the flaming mtl thinks about it a
        sec torches the rest of the whole evil fucking place


        gate

        as spartan steps through the mtl sputters to a halt
        he tosses it aside  the cryo prison burns explodes
        freezes contracts expands behind him

        a far greater crowd has gathered  police citizens
        scraps  they watch in silent awe and shock as spartan
        reemerges  katherine walks up  deadpan as her
        father 

                                katherine
                  good to see you again dad
                         kisses him on
                          the cheek
                  come by sometime for dinner
                         re  the
                          destruction
                  ill cook

        he kisses her back on the cheek  she smiles they
        hug  lenina watches from nearby

                                huxley
                  that was it  thats the whole
                  kissing thing  what was cocteau
                  so worried about

        spartan grabs her  lays a real kiss on her  long and
        hard  she comes up for air gasping eyes shiny

                                huxley
                  oh  my
                         then
                  is the rest of fluid transfer
                  activities like this

                                spartan
                         beat dry
                  better

                                huxley
                         beat
                  better  oh  my

        she kisses him  long and hard  breaks

                                huxley
                  welcome to the future john
                  spartan  now that youve
                  destroyed everything

        he throws an arm over her shoulder  they turn and walk
        away  they head off into the sunrise

                                spartan
                  yeah i think im gonna like it
                  here

                  theres one thing i want to
                  know though  how does that
                  damn three seashells thing
                  work

        and as the music comes up and obscures her explanation
        we 

                                                   fade outthe end
