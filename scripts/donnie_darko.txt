               we descend upon carpathian ridge a crescentshaped cliff 
               that extrudes from the dense virginia evergreens above a 
               deep rock canyon the cliff marks the end of a dirt road 
               that winds down from above

               donnie darko sixteen is asleep at the edge of the cliff 
               with his bike collapsed next to him he is shivering curled 
               up on the foetal position

               he slowly opens his eyes and looks around disoriented by 
               the morning light he then stands up looking down into the 
               expansive rock canyon after a moment of hesitation he takes 
               his bike back up the hill

                         i was feeding fear with food and 
                         finally i looked in the mirror 
                         not just in the mirror i looked 
                         through the mirror and in that image

                         the bottom line mr cole is 
                         that there is material being taught 
                         to our children that is cause for

                         listening to me there are other 
                         things that need to be taken into 
                         account here like the whole spectrum

               as everyone is leaving class donnie stays behind

                                     donnie
                         dr monnitoff

                                     dr monnitoff
                         donnie

                                     donnie
                         i know that this is gonna sound kinda 
                         weird but do you know anything 
                         about time travel

               dr monnitoff pauses turns and looks at donnie he seems to 
               know something

               int physics class  later on

               dr monnitoff has drawn a diagram on the blackboard in his 
               hand he holds a copy of stephen hawkings a brief history 
               of time

                                     dr monnitoff
                         so according to hawking 
                         wormholes might be able to provide a 
                         short cut for jumping between two 
                         distant regions of spacetime

                                     donnie
                         so in order to travel back in 
                         time youd have to have a big 
                         spaceship or something that can travel 
                         faster than the speed of light 

                                     dr monnitoff
                         theoretically

                                     donnie
                          and be able to find one of these 
                         wormholes

                                     dr monnitoff
                         a wormhole with an einsteinrosen 
                         bridge which is theoretically a 
                         wormhole in space controlled by man

                                     donnie
                         so thats it

                                     dr monnitoff
                         the basic principles of time travel 
                         are there
                              beat
                         so you have the vessel and the portal  
                         and the vessel can be anything most 
                         likely a spacecraft

                         living creature on this earth dies 
                         alone

                                     dr thurman
                         how does that make you feel

                                     donnie
                         it reminded me of my dog callie

                                     dr thurman
                         is callie still around

                                     donnie
                         no she died when i was eight we 
                         couldnt find her for days she went 
                         and crawled underneath our back 
                         porch

                                     dr thurman
                         do you feel alone right now

               he looks at her for a moment

                                     donnie
                         id like to believe that im not 
                         but ive just never seen any proof 
                         so i just choose not to bother with 
                         it its like i could spend my 
                         whole life thinking about it 
                         debating it in my head weighing the 
                         pros and cons and in the end i 
                         still wouldnt have any proof so 
                         i dont even debate it any more  
                         because its absurd
                              beat
                         i dont want to be alone
                              beat
                         so does that make me like an 
                         atheist

                                     dr thurman
                         no that makes you keep searching

               donnie takes this in for a moment

               int family room  evening sunday 715 pm

               eddie and dr fisher watch the redskins game ronald and 
               donnie watch the game in the family room

                                     eddie
                         ahh we need theisman

                                     dr fisher
                         we need a miracle

               int kitchen  next

               rose and anne fisher fortyfive share a bottle of wine at 
               the kitchen table

                                     anne
                         and so his tapes made me realise 
                         that for fortyfive years i have 
                         been a a prisoner of fear rose you 
                         have to meet jim cunningham
                              taking a sip of wine
                         i cant believe hes not married

               samantha bounces through the kitchen and into the family 
               room wearing a dorothy outfit from the wizard of oz

               int family room  next

               donnie sits back in the laz boy dozing off

               john maddens cbs chalkboard unfolds on the tv screen madden 
               traces his electronic lines across the screen tracing the 
               movement of the players as their images are frozen in 
               time

               donnies eyes close and then reopen

               donnie turns his head and sees that the room is momentarily 
               bathed in artificial white light as if god hit the slow
               motion button during a flash of lightning

               donnie turns his head and sees that protruding from his 
               fathers stomach is a thick spear made of silvery plastic 
               gel

               as eddie gets up from the couch to walk over to the 
               refrigerator his spear precedes him morphing into an 
               extruded arrow that reaches the refrigerator several seconds 
               before him

               the spear traces the exact geography of his movement through 
               time using his centre of gravity as its axis point

               donnie turns and sees samantha skipping from the kitchen 
               as her spear bounces several feet in front of her like a 
               caterpillar

               her spear smaller than her fathers is proportional to 
               her mass

                                     samantha
                              her voice echoing 
                              through the silence
                         follow the yellow brick road

               donnie looks down at his stomach and sees his own spear 
               protruding outward it then begins to extrude forward towards 
               the foyer

               he does not follow it it then retreats back in and beckons 
               him to follow

               like a child transfixed by a firefly donnie follows the 
               path of his spear into the foyer

               int foyer  upstairs hallway  nxt

               donnie and his spear round the corner and arrive in his 
               parents bedroom

               int master bedroom  night

               his spear leads him to the closet he opens the closet door 
               and the spear leads him down to a box hidden beneath his 
               fathers shoe rack

               donnie removes the box from the closet and unlatches it 
               inside is a gun donnie removes the pistol from the box 
               staring at it with the same childlike expression

               suddenly donnies universe snaps back to normal the white 
               light strobes the spear has vanished

               donnie still holds the gun his expression changes to nervous 
               shock

               his eyes linger over the gun for a moment he then quickly 
               puts it back in the box and carefully places the box back 
               under the shoe rack

               rose and eddie sit in front of dr thurman

                                     rose
                         thank you for seeing us we 
                         just felt that it was time to

                                     dr thurman

                         son

                                     rose
                         well you know about his past and 
                         when you said to look for signs of 
                         aggression he was recently 
                         suspended from school for insulting 
                         his gym teacher

                         rose let me just lay out what i 
                         believe is happening here donnies 
                         aggressive behaviour seems to stem 
                         from his increased detachment from 
                         reality his inability to cope with 
                         the forces in the world that he 
                         perceives to be threatening

                         donnie is experiencing what is 
                         commonly called a daylight 
                         hallucination

                         he has described lengthy 
                         conversations physical encounters 
                         with what i believe to be a 
                         manifestation of his subconscious 
                         mind

               rose looks over at eddie with an expression of panic

                                     rose

                         i would like to put him through more 
                         hypnotherapy and increase his 
                         medication

               eddie looks at rose who nods in approval

                                     rose
                         if thats what you think is necessary

                         but let me remind you that this 
                         treatment is experimental

               int kitchen  night

               donnie walks into the kitchen and removes a butchers knife 
               from a drawer

               int upstairs bathroom  night

               donnie stands in front of the bathroom mirror catatonic  
               looking at his reflection

               frank stands behind him

               suddenly donnie turns around with the butchers knife and 
               lunges at frank with all of his weight

               the knife collides with franks invisible force field as if 
               it were liquid steel donnie lunges repeatedly at frank with 
               psychotic rage but the knife bounces off

                         sense some students out there who

                                     jim cunningham
                         now thats what i like to hear
                              suddenly serious
                         because too many young men and women 
                         today are paralysed by their fears 
                         they give in to their feelings of 
                         selfdoubt they surrender their 
                         bodies to the temptations of drugs 
                         alcohol and premarital sex empty 
                         solutions these are toxic 
                         chemicals and diseasespreading 
                         behaviour

               a large screen lowers behind him

                                     jim cunningham
                         i would like to tell you a story 
                         today about a young man whose life 
                         was destroyed by the instruments of 
                         fear a young man searching for 
                         love in all the wrong places
                              shaking his head 
                              tragically
                         his name was frank

               on the giant screen an image slide appears of a young cartoon 
               teenager whose eyes are whacked out on drugs the title 
               appears

                                   his name was frank

               upon hearing the name frank donnie falls into a paranoid 
               trance

               gretchen who looks extremely bored leans over to donnie

                                     gretchen
                         lets get out of here

               donnie ignores her his eyes are locked on jim cunningham 
               who begins his rousing reenactment of the sad unfortunate 
               downfall of frank

               within minutes jim cunningham has the crowd laughing 
               enamoured of him with his cartoon slide show

               note during this sequence the camera speed ramps to 4 bps

               int school auditorium  next 1030 am

               the huge screen rises upwards and jim cunningham takes 
               questions from the crowd from portable mike stands in the 
               back of the auditorium

               several students get up and go to the mikes

                         theres no need to be embarrassed 
                         many times we eat because we are 
                         afraid to face the reality of our 
                         ego reflections we shouldnt just 
                         look into the mirror we should look 
                         through the mirror

               kitty farmer runs out onto the stage and hands jim cunningham 
               a bottle of water and a towel she gives him the thumbsup 
               sign and runs back offstage

                                     lanky kid
                         um how can i decide what i want 
                         to be when i grow up

                                     jim cunningham
                         i think you should look deep within 
                         yourself deep within your heart 
                         and find what it is in the world 
                         that makes you feel love just pure 
                         love and then go to that in your 
                         studies in your athletics go 
                         towards love

                                     lanky kid

                                     jim cunningham
                         violence is a product of fear those 
                         who love themselves enough should 
                         have no need to fight another person 
                         learn to truly love yourself and 
                         the world will be yours

                                     larry riesman

                         yeah so the idea is that you buy 
                         these glasses for your infant and 
                         they wear them at night when they

                         slide photographs and each photograph 
                         is of something peaceful or

                         what effect do you think this would 
                         have on an infant

                                     donnie
                         well the thing is nobody remembers 
                         their infancy and anyone who says 
                         they do is lying we think that this 
                         would help develop memory earlier in 
                         life

                                     dr monnitoff
                         did you stop and think that maybe 
                         infants need darkness that darkness 
                         is part of their natural development

                         uhh sure and in order for the 
                         vessel to travel through time it 
                         must find the portal in this case 
                         the wormhole or some unforeseen 
                         portal that lies undiscovered

                         that is highly unlikely youre 
                         talking about an act of god

                         time is predecided then every living

                         could see into the future and thats 
                         a form of time travel right

                         you are contradicting yourself 
                         donnie if we could see our destines 
                         manifest themselves visually then 
                         we would be given the choice to betray 
                         our chosen destinies the very fact 
                         that this choice exists would 
                         mean that all preformed destiny 
                         would end

                              cough
                         it could be the death of an entire

                         why should i mourn for a rabbit like 
                         it was a human

                         is the death of one species less

                         of course a rabbit is not like us 
                         it has no history books it has no 
                         knowledge of sorrow or regret i 
                         like bunnies and all theyre cute 
                         and theyre horny and if youre 
                         cute and horny then youre probably 
                         happy that you dont know who you 
                         are or why youre even alive but 
                         the only thing ive known rabbits to 
                         do is have sex as many times as 
                         possible before they die

                         and he cares for them so we care

                         a famous linguist once said that 
                         of all the phrases in the english 
                         language of all the endless

                         keeps us going

               she takes the box and crosses the room towards donnie

                                     ms pomeroy

               int main hallway  next 315 pm

               and with that ms pomeroy turns and walks down the hallway 
               with her career in a cardboard box heading towards the 
               bright friday afternoon sunlight

               donnie walks back down the hallway lost in his own 
               introspection

               across the way at her locker as cherita chen donnie 
               approaches her slowly like a cat

               she turns from her locker and they make eye contact

               she looks at him warily frightened a book falls from her 
               arms onto the floor

               written in large letters on the brown book cover is his name

               donnie darko

               he comes face to face with her grabs her earmuffs with both 
               hands and touches his forehead to hers as if he were going 
               to kiss her

                                     donnie
                              long beat
                         i promise that one day things will 
                         get better for you

               cherita holds still for a moment trembling and then jerks 
               back from him her earmuffs come off in his hands

               she backs away from him slowly a single tear rolls down her 
               cheek

                                     cherita
                         chut up

               she then turns and runs down the hall disappearing from 
               sight

               ext old gun road  afternoon 4 pm

               donnie walks by himself thinking wearing cheritas 
               earmuffs

                         it has to happen soon it has to 
                         happen soon

               dr thurman gets up and tries to control donnie following 
               him around the room

                                     dr thurman

                         who is he going to kill

               dr thurman grabs him trying to get him under control in an 
               awkward embrace

                                     dr thurman
                         who is he going to kill

               donnie stares across the office like a frightened child 
               as the room becomes white with artificial light

               frank is there in the office staring back at him

                                     donnie
                              freaking out

                                     donnie

                         mind and hell show me the way out 
                         of this the sky is going to open 
                         up and then he will reveal himself 
                         to me

                                     dr thurman
                         if the sky were to suddenly open 
                         up there would be no law there 
                         would be no rule there would only 
                         be you and your memories the 
                         choices youve made and the people 
                         youve touched the life that has 
                         been carved out from your subconscious 
                         is the only evidence by which you 
                         will be judged by which you must 
                         judge yourself because when this 
                         world ends there will only be you 
                         and him and no one else

               of his trance

               donnie walks towards the kitchen but then doubles over 
               against the wall in pain

               suddenly the room blows out with a strobe of white light 
               as costumed teenagers and their vector spears intersect in a 
               shimmering maze of chaos

               donnie slowly follows his spear as it leads him through the 
               crowd directly towards the refrigerator

               donnie stares blankly at what he sees scrawled in magic 
               marker on the memo board

               it reads frank was here went to get beer

               donnie stares at the board for several moment he then 
               turns his head and sees a teenager with a ronald reagan mask 
               walk by

               he then sees another spear come towards him gretchen rounds 
               the corner coming in from the family room

               donnie falls to his knees and puts his face inside the end 
               of gretchens spear we see his pov  an abyssal tunnel 
               of light

               side of the house everyone hears it

               donnie looks towards the lower front of the house where there 
               is a cellar door

                                     gretchen

                              his eyes widen
                         yeah

               the cellar door is ajar and there is a dim light coming 
               out from inside

                                     ronald

               donnie and gretchen open the door to the cellar and descend 
               down into a murky pit with a stone floor

               inside the room is quite large filled with row after 
               row of boxes paintings antique furniture and chandeliers 
               there is even an ancient piano in the back

               gretchen slowly reaches her hand out and places her finger 
               on the deepest piano key

               suddenly a figure emerges from the shadows and slams donnie 
               into the wall he then grabs gretchen by placing an arm around 
               her neck with a butchers knife

               it is ricky danforth seth comes out from another corner 
               also brandishing a butchers knife both have pantyhose pulled 
               over their heads

                                     ricky

               the four of them come bursting out of the cellar

               seth holds donnies arms down with his knees and places the 
               butchers knife against his throat

               ricky throws gretchen down hard onto the shoulder of old gun 
               road

               she lets out a gasp of pain as her head hits the gravel

               sean and ronald watch dumbfounded backing away

               seth just stares down at donnie with his dead eyes pushing 
               the knife down harder cutting off donnies air supply

                                     sean

                         theres a car coming

               seth slowly turns his head and sees far down old gun 
               road approaching headlights

                                     donnie

               gretchen struggles to breathe on the shoulder of the road 
               the wind knocked out of her semiconscious

                                     seth

                              in a hoarse whisper
                         donnie

                                     donnie

               seth gets up and runs off with ricky into the forest just 
               as the approaching car crests the top of old gun road at 
               breakneck speed

               suddenly in the bright glow of the cars headlights is 
               the silhouette of grandma death standing in the middle of 
               the road

               in her right hand she is clutching a letter

               donnies letter

                                     gretchen
                         donnie

               the car swerves left barely missing grandma death

               the pontiac tries to brake hard but the wheels lock 
               and it goes skidding onto the shoulder

               gretchen raises her head from the gravel into bright 
               headlight beams

               the transam goes barrelling over her like a speedbump 
               and her limp body rolls off into the grassy ditch

               the transam skids off into the grass and collides headon 
               with the crumbling stone chimney which explodes into the 
               crumpled hood of the car as it eventually comes to a stop 
               in a fury of smoke

               donnie staggers to his feet regaining his breath he runs 
               over to gretchen and kneels down next to her

                                     donnie
                         gretchen wake up wake up

               her neck is broken she has no pulse

               the passenger door to the transam opens and a passenger in 
               a clown costume gets out

               the drivers side door opens and the driver gets out

               he is wearing a rabbit suit a halloween costume

               he is holding the grotesque rabbit helmet in his hand

                         do

               frank approaches donnie who raises his head from gretchen 
               to see him for the first time face to face with an 
               expression of shocked horror

                                     passenger

               slowly

               grandma death looms behind them

                         waiting for you

               donnie raises the gun from his fathers closet with his right 
               hand and to his own surprise he pulls the trigger

               franks left eye implodes as the bullet passes through his 
               head his body falls limply to the ground

                         holy shit

               the passenger turns and runs off into the woods

                                     ronald
                         whatd you do donnie whatd you

                         that everything is going to be just

               after contemplation of the recent events sean and ronald 
               turn and run off in the opposite direction

               donnie is left alone with the dead bodies

               he turns and stares at grandma death who is calmly standing 
               there with his letter in her hand

               she stares at the house where paramedics wheel a body out 
               of the front door

                                     gretchen
                         what was his name

                                     david
                         donnie donnie darko

               they stare at the front yard for a while we see elizabeth 
               we see eddie carrying samantha who is crying

                                     david
                         i feel bad for his family

                                     gretchen
                              long beat
                         yeah

                                     david
                         did you know him

               she stares at the family for several moments and then 
               shakes her head slowly as if trying to locate a memory that 
               is slipping away

                                     gretchen
                         no

               rose leaning against a tree while smoking a cigarette 
               notices them she seems to recognise gretchen from 
               somewhere in the vast reservoir of her memory

               she waves at her

               she waves back

               fade out

                                         the end
