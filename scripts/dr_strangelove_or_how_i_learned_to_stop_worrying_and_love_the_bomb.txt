reason men i want to impress upon you the need for extreme 
watchfulness  the enemy may come individually or he may come in 
strength  he may even come in the uniform of our own troops  but however 
he comes we must stop him  we must not allow him to gain entrance to this 
base  now i am going to give you three simple rules  first trust no 
one whatever his uniform or rank unless he is known to you personally  
second anyone or anything that approaches within 200 yards of the 
perimeter is to be fired upon  third if in doubt shoot first and ask 
questions afterwards  i would sooner accept a few casualties through 
accident than lose the entire base and its personnel through 
carelessness  any variation on these rules must come from me personally  
now men in conclusion i would like to say that in the two years it has 
been my privilege to be your commanding officer i have always expected 
the best from you and you have never given me anything less than thatcut to  int  burpleson afb omputer room  mandrake who has been

mandrake enters rippers officemandrakeexcuse me sir something rather interestings just cropped up  listen to 
that  music  civilian broadcasting  i think those fellows in the 
pentagon have given us some sort of exercise to test our readiness  
personally i think its taking it a bit too far our fellows will be 
inside russian radar cover in about twenty minutes  you listen to that  
traffic block full of stations all churning it outrippermandrakemandrakeyes sirripperi thought i issued instructions for all radios on this base to be 
impoundedmandrakefollows ripper as he rises from his chair to lock his office doorwell you did indeed sir and i was in the process of impounding this very 
one when i happened to switch it on  i thought to myself our fellows 
hitting russian radar cover in twenty minutes dropping all their stuff 
id better tell you because if they do itll cause a bit of a stink 
wont itrippergroup captain the officer exchange program does not give you any special 
prerogatives to question my ordersmandrakewell i realize that sir but i thought youd be rather pleased to hear the 
news  i mean after all well lets face it we we dont want to start a 
nuclear war unless we really have to do weripperplease sit down  and turn that thing offmandrakeyes sir  ah what about the planes sir  surely you must issue the 
recall code immediatelyrippergroup captain the planes are not going to be recalled  my attack orders 
have been issued and the orders standmandrakewell if youll excuse me saying so sir  that would be to my way of 
thinking rather well rather an odd way of looking at it  you see if 
a russian attack was in progress we would certainly not be hearing 
civilian broadcastingripperare you certain of that mandrakemandrakeim absolutely positive about that sir yesripperand what if it is truemandrakewell im afraid im still not with you sir  because i mean if a 
russian attack was not in progress then your use of plan r in fact your 
orders to the entire wing oh  well i would say sir that there was 
something dreadfully wrong somewhererippernow why dont you just take it easy group captain  and please make me a 
drink of grain alcohol and rain water and help yourself to whatever youd 
likemandrakesalutesgeneral ripper sir as an officer in her majestys air 
force it is my clear duty under the present circumstances to issue the

excuse me sirmandrake tries all exits and finds them lockedim 
afraid sir i must ask you for the key and the recall code  have you got 
them handy sirripperi told you to take it easy group captain  theres nothing anybody can do 
about this thing now  im the only person who knows the three letter code

here so enjoyably a decision is being made by the president and the joint 
chiefs in the war room at the pentagon  and when they realize there is no 
possibility of recalling the wing there will be only one course of action 
open  total committmentmandrake do you recall what clemenzo once said about warmandrakeno  i dont think i do sir noripperhe said war was to important to be left to the generals  when he said 
that fifty years ago he might have been right  but today war is too 
important to be left to politicians  they have neither the time the 
training nor the inclination for strategic thought  i can no longer sit 
back and allow communist infiltration communist indoctrination communist 
subversion and the international communist conspiracy to sap and impurify 
all of our precious bodily fluidscut to  int war room pentagonmuffleysam is everybody herestainsmr president the secretary of state is in vietnam the secretary of 
defense is in laos and the vice president is in mexico city  we can 
establish contact with them at any time if its necessary  the 
undersecretaries are all here of coursemuffleyright  now general turgidson whats going on hereturgidsonmr president about thirtyfive minutes ago general jack ripper the 
commanding general of burpleson air force base issued an order to the 34 
b52s of his wing which were airborne at the time as part of a special 
exercise we were holding called operation dropkick  now it appears that 
the order called for the planes to attack their targets inside russia  
the planes are fully armed with nuclear weapons with an average load of 40 
megatons each  now the central display of russia will indicate the 
position of the planes  the triangles are their primary targets the 
squares are their secondary targets  the aircraft will begin penetrating 
russian radar cover within 25 minutesmuffleygeneral turgidson i find this very difficult to understand  i was under 
the impression that i was the only one in authority to order the use of 
nuclear weaponsturgidsonthats right sir  you are the only person authorized to do so  and 
although i hate to judge before all the facts are in its beginning to 
look like general ripper exceeded his authoritymuffleyit certainly does  far beyond the point i would have imagined possibleturgidsonwell perhaps youre forgetting the provisions of plan r sirmuffleyplan rturgidsonplan r is an emergency war plan in which a lower echelon commander may 
order nuclear retaliation after a sneak attack if the normal chain of 
command is disrupted  you approved it sir  you must remember  surely 
you must recall sir when senator buford made that big hassle about our 
deterrent lacking credibility  the idea was for plan r to be a sort of 
retaliatory safeguardmuffleya safeguardturgidsoni admit the human element seems to have failed us here  but the idea was 
to discourage the russkies from any hope that they could knock out 
washington and yourself sir as part of a general sneak attack and 
escape retaliation because of lack of proper command and controlmuffleywell i assume then that the planes will return automatically once they 
reach their failsafe pointsturgidsonwell sir im afraid not  you see the planes were holding at their 
failsafe points when the go code was issued now once they fly beyond 
failsafe they do not require a second order to proceed  they will fly 
until they reach their targetsmuffleythen why havent you radioed the planes countermanding the go codeturgidsonwell im afraid were unable to communicate with any of the aircraftmuffleywhyturgidsonas you may recall sir one of the provisions of plan r provides that once 
the go code is received the normal ssb radios in the aircraft are switched 
into a special coded device which i believe is designated as crm114  
now in order to prevent the enemy from issuing fake or confusing orders 
crm114 is designed not to receive at all unless the message is preceded 
by the correct three letter code group prefixmuffleythen do you mean to tell me general turgidson that you will be unable to 
recall the aircraftturgidsonthats about the size of it  however we are plowing through every 
possible three letter combination of the code  but since there are 
seventeen thousand permutations its going to take us about two and a half 
days to transmit them allmuffleyhow soon did you say the planes would penetrate russian radar coverturgidsonabout eighteen minutes from now sirmumuffleyare you in contact with general ripperturgidsonah no sir no general ripper sealed off the base and cut off all 
communicationsmuffleywhere did you get all this informationturgidsongeneral ripper called strategic air command headquarters shortly after he 
issued the go code  i have a partial transcript of that conversation if 
youd like me to read itmuffleyread itturgidsonthe duty officer asked general ripper to confirm the fact the he had 
issued the go code and he said yes gentlemen they are on their way in 
and no one can bring them back  for the sake of our country and our way 
of life i suggest you get the rest of sac in after them otherwise we 
will be totally destroyed by red retaliation  my boys will give you the 
best kind of start fourteen hundred megatons worth and you sure as hell 
wont stop them now  so lets get going  theres no other choice  god 
willing we will prevail in peace and freedom from fear and in true health 
through the purity and essence of our natural fluids  god bless you 
all  then he hung up  were still trying to figure out the meaning of 
that last phrase sirmuffleytheres nothing to figure out general turgidson  this man is obviously a 
psychoticturgidsonwell id like to hold off judgment on a thing like that sir until all 
the facts are inmuffleyanger risinggeneral turgidson when you instituted the human 
reliability tests you assured me there was no possibility of such a thing 
ever occurringturgidsonwell i dont think its quite fair to condemn a whole program because of a 
single slip up sirmuffleyi want to speak to general ripper on the telephone personallyturgidsonim afraid thats impossible sirmuffleygeneral turgidson i am becoming less and less interested in your 
estimates of what is possible and impossible  general facemanfacemanyes sirmuffleyare there any army units stationed anywhere near burplesonfacemanwell ah ill just check sirturgidsons phone beepsturgidsonhellopause then whisperingi told you never to call me here

put him in immediate telephone contact with mefacemanyes sirturgidsonmr president if i may advise under condition red it is standard 
procedure that the base be sealed off and the base be defended by base 
security troops  any force  trying to enter there would certainly 
encounter very heavy casualtiesfacemangeneral turgidson with all due respect for your defense team my boys can 
brush em aside without too much troubleturgidsonmr president there are one or two points id like to make if i maymuffleygo ahead generalturgidsonone our hopes for recalling the 843rd bomb wing are quickly being reduced 
to a very low order of probability  two in less than fifteen minutes 
from now the russkies will be making radar contact with the planes  
three when the do they are going to go absolutely ape and theyre gonna 
strike back with everything theyve got  four if prior to this time we 
have done nothing further to suppress their retaliatory capabilities we 
will suffer virtual annihilation  now five if on the other hand we 
were to immediately launch an all out and coordinated attack on all their 
airfields and missile bases wed stand a damn good chance of catching em 
with their pants down  hell we got a five to one missile superiority as 
it is  we could easily assign three missiles to every target and still 
have a very effective reserve force for any other contingency  now six 
an unofficial study which we undertook of this eventuality indicated that 
we would destroy ninety percent of their nuclear capabilities  we would 
therefore prevail and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian 
casualties from their remaining force which would be badly damaged and 
uncoordinatedmuffleygeneral it is the avowed policy of our country never to strike first with 
nuclear weaponsturgidsonwell mr president i would say that general ripper has already 
invalidated that policylaughsmuffleythat was not an act of national policy and there are still alternatives 
left open to usturgidsonmr president we are rapidly approaching a moment of truth both for 
ourselves as human beings and for the life of our nation  now the truth 
is not always a pleasant thing but it is necessary now make a choice to 
choose between two admittedly regrettable but nevertheless 
distinguishable postwar environments  one where you got twenty million 
people killed and the other where you got a hundred and fifty million 
people killedmuffleyyoure talking about mass murder general not warturgidsonmr president im not saying we wouldnt get our hair mussed  but i do 
say no more than ten to twenty million killed tops   uh depended 
on the breaksmuffleyi will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since adolph

keep up with the expense involved in the arms race the space race and 
the peace race  and at the same time our people grumbled for more nylons 
and washing machines  our doomsday scheme cost us just a small fraction 
of what wed been spending on defense in a single year  but the deciding 
factor was when we learned that your country was working along similar 
lines and we were afraid of a doomsday gapmuffleythis is preposterous  ive never approved of anything like thatdesadeskiour source was the new york timesmuffleydr strangelove do we have anything like that in the worksstains and turgidson who have been listening to muffley and desadeski

the discussion between muffley and desadeskiunder the authority 
granted me as director of weapons research and development i commissioned 
last year a study of this project by the bland corporation  based on the 
findings of the report my conclusion was that this idea was not a 
practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too 
obviousmuffleythen you mean it is possible for them to have built such a thingstrangelovecarefully plucks cigarette from his shaking right hand which is in a 
black glovemr president the technology required is easily within 
the means of even the smallest nuclear power  it requires only the will 
to do somuffleybut how is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically and 
at the same time impossible to untriggerstrangelovemr president it is not only possible it is essential  that is the 
whole idea of this machine you know  deterrence is the art of producing 
in the mind of the enemy thefearto attack  and so because of 
the automated and irrevocable decision making process which rules out 
human meddling the doomsday machine is terrifying  its simple to 
understand  and completely credible and convincingturgidsongee i wish we had one of them doomsday machines stainsymuffleybut this is fantastic strangelove  how can it be triggered automaticallystrangelovewell its remarkably simple to do that  when you merely wish to bury 
bombs there is no limit to the size  after that they are connected to a 
gigantic complex of computers  now then a specific and clearly defined 
set of circumstances under which the bombs are to be exploded is 
programmed into a tape memory bankturgidsonstrangelove  what kind of a name is that  that aint no kraut name is 
it stainsystainshe changed it when he became a citizen  it used to be merkwurkdigliebeturgidsonhmm  a kraut by any other name huh stainsystrangeloveyes but the whole point of the doomsday machine is lost if you
