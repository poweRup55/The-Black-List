			up making an ass of himself better

					mcilvaine
			how is that better

					cynthia
			come on people cannot turn away
			from an accident you drive by
			you say ooh i hope theres not
			a head lying in the road but you
			look  see nobody in america
			wants to be nobody this guy
			wants to be famous so
			basically the deal is he agrees
			to drive down the highway a
			hundred miles an hour blindfolded
			and we get to see if his head
			winds up rolling down the
			highway fun for the whole
			family so lets do it

					entertainment reporter
			tomorrow morning the cable

			television in an experiment that
			they say will last at least a month
			theyre going to follow  live 
			every waking minute of a thirtyone
			year old video store clerk from
			paramus new jersey the real tv
			press release on this promises that
			none of it will be scripted none of
			it will be edited and in my opinion

	wise

					john
			i feel that ed is the apotheosis
			of a prevailing american
			syndrome it used to be that
			someone became famous because
			they were special now people
			are considered special just for
			being famous fame itself is
			now a moral good in this country
			its its own virtue
