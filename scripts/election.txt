			none of this would have happened if mr 
			mcallister hadnt meddled the way he 
			did  he should have just accepted 
			things as they are instead of trying to 
			interfere with destiny  you see you 
			cant interfere with destiny  thats 
			why its destiny  and if you try to 
			interfere the same things going to 
			happen anyway and youll just suffer

	close on dave really getting into it playing to an unseen stadium 
	behind him jim is very careful with his chords
	
					jim vo contd
			you could tell dave was one of those 
			guys who taught because they never

					tracy vo contd
			you probably think the worst  that mr 
			novotny was just taking advantage of one

			during my sophomore year in geometry it 
			was strictly professional between us

	palpable mood of boredom and apathy
	
	jerry slavin a handicapped kid in a wheelchair is  at the 
	microphone his head lists to one side and he takes  long breaths as 
	he speaks
	
					jerry

	speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them
	
					tracy
			poet henry david thoreau once wrote i 
			cannot make my days longer so i strive 
			to make them better  with this 
			election we here at millard also have 
			an opportunity to make our high school 
			days better  during this campaign i 
			have had the opportunity to speak with 
			many of you about your concerns  i 
			spoke with freshman eliza ramirez who 
			told me how alienated she feels from her 
			own homeroom  i spoke with sophomore 
			reggie banks who said his mother works 
			in a cafeteria and cant afford to buy 
			him enough spiral notebooks for his 
			classes  i wont bore you with long
			winded promises about all the new and 
			innovative things i will definitely 
			achieve during the year in which it will 
			be my honor and privilege to represent 
			each and every one of you but i can say 
			that my years of experience on the 
			student council have taught me the three 
			most important attributes the president 
			needs to possess  commitment 
	
					doug schenken
			eat me
	
					dougs buddy 
			eat me raw
	
	there is  scattered laughter tracy pauses wait hendricks bounds up 
	and grabs the mike
	
					walt
			if you cant be adults and give these 
			candidates the courtesy they deserve 
			then you dont deserve to be called 
			adults but children because thats what 
			children are and youll be treated like 
			children so lets all listen up
	
	walt backs away to his seat tracy resumes
	
					tracy
			the three most important attributes the 
			president needs to possess are 
			commitment qualifications and 
			experience  ill add one more caring  
			i care about millard and i care about 
			each and every one of you and together 
			we can all make a difference  one of 
			the things i would like to establish is 
			a regular open forum where any student 
			can come and voice their concern about 
			issues we face here at millard  i and 
			the rest of the student council would 
			then interface with the faculty and 
			staff so a continuous dialogue would 
			exist
	
	walt whispers to jim
	
					walt
			id say she knows a thing or two about 
			studentfaculty dialogue
	
	jim nods solemnly
	
					tracy
			when you cast your vote for tracy flick 
			next week you wont just be voting for 
			me  youll be voting for yourself and 
			for every other student our days wont 
			be any longer but they can sure be 
			better  thank you
	
	tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair  there is polite 
	applause and a few whistles  jjjb comes back to the microphone
	
	tracy takes her seat next to paul and glances at him  paul scares 
	straight ahead a fat bead of sweat on his forehead one of his legs 
	is jiggling
	
					jim
			the next candidate for student body 
			president is paul metzier  paul
	
	paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike   though by no means 
	thunderous his applause clearly exceeds tracys  a small cluster of 
	jocks woof for him shaking their fists in the air  paul manages a 
	weak grin for his buddies
	
	tracy shifts in her chair her smile stiff and forced
	
	lisa smiles and nods at paul from the bleachers giving him 
	encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked 
	about
	
	tammys eyes dart between lisa and paul she shows no emotion reveals 
	nothing
	
	the applause quickly dies and after a moment paul remembers to look 
	at the white paper in his hand he speaks in a barely audible 
	monotone never once glancing up
	
					paul
			as many of you know i broke my leg 
			pretty bad thi3 year and the experience 
			has made me reevaluate what i want to do 
			with my life and that is help people 
			when you think about it a school is more 
			than a school its our second home where 
			we spend all cur time and grow as 
			individuals and a community but is our 
			school everything it could be i want our 
			school to reach its true potential that 
			is why i am running for president
	
	jim pinches the bridge of his nose clearly pained
	
	a few loud sound effect snores saw through the air and walt points a 
	stern finger at  you guessed it  doug schenken
	
					paul
			i know what it is to fight hard and win 
			like when we almost went to state last 
			fall and i threw that fourthquarter 
			pass against westside for the touchdown 
			that won the game by three points i 
			wont let you down like i didnt then i 
			promise we can all score a winning
					big breath
			touchdown together vote paul metzier 
			for president thank you
	
	paul now gets considerably less applause but his jock friends remain 
	loyal
	
					jim
			okay paul now our final candidate for 
			president  another one of the metzier 
			clan  sophomore tammy metzier
	
	tammy approaches the mike there are scattered mocking whistles and 
	catcalls
	
	tammy calmly looks over the crowd waiting for the jeers to subside 
	she makes eye contact with lisa who stares back
	
					walt 
			people  people i
	
	the room quiets down  tammy puts her lips close to the mike
	
					tammy
			who cares about this stupid election
	
	now theres something worth listening to
	
					tammy contd
			we all know it doesnt matter who gets 
			elected president of millard you think 
			its going to change anything around 
			here make one single person happier or 
			smarter or nicer the only person it 
			matters to is the one who gets elected  
			the same pathetic charade happens every 
			year and everyone makes the same 
			pathetic promises just so they can put 
			it on their transcripts to get into 
			college  so vote for me because i 
			dont even want to go to college and i 
			dont care and as president i wont do 
			anything  the only promise i make is 
			that if elected i will immediately 
			dismantle the student government so 
			that none of us will ever have to sit 
			through one of these stupid assemblies 
			again
	
	there is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause  
	tammy has set them free  even cynical old doug schenken and his 
	buddies join in
	
					students 
			tammy   tammy  tammy
	
	in total control she steps back from the mike and curtsies
	
	walt shoots an angry confused look at jim who shrugs tracy is 
	clearly upset but her smile remains eerily fixed paul just looks 
	confused and ashamed  jerry slavin is convulsed in laughter and 
	chants along with the multitude
	
	tammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation

			when i arrived at school that morning 
			i was shocked to find that one of my key 
			banners had been removed by vandals i 
			noticed that a few of my rivals posters 
			had also been tampered with of course 
			i was outraged but one day before the 
			election is not the time to lose your

	on a desk and pacing
	
					jim
			i guess you know why youre here
	
					tracy
			if its about the posters i think its 
			so awful its a travesty
	
					jim
			a travesty  huh  thats interesting 
			because i think you did it
	
					tracy
			wait  are you accusing me youre not 
			serious 
					indignant
			i cant mr mcallister we have 
			worked together on sga for three solid 
			years and i mean i cant believe it  
			im im shocked
	
	jim stares at her
	
					tracy contd 
			mr m i am running on my 
			qualifications  i would never need to 
			resort to you know to vandalism like 
			a you know plus my own best banner 
			was torn down  did i do that too
	
					jim
			were you or were you not working in the 
			watchdog office over the weekend
	
					tracy
			i was  so  mr pecharda let me in  
			as you know with all my 
			responsibilities i often come in on the 
			weekend and have permission to do so  
			but i left very early around 630
	
					jim
			630  how do you know what time the 
			posters were torn down
	
					tracy
			i dont  i just know they were there 
			when i left  im giving you helpful 
			information is all  you know instead 
			of wasting time interrogating me we 
			should be out there trying to find out 
			who did this
	
					jim
			okay tracy so who do you think did 
			it  whom should we interrogate
	
					tracy
			well i dont know  it could have been 
			anybody  there are a lot of you know 
			subversive elements around millard  you 
			know like rick thieson and kevin speck 
			and those burnouts  or doug schenken 
			what about him  or what about tammy
			metzier  her whole thing is being anti
			this and antithat
	
	jim shifts gears
	
					jim
			youre a very intelligent girl tracy  
			you have many admirable qualities  but 
			someday maybe youll learn that being 
			smart and always being on top and doing 
			whatever you need to do to get ahead 
			and yes stepping on people to get 
			there well theres a lot more to life 
			than that  and in the end youre only 
			cheating yourself
	
					tracy
			why are you lecturing me
	
					jim
			this isnt the time or the place to get 
			into it but there is for just one 
			example a certain former colleague of 
			mine who made a very big mistake a 
			life mistake  i think the lesson there 
			is that old and young we ail make 
			mistakes and we have to learn that our 
			actions all of them can carry serious 
			consequences  youre very young tracy 
			underage in fact  but maybe one
			day youll understand
	
					tracy
			i dont know what youre referring to 
			but i do know that if certain older and 
			wiser people hadnt acted like such 
			little babies and gotten all mushy 
			everything would be okay
	
					jim
			i agree  but i also think certain 
			young and naive people need to thank 
			their lucky stars and be very very 
			grateful the whole school didnt find 
			out about certain indiscretions which 
			could have ruined their reputations and 
			chances to win certain elections
	
					tracy
			and i think certain older persons like 
			you and your colleague shouldnt be 
			leaching after their students 
			especially when some of them cant even 
			get their own wives pregnant  and they 
			certainly shouldnt be running around 
			making slanderous accusations  
			especially when certain young naive 
			peoples mothers are paralegal 
			secretaries at the citys biggest law 
			firm and have won many successful 
			lawsuits and if you want to keep 
			questioning me like this i wont 
			continue without my attorney present
	
	jim draws a long breath as he tries to control himself
	
					jim
			okay tracy  have it your way
	
	theres a knock  jim and tracy turn to see
	
	tammy metzler timidly poking her head in

			by a vote just one vote
	
	jim who hasnt cared about any of this today suddenly takes note he 
	stares blankly at larry as the news sinks in

					mr flagg 
			right  and what year was that
	
					dale
			1958
	
					mr flagg
			almost  1957  so the point here is 
			when we found out about sputnik we got 
			really scared  it seemed like no matter 
			what we had and kept secret they could 
			develop it too  abombs hbombs 
			rocket ships  and this time we were 
			behind them  so  february 1961 
			kennedy tells congress and the american 
			people he wants to go to the moon  may 
			1961 the apollo program is announced
	
	tracy just cant take it anymore  she abruptly stands up takes the 
	giant hall pass off the lip of the blackboard and starts to leave  
	mr flagg gives her a small nod
	
	int  railway	day
	
	tracy nears a room a special room  she slows down and peeks in the 
	window of the door  she sees 
	
	larry fouch  sitting at the back of the classroom staring front  
	tracy presses her face to see what larry is staring at 
	
	jim at his desk counting ballots
	
	larry catches sight of tracy in the window
	
	tracy crosses her fingers by her ears and gives a questioning look
	
	larry sneaks a guilty look at jim absorbed in his counting  then 
	against his better judgment flashes tracy a quick furtive double 
	thumbsup
	
	tracy suddenly disappears from the window
	
	in the empty hallway  tracy pogos with unbridled joy
	
					tracy vo
			you know that moment when they announce 
			the winner of a beauty pageant  when 
			miss texas or whoever suddenly realizes 
			shes miss america and all she can do 
			is scream and weep and hug the losers  
			i had my moment in the hallway that 
			tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but 
			myself
	
	she pulls herself together enough to peek through the window of the 
	other door to jims classroom the window behind which jim
	is still busily doing his count
	
	int jims classroom  day
	
	jim counts out the last of the ballots mouthing the numbers to 
	himself
	
					jim vo
			i was at the end of my count when it 
			happened  id come up with exactly the 
			same numbers as larry  tracy had won 
			the election by a single vote 256 to 
			257  i was about to announce my tally 
			when  
	
	jim looks up and sees
	
	tracy in the window her face exploding with joy  she freezes
	
	we move closer to jim in slowmotion  what actually occurs in a 
	splitsecond is suspended in time
	
					jim vo contd
			the sight of tracy at that moment 
			affected me in a way i cant fully 
			explain  part of it was that she was 
			spying but mostly it was her face 
			looking at her you might think she was 
			a sweet innocent teenage girl but she 
			wasnt sweet  and she wasnt innocent 
			she was selfish and cynical and 
			ambitious and thought nothing of 
			destroying the lives of others to get to 
			the top who knew how high she would 
			climb in life how many people would 
			suffer because of her i had to stop her 
			now
	
	tracy unfreezes and darts out of sight jim glances at larry larry is 
	writing in a notebook
	
	jims hand
	
	creeps up from his lap and onto the pile of tracy votes  his fingers 
	nimbly count two ballots and pull them off the desk
	
	jim coughs as beneath his desk he crumples the ballots into a ball and 
	drops them into the wastepaper basket
