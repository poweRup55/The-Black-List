     warehouse toward a shut garage door brill clicks a
     remote the door rises

     outside the warehouse  the chevy roars outward
     screams around a corner then speeds down a road lined
     with warehouses

     dean looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a
     saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road

                        brill
            wheres your gun

     they pass an area with no warehouses the saturn turns
     heading straight at them

            back at the warehouse

     the saturn pulls on the road behind them the man in
     the saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle the
     side window by deans head shatters

     brill onehands the pistol and checks the load

     the chevy enters a narrow lane the saturn right behind
     with the chevys tires flat and flapping the saturn
     hugs their rear dean looks back again as the rifleman
     fires

     the rear window explodes dean pops up and fires three
     quick wellplaced rounds

     the saturn swerves and drops back brills impressed

     dean looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an
     iron crossbar brill unfazed pushes the chevy faster
     beam or no beam hes going through

                        brill

               realizing
            oh my god

     brill and dean hit the deck as the chevys hood scrapes
     just under the beam the windshield frame takes the
     full impact the beam slices through steel and glass
     decapitating the car they emerge on the other side

     he stops talking

     he hears rotor thumps as a black helicopter appears
     over a foglaced hillside swooping down

     brill floors it the helicopter drops in closer as
     brill swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70
     plus on flapping tires a helicopter sharpshooter aims
     with an m16

     a spray of highpowered slugs suddenly rip into the
     chevys hood the engine starts knocking

                        brill

     the road straightens up ahead a tunnel

     the chevy reaches the tunnels opening on sparking
     screeching wheel rims

     the helicopter pulls up missing the hill by inches

     but not the power lines the pilot sees them too late
     the helicopter flies into a web of cables the upper
     rotor slices neatly off the helicopters body rockets
     downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a
     rock on water until it meets an oncoming semitruck

     a rookie climbs from his car leaps the wall draws his
     gun and nears

     inside the taurus the windows are shattered steam
     hisses gasoline drips and coal is everywhere

     dean shimmies out through a broken side window he
     barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so

     his foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal
     which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him
