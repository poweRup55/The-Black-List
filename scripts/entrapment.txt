        fade in

        ext new york  december 1999  late night

        we are moving through a thicket of skyscrapers in the dim
        light we see one building then its reflection against
        another building we swoop past the empire state building lit
        in christmas red and green catch a glimpse of the christmas
        tree in rockefeller center

        on screen we see new york city december 15 1999 high atop a
        tall glass building we find another christmas tree

        we close on the thief whose face is concealed behind a sleek
        blackvisored helmet with nightvision goggles from a pack
        the thief takes a climbing rope clamps it with a carabiner
        around a post then dials a distance into the special ratchet
        mechanism

        the thief steps to the edge and leaps over plunging past the
        glass windows after a terrifying free fall suddenly the
        rope gears down smoothly bringing the thief to a stop at a
        window pane a dizzying sixty floors above the street
        through the glass we see a corporate headquarters

        the thief drills out bolts holding the window in place then
        one is stuck in a heartstopping move the thief turns upside
        down torques on the recalcitrant bolt uhnnn it comes free

        the thief replaces the existing bolts with custom bolts
        buffered with rollers pries at the window corners and pops
        the pane free then the thief rolls the pane onto the
        rollers leaving just enough room to slip into

        int petrotex corp  late night

        the board of directors suite of a large multinational
        corporation dominated by an obsidian table ringed with
        leather chairs an alarm box softly pulses

        the thief points a remote at the alarm the remote runs
        possible codes at speed on display panel until the right one
        stops the thief clicks the remote off

        the kind of art that gilds greed with taste lines the walls
        ignoring it the thief picks up a vase of lilies and carries
        it across the room to a side table by the window the thief
        carefully tilts the stems so that the lilies hang over the
        lip of the vase away from the window then exits the board
        room

        int reception area  late night

        a lichtenstein some plants a large map of the world with
        tiny red lights indicating branch offices around the world a
        christmas tree with some uniformly wrapped presents carefully
        arranged beneath it keeping an eye on a set of double glass
        entry doors the thief pauses behind a henry moore sculpture
        through the doors we see a desk where sits a security guard
        his back to us

        int hall int reception room  intercut

        the security guard reads and halfwatches the monitors on
        one we see the reception area and the vaguest shadow of the
        thief the guard looks at his book the thief begins to move
        the guard glances back at the monitor the thief jumps back
        then the guard returns to the book on the monitor the thief
        darts across the room and into a door

        int bathroom  same

        which is a bathroom hmmm but that is exactly where the
        thief wants to be out of the backpack the thief takes a
        small drill and begins to make a hole high on the wall

        int hallway  same

        above the security guard the drill pierces the wall leaving
        just a dusting of sheetrock on the floor

        int bathroom  same

        the thief feeds a tiny tube up to the edge of the just
        drilled hole turns a valve on a small canister

        int hall  night

        the security guard yawns tries to focus on his reading

        ext new york building  late night

        from a distant perspective we see the shadowy thief exit the
        bathroom as the security guard puts his head down on the
        desk the thief enters another room off the reception area
        the chairmans office

        int chairmans office  night

        pictures of the chairman with politicians and celebrities
        line one wall across from the desk a jasper johns map of
        the united states above the desk a small painting in an old
        gilt frame a rembrandt the pride of the collection a nude
        woman reading a letter

        the thief takes out a small periscope mirror and some right
        angled cutters carefully slides the mirror behind the
        painting manipulates the mirror with one hand the cutters
        with another finds the alarm snips it

        moving quickly now the thief rolls the canvas in acidfree
        paper takes a cylindrical tube from the backpack pulls out
        another canvas fits it carefully into the stolen paintings
        nowempty frame the thief stares at it through the opaque
        helmet visor approves slips the rolledup stolen canvas
        into the empty tube leaves

        before we follow the thief we linger to see the replacement
        canvaselvis on black velvet

        int hallway  late night

        with the thief now out the reception area and into the hall
        where the drugged guard sleeps to a mail chute built into
        the wall as the thief opens the chute we hold on the last
        line of a mailing label kuala lumpur malaysia

        the thief pops the labeled tube down the chute

        ext building window  night

        the thief disappears out the open window the window closes
        becoming

        ext building window  night

        another window in which we see reflected the lens of a
        telescope and in that lens the image of the office where
        the thief has just been a silhouetted figure is looking
        through the telescope

        through the scopes lens close detail of the office where
        the thief had been we see light fall into the room as the
        figure exits a door and softly closes it the image lightens
        and dissolves into

        int petrotex headquarters  video  day

        the board suite on video daytime with cops and
        investigators combing the crime scene the security guard

        theres something eerie about him he seems to be right
        inside gins head

        and smashes it against the side of his hand

        over the phone mac hears the crash snaps to alert

                            mac
                  gin gin

        haass inert body

        int haas warehouse  day  moments later

        carrying her bag and grasping the film case in her hand gin
        runs down the back stairs

        quinn charges at her blocking the way out the front where
        mac is she heads into a narrow concrete passage quinn is
        right behind her implacable scary a half smile on his face
        like he is enjoying this

        she runs up some concrete steps hits a padlocked gate
        covered over the top with a mesh screen she shakes it like a
        caged animal and here comes quinn honing in on her she
        scrambles up kicks upward at the wire cage above the gate
        knocks it off

        just as quinn reaches the gate she lurches over falls down
        on top of a parked car thump jumps onto the top of another
        car thud then runs toward the market

        ext borough market  day

        gin runs down one row of stalls and up another its a maze
        quinn is right behind her she scrambles over a huge mound of
        onions leaps down into another stall

        but quinn keeps coming she runs down an alley turns a
        corner dead end quinn is right behind her

        she scrambles up a fence but he kicks the supporting post
        out and the fence collapses

        she struggles to her feet runs over the fallen fence quinn
        throws it out of the way and keeps after her

        shes in a maze of pillars now dodging from one to another
        out of breath she pauses behind a pillar no quinn trains
        rattle overhead traffic speeds by on the other side of an
        impassable partition

        getting her breath she darts out again but quinn is right
        there he grabs her roughly steers her into an empty stall

        quinn pulls out a scary looking knife this cant be
        happening not in the middle of a public market but it is
        no one is paying any attention quinn readies the knife

                            quinn contd

        his fist smashes quinn in the kidneys

        quinn goes down

        gin jumps into the car quinn struggles to his feet still
        without getting out of the car mac jams his elbow into
        quinns stomach

        mac pulls away but he can barely drive faster than a walk
        its claustrophobic and scary all these people are in the
        way

        and here comes quinn through the crowd implacable fury on
        his face he leaps forward and stabs at the canvas roof with
        his knife rip the blade slices through the roof right by
        gins head gin screams mac swerves the jag

        pipe from some scaffolding crash he smashes the tail light

        damn car

        mac spots an opening in the crowd steps on the accelerator
        and pulls away from quinn

        int palace  great hall  day

        the music begins mac reaches out his hand to gin shes had
        to overcome a lot to get here her fear the incredible
        pressure of the job his impossible behavior but here she
        is cinderella at the ball

        she reaches out her hand to take his and as she takes it
        time stops for the first time they are truly touching truly
        connected they stare at each other and then they take the
        floor tentative at first like new lovers

        he takes her in his arms and then expecting nothing he
        leads her into one combination then another she follows him
        effortlessly her eyes never leaving his face as if to say
        is that all youve got

        he takes her into more complicated moves but shes right
        there in his arms not missing a beat anyone looking would
        believe they were completely in love

                            mac
                  where did you learn to do this

        she smiles teasing him

                            mac
                  of course dearolddad

        we are absorbed in their absorption with each other its as
        if the force between them clears a space around them

        and then we see thibadeaux watching them watching intently
        gauging just how close these two seem to have become and he
        doesnt like it

        the other dancers disappear into a swirl of color and
        movement we only see them now and its hot and beautiful

        they see only each other suddenly the clock strikes 10 the
        little figures swing out and begin pounding the chimes dong
        dong dong the reminder of time of their job makes her
        stumble

                            mac
                      continuing
                  about to turn into a pumpkin princess

        as the chimes continue they stare at each other the spell
        not quite broken neither expected this surge of feeling
        neither knows what to say mac offers her his arm

                            mac
                      continuing
                  it would be rude to leave without paying
                  a visit to the guest of honor

        meaningthe mask she nods and takes his arm

        int palace  moments later

        we are strolling down a long hall with other couples going to
        see the mask the gallery is just ahead around that corner
        theres a security guards clock and theresoh no
        greeting them is a pair of glass doors

        of clear glass is the mask the first time we have seen it
        for real it is right there so close but glass doors
        panicked gin hisses at mac under her breath

                  least we know going in what it is

        as he talks he kneels down to check his show quickly
        peeling off a tiny silver disc with tape backing and leaving
        it in the center of a square of marble

                            mac

        doors the mask gleaming in its case behind them

        bridge he switches on his head lamp up ahead in the dim
        light we see a window covered with rusted bars

        mac pulls out his slice pack turns on the valve and begins
        to burn the bars

        dong bam the ram hits the last time

        in the mask room one of the marble squares floats slightly
        above the floor

        a guard walks through the great hall he enters a card into a
        checkin box which beeps quietly then he continues his
        rounds through the debris of the party

        mac has his hands on the marble

                            mac
                      continuing

                            mac
                      continuing
                  gently very gently

        they lower the marble onto the rollers then roll it away
        the basement is bathed in the dim light of the mask room

        mac carefully extends the 20 centimeter rod they know they
        cant go above that

        mac positions the camera which comes oh so close to the top
        of the rod he opens a palm top computer with a mouse that
        lets him control the camera tests it surveys the room on
        his screen

        he positions the tripod with its laser magic arms carefully
        sets it she mounts the first light they are head to head
        extremely close in the narrow opening

                            gin
                  contact

        she turns on the laser on macs screen we see a red beam
        stream out directly into the pir sensor

        the guard has made his way closer to the mask room he
        inserts his card into the next checkpoint

        in the great hall the hands of the clock move to 1202

        mac positions the next tripod through the small opening

        on macs palm top monitor we now see a maze of red lights
        exactly like the yarn on his floor

        mac turns to gin it either works now or it doesnt they
        share a long look then she crawls up through the narrow
        opening into the room he looks at his watch

                            mac
                  less than four minutes now

        for a moment she lies on the floor still the mask looming
        over her on the other side of the room we hear her
        breathing

        as he talks her through mos she begins the delicate tai chi
        around the beams which only mac can see if she breaks one
        she sets off the alarm

        we are on her face then his the concentration is intense
        he is dancing through the beams using her body it is as
        intimate if not more so as their dance

        the guard checks in at another checkpoint the clock says
        1204

        finally she makes it to the mask pulls out a tiny palm top
        scans a series of numbers then enters them into the keypad

        very slowly the canopy above the mask begins to rise

                            gin
                      continuing
                  thank you god

                            mac
                  watch the pressure switch

        she has a knife in one hand ready to slide it carefully
        under the mask but her hand begins to shake pulls back
        tries again damn worse

        mac doesnt bully her now he talks softly and confidently
        mentor to protege professional to professional

                            mac
                  we all get the shakes deep breath now
                  in through the nose out through the
                  mouth

        she tries but her hand still shakes

        the guard enters the room before the corridor leading to the
        mask room

        the great hall clock says 1205

        mac glances at his watch

                            mac
                      continuing
                  okay think of a beach palm trees
                  swaying in the wind the gentle sound of
                  the surf think of nothing

                            mac

                  or a great big rat about to take a bite
                  out of your ass

        she opens her eyes grinning and determined she sticks her
        hand with the knife toward the base of the mask again it
        shakes but she steadies it slips it under the mask ahhh

                            mac
                      continuing
                  good girl no hurry but the guards
                  coming down the corridor

        the guard turns into the corridor leading to the glass doors

        gin carefully lifts the mask holding the knife under it

        the guard approaches the mask room we see the double doors
        but not the mask case he stops and takes a sip of champagne
        from a halfempty glass

        gin slowly slides the mask over to the edge of its pedestal
        and into her bag while holding the knife down

                            gin
                  preparing pressure switch neutralization
                  device

        we see skin and then more skin and two bodies becoming one

        splash water goes on macs face for a long moment he looks
        at himself in the mirror hes broken all his rules

        int gins apartment  kuala lumpur

        mac walks back into the apartment gin lies naked in the bed
        her back to him  he sits down on the bed stares at the
        curve of her body

        he reaches out and traces the line of her back

        we go to gin who we think is still asleep but her eyes are
        open and filled with emotion the night together has been as
        powerful and confusing for her as it was for him

        she rolls over and into macs arms for a moment they hold
        each other no irony no distance

                            mac

                  your secretsstraight up with someone
                  just once

        she doesnt know how to respond so tries to find some solid
        ground by trying to treat her deep feelings with a light
        touch

                            gin
                  what would that make us in love or 
                  something

        and then its his turn to retreat

                            mac
                  or something

        for a moment their eyes meet but the emotions have gotten
        ahead of the words theres an emotional nakedness that needs
        a fig leaf and when the words come they seem simple and
        honest and without guile

                            gin
                  we broke the rules didnt we

        a truck stops blocks his view for a moment then starts

        counterweight a thousand feet above him  straddling the
        narrow shaft he begins to unscrew the bolts holding the

        furtively pulls out the stop button  presses doors close
        the polished doors slide shutalmost shut

        thwang  a foot is thrust through the closing gap closely
        followed by the flushed face of the drunken guest who
        accosted her earlier

        delighted with his captive audience the drunken guest
        suddenly pauses midpleasantry as he realizes

                            drunken guest
                  were not moving

        before gin has time to protest he turns to the control panel

        mac is halfway through the opening  alerted by gins warning
        and by the whine of the machinery he desperately scrambles
        back to avoid having his head literally torn off by the
        upcoming elevator  as he pulls himself through the elevator
        catches his hand  rips the wrench away from him  it tumbles
        into the darkness below  in the narrow coffinwide
        counterweight shaft mac now fights to prevent himself sliding
        after his wrench  desperately he hooks his fingers into the
        mesh  his fingers tear at the openingsand hold

        int elevator  night

        barely able to breathe gin stares at the drunken guest as he
        lurches towards her

                            drunken guest
                  well id say that fixed it  so whos

        int shaft  night

        mac is in deep trouble  five hundred feet above him and now
        hurtling downwards are thirty tons of concrete counterweight
        six feet above him is the opening he must now reach  or hes
        roadkill  he struggles painfully to the opening look sup
        the counterweight is two hundred feet above him and falling
        like a guillotine  no wrench  no time to get himself
        through the narrow opening he grasps the ledge above  swings
        back and kicks  frantically at the mesh screen below  with
        the downdraft of the weight roaring in his ears mac kicks
        again and again until the screen buckles and falls  mac
        lands on the service elevator roof as the weight sweeps down
        behind him crushing the protruding screen with sickening
        ease

        int elevator  night

        seemingly answering the drunken guests question  gin
        touches her earlobe talks into her watchstrap mike

                  floor are you on

        unable to suppress a smile at hearing that familiar gruff
        voice gin looks at the drunken guest and says

                            gin
                  75th

        misunderstanding the smile and the apparent question the
        drunken guest leans into gin pinning her back against the
        side wall

                            drunken guest
                  absolutely  all the way  now maybe you

        total attention blathers luridly about making fireworks
        together gin looks up at the video camera

        int surveillance room  night

        in the black and white image on the monitor this looks like
        just another drunken boy meets girl kind of thing  the
        guards grin at each other  looks like interesting viewing

        in midflight about the sparks that are going to fly between
        them the drunken guests face suddenly undergoes a strange
        change  an alcoholanesthetized body suddenly
        perceivingpain  unseen by the video camera gin literally
        has him by the balls  never letting the camera smile leave
        her face she talks firmly and evenly to him

        the elevator has stopped  the shocked drunken guest nods
        mutely and stumbles painfully away the chinese security
        guard sees her still in the lift

        the darkness below  without hesitation mac reaches forward
        grabs the vibrating cable and using his gloved hands as a
        brake slides down the cable to meet the oncoming weight
        mac has to slow down if hes not going to meet the weight at
        freefall velocity  smoke seeps from his gloves as the
        friction bites  his face contorts with the effort but his
        feet hit the weight and suddenly hes being swept upward at

        the elevator roof starts to widen  and now hes clear  he
        launches himself into the growing void

        swing back pendulum out again head straight for the strut
        and mac grabs it wraps his leg around it pulls gin in

        safe but then the wire swings back spurting angry sparks
        from its torn end its live

        mac makes two quick turns of his climbing rope clips on a
        carabiner and climbs back down to gin

        the wire swings wide then heads back

        he grabs gin then kicks away from the highly conductive
        steel strut just asright where they werethe wire hits it
        in an angry shower of sparks

        mac and gin swing wide on the rope high above the ground
        her bag rips off her shoulder and arcs high into the air and
        then disappears on the way to the ground

        mac grabs desperately onto the handhold swings a leg around
        and she grabs on as well safe sort of

        mac and gin are dwarfed by the struts behind them is the
        black sky laced with fireworks and the stark geometric design
        of the building far below them the celebration on the street
        continues the people look like ants

        swat team members run across the lower level of the sky
        bridge just beneath them on the struts are gin and mac
        they enter a trap door climb up an interior ladder

        they emerge on the lower level the swat teams are above
        them now on the second level mac and gin climb out to the
        roof all the while just avoiding being seen by the swat
        teams running back and forth

        theyre on the roof sixty floors above the street mac
        points to the big air conditioning ducts

                            mac
                  we need to get there

        slowly they begin negotiating the web of steel girders
        heading for the opposite tower

        suddenly flash the helicopter searchlight catches them

                            loudspeaker
                  stop where you are

        gin stops in the lights like a deer

                            gin
                  shit

        mac grabs her arm

                            mac
                  if you cant have fun now you never
                  will

        he steers her on the run across the glass roof of the sky
        bridge hundreds of feet above the ground caught in the
        lights of the hovering helicopter

        cruz watches from the monitoring room

                            loudspeaker
                  police stop where you are

        still fixed in the searchlights gin and mac run over the
        steep frame closing in on the other tower

                            loudspeaker
                  stop at once you have been duly warned

                            gin

                            mac
                  i dont think so

        the other building is only a few feet away

        cruz has a big choice to make everyone stares at him

                            police officer
                  were losing them my team leader has a
                  clear shot im authorizing him to take
                  it

        the pressure on cruz is unbelievable he takes off his
        headset like pilate washing his hands of responsibility

                            cruz
                  your country your call

        gin and mac leap into the building just as blam blam
        bullets shatter the glass right by them

        gin is terrified macs whole demeanor changes this is
        for keeps now he slams a steel door to the sky bridge
        shutting the swat teams out

        they race through the corridors of the building

        doubling back out again to where the huge stainless steel
        airconditioning shafts vent into the air

        they run to the giant intakes its too high for her mac
        makes a cup of his hands boosts her up but the helicopters
        back the wind from its rotors almost blow them over gin
        reaches her hand out to help mac up blam hes hit in the
        side spun around

        with superhuman strength she jerks him up into the funnel
        out of the line of fire

        he lies on the floor of the funnel bleeding

                            gin
                  oh my god

        right behind them the shaft makes a right angle turn and
        plunges to the street above them a huge fan gently turns
        fracturing the searchlight from the helicopter in the bg
        we see the swat teams burst out onto the roof

                            mac
                  get to the edge

        mac struggles up they go to the edge of the black abyss the
        wind whistles up in their faces he hands her a pack

        gin emerges on the ground and blends into the crowd spilling
        out into the street she looks up at the two giant towers
        etches against the sky fireworks still blossoming all around
        them

        high on the building helicopters hover like malevolent
        insects by the air conditioning shaft

        across the platform watching mac sit there another train
        comes in people get off people get on very slowly he
        checks his watch we track into macs eye dissolve from the
        image of the train in it to

        int transchina express  dusk  macs vision

        another train a passenger train gin is sitting by the
        window staring out at the sunset shes dressed differently
        her hair is different thailand passes by outside but she
        really doesnt see it

        she leafs through the packet mac gave her tickets passports
        anda pressed red rose the one she gave him at blenheim
        she picks it up tries to smell its faint memory we take a
        long beat of wistfulness at what might have been

        int railroad station  day

        the clatter of a train pulling in brings mac out of his
        reverie people stream off his very bones feel weary now he
        loved her he set her free hes alone again

        the train departs leaving the tracks empty

        and there standing alone on the other platform is gin

        mac sees her very slowly he stands up his eyes never leave
        her face

        she came back for him they both begin to smile

        we hold on them there staring at each other

        begin end credits

        int railway station  moments later

        we are square on the space between the tracks in the bg
        the rails emerge out of a tunnel into the bright sunlight
        mac and gin come together into frame

        they kiss

        and then we are behind them as they walk toward the light
