               he nods now we see who he is talking to erin brockovich

               how to describe her a beauty queen would come to mind  
               which in fact she was tall in a mini skirt legs crossed 
               tight top beautiful  but clearly from a social class and 
               geographic orientation whose standards for displaying beauty 
               are not based on subtlety

                                     erin
                         for instance at one point i wanted

                         at fleuer engineers and constructors 
                         in irvine i fell madly in love with

                         century bc

               jaffe looks down at her resume trying to figure a polite 
               route

                                     dr jaffe

                              looks up at her
                         look

               beat by erins expression she knows whats coming

               ext dr jaffes office  so california suburb  main drag  
               day

               a side street no pedestrians just parked cars

               erin is finishing a cigarette her face has fallen  the 
               enthusiasm and spirit she showed in the interview are now 
               replaced by a desperate type of concern she takes a final 
               puff puts the cigarette out and walks to her car

               a parking ticket flaps under the wiper of an old hyundai

                                     erin
                         fuck

               even when she talks dirty theres a heartland goodness to 
               her voice like kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze

               as she grabs the ticket from the windshield her sunglasses 
               accidentally clatter to the ground

                                     erin
                         shit

               when she picks them up a fingernail snags on the pavement

                                     erin
                         god damn it

               she tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in

               wider on the street

               the hyundai starts it up signals then just as it pulls 
               slowly out into the street a jaguar barrels around the 
               corner accelerating out of the turn and slams into the 
               side of erins car sending it careening into the median  
               it smashes into a footthick lightpost and stops

                         well i think maybe some of the 
                         girls are a little uncomfortable 
                         because of what you wear

                                     erin

                         thats alright with you

               ed hides a smile he nods as he exits erin returns to work 
               and remarks without looking up

                                     erin
                         you may want to rethink those ties 
                         you wear

               this is a dry desolate part of california no downtown no 
               community just tract after tract of arid farmland with 
               small bland unprotected ranch home cropping up out of 
               landscape like occasional tombstones

               a beatup old sign on the road reads hinkley ca pop 
               but the corner where the number would be has broken off

               as a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields erin turns 
               onto community boulevard the main road that cuts through 
               hinkley

               in doing so she passes a nearby utility plant its criss 
               crossing pipes and large cooling towers stand out clearly

               bottles of spring water wait by the door

               the hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops erin gets 
               out as she heads up to the door her spike heels sink into

                         for hinkley but i look around here 
                         and i think if they want this place

                         and i dont just mean pay for the 
                         house id like them to pay me for

                         records they kinda surprised me 

               this would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self

                         of cancer

                         thank the lord but you never know 
                         and then while thats going on i 
                         end up having to have a hysterectomy 
                         plus a whole mess of lumps removed 
                         from my breasts all benign so far 
                         but still no matter how positive 
                         you stay an operation can still 
                         take it out of you
                              erin nods
                         so the whole idea of selling the 
                         house  if they arent gonna pay us 
                         properly i just dont see the point

                         yeah i can see that
                              beat
                         i guess the only thing that confused 
                         me is  not that your medical 
                         problems arent important but  
                         how come the files about them are in 
                         with all the real estate stuff

               donna tops off their iced teas

                         why you were corresponding with pge 
                         about it in the first place

                         whole family and not like with 
                         insurance where you pay then wait a 
                         year to be reimbursed either they 
                         just took care of it just like that 
                         we never even saw a bill

                                     donna

               maybe its the angle or maybe its what donnas been telling

                         kids

               erin suddenly grows uncomfortable at the implied intimacy

                                     george
                              laughs

                         fall cant be

               he kisses one of her earlobes erin likes the sound of this 
               but it also makes her apprehensive she leans in to kiss 
               him but before she does

                         makes me nervous

                         what you told her about the chromium 
                         we figured that might have something 
                         to do with this too

                         maybe or took birth control pills  
                         but then donna told me you thought 
                         this chromium might be to blame for 
                         her problems so i figured

               she sticks one in another hand before noticing that its 
               georges

                                     george

               george drops the pamphlet and takes beth from erin he heads 
               over to matt and katie sitting glumly on a log

               later still

               erin is heading over to george and the kids ready to leave 
               when donna comes up to her with a middleaged man in tow

                                     donna

                         station 

               erin stops in her tracks very interested but she can see 
               out of the corner of her eye that george and the kids are 
               getting impatient with her she excuses herself for a moment 
               and runs over to them

                                     erin
                         look take the kids home and ill

                         good

               george she runs back to donna and the middle aged man

               george is fuming the kids are clearly disappointed

                                     george

               pocket finds her  as hes leaning down to give it to her 
               he hears a rumble coming down the street beyond the barbecue 
               area the roar grows he stands looks

               a group of about ten bikers ride by like thunder he looks 
               at them then at the stroller george suddenly feels 
               ridiculous and then guilty for feeling that way about the 
               kids

               especially when matthew reaches for his hand squeezes it 
               and says as if worried george will leave too

                                     matthew
                         come on george

               the bikers rev loudly as they ride by then fade away

               george just stands there and watches them go

               later still

               erin and frank are on a bench talking out of the corner of 
               her eye she sees her car drive off georges hand sticks 
               out the drivers side and flips her the bird she watches 
               him disappear then hiding her rage turns back to frank

                                     erin

               cover the credenza piles of documents litter every surface

               erin is up at the map eating chinese food

                                     erin
                         they used the hex chrom here in 
                         these cooling tanks as an anti
                         corrosive then they dumped the excess 
                         water here in these six ponds

                                     ed
                         i dont remember seeing any ponds up 
                         there

               she bites into a forkful of food keeps talking

                                     erin
                         they covered em over and not too 
                         carefully either cause you dig one 
                         inch under the surface and the dirt 
                         is green as a fucking shamrock

                                     ed
                         and thats what caused the

                                     erin
                         it didnt help but no the real

               she reaches for a document reads from it

                                     erin
                         see according to this they were 
                         supposed to line the ponds so this 
                         shit couldnt seep into the ground  
                         but guess what 

                                     ed
                         they skipped that step

                                     erin
                         so for fourteen years this stuff 
                         flowed into the groundwater

                         frank cares what was in those ponds 
                         cause he used to spend half his day 
                         wading around them that was his 
                         job

                                     ed

                                     ed
                         we file a complaint we take our 
                         four hundred or so plaintiffs and 
                         everything you dug up and we file a 
                         cause of action and present it to a 
                         judge

                                     erin
                         then what

                                     ed
                         then pge will submit a demur  a 
                         list of reasons attacking each 
                         complaint claiming there is no cause 
                         of action for a lawsuit and then it 
                         goes before a judge

                                     erin
                         so then its all up to what this one 
                         judge decides

                         of our time

               sanchez throughout her speech has been reacting in a 
               patronizing manner  as if erins words were of no import 
               by the end of erins speech sanchez has picked up a glass 
               of water in front of her and is about to drink when erin 
               says

                                     erin
                         oh and by the way we had that water 
                         brought in especially for you

               sanchez pauses with the glass to her lips and sets it 
               back down on the table 

                                     sanchez

               erin gets up and storms out first we see on annas face

               hands then exits

                         kurt thinks that with nothing 
                         linking it to the corporate offices 
                         yet well probably end up on the 
                         lower end of that fiftyto400 million 
                         dollar offer its still a lot of 
                         money

                                     erin
                         its not enough not for over six 
                         hundred people what i dont 
                         understand is if we cant connect 
                         the corporate offices to it why 
                         would pge offer even that much

                                     ed
                         because they know the evidence we 
                         do have they know theyre gonna 
                         lose a jury trial maybe they wouldnt 
                         lose 400 million bucks but once you 
                         factor in 

                                     erin
                         wait a minute  are you saying you 
                         want to settle for the low end

                              admits
                         kurt suggested it he doesnt think 
                         were going to be able to get more 
                         than thirty percent of these people 
                         to agree to arbitration

                                     erin
                         and of course kurt knows these 
                         people so well

                         which means the low end is the 
                         best theyre going to get erin

               erin is deeply disturbed by this

                                     erin

                         this girls the same age as me

               erin gently takes the form away from matthew wanting to 
               shield him from the harsh realities of this case

                                     erin
                         thats right sweetheart

               she replaces the form on top of the stack

                         shes one of the sick people

                         medicine to make her feel better

               matthew mulls this over a bit more

               proud of her son in this moment as if his understanding is
