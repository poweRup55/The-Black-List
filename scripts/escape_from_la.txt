superimpose new las vegas off the coast of seattle thursday 0330 
hours gmt 

a salesman with a chinmike speaks nonstop unintelligible 
chinese a frenzied crowd gathers around him waving money 
placing bets 

two men sit at either end of a long table they are in deep 
shadows facing each other we only get glimpses of them one fat 
mirrored sunglasses chinese his fingers tap on the table a 
cockroach scurries past ammo belts a sheathed combat knife the 
size of your arm 45 automatics in holsters 

the other dressed in black an eyepatch dangerous a flash of 
two sixguns in holsters a futuristic gunfighter the cockroach 
dashes past his fingers whap he squashes it 

the crowd goes nuts placing bets yelling and screaming in a 
dozen languages 

the salesman places three different shaped clear shot glasses in 
front of the two men then he leans over to 

a vat of poisonous snakes he reaches in grabs a cobra pulls it 
out the cobra hisses and squirms deftly the salesman continues 
to talk nonstop into his chinmike as he milks the cobra venom 
into the first glass 

he pulls out an icepick jabs it into the snakes throat and 
bleeds a thick greenwhite liquid into the second glass finally 
he slits open the cobra with a large knife and cuts out the heart 
and liver tossing aside the dead snake the salesman squeezes the 
heart and liver with his fingers the juice drips into the third 
glass 

now the salesman stirs the glasses the poison is clear the blood 
is milkygreen the heart and liver are red he places the glasses 
on the table between the two men 

the two men stare at each other motionless the crowd continues 
placing bets at a fevered pitch a titanium white tube floats 
above the center of the table a laser beam of light shines from 
one end 

the salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger 
sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle the light 
circling the room before stopping on the fat mans forehead 

the fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses his hand shakes 
slightly he hesitates finally he takes the glass with the red 
liquid the heart and liver lifts it to his lips pauses then 
gulps it down 

the crowd explodes more bets 

the salesman leans over and spins the light tube again this time 
it lands on something black an eyepatch pull back to reveal a 
man with an eyepatch 

the man with the eyepatch reaches forward his hand paused 
between the remaining two glasses he takes the one filled with 
milkygreen blood and downs it fast the crowd roars 

one glass left the two men stare at it intently 

the salesman spins the light tube with more force than before it 
circles again and again slowing down speeding up finally 
stopping on the fat man 

the salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd shouting at 
the fat man the fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison 
his trembling fingers hover above it then he quickly withdraws 
his hand 

the crowd reacts boos as 

the man with the eyepatch smiles a slightly cynical smile and 
without hesitation he reaches out grabs the glass of poison and 
drinks it down the crowd surges forward but the salesman stops 
them with a sweep of his arm all bets are off 

the two men stand from the table take several steps away toward 
the end of the alley stand facing each other two gunfighters 

flashes of the two men a piece of a black military boot a hand 
positioned over a sixshooter mirrored sunglasses a sweaty 
trembling lip and the eyepatched mans one good eye blue and 
clear staring  hard and calm as a sunny day 

the draw it happens in an instant the alley thunders with 
gunfire the guns buck and flash then silence the two men stand 
there for a beat until one of them the fat man slumps falls 
face first into the alley dead 

the crowd goes completely ape shit as snake plissken emerges from 
the shadows of the alley holsters his guns grabs his take of the 
money 

snake plissken long hair a black eyepatch a tightlipped 
grimace the impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism 
the toughest most dangerous man on planet earth a legend 

plissken strolls out of the alley into the crowd he counts his 
money pockets it as a cigarette girl approaches him plissken 
stops her pays for a pack of cigs as she eyes him 

closeup of plisskens arm 

 the cigarette girl touches him pricks his skin with her 
fingernail a drop of blood appears 

plissken turns stares after her as the sound of helicopters 
rises from above in the night sky the crowd suddenly starts to 
disperse 

helicopter searchlights blast down on the street plissken is 
suddenly caught in the glare he starts to move away 

kaclang 

out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere 
the net slams down on top of plissken trapping him driving him 
down to the pavement with its weight plissken struggles inside 
the net as black figures  united states police force officers  
rush toward him grab the net tightening it more cops move for 
him as we slowly fade to black

the rain is coming down in a torrent as plissken makes his way 
down the hillside then all at once the rain lets up then 
stops the trees drip with moisture suddenly a huge kathump from 
above him plissken looks back a huge mudslide is roaring its way 
down the hill toward him 

plissken races down the hill but the mudslide cascades downward 
like a freight train catches up with him sweeps him off his 
feet and plissken goes riding down the hill rumbling and 
sliding in the mud 

ext stand of trees  night 

the mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees spreads out 
slows a completely mudcovered black plissken climbs out of the 
goo hes dripping with it his one good eye shines in the 
moonlight he takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline 
when 

a voice spinal vo

plissken spins hes standing right next to spinal the leader of 
the black cowboy gang dressed in black boots with spurs black 
duster black cowboy hat he carries an automatic rifle he looks 
just like charles barkley

of black cowboys crouched behind the trees waiting in ambush 
covered with mud plissken blends right in 

spinal

plissken jumps behind a tree looks down the hillside

a black cowboy raises his m79 grenade launcher as the others 
quickly race down the hillside he fires 

the hollywood bowl 

a 40mm armorpiercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it 
rockets toward the burning cross and  kablammo a fireball blows 
pieces of the cross into the air the kkk spin around 

a blast of lightning illuminates the black cowboys attacking from 
the hills they open fire a kkk grand dragon is picked off his 
feet buffeted in midair flesh and robe shredded by gunfire a 
hail of bullets hits the kkk they return fire but are 
overwhelmed they are hit jerking and twisting fire from the 
black cowboys is withering racking the hooded figures like bolts 
of lightning the black cowboys keep advancing firing as it 
starts to rain again 

through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water the firefight 
continues four kkk leap out from behind a row of seats and 
jump plissken knocking his gun to the ground in a blinding 
flash using hands feet and head plissken sends them flying as 
he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun he sees that the 
rain is washing the mud off his body 

and so does spinal who stands nearby watching as plissken is 
washed clean by the rain spinal raises his weapon then stops 

spinal

plissken slowly stands his submachine gun in his hand behind 
them the firefight is almost over the kkk scatter into the 
rain 

spinal

like an itchin in my heart crowds dance in the street its 
like a block party black latino and native american gangs

the marquee of the ruined chinese theater the marquee now reads 
safe sex no condoms needed polypropylene orifices 
satisfaction guaranteed 

one of the hookers struts in front of plissken 

closeup  the hooker 

opening her mouth she gives a sensuous puff a polypropylene 
orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a 
small pink balloon she sucks it back in and puckers kissing the 
air plissken turns as the sounds of car engines rises 

his pov  coming down hollywood boulevard 

 is a caravan of vehicles the crowd parts to let them through 
cheering insanely plissken ducks into an alley watches 

the caravan passes plisskens position two men on horseback lead 
a convoy of rumbling fuming old cars buses motorcycles  all 
scarred and ripped and jerryrigged  bumps down the boulevard 

plissken watches from his spot in the alley as a blondehaired 
hooker joins him rubs his arm she has no polypropylene at least 
none that we can see

 is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels 
severed doll heads are glued all over the hood and a large 
glittering disco ball spins atop the roof catching shards of 
light and flicking them back into the night 

behind the disco ball stands the real cuervo jones at least and 
there next to him is utopia shes dressed in black lace underwear 
and bra garters and stockings a playboy fantasy she holds the 
prototype delgado cuervo jones secondincommand stands behind 
her he is huge and evil dressed like pancho villa 

plissken stares as the cadillac passes the hooker cheers along 
with the rest of the crowd and doesnt notice that plisskens 
moved off 

several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan mescalitos 
ride with their women slung behind them as the last bike passes 
plissken darts out of the alley yanks the woman off the back of 
the cycle jumps on

iron bars and swords in their hands plissken stares up ahead 

his pov  the cadillac 

 is just a few feet away cuervo jones and utopia 

plissken guns it when suddenly two mescalitos pull up on either 
side of him one of them swings a chain plissken grabs it with 
one hand and with his other hand aims his submachine gun and 
fires the mescalito and bike go flying and plissken holds on to 
the chain 

atop the cadillac cuervo jones reacts to the sound of gunfire he 
turns to see 

plissken

as the other mescalito riding behind him swings a chain plissken 
swings his the two chains snap together intertwining then 
plissken squeezes his handbrake he screeches to a stop the 
mescalito keeps going and is yanked over backward by his own 
chain off the harley finally the harley flops over skids 
explodes plissken guns it again takes off after the cadillac 

two more mescalitos pull up on either side of plissken they take 
aim at him with their automatic rifles plissken pulls a sudden 
wheelie lifts the front of his bike up into the air rides on the 
back wheel the two mescalitos fire  directly into each other 
they fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement 

plissken surges the bike forward coming up on a mescalito on 
horseback who turns and fires plissken ducks and the bullet rips 
through the rear tire the tire blows and the bike swerves out of 
control plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the 
saddle 

the horse 

plissken pulls himself up behind the mescalito and wrestles for 
control of the mount plissken grabs the reins and wraps them 
around the mescalitos neck squeezing until his eyes burst 
plissken slams his arm against the mescalito throwing him off the 
saddle bouncing onto the pavement 

plissken gallops ahead circling a lasso high above his head 
pounding down on a biker the lasso takes flight and finds it 
mark the bikers neck plissken pulls the lasso taut ties the 
end to the saddle horn rides his mount parallel to the biker 

the bike 

with one quick yank to the lasso plissken pulls the biker off 
jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horses rump

takes off down the street dragging the biker by the neck 

the cadillac 

speeds up as plissken moves up to the mustang five cars behind he 
swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk plissken climbs up 
to the roof leaps on the hood then jumps to the trunk of the car 
in front  leapfrogging jumping to the next car the next car 

mescalitos 

lean out their car windows firing at him but plissken keeps 
moving toward the cadillac 

suddenly a hand 

reaches out a car window and grabs plisskens submachine gun

when cuervo jones 

leaps from the cadillac and takes plissken down to the roof 

cuervo jones

down sunset the hand in the car window still holds plisskens 
submachine gun 

cuervo crouches on the roof hissing at plissken 

cuervo jones

plissken 

lies there for several beats then climbs to his feet 

his pov  the caravan 

 disappears up sunset 

plissken 

stands alone in the deserted street the ruins of a supermarket 
cheap motels liquor stores  all empty desolate 

he looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie 
after a beat he starts moving up sunset checking his two 9mm 
handguns slipping them into their holsters 

ext sunset and doheny  night 

on the border of beverly hills sunset stretches off into the 
darkness beyond the intersection a slight wind blows litter 
aimlessly along there are occasional sounds creaks distant 
clangs

homing device it is silent the small screens blank then 
plissken glances at his wrist watch

sunset boulevard 


ext sunset boulevard  beverly hills  night 

plissken walks past the oncebeautiful mansions along sunset now 
they are dark ruined 

closer  beverly hills mansion 

as a twisted mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the 
wrist pulls aside a window curtain the face behind the window is 
in shadows but we can just make out its pale discolored 
features the other hand brings up a walkietalkie 

sentry

emerges from the shadows this is the gatekeeper strange 
mismatched body parts a blackskinned arm attached to a pale 
white body his face is unnaturally smooth  too many face lifts 
he carries a torch 

gatekeeper

figures have suddenly moved out into the street all with 
mismatched body parts  heads too large for their torsos female 
body parts mixed with male heads all sewn together with large 
uneven stitches plissken is surrounded 

gatekeeper
welcome to beverly hills 

plissken raises his gun starts to move when suddenly a figure 
rises behind him out of the shadows 

a multicolored flesh hand 

raises a lead pipe brings it down hard 

on plisskens head 

thunk he goes out like a light 

as plissken slumps unconscious to the street the figures move for 
him their arms lock around him drag him away with amazing speed 
 a pack of wolves on a deer 

closeup  plissken  night 

plissken bolts awake to find himself tied to a cross its 
lurching back and forth as though the ground is moving 

ext rodeo drive  beverly hills  night 

plissken is being carried down rodeo driveon the cross by a throng 
of surgical failures they carry torches dressed in tatters 
their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly 

rodeo drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts the once 
beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles 
human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice 

gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and 
armani displays more eclectic high priced pieces sewn together 
like sculptures in their windowfronts a giant rift runs down the 
streets center acrid smoke rises 

the throng stops at an intersection and plisskens cross is 
anchored in the middle of the street surrounding the intersection 
are patients of every size age sex 

plissken looks over sees another cross being carried up and 
planted right next to his a beautiful girl is tied to this cross 
this is taslima 20s iranian the face of a persian princess 
shes dressed in black leather and basically has an iq of around 
50 

taslima
hi snake its so great to meet you my 
names taslima im a fan of yours 

plissken
are you crazy 

taslima

dead so are you snake 

plissken looks across the street our of the ruins of the once 
famous red door of elizabeth arden come an arm of women facialists 
with acidburned faces from onetoomany skin peelings wielding 
knives saws horriblelooking carving instruments 

taslima
i cant believe i got caught
sighs

only they kicked me out cause i screw up 
sometimes i forget stuff 

plissken struggles with his bonds 

taslima
i left my boyfriends place tonight took 
a wrong turn
sighs again
oh snake im really kind of out of it 
sometimes 

out of the red door come more interns and nurses carrying surgical 
pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts 

the throng of facialists patients interns and nurses surround 
plissken and taslima on the crosses they move back to the 
sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from plissken 
and taslima is about to begin the gurneys are wheeled into place 
and set up as large cutting tables the facialists take their 
positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat 

plissken
what are they 

taslima
they live here used to be like us but 
after too many silicon implants their 
muscles turned to jelly the only way they 
survive is to have body parts transplanted 
over and over again
whispers
snake nobody who comes into beverly hills 
gets out alive 

plissken
no screamin shit 

taslima
oh no its the doctor 

plissken
who 

taslima
the surgeon general of beverly hills 

the doctor the surgeon general of beverly hills 

steps out into the street he appears incredibly gorgeous a hunk 
of a man put together by the finest body parts available in 
beverly hills  a millennium fabio  but upon closer examination 
hes got no lower jaw instead there is a rusting metal gridwork 
attached beneath each ear it never moves he can actually speak 
through a metal box attached to his windpipe 

the doctor 

stands in front of them he raises his hands to quiet the crowd 
he walks around the cross admiring the beautiful bodies before 
him he tickles the fine flesh with his right hand which is made 
up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge 

the doctor
ive never seen more beautiful specimens 
there will be no auction tonight these 
body parts will go to those who need them 
the most 

the crowd gumbles 

plissken

turns his head sideways to a small hidden pocket near his neck 
with his teeth he pulls out the silver mouth dart slips it onto 
his tongue closes his mouth 

the doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward 
plissken 

the doctor
what a beautiful blue eye its a shame 
you only have one 

a nurse brings over a small stepladder the doctor positions it 
in front of plissken slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face 
to face with him the doctor looks ready to pluck plisskens good 
eye from its socket with his scalpel tips 

fffttt plissken spits the mouth dart 

whack the dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead he 
freezes his scalpel hand raised his eyes clouding he falls 
forward 

the scalpel hand swings misses its mark and instead hits the 
rope tied around plisskens wrist whatck the ropes cut 

plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand cuts his other 
hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off 
the stepladder 

whump plissken falls to the intersection almost at the same time 
as the doctor hits the pavement 

the patients are stunned motionless they stare at their doctor 
lying in the street moaning moving slightly 

snake starts to run 

taslima
snake help me 

snake

taslima

almost on a whim plissken cuts her free then he runs taslima 
follows him 

plissken heads toward a side street looks over his shoulder sees 
taslima following 

plissken

taslima

plissken

then plissken comes to a dead stop 

his pov  down the street

comes a mass of patients right at him taslima grabs plissken 
pulls him with her they take off down a dark cobblestone 
street 

ext dark alley  night 

plissken and taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives 
chase they stop at another small alley between two large 
buildings 

taslima
down this way 

they disappear into the small alley 

ext small alley  cul de sac  night 

its long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on 
either side suddenly plissken and taslima come to the end  a 75 
foot high fourstory building blocking the passageway to wilshire 

plissken
this is a dead end
looks at her
you took us into a dead end 

taslima
i just thought you wanted to get away i 
didnt know you wanted to go someplace 

kaclank they turn 

the doctor staggers down the alley the dart still sticking from 
his forehead behind him the patients follow 

plissken shoves taslima toward a broken window 

plissken
go 

he follows taslima through the window 

int second floor balcony  night 

plissken and taslima climb dilapidated stairs move along the 
balcony railing a torn and tattered roy lichtenstein painting 
hangs crooked on a wall twenty foot high bright red letters  
caa  lie strewn across the marble floor various offices are 
wrecked and dark scripts lay all over the place 

they stop at a dark hallway taslima moves cautiously ahead 

taslima
be careful of the bald cats they live in 
these buildings 

plissken
the what 

plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder but his hands 
are trapped by the doctors body closer and closer moves the claw 
dagger toward plisskens good eye 

taslima scrambles picks up plisskens 9mm then stares at the two 
men 

plissken
yelling
are you gonna stand there give me the 
gun 

taslima starts to hand it to him both plissken and the doctor 
fight to reach it finally its in plisskens grasp he blasts 
three times  each one hitting the doctor shudders rolls away 

plissken gets to his feet he blasts one more time for good 
measure then follows taslima down the hallway 

int first floor  rear exit  night 

they come down a flight of stairs stop at the rear door 

plissken
how do we get out of here 

taslima
sewers come on 

she pushes open the door 

ext beverly hills street  night 

plissken and taslima run from the building as a chorus of wails 
rises patients swarm around the building in pursuit 

taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street 

taslima
down there 

plissken lifts the grating taslima jumps in followed by 
plissken 

int sewer tunnel  night 

dim greenish light plissken and taslima begin running down the 
sewer tunnel through the hole behind them drop patients giving 
chase plissken and taslima race through a halffilled storm drain 
seeping with slime they turn a corner into another tunnel and 
run smack into a horde of patients instantly the patients 
overpower them hands reach out and drag them down 

suddenly from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound a weird 
whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld it 
gets louder and louder the patients freeze then begin screaming 
and as the sound gets louder still they all disappear escaping 
back down the tunnel 

from down the tunnel 

an eerie light appears coming nearer and nearer every moment 

taslima
snake  what is it 

plissken
how the hell am i supposed to know this 
is your damn city 

slowly the light takes form it is a single gigantic eye  
floating in pitchblack darkness it continues coming  growing 
larger and larger suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a 
blasting ringing sound music 

its incredibly loud salsa music 

from out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart 

on a metal pole in front is a huge lighted eye such as an 
optometrist might use to advertise his services salsa music 
blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of 
the cart at the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in 
jeans cowboy boots and a flak vest wearing a gas mask a lariat 
is hooked to his belt 

he pulls up near plissken and taslima shuts off the motor and the 
music lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him climbs down he 
holds the gun on them 

removing his head gear his face becomes visible he is pendejo 
bob a mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask he takes off 
the sunglasses and his apparently blind in one eye he looks like 
los lobos lead guitarist 

pendejo bob

plissken

pendejo bob

plissken

suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny builtin spotlight 
with it he examines plisskens face 

pendejo bob

there is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished 
pendejo bob extends his hand

plissken doesnt shake from down the tunnel the shouts and 
footfalls of the patients gets closer 

pendejo bob

plissken and taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart pendejo 
bob spins the cart takes off in the other direction 

int underground passage  night

light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle 

pendejo bob

passage

through the air twisting his body sideways and lands a hard kick 
right in delgados face delgado goes sprawling one of the 
machetes clanks to the floor

past him he crouches on the balls of his feet and as the rear of 
the caddy drifts closer he springs 

and grabs on to the rear bumper the monster wheels spin like 
huge black scythes on either side of him plissken reaches under

back seat next to utopia then grabs her and turns to the side 
door cuervo jones releases the wheel for a moment turns to grab

in the street pries it up 

mescalitos pour out of their vehicles as cuervo jones charges 
into the street pointing at plissken 

cuervo jones

plissken lifts utopia to her feel hauls her over to the manhole 
opening and dives inside just as the mescalitos open fire the 
street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot 
lead

to his feet pulls her with him and heads off sloshing through 
the water the sound of gunfire echoes above them

journey with pendejo bob 

plissken spins utopia around pushes her backward toward the drop
off his eye burning into her 

her feet reach the very edge 

plissken holds her there utopias face is a mask of sheer terror 
she gulps air in staccato bursts

he releases her backs up looks at the prototype then pulls one 
of his revolvers from its holster cocks the hammer aims

he spins drops the prototype 

 as map to the stars eddie emerges from the darkness of the 
sewer tunnel he holds a gun in one hand aims 

kablam 

he fires again hits plisskens leg 

plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off as map 
to the stars eddie moves quickly forward 

 and snatches the prototype from the wet floor 

plisskens gun hand is useless numb from the shoulder wound he 
slowly painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand tries to 
raise it 

map to the stars eddie

map to the stars eddie takes aim  a head shot  

plissken spins and dives off the edge 

 down into the drop off 

plisskens body 

airborne falling through black space down down down straight 
to hell below until we cant see him anymore as the darkness 
swallows him up 

map to the stars eddie steps to the ledge looks down as cuervo

cuervo jones

 and drops the prototype with a clank

prototype voice
tiny filtered
i am now armed and ready for use use 
extreme caution the location of the 
effected blast area can only be determined 
by the orbital position of the satstar 
ring 

everyone in the tunnel is frozen unable to move slowly cuervo 
jones picks up the prototype stares at it then breaks into a 
smile 

cuervo jones

stares coldly at map to the 
stars eddie

several mescalitos grab map to the stars eddie pull him back 
along the tunnel

cuervo jones turns to utopia who stands numbly staring off at the 
dropoff he walks over to her then slaps her hard viciously 
across the face 

utopia reacts to the stinging slap 

utopia

sound of hundreds of helicopters rise 

cuervo jones

above manchester and the forum is filled with helicopters all

the sky chopper roar overhead a group of vagrants cluster around 
a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers theyre 
watching a futuristic bigspin lotto on a large screen tv the 
sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building

so wheres plissken

darkness 

creaking the whoosh of something swinging through the air 

a huge blue eye opens looks around 

darkness 

plisskens boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh 

darkness 

and then plissken swings like a pendulum hanging from a long 
strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness 

plisskens eye blinks 

the darkness 

begins to reveal details slimy walls below a black pit of hell 
wind gushing 

and then a light stabs across the void 

close  plissken 

 the light hits plisskens good eye 

the light is from inside the eye of pendejo bob he stands on a 
small ledge at the mouth of a cave leading into the howling pit 

pendejo bob
hey snake you okay
unhooks the lariat
i heard gunfire down here
begins to swing the rope
never been down this far before
swings the rope in a huge 
arc
grab this 

pendejo bob tosses the lariat the noose flies across the pit and 
plissken grabs it with his good hand 

pendejo bob
now hang on 

plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose as pendejo bob 
jerks the line hard plissken is in midswing and the rope 
jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction 

plisskens boot slips out of the wire mesh 

and plissken falls like a brick stops abruptly as the line 
catches and swings against the side of the pit he dangles with 
only his one good arm holding on to the rope 

pendejo bob pulls the line upward straining against plisskens 
weight slowly plissken rises a tug at a time hauled up the edge 
of the pit toward the cave above 

 when suddenly he passes another opening a storm drain below 
pendejo bob he swings into the drain grasps the side with his 
hand and pulls himself in 

pendejo bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of 
the pit 

pendejo bob
hey snakewhere are you 

plissken crawls into the slimy drain pulls the rope off of him 
ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water he turns on weak 
legs back toward the pit behind him bleeding numb in one hand 
his leg on fire 

plissken
yells
im in another opening storm drain 
there may be another way up to you 

plissken crawls along the drain the sound of rushing water gets 
louder 

he comes to the edge of the drain right below him is another 
drain filled with water rushing through it like a river 

plissken is stuck he turns in great pain and starts back toward 
the pit when suddenly everything starts shaking booming its 
a small earthquake a preshock 

snap 

suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way cracks 
disintegrates 

and plissken falls backward into the rushing water and is pulled 
suddenly downstream into the drain disappearing from sight 

pendejo bob 

stands silently above listening 

pendejo bob
snake
no reply
snake 

booming the whole pit shudders shaking another earthquake 
pendejo bob drops the rope turns and dashes away down the 
vibrating storm drain 

ext storm drain  wilshire canyon  night 

black oilslicked water rushes in the moonlight out of a huge 
opening in what appears to be a canyon wall 

close on the edge of the drain 

as an arm shoots out clutching the edges of the drain 

plissken 

emerges from the hole slides out tumbles down to a waterfilled 
canyon bottom he lies there for a moment trying to focus his 
eye stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg finally he rises 
unsteadily to his feet looks around trying to get his bearings 
he finds himself at the bottom of 

the wilshire canyon 

straight down wilshire boulevard is an enormous canyon a river 
bottom gouged out of concrete in the big earthquake at least 30 
feet deep it is a vast trough leading past skyscrapers and 
buildings above off into the distance 

plissken warily glances at his watch 1 hour 10 minutes to go 

suddenly plissken is struck by a pair of headlights pipelines 
dune buggy comes bumping along the canyon bottom sloshing through 
water pulling up next to plissken 

pipeline
snake saw you at the game tonight great 
shot
stares at him
you look like shit 

plissken hobbles over to the dune buggy as pipeline gets out 

pipeline
you feel those preshocks snake 

pipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear 
of the buggy he lifts one down and slings it under his arm 

pipeline
could be a big one comin any minute 
now 

plissken

pipeline

plissken

pipeline

whole towns gonna be there things

a thumping sound skyward more choppers thunder over them on 
their way southeast plissken grabs pipeline with his good hand 

plissken

but hes too weak his hand slides off plissken sinks to his 
knees pipeline stares at him 

pipeline

to his feet

cuervo they used to be partners but they 
split up 

plissken

pipeline
hershe she lives downtown with mojo 
dellasandro in the big boat down that 
way 

pipeline points down the canyon to the east 

pipeline
shes connected with the black cowboys 
and they dont take shit from nobody 

suddenly that booming shuddering rumble begins the canyon starts 
to shake the water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly 

pipeline
yo man its a big one 

and the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer the walls of 
the canyon crack plissken and pipeline are thrown to the ground 

skyscrapers above them on wilshire rock and tremble in the quake 
pieces of the building sheer off fall a parking garage caves in 

thunder shakes the earth around plissken and pipeline the canyon 
floor splits open water pours into the cracks huge bouldersized 
chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls 

and then suddenly it all stops 

the booming subsides the earth stops shaking plissken and 
pipeline get to their feet look around the water around them 
continues to slosh about violently 

pipeline
tsunami snake 

his eyes wide a smile on his face pipeline hurries over to the 
dune buggy grabs another surfboard from the back hands it to 
plissken 

pipeline
surfs up big time 

now there is another deep sound rising coming from the west 
behind them a bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom 
of the register upward as if some massive wall of doom were on 
its way 

pipeline kneels positions his surfboard in his hands 

pipeline
get ready snake its gonna be some kinda 
ride 

plissken looks behind him 

pov  the front edge of the tsunami 

is blasting down the wilshire canyon coming right for them it is 
a 25foot wall of ocean water moving fast bellowing like a 
thunderclap 

plissken sees he cant climb out of the canyon in time moves over 
to pipeline kneels down 

pipeline
let the front edge pick you up dont get 
on your board till it peaks 

behind them the tsunami slams along the canyon coming right for 
them 

pipeline
dont lose it man you slip off your 
board and its the big wipeout you know 
what i mean 

the roaring is so loud its like being on the inside of a cannon 
barrel the tsunami is 100 feet away 75 feet 50 feet 25 
feet it rolls up right behind them 

pipeline
hang on snake
yells
yaaaaaaa 

the front edge 

of the tsunami sweeps under them pipeline and plissken push off 
from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a 
cow catcher on a train the water sweeps them up until they 
disappear under the blackness 

until suddenly pipeline pops up on top of the tsunami riding on 
his surfboard arms outstretched feet braced 

and then plissken pops up beside him surfing clumsily on top of 
the tsunami wave kneeling on his surfboard 

they blast down wilshire canyon at 80 miles an hour plissken is 
wobbly on the surfboard but he manages to stay on top of the 
wave finally he gets the hang of it glances over at pipeline 
who grins from ear to ear 

pipeline
awesome snake awesome man 

plissken looks up ahead 

his pov  moving through wilshire canyon 

five feet from street level an old van speeds along whats left 
of wilshire boulevard right on the canyons edge it veers around 
debris in the street changes lanes suddenly hell bent for 
leather 

plissken and pipeline move closer and closer to the van as the 
tsunami sweeps them along 

now they move alongside the van and plissken stares over 

closer  the van 

behind the wheel is map to the stars eddie driving like a 
lunatic his teeth bared and set madder than shit 

plisskens eye widens burns 

plissken
to pipeline
see you later 

and suddenly plissken shifts his weight and the surfboard tips 
and slides sideways across the surface of the tsunami all the way 
over to the edge right next to the van map to the stars eddie 
glances to his left 

his pov  plissken 

is surfing the tsunami not 10 feet away from him 

map to the stars eddie stares in absolute horror plissken tips 
the board again and slides another 5 feet closer 

as map to the stars eddie 

jams the pedal and the van screams forward 

as plissken 

stands up and leaps from the surfboard 

for a moment he is airborne leaping across the gap to the van 
and slams into the side of the van he grabs on to the roof hangs 
on with one hand his body whipping against the rocking bucking 
side map to the stars eddie starts swerving trying to throw 
plissken off 

ext van  wilshire boulevard 

the van shoots back and forth across wilshire plissken dangling 
inches from the tsunamifilled canyon plissken pulls himself up 
and crawls onto the roof 

inside the van 

map to the stars eddie pulls his gun cocks it 

when suddenly plisskens hand snakes down from the roof reaches 
in the drivers window grabs his hair and slams his forehead 
into the steering wheel with a thock 

map to the stars eddie goes out like a light he slumps over in 
the seat but his foot is stuck on the accelerator 

plissken grabs the wheel with his left hand and manages to steer 
the van from the roof the van lurches wildly hits a chunk of 
concrete in the street skids fishtailing violently from the 
impact it smashes against the curb screeches and bumps along 
concrete 

map to the stars eddies foot is bumped right off the accelerator 
and the van slows to a wobbling grinding stop 

plissken slowly climbs down from the roof opens the drivers 
door shoves map to the stars eddie out of the way and jumps in 

int van  night 

plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down wilshire 
map to the stars eddie starts to come around 

plissken grabs his gun cocks it puts the barrel up against map 
to the stars eddies temple just as he comes to

cowboy gang stand on the top deck of the queen mary mojo 
dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig the wind 
whips around them the hillsides in the distance are on fire 

they look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the 
deck the wind picks up map to the stars eddies rig he bumps up 
and down side to side buffeted wildly until mojo dellasandro 
brings him back down to the decking

with that plissken launches himself off the deck sailing out over 
open space then down toward the street 

plissken 

gliding through the air as the wind picks him upward he arcs 
away from the street level up toward the remains of the downtown 
skyscrapers behind him one after another the group takes off 
into the wind diving rising with the wind 

map to the stars eddie makes a rapid suicidal dive right down 
toward the pavement below he screams like a madman until the wind 
lifts him at the last possible second 

ext tops of skyscrapers  night 

the group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings a bracero 
family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a 
sheer precipice as the side of the skyscraper they live in has 
been torn off they wave to plissken as he passes 

two floors down someone has hooked up huge speakers and a 
croaking male voice is singing a barbra streisand hit to a 
background track 

a beautiful girl in a sheer diaphanous gown dances far out on a 
narrow girder waving a scarf at the moon 

plissken and the others now fly in formation like avenging bats 
through the night except for map to the stars eddie who keeps 
rising and plunging violently barely in control 

ext disneyland  night 

an army of vehicles and people pour into disneyland  but its a 
disneyland gone to hell a huge sign reads the happy kingdom

the gates no longer exist the overhead tram lies broken on the 
ground slowly vehicles drive straight inside 

a battered old limousine carries cuervo jones and a grimlooking 
utopia past the ruins of the train and around the ghosttown 
square of main street ahead is the fairy castle broken and 
crumbling like some relic from a nightmare around it are the 
thrill rides tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force of the 
original earthquake 

crowds are waiting gangs of every conceivable description ethic 
gangs female gangs gangs of children also families with 
hangerson as soon as the limousine appears the crowds begin 
cheering 

int limousine  night 

cuervo jones stares out at the masses 

cuervo jones
theyre simple people they love a party
turns to utopia
were gonna throw them one hell of a party 
when we get to america right 

utopia is silent sullen cuervo raises his hand to her and she 
jumps cowering 

cuervo jones
put a smile on your face 

a terrified smile spreads across utopias face 

ext main street  night 

as the limousine inches down main street suddenly a wall of 
headlights pop on 100 or so battered old vintage chevys rev their 
engines begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic lifts 
gangs begin cheering firing their weapons into the air like new 
years eve 

at the end of main street is a huge open area  almost an arena 
beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters 

as the limousine stops and cuervo jones emerges utopia on his 
arm the cheering begins a wall of sound through the park three 
black muslims step out to greet cuervo dressed in turbanlike 
headgear and sunglasses wearing black capes and carrying old 
thompson machine guns they stop give the righthanded power 
salute one of them bivouac speaks to cuervo 

bivouac

cuervo jones turns to the crowd extends his arms 

cuervo jones

and the loudest longest cheer youve ever heard goes up 

ext skies above disneyland  night 

plissken and the group sail through the sky like silent avenging 
angels toward disneyland below them and several miles away 

plissken 

glances at his wrist watch only 20 minutes left map to the stars 
eddie swings wildly over in his direction manages to stabilize 
his glider for a few moments

ext main street  the arena  night 

cuervo jones leads utopia toward a large attack helicopter out in 
front of all the others the choppers are all starting up 
roaring blades turning 

suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming yelling map 
to the stars eddie diving out of control eyes wide as he passes 
cuervo jones and utopia 

map to the stars eddie

map to the stars eddie suddenly grabs cuervo as if to protect him 
and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in cuervos hand 
at the same moment bivouac and the black muslim open fire on an 
old storefront behind cuervo jones the place is shredded 

cuervo jones pulls map to the stars eddie up off the ground and 
grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches 

cuervo jones

cuervo jones pulls out a pistol cocks it aims at map to the 
stars eddies face 

kabloom no not the pistol a huge explosion rocks main street 

whoosh suddenly out of the night sky spinal and the black cowboys 
dive right down across main street

through flames and running people plissken and cuervo battle 

in cuervos hand is a long black knife just as hes plunging it 
plissken steps aside and grabs him locked together they battle 
savagely 

the knife cuts plisskens chest 

cuervo moves for plisskens throat 

plissken smashes him in the face 

they both grip the knife in a deadlock 

from above spinal dives down and hurls a grenade cuervo and 
plissken disappear in a huge flash of fire and smoke as the 
grenade erupts out of the pavement nearby 

when the smoke clears three things are on the ground plissken

instantly plissken and cuervo dive for the prototype plissken has 
it kicks cuervo in the face drags himself to his feet and takes 
off running as fast as a man can run with one bullet in his leg 

map to the stars eddie drags utopia toward the lead helicopter as 
hershe comes in for a landing 

spinal comes in for a landing continues to throw grenades the 
other black cowboys land provide covering fire 

plissken races for the chopper behind him cuervo jones is on his 
feet and in pursuit

helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off 
into the sky finally cuervos chopper lifts off

they look as suddenly the night sky on either side of them is 
filled with gang helicopters

ext sky over the san fernando sea  night 

the lead helicopter is surrounded by enemy choppers above below 
on either side 

right next to plissken cuervos chopper pulls up just ten feet 
away cuervo grins out at plissken evilly unhooks himself from 
his seat 

on the other side another chopper with bivouac and the black 
muslims pull up in the rear compartment a black muslim aims what 
looks like a huge harpoon gun mounted to the floor 

kawham 

the line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the 
side of plisskens chopper the prongs clawing in holding in the 
lead helicopter the black cowboys spinal and hershe aim their 
weapons 

plissken

the sea 

cuervo jones leaps from the opened door of his chopper flies 
through space lands on plisskens door with a whump he smashes 
through the side window and grabs plissken 

kablam kablam gang choppers open fire riddling the rear 
compartment with bullets spinal and several black cowboys are 
hit 

plissken fights cuervo through the door 

plissken

utopia stares at him 

utopia

but cuervo wrenches the door open grabs plissken and pulls him 
out of the seat utopia grabs the controls 

the lead helicopter goes wild lurching and swinging and dropping 
plissken and cuervo are locked in a death grip hanging on to the 
doorway one foot in one foot out 

plissken embraces cuervo and throws them both over the edge 

they fall through space locked together until 

whap they are jolted to a dead stop swinging in midair 
plisskens arm wrapped around the dangling right skid 

the lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings plissken and 
cuervo suspended below struggling to the death whipped back and 
forth by the helicopters gyrations 

in the cockpit utopia grabs the controls the ship is shaking 
swinging like a pendulum hershe is hit with gunfire flops in the 
rear compartment map to the stars eddie slowly regains 
consciousness stares in horror at utopia 

map to the stars eddie
wheres plissken 

outside cuervo clutches plissken around the neck struggling and 
thrashing plissken head butts him dazing him for a second 

kacrack the dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on 
the helicopter above plissken and cuervo jones stare up then at 
each other then both begin pulling themselves up the skid 
climbing hand over hand in a desperate race 

both men reach the bottom of the helicopter and leap across to the 
left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the 
san fernando sea plissken and cuervo kick at each other plissken 
slides away from him looks up sees the grappling hook stuck 
into the side of the helicopter 

plissken swings up straddling the skid he reaches up and begins 
prying loose the grappling hook cuervos coming right up behind 
him reaching for him a huge knife in his hands he raises the 
knife  when map to the stars eddie leans out of the cockpit door 
lowers a gun and aims it right at cuervo 

map to the stars eddie
hey cuervo 

cuervo looks at him starts to say something eyes bulging 

map to the stars eddie
if you get to america  lets do lunch 

kablam kablam the shots hit and cuervo buckles falls backwards 
off the skid plunging downward toward the surface of the san 
fernando sea kasplash 

plissken rips out the grappling hook 

as boom 

map to the stars eddie is hit with gunfire dies falls out of the 
seat out of the door out of the helicopter  plunges to the 
water below 

plissken jumps back inside the cockpit 

utopia

pov through windscreen 

police battle helicopters thunder toward them in unison the 
police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms 
burning whitesulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness 
and hit enemy choppers the sky around the lead helicopter is 
filled with explosions waves of rolling fire falling flaming 
wrecks plunging past as enemy choppers begin to hit the water 

it is a dreamlike slowmotion ballet huge black police gun ships 
circle lazily around the enemy choppers their flexguns and 
rockets spitting bluewhite fire the pound the living hell out of 
the enemy choppers in fg plisskens helicopter sweeps over the

takes off running into the darkness inside 

plissken

plissken slowly drops the collective control the left skid sets 
down and the ship continues to descend tips begins to roll 
inside as the chopper rolls over plissken braces himself as the 
blades hit the ground the chopper goes wild the fuselage jumps 
and twists in a grinding fury smoke and debris fly the blades 
snap off 

from behind plissken  inside 

looking out the front the blades smash through the windscreen 
barely missing the top of plisskens head plissken is splattered 
with glass a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part 
of his biceps blood pours the rear compartment explodes into 
flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank fire billows into 
the cockpit engulfing plissken 

outside plissken pulls himself out of the door he is on fire 
dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the 
flaming midsection of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball 

plissken climbs to his feet smoking wounded 

 as malloy the president brazen and a squad of police arrive 
in vehicles they slowly get out 

 as plissken limps toward them 

plissken
