al   ext spaceship stock

	it soars into space

2	int orbiting spaceship

	through whose windows the same light lividly
	illuminates three spacesuited and helmeted astronauts
	 afraid and curiously hesitant at the controls we
	establish a dual date meter showing the year in terms
	both of earth time and selftime  both panels
	read 3955

					astronaut 1 male
			we made it

					astronaut 2 male
			so far  but one thing i8 for certain
			whoever wins the war therell be no
			place on earth for us

					astronaut 3 female
			where are we going

					astronaut 2 male
				briskly
			probably to our death  but just
			possibly 

3	pov shot  earths rim whitens to incandescence

	and a soundless explosion sends a column of fire an
	mushrooming up towards us

4	spaceship

	appalled silence  through the ships windows the
	astronauts are watching and we with them the nuclear
	disintegration of earth  the incandescence almost
	burns through their space helmets  in awed voices

					astronaut 2
			the foolstheyve finally destroyed
			themselves

					astronaut 1
			my god the earth is no more

					astronaut 3
			and weve escaped

	the spaceship begins to shudder

					astronaut 2
			we have if we survive the shock
			wave

	the shock wave of the huge megatonic explosion hits
	the spaceship from below

	chaos and pandemonium inside  we multiply normal air
	turbulence a thousandfold and are bashed buffeted
	whirled twirled lifted a hundred miles and dropped
	fifty before slowly flattening out to some semblance
	of equilibrium on presumably a new orbit  the date
	meter digits under earth time have begun to click and
	race erratically astronaut 2 watches intently

					astronaut 2
			the shock must have  unbalanced
			the mechanism  i dont understand

	now he turns to look at another dial

5	illuminated panel labeled automatic reentry sequence

	across it curves the descending graphline which traces
	optimum reentry path  now the lights begin to trace
	the spacecrafts actual reentry path which sometimes
	slightly deviates to left or right of the graphline but
	always approximately follows its course

					astronaut 2
			weve been forced out of orbit

	the colonel among friends is barbecuing a steak on
	the lawn of his private quarters as the garden phone
	rings beside him  the roar of the os helicopters
	passing overhead and the nature of the phone message

	brief conversations course is burnt to a cinder  as
	the helicopters recede

					president
			let us hope and pray that you are
			right general  but i think we
			should be alert to a remoter
			possibility  that the russians
			retrieved one of our missing space
			ships and remanned it with astronauts
			who have now accidentally splashed
			down in our own territorial waters
			if theyre alive you may tell
			colonel winthrop at el palomar to
			welcome them with caution  whether
			theyre alive or not have nasa go
			over that ship with whatevers the
			scientific equivalent of a fine tooth
			comb  and until we know more i want
			a full security clampdown on the entire
			operation
				dryly
			you understand me general  this is

					colonel
			whats the matter

	marine mp helplessly ushers them into

28    int guardhouse

	its rear section behind bars is furnished with
	austere but serviceable beds chairs tables and a
	washing sink with plates and cutlery in rack above  on
	the floor a capacious rawhide valise from which zira
	gloved and shod has extracted a robe into which she
	is changing her discarded space suit lies at her feet
	milo and cornelius have already changed  their space
	suits are hanging neatly from wall hooks  at colonels
	entry milo and cornelius rise courteously to their
	feet while zira struggles hastily into her robe  from

					colonel

			excuse me  i didnt mean to

					aide
			theyrepretending to dress

					colonel

					marine mp

				with an effort

			greg give them their oranges

	aide advances cautiously with paper bag

29    master shot

	we hold colonel and marine mp talking in fg while
	aide proffers oranges which the trio gracefully
	accepts in bg

	zira holding her orange has gone straight to the sink
	rack from which she takes three plates three knives
	and three forks

					colonel
				not noticing

			arrange prisoner escort for 1630
			hours

	zira distributes plates and cutlery to milo and
	cornelius to aides astonishment the apes draw up

					colonel
				not noticing

			were sending them to the zoo infirmary

	the apes start meticulously quartering their oranges on
	their plates with their knives

					colonel
				still to aide
			theyll have company  theres
			a gorilla in the next cage

	zira overhearing this reacts violently rises picks
	up her plate and hurls it to the ground

					colonel
				looking round at
				last
			now why the hell did it do that

	the full implications of the plates and the knives only
	strike him as we

										cut to

30    int zoo infirmary  night

	we start on close shot of the deer with pneumonia
	cradled under ultraviolet lamps which as we pull back
	prove to be the huge clinically furnished rooms only
	light source  for the sick animals must get their
	rest  we pan past a recumbent camel and the mauled fox
	cub into whose small sleeping body the rubber tube of
	a suspended flask is intravenously dripping plasma and
	end on a whitecoated keeper with flashlamp
	inspecting our ape trio now installed in one of two
	large contiguous cages at the dim rooms center  
	straw for them to lie on a bowl of water for drinking
	and a generous supply of oranges and bananas one of
	which he cautiously proffers to zira through the bars
	while playfully patting her head  zira reacts the
	banana and slaps his face  taken aback but still
	amicably

					keeper
			have it your own way mate

	clang  he locks them in and exits  when the light
	from his flashlamp has faded to neardarkness we hear
	an outer door more distantly locked

					zira
				outraged whisper
				to cornelius
			im not his mate  im yours

					cornelius
			zira please control yourself
			i think theyre trying to be kind

					zira
			this cage stinks of gorilla

	she sits down disconsolately on the straw  instantly
	cornelius sits by her and takes her hand  in 
	undertones

					zira
			cornelius  where are we  whats
			happened

	cornelius helplessly shrugs  from the shadows very
	softly

					milo
			i know where we are  i know what
			has happened

	zira and cornelius stare at him

					milo
			in some fashion  and i lack
			the intellect to know precisely how
			 we have traveled from earths
			future into earths past

					cornelius
			but we saw earth destroyed

					milo
			and earth will be destroyed 
			just as we saw it  only since
			fleeing it we have passed through
			abackward disturbance in time 
			did you notice the date meter
			clicking down after the shock
			wave hit our ship  and we
			have returned to earth almost
			two thousand years before its
			destruction
					solemnly
			that is another reason for keeping
			silence  our human captors would
			not be edified to know that one
			day their world will crack like
			an egg and fry to a cinder because
			of an ape war of aggression

	his low tones have become just emphatic enough to
	disturb

31    gorilla in next cage

	it shifts grunts and whimpers uneasily

32    back to scene

	the trio reacts  we close to

					milo
			apes at this instant in time
			cannot yet talk  for the moment
			we should follow their example

										fade out


	fade in

33    ext zoo  misty morning shots 600 am

	we hear occasional call of a tropical early bird and
	close to two human early birds  lewis dixon a young
	animal psychiatrist and his pretty female research
	assistant stevie  as they walk

					lewis
				feeling in
				pocket
			the driver brought e report from
			the air base
				scanning it
			the usual imitatory behavior 
			mimicking salutes  handshaking
			 sitting on chairs  eating
			off plates with knives  but

	he hesitates

					stevie
			what lewis

					lewis
			there was a sort of carpetbag in
			the ship

					stevie
			with food

					lewis
			no  clothes  stevie they changed
			into them

					stevie
			i dont believe it

	but his reaction says it is true  we have reached the
	infirmarys main open door which is guarded by two
	soldiers

					stevie
			what are they doing here

					lewis
			security
				undertone
			join the marines and see the zoo 

	passing between the soldiers they enter


a33  int infirmary corridor

	they don white smocks marked with their own names
	hanging from wall hooks walk past the sick deer and
	the fox under treatment in small boxcages against the
	wall and enter

b33  main room  double cage

	in one half of the cage sleeps the depressed gorilla
	in the other half very much awake sit cornelius and
	zira staring at the intelligence test apparatus
	outside the cage stands keeper

					lewis
			good morning arthur

					arthur
			hi dr dixondr branton

	our apes survey them stonily

					arthur
				fingering bruise
				on cheek
			the females a bit uppity sir

					lewis
			okay ill be careful  well
			start with the wisconsin
			multiphasic

	stevie opens the cage

					lewis
			go easy stevie

					stevie
			they look pretty docile

					lewis
			yes but dont take any chances

	the wisconsin multiphasic is a screen which can be
	lowered and raised like a window shade between the
	investigator on one side and the subject on the other
	zira winks knowledgeably at cornelius  milo gestures
	her into more discreet behavior  keeper sets up
	apparatus during

					lewis
				to stevie
			unless the spacecraft was
			remotely controlled they must
			have been conditioned to press
			at least some of the right
			buttons  they cant be morons
				to keeper
			the female first arthur  and
			set up tictactoe

	to everyones surprise and keepers relief zira
	promptly squats down on her side of the raised screen
	the hypercautious milo disapprovingly shakes his head
	lewis raises screen and displays a single red cube for
	three seconds before lowering screen to mask ziras
	view  when he raises it again he is simultaneously
	displaying a blue pyramid a green cone a yellow
	sphere a blue cube a red octahedron and the red cube
	zira instantly selects the red cube which she offers
	courteously back to lewis lewis gives an astonished
	whistle  stevie too reacts in amazement

					lewis
			she seems to be pretty smart
			all right  lets make it
			difficult

	he lowers the screen and readies an assortment of five
	colored blocks then raises the screen only for a
	second then lowers it  he now adds additional blocks
	to make it an even dozen and breaks up the pattern of
	five previously seen by zira  now almost smugly he
	raises the screen but any superiority he may have felt
	is quickly erased as zira swiftly selects the original
	five blocks lewis is dumbfounded stevie drops her
	notebook and the keeper stares in utter disbelief

	now lewis pulls the drawer out from the table and we
	see that slots for all twelve blocks have been carved
	in the bottom  no slouch zira  she deftly and swiftly
	fits all twelve blocks into their proper niches  
	whereat she rises to her feet clasps hands over her
	head like a boxer acknowledging victory  cornelius
	responds with mirth but milo shakes his head

	lewis has risen at this interplay between the apes and
	now questions the keeper quietly

					lewis
			they havent eaten this morning

					arthur
			not a bitejust as you ordered

					lewis
			good  well go for the banana

	scattered about the cage are a number of oddly
	constructed wooden boxes all gaily painted  stevie
	now adds several more as arthur tugs on a rope pulley
	to lower a banana from the top of the cage

	this is a test unfamiliar to zira who responds to its
	challenge  she speculatively eyes the banana then
	stoops to prowl among the boxes which she carefully
	examines without touching them  then she 
	straightens and thinks the tension is 
	insupportable  suddenly zira moving into action 
	interlocks all the boxes so that they form
	a somewhat eccentric staircase leading to the banana
	having done so she ascends the stairs sits on the
	top and stares smugly at the banana now only inches
	from her nose

					stevie
			why doesnt she take it


					zira
			because i loathe and detest bananas

					cornelius
			zira

	as though in a slow nightmare stevie sags and faints
	somehow lewis catches her and lowers her to the cage
	floor  somehow keeper sluices water from the drinking
	bowl over her upturned race  as she recovers

					lewis
				sweating
			help me get her away  ill come
			back

	jointly supporting stevie they leave the cage which
	keeper locks  we stay with

34    out

35    ape trio

					milo
			zira are you mad

					cornelius
			dr milo please dont call my
			wife mad

					milo
				evenly
			i did not call her mad  i merely
			asked her if she was  and i repeat
			the question
				to zira
			are you mad

					zira
			i hate deceit

					milo
			there is a time for truth and
			a time not for lies but for
			silence  until we know who i8
			our friend and who our enemy

					zira
			and how in the name of god are we
			to know that unless we communicate
			we can speak  so i spoke

					milo
			we can also listen 

					cornelius
			to a lot of psychiatric small talk 

					milo
			and we can watch 

					cornelius
			a display of primitive apparatus 

					zira
				kicking the apparatus
			primitive  its prehistoric  it
			couldnt test the intelligence of
			a newt

	she kicks the apparatus again and it collapses  the
	gorilla in the next cage gives a disturbed grunt

					cornelius
			zira calm yourself 

					zira
			i am calm

	she knocks another piece of apparatus endways now even
	milos selfcontrol snaps  he stalks to the side bars
	and with eyes screwed shut in frustration briefly but
	fiercely shakes them before spinning round with back
	pressed against the bars to glare at his two 
	tormentors we shoot at and past him into the next cage
	where the gorilla now shambles to its feet and slowly
	advances from bg during

					milo
			stop arguing  its too late for
			that

	his body masking the gorillas crouched and stealthy 
	approach from them  but not from us

					milo
			use your heads and start thinking
			now that they know we can speak
			how much shall we tell them  ow

					zira
				screaming
			milooo

	through the bars two hairy hands converge on milos
	throat and strangle him to death  the roaring of the
	gorilla the throttled cries of milo and ziras screams
	combine to launch


36    various zoo shots

	of alarmed birds and beasts as panic briefly infects
	the zoo  eg a sleeping owl opens huge eyes cranes
	cry mallards take off from pool seals cough apes
	gibber tigers snarl lions roar and elephants 
	trumpet  we might instead of separating each cry
	overlay sound cumulatively so that each new noise is
	added to its predecessors as we build visually and
	aurally to a massive and bestial crescendo before

									cut back to

37    the cage

	the panic is over  outside stevie shaken but
	recovered confers with lewis  as keepers 1 and 2 lift
	a blanketed stretcher and carry milos body out of
	shot

					lewis
			we shall want a full autopsy 

					stevie
			with particular emphasis on the
			cranial and oral areas

					lewis
			keep him in cold storage till the
			reports in  then send him to
			taxidermy
				wryly
			hes a museum piece

	a low moan turns their heads toward the cages
	interior zira sits crouched in a corner her head in
	her hands and rocking from side to side  cornelius is
	comforting her

					lewis
				to stevie
			id better do this alone

	she nods and stays outside the cage which lewis
	enters he looks compassionately at the two huddled
	apes the straw the orange peel the bananas the
	abandoned intelligence test apparatus

					lewis
				gently
			we mean you no harm

	silence and stillness

					lewis
			do you understand  we mean you
			no harm

	slowly and bitterly zira points an ironic and accusing
	finger at the next cage where an anesthetized and
	chained gorilla slumps in the shadows

					lewis
			but he isnt us  hes your own
			kind

					zira
				angrily on her
				feet in a flash
			hes a gorilla

	as cornelius soothes her

					lewis
			i mean hes of your race
			hes an ape  look  you dont
			have to be afraid  weve put him
			in chains and under sedation
			do you understand that

					zira
			i should  ive been doing it
			half my life to humans

					lewis
				dumbfounded
			humans

					zira
				as though this
				explained everything
			im a psychiatrist

	a second shock  lewis covers dazed eyes with his hand
	and after a struggle regains his selfcontrol

					lewis
			so am i  and i mean you no harm

					cornelius
				at last
			we know that

	lewis over one hurdle exhales

					lewis
			do you have a name

					cornelius
			my name is cornelius  and this
			is zira  my wife

					lewis
			my name is lewis  lewis dixon 

	he diffidently extends a hand  cornelius takes it
	zira doesnt

					lewis
			nobodys going to believe it

					cornelius
			believe what

					lewis
			that primitive apes can talk

					zira
				furious
			primitive

					lewis
				quick smile
			i mean that in our primitive
			civilization apes just dont talk
			i mean i think its important that
			when our primitive security
			precautions are lifted the first
			time you say something in public you
			should talk to what we primitively
			call the right people

	zira gives him a long searching look  and smiles

					zira
			may i say something personal

					lewis
				smiling back
			please

					zira
			i like you

	lewis look gratefully from her to

					cornelius
			i did from the beginning
