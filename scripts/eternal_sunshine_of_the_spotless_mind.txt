                         us

               the receptionist gestures toward a christmas tree in the 
               corner its ornaments are holograms

                                     old woman
                         this book  its essential that 
                         people read it because 
                              gravely patting the

                              nodding 
                              sympathetically
                         maybe after the holidays then

               int tiled hallway  day

               the old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway 
               hall she stops to catch her breath then continues and passes 
               several archway with letters printed above them when she 
               arrives at one topped by an ll she slips a card in a slot 
               a plastic molded chair drops into the archway she sits in 
               the chair it rises

               int tube  day

               the woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into 
               a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube the other 
               chairs are peopled with commuters we stay with the woman as 
               she and the others travel over new york city in the tube 
               there are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the 
               skyline the woman glances at the manuscript in her lap 
               its called

                          eternal sunshine of the spotless mind

               this serves as the movies opening title the other credits 
               follow as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes  
               their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank

                                     clementine
                         what no i dont like the term 
                         boyfriend its so gay

               mierzwiak nods hes attentive pleasant and neutral 
               throughout

                                     clementine
                         maybe gay isnt the right word but 
                         anyway its been rough with him 
                         whatever the fuck he is heheh my 
                         significant other heh heh and i 
                         guess on a certain level i want to 
                         break it off but i feel yknow 
                         its like this constant questioning 
                         and re questioning do i end it 
                         should i give it more time im not 
                         happy but what do i expect 
                         relationships require work you know 
                         the drill the thing that i keep 
                         coming back to is im not getting 
                         any younger i want to have a baby 
                         at some point maybe right so 
                         then i think i should settle  which 
                         is not necessarily the best word  
                         i mean hes a good guy its not 
                         really settling then i think maybe 
                         im just a victim of movies yknow  
                         that i have some completely 
                         unrealistic notion of what a 
                         relationship can be but then i think 
                         no this is what i really want so i 
                         should allow myself the freedom to 
                         go out and fucking find it you know 
                         agreed but then i think he is a 
                         good guy and its complicated  
                         yknow

                                     mierzwiak
                         i think i know i think we can help 
                         why dont you start by telling me 
                         about your relationship everything 
                         you can think of everything about 
                         him everything about you and well 
                         take it from there

               joel talks on a phone the wind howls around him he tries 
               to shield the mouthpiece as he talks

                                     joel

               joel wanders the windy empty beach with his briefcase he 
               passes an old man with a metal detector they nod at each 
               other

               later joel looks out at the ocean

               later joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook he opens 
               it and writes with a gloved hand

                                     joel

                         last night we had sex it was weird 
                         to fall into our old familiar sex 
                         life so easily like no time has 
                         passed after two years apart suddenly 
                         were talking about getting together 
                         again i guess thats good

               he has no other thoughts he glances up spots a female figure 
               in the distance walking in his direction she stands out 
               against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt 
               its clementine he watches her for a bit then as she nears 
               he goes back to his writing or at least pretends to once 
               she passed he watches her walk away she stops and stares 
               out at the ocean joel writes

                                     joel

                         dont know i guess id better get 
                         back to naomi

               later joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the 
               season he peeks cautiously in a dark window

               later joel digs into the sand with a stick

               int diner  day

               its a local tourist place but offseason empty joel sits 
               in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of

               glances at her bright blue hair she picks an empty booth 
               and sits joel studies her discreetly the waitress approaches 
               her with a coffee pot

                                     waitress

                         century

               the waitress is not amused

               the waitress heads to the grill clementine fishes in her 
               bag brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment 
               pours something in then brings the cup back up

                                     clementine
                              calling

               clementine looks around the place her eyes meet joels before 
               he is able to look away she smiles vaguely he looks 
               embarrassed then down at his journal clementine pulls a 
               book from her purse and starts to read joel glances up 
               tries to see the cover its blue he cant read the title

               ext beach  day

               joel stares out at the ocean far down the beach clementine 
               stares at it too joel glances sideways at her then back at 
               the ocean

               joel sits on the bench waiting for a train clementine enters 
               the platform sees joel the only other person there she 
               waves sort of goofily enthusiastic playing as if theyre 
               old friends he waves back embarrassed she takes a seat on 
               a bench far down the platform joel stares at his hands 
               pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal 
               his awkwardness

               int train  a bit later

               joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the 
               slowly passing desolate terrain after a moment the door 
               between cars opens and clementine enters joel looks up 
               clementine is not looking at him she busies herself deciding 
               where to sit she settles on a seat at the opposite end of 
               the car joel looks out the window he feels her watching 
               him the train is picking up speed finally

                                     clementine

                         i just dont think nice is a 
                         particularly interesting thing to 
                         be

               the conductor enters the car

                                     conductor
                         tickets

               joel hands the conductor his ticket the conductor punches 
               it and hands it back

                                     clementine
                         what is nice anyway i mean besides 
                         an adjective i guess it can be an 
                         adverb sort of

               the conductor turns to clementine she fishes in her bag

                                     clementine
                         it doesnt reveal anything nice is 
                         pandering cowardly and life is 
                         more interesting than that or should 
                         be jesus god i hope it is 
                         someday
                              to conductor
                         i know its here

               the conductor and joel watch as she gets more agitated

                                     clementine
                         i dont need nice i dont need myself 
                         to be it and i dont need anyone 
                         else to be it at me

                         on

               she dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts 
               frantically through joel sees the book she was reading in 
               the diner its the play by stephen dixon

                         oh here

               she hands the conductor the tickets smiles sweetly he 
               punches it hands it back to her and walks away

                         next stop southampton

               the conductor heads into the next car clementine shoves 
               stuff back into her purse her hands are a little shaky she 
               pulls a airlinesized bottle of alcohol from her pocket

               joel stands in the living room somewhat nervously he tries 
               to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings he looks at 
               the books on her shelves clementine is in the kitchen we 
               see her as she passes by the doorway several times preparing 
               drinks and chatting

               performing brian enos music for airports to look at 
               clementine reenters with her drink

                                     clementine

               she grabs it and sticks it in the cd player the music is 
               dreamy and haunting and slow clementine falls back onto the 
               couch closes her eyes and sips her drink

                                     clementine

               joel sits down in his chair and drinks theres a silence 
               which seems fine to clementine but makes joel anxious

                         my goal can i tell you my goal

                                     joel
                         yeah

                                     clementine
                              ala paul simon
                         whats the goal joel
                              laughs
                         my goal joel is to just let it 
                         flow through me do you know what i 
                         mean its like theres all these 
                         emotions and ideas and they come 
                         quick and they change and they leave 
                         and they come back in a different 
                         form and i think were all taught we 
                         should be consistent yknow you 
                         love someone  thats it forever 
                         you choose to do something with your 
                         life  thats it thats what you 
                         do its a sign of maturity to stick 
                         with that and see things through 
                         and my feeling is thats how you 
                         die because you stop listening to 
                         what is true and what is true is 
                         constantly changing you know

                                     joel

               we stay with clementine as she watches joel tromping through 
               the snow and getting in his car

               int joels car  night

               joel speeds through the suburban rockville center 
               neighborhood there is no snow on the ground he seems 
               different somehow foggy and disoriented

               subtitle three days earlier

               he arrives at his apartment building and parks

               ext joels apartment building  continuous

               joel gets out of his car spots a van parked across the 
               street there are two dark figures inside

                                     voiceover
                         them

               he hurries inside the building

               int joels apartment  night

               joel enters dumps his overcoat on a chair turns off the 
               lights crosses to look furtively out the window its snowing 
               in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a 
               streetlight

                                     joel
                         it was snowing

                                     voiceover

                         them out the orange glow of a 
                         cigarette

               joel squints to see inside the van two dark figures talk 
               one sucks on a cigarette and a dim orange light momentarily 
               illuminates the interior the figure in the driver seat rolls 
               down his window and gives a cheery wave to joel

                                     joel
                         the driver waved so casual friendly

                                     voiceover
                         im like a joke to them

               joel pulls away from the window his face blanched

                                     voiceover
                         i guess they figure they can act 
                         like they want they dont have to 
                         worry about me remembering

               he paces mulling things over as he does the scene starts 
               to change almost as if it is drying out

                                     joel
                         i might be making a mistake

               the colors bleach the surroundings become slightly vague 
               even joels persona and voiceover seem to alter his 
               emotional intensity becoming diffused joel does not seem 
               aware of this he stops pacing takes a small vial from his 
               pocket dumps the lone pill onto his palm he looks at it 
               its pink theres some illegible initials stamped on it

                                     joel

               he swallows it peeks out the window again takes off his 
               clothes slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store 
               packaging he sits on the edge of the bed dials the phone

               joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed by now the 
               scene is lifeless almost a husk he hears the apartment 
               building door open he hears footsteps

                                     joel

                         its too late

               his eyelids are getting heavy he closes his eyes

               black

               he hears a key in his apartment door

                                     joel
                         fuck

               int bookstore  night

               joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop its a jarring 
               transition visually and emotionally joel is in the midst 
               of some traumatic state of mind he fingers the vial with 
               the pink pill in it as he watches clementine stack books on 
               shelves her hair is bright orange now

                                     joel
                         i should maybe talk to you

                                     voiceover
                         clementine i should just maybe talk 
                         to her

               joel rises and heads toward clementine

                                     joel
                         i love you and if you knew that 
                         if i told you what happened ill 
                         explain everything what we meant to 
                         each other ill tell you everything 
                         about our time together youll know 
                         everything again and

                                     voiceover
                         maybe if i just explain what happened 
                         i wouldnt have to go through this 
                         and i could tell you everything and 
                         it would be like you knew and we 
                         could rebuild and we could be happy 
                         again and

               right before joel gets there patrick a skinny young man 
               approaches clementine joel stops watches the young man 
               seems out of breath he glances over at joel then taps 
               clementine on the shoulder she turns annoyed sees who it 
               is and her face lights up

                                     joel
                         clementine

                                     voiceover
                         thats your look for me

               clementine giggles stands and pokes patrick playfully in 
               the ribs

                                     patrick

                         i was not

               joel is mesmerized by their familiarity as he stands there 
               the scene starts to dry out clementine and patrick continue 
               their flirtation but its turning lifeless as if they are 
               just reciting lines the bookstore start to lose its color 
               and immediacy

                                     clementine
                         come over after im done here

                         how could anyone do this to anyone

                                     clementine

                         hair

                         its so cool youre by far the most 
                         sensational person in the room

                         in the room

                                     patrick
                         in the world

               joel seems dazed in some sort of dream confusion as he 
               realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd

                                     joel
                         whats happening here

               joel turns to leave

               int joels car  night

               joel drives fast recklessly the intensity is back hes 
               weeping as he drives

                                     joel
                         gotta get home how could she do 
                         this to me how could she not care 
                         about what we meant to each other 
                         what a fuck what a fucking monster 
                         she is

                                     voiceover

                         is

               the scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment 
               building and gets out of the car joel spots the parked 
               van weve seen this before but its dried out now

               joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff  
               hes been crying he looks behind him and finds himself 
               looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on 
               the snowy street he turns back to the new york street and 
               spots the address he was looking for 610 11th avenue

               int waiting room  day

               joel sits in the small room with his bags a woman across 
               from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap her 
               eyes are red from crying mary the receptionist pokes her

               coat

                                     mierzwiak

                         tonight

               stan nods professionally

                                     stan
                         mr barish

                                     joel
                         how exactly is this going to work 
                         tonight

               as mierzwiak talks the room colors start to fade mierzwiaks 
               tone of voice is also affected it becomes dry and monotonous

                                     mierzwiak
                         well start with your most recent 
                         memories and go backwards  there 
                         is an emotional core to each of our 
                         memories  as we eradicate this 
                         core it starts its degradation 
                         process  by the time you wake up 
                         in the morning all memories weve 
                         targeted will have withered and 
                         disappeared like a dream upon waking

                                     joel
                         is there any sort of risk of brain 
                         damage

                                     mierzwiak
                         well technically the procedure 
                         itself is brain damage but on a par 
                         with a night of heavy drinking 
                         nothing youll miss

               joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment suddenly 
               he gets it

                                     joel
                         its happening now im already in 
                         my brain

               mierzwiak looks at the fading room

                                     mierzwiak
                         yes i suppose you are
                              back in his faded 
                              memory persona
                         so lets get started  if we want 
                         the procedure underway tonight we 
                         have some work to do

               joel is sitting in a chair electrodes connect him to some 
               electronic machinery monitored by stan mierzwiak watches 
               from the corner

                                     stan
                         we use the articles you brought to 
                         create a map of clementine in your 
                         brain tonight while you sleep well 
                         be able to trace the map and erase

                                     joel
                         but youre tracing and erasing now 
                         its already started im home in my 
                         bed

               stan pulls a snow globe from one of joels bags shows it to 
               joel the equipment registers joels reaction

                                     stan
                         very good

               stan pulls out a potato dressed as a vegas showgirl joel 
               studies it the machines register his response

                                     mierzwiak
                         well dispose of these mementos when 
                         were done here that way you wont 
                         be confused later by their 
                         unexplainable presence in your home

               stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of clementine printed 
               on it joel looks at the cup the machines record his 
               reaction

                                     stan
                         good were getting healthy read
                         outs

               the room stan and mierzwiak are now vague and wispy

                                     stans voice
                         patrick do me a favor 

               joel is watching stan stan is not speaking yet his voice 
               continues

                                     stans voice
                          and check the voltage levels im 
                         not wiping as clean as i would like 
                         here

               joel looks up stans voice seems to be coming from above

               int joels apartment  night

               joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas his eyes are closed 
               and electrodes connect his head to several machines the 
               machines are operated by stan now in grubby street clothes 
               and in need of a shave and by patrick dressed similarly 
               the monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light 
               blips running like streams through an image of joels brain 
               stan presses buttons and operates a joystick aiming for the 
               lines patrick who we saw earlier with clementine at the 
               bookstore studies a meter on one of the machines

                                     patrick
                         the voltage looks fine

                                     stan
                         then check the connections

               patrick fiddles with some jacks

                                     patrick
                         does that help

                                     stan
                         yeah that looks better thanks

               int lab room  day

               the memory is becoming vague characters affects flat  
               stan pulls out a pile of looseleaf pages mierzwiak smiles

                                     mierzwiak
                         ah your journal this will be

                              reading

                         have been stagnant for so long

               the scene is just a shell of itself as stan rattles on

                                     stans voice

               joel looks up at the ceiling

               int joels apartment  day

               joel snapped into a new memory cries as he fills two large 
               plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with 
               clementine there are funny little gifts windup toys some 
               potatoes dressed as women some clothing clementine has left

               there is obscured in darkness joel wanders it in the 
               distance clementine walks off but as in an animated loop

                                     clementine
                         its my favorite book since i was a 
                         kid its about these toys theres 
                         this part where the skin horse tells 
                         the rabbit what it means to be real
                              crying
                         i cant believe im crying already 
                         he says it takes a long time thats 
                         why it doesnt often happen to people 
                         who break easily or have sharp edges 
                         or who have to be carefully kept 
                         generally by the time you are real 
                         most of your hair has been loved 
                         off and your eyes drop out and you 
                         get loose in the joints and very 
                         shabby but these things dont matter 
                         at all because once you are real 
                         you cant be ugly except to people 
                         who dont understand

               shes weeping joel is stroking her hair they kiss and begin 
               to make love under the blanket its sweet and gentle and 
               then it starts to fade

               she continues as if shes still being made love to even 
               though joel is completely beside himself he jumps up naked 
               and yells at the ceiling

                                     joel
                         please please ive changed my mind

               a much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this 
               screen it rotates eventually mierzwiak sees a small distant 
               light in the brain he zeroes in on it

                                     mierzwiak

               kitchen clementine joel is thrown into

               int car  night

                         like a surgeon or a concert pianist

               int car  night

               clementine and joel laugh as they try to give voice to what 
               the characters on the screen are saying

                                     clementine

                         buried

               joel grabs her they run off just as the scene decays into a

               unflappable self

                         yeah i know oh god okay well i 
                         was so excited

               a series of murky images no detail

               a flirtatious look from mierzwiak

                                     marys voice
                         remember you bought me that little 
                         windup frog

               a vague shot of a windup frog

                                     marys voice
                         and you said

               a vague shot of mierzwiak mouthing to marys voice

                                     marys voice
                         this is for your desk just a little 
                         token

               back to mary sitting on the floor listening to the tape

                         i knew then i knew something was 
                         going to happen something 
                         wonderful

               int joels apartment  night

               joel sits in the quiet living room the scene is fading

                                     joel
                         naomi

                                     voiceover
                         on the couch dark quiet i wondered 
                         if i had made a terrible mistake i 
                         almost reached for the phone about a 
                         thousand times i thought i could 
                         take it back erase it explain i 
                         had momentarily lost my mind then i 
                         told myself we werent happy that 
                         was the truth that what we were was 
                         safe it was unfair to you and to me 
                         to stay in a relationship for that 
                         reason i thought about clementine 
                         and the spark when i was with her 
                         but then i thought what you and i 
                         had was real and adult and therefore 
                         significant even if it wasnt much 
                         fun but i wanted fun i saw other 
                         people having fun and i wanted it 
                         then i thought fun is a lie that no 
                         one is really having fun im being 
                         suckered by advertising and movie 
                         bullshit then i thought maybe 
                         not maybe not and then i thought 
                         as i always do at this point in my 
                         argument about dying

                         i projected myself to the end of my 
                         life in some vague rendition of my 
                         old man self i imagined looking 
                         back with a tremendous hole of regret 
                         in my heart

                         operating at this level that  how 
                         can one person be unhappy if one 
                         person is unhappy both have to be 
                         by definition

                         ive been feeling so alienated and 
                         numb lately forever the thought of 
                         not acknowledging my feelings again 
                         seems selfdestructive how can i 
                         continue on this path toward a living 
                         death a life filled with obligation 
                         and guilt and responsibility but

                         forever

                         outrun my humiliation you said so 
                         go with such disdain

                                     clementine
                              poking her head

                         least lets pretend we had one

               clementine comes downstairs vague and robotic making her 
               way through the decaying environment

                                     clementine
                         bye joel

               ext beach  night

               joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire this scene 
               too is disintegrating it dries up and joel is just standing 
               there on a faded beach at night the bonfire frozen in the 
               distance like a photograph

               int car  night

               joel sits in the back seat rob and carrie are in the front

               joel nods glumly

               carrie continues to talk but her voice goes under as joel 
               studies the faded husks of memories piled like refuse outside 
               the moving car window he sees driedout version of previous 
               interactions with clementine playing out in loops he looks 
               back and sees the memory of his ride home from the beach 
               with rob and carrie it too is decaying soon all has 
               crumbled into dust everything goes black

               int joels bedroom  early morning

               howard watches the monitor the last specks of light are 
               fading it grows dark he is tired his eyes are hollow he

               howard dials the bedside phone he waits as it rings
