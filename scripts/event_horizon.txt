               a vast field of stars the gas giant neptune slowly spins 
               into view brilliant and blue and cold against the void

               to discern the hard angles of a manmade craft a ship no 
               longer dwarfed by the planet the scale of the vessel emerges 
               a vast labyrinth of steel

               its shadow swallows all in darkness

               reflects off immobile particles in the air thick quartz

               but for one blinking red light

               an emergency beacon underfloor lights go on

               the strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the 
               helm slowly spinning he is dead perfectly preserved in 
               the cold vacuum of space his eyes are empty black pits and 
               his mouth hangs open in a scream dr william weir

               decorated by a woman but weir is alone unless you count

               the woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave 
               smile

               weir lies back on the bed looks at the photo presses it to 
               his forehead and closes his eyes trying to be with her

                         that ship was lost in deep space 
                         seven years ago if the titanic sailed 
                         into new york harbor id find it 
                         more plausible

                         a search and rescue team investigate 
                         the source of the transmission if 
                         it really is the event horizon 
                         theyll attempt a salvage

                         we need you to prepare a detailed

                         a written briefing cant possibly 
                         anticipate the variables on a mission 
                         like this i have to go with them

               lyle looks at weir stunned by the request

                         dr weir you have no experience 
                         with salvage procedures

                                     weir
                         i designed the ships propulsion 
                         system i am the only person capable 
                         of evaluating the performance of the 
                         gravity drive you cant send a search 
                         and rescue team out there alone and 
                         expect them to succeed that would 
                         be like like sending an auto
                         mechanic to work on the shuttle

                         what i am about to tell you is 
                         considered codeblack by the nsa

               the crew look at each other they havent heard that in a

                                     justin
                         that means topsecret cooper

                         i heard it

                                     weir
                         the usac intercepted a radio 
                         transmission from a decaying orbit 
                         around neptune the source has been

                         thats impossible she was lost with 
                         all hands what seven

                         seven years ago the reactor blew

                         how can we salvage

                                     smith
                         let the dead rest man

                         cancel our leave and send us out

                         everybody shut up let the man speak

               in the quiet that follows

                                     weir
                         what was made public about the event 
                         horizon that she was a deep space 
                         research vessel that its reactor 
                         went critical that the ship blew 
                         up none of that is true
                              beat
                         the event horizon was the culmination 
                         of a secret government project to 
                         create a spacecraft capable of faster
                         thanlight flight

               the crew stares at weir he has just dropped another bomb on 
               them

                                     smith
                         you cant do that

                                     starck
                         the law of relativity prohibits faster
                         thanlight travel

                                     weir
                         relativity yes we cant break the 
                         law of relativity but we can go 
                         around it the ship doesnt really 
                         move faster than the speed of light 
                         it creates a dimensional gateway 
                         that allows the ship to 
                         instantaneously jump from one point 
                         in the universe to another light 
                         years away

                                     starck
                         how

                                     weir
                         well in laymans terms you use a 
                         rotating magnetic field to focus a 
                         narrow beam of gravitons these in 
                         turn fold spacetime consistent with 
                         weyl tensor dynamics until the space
                         time curvature becomes infinitely 
                         large and you have a singularity

                                     cooper
                         laymens terms

               weir thinks of another way to explain it he rips a pinup 
               from smiths locker

                                     smith
                         hey

                                     weir
                         say this paper represents spacetime 
                         and you want to get from point a 
                         here
                              marks it on the photo 
                              with a pen
                         to point b here
                              marks point b
                         now whats the shortest distance 
                         between two points

               the crew stares at him starck decides to play

                                     starck
                         a straight line

                                     weir
                         wrong the shortest distance between 
                         two points

               weir folds the paper lining up point a over point b then 
               thrusting his pen through both skewering the pinup

                                     weir
                         is zero thats what the 
                         singularity does it folds space so 
                         that point a and point b coexist in 
                         the same space and time after the 
                         ship passes through this gateway 
                         space returns to normal
                              hands the ruined pin
                              up back to smith
                         its called a gravity drive

                                     justin
                         how do you know all this

                                     weir
                         i built it

               even cooper is impressed

                                     cooper
                         i can see why they sent you along

                                     justin
                         so if the ship didnt blow up what 
                         happened

                                     weir
                         it was the ships maiden voyage to 
                         test the drive the event horizon 
                         moved to safe distance using ion 
                         thrusters they received the goahead 
                         to activate the gravity drive
                              beat
                         and the ship vanished from all our 
                         scopes no radar contact no enhanced 
                         optical no radio contact of any 
                         kind they disappeared without a 
                         trace
                              beat
                         until now

                                     weir
                         thats what were here to find out

                                                                    cut to

                         we havent been able to confirm any 
                         live contact but tdrss did receive 
                         a single transmission from the event 
                         horizon

                         houston has passed the recording

                         areas from the rest of the ship 
                         that way if the gravity drive

                         i thought of that with the filters

                         breathable air for twenty hours

                                     starck
                         the event horizon sensors show the 
                         same thing bioreadings of 
                         indeterminate origin right before 
                         that wave hit the clark there was 
                         some kind of surge right off the 
                         scale but now its back to its 
                         previous levels

                                     miller
                         whats causing the readings

                                     starck
                         i dont know but whatever it is

                         weve been over every inch of this

                         i dont know what happened to justin

                                     cooper
                         im telling you i saw it

                         what you saw could have been an 
                         optical effect caused by gravitational 
                         distortion

                         i know what i saw and it wasnt a

                         hold on whats this gravitational

                         its possible that a burst of gravity 
                         waves escaped from the core 
                         distorting spacetime they could be

               her son denny looks at her and giggles she gasps the scalpel

               a burst of static

               followed by an inhuman howl of feedback like screaming 
               hyaenas almost alive through the swirl of static the

               miller freezes the frame he squints at the screen

               obscured by static the image is blurred beyond comprehension

               suddenly the lights fade out dim emergency lighting snaps

                         support as it is if we cant stop 
                         the drain were not gonna make it

               weir heads for the door

                         wait

               but weir has vanished into the corridor

                                     miller
                         the rest of you stay here i dont 
                         want anyone else going near that 
                         thing

               miller follows after weir

                                                                    cut to

               the second containment seal opens weir is about to enter 
               when miller stops him he checks a geiger counter it is 
               silent

                                     miller
                         no radiation whats causing the 
                         drain

               weir crosses to a console frowns

                                     weir
                              shakes his head
                         the magnetic fields are holding 
                         maybe a short in the failsafe 
                         circuit ill check it out

               miller assists weir in removing bolts from an access panel 
               the panel falls away revealing a cramped duct leading into 
               the ships circuitry

               weir climbs into the duct miller hands him a flashlight and 
               a toolkit

                                     miller
                         we dont get the power back our 
                         airs gonna go bad

                         check the core for radiation carbon 
                         dioxide may be the least of our 
                         worries

               weir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship

               int event horizon  weirs duct

               weirs breath echoes in the cramped shaft he counts off 
               circuit panels as he goes

               miller slogs through the coolant to the core stares at it 
               it remains metallic mundane

               he pulls out a geiger counter and crosses to the reactor 
               shell examines a gleaming weld the geiger counter clicks 
               slowly no leak

               justin arches in agony and the words come in a strangled

               weir stops before module e12 hears a faint hissing and 
               popping

                                     weir
                         there you are

               he uses a screwdriver to open up the module reveals a series 
               of circuit boards one sparks weir plucks the damaged chips 
               and starts running a bypass

               his flashlight flickers he bangs it against the duct wall 
               it grows dimmer goes out

                                     weir

               another drip then a womans voice like a distant echo

                         billy

               weir starts at the sound he recognizes the voice

               she speaks again no longer far away but a close whisper in 
               his ear

                                     claire os

                         we just lost all power in here dr 
                         weir

               millers voice trails off as he looks towards the core a 
               red glow reflects across his eyes he takes a few steps away 
               from the reactor he stares

               at the burning man standing before the core the deep 
               roar of its conflagration fills the containment

               it slowly turns and raises its arm and points at miller in 
               accusation

                                     burning man
                         dont leave me

               miller stares as the burning man turns and vanishes into a 
               bulkhead leaving the wall blackened and burned with his 
               passing

               the flashlight flickers

                         isnt it possible that you were 
                         traumatized by finding the body on

               she falls silent unwilling to say more

                         peters is right its like something

               smith reacts violently turning on dj shoving him back dj 
               uses smiths momentum to spin the pilot into the wall he 
               presses his scalpel just below smiths ear

               lightboxes it surges up from gutters in the floor

               and the pounding grows louder louder almost to

               the spell breaks and she runs

               int event horizon  generic corridor

               his arm in a wristlock he turns on her his face furious

               and the pounding stops they remain frozen for a moment 
               afraid to breathe

               and finds dj suspended above the table neatly dissected 
               his organs have been laid out carefully before him on the 
               steel table

                                     miller

                         oh god

               miller raises the nailgun with trembling hands fires

                                                                    cut to

               miller approaches the door to the bridge it is open

               int event horizon  bridge

               miller stands in the doorway a figure sits at the helm 
               miller aims the nailgun

                                     miller
                         weir

               the figure doesnt move miller slowly circles around the 
               helm

               its starck bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose 
               unconscious

                                     miller
                         hold on get you outta these

               miller kneels in front of her puts down the nailgun loosens 
               the cords she breathes in ragged gasps opens his eyes

               then stops she stares over millers shoulder like a deer 
               caught in the headlights

               miller looks behind him

               weir stands there staring with eyes sewn shut

               miller reaches for the gun

               weir hits him sending miller across the bridge into a 
               bulkhead weir picks up the nailgun examines it

               miller slowly gets to his feet

                                     miller
                         your eyes

                         i dont need them anymore where 
                         were going we wont need eyes to 
                         see

                                     miller
                         what are you talking about

                                     weir
                         do you know what a singularity is 
                         miller does your mind truly fathom 
                         what a black hole is
                              beat
                         it is nothing absolute and eternal 
                         nothing and if god is everything 
                         then i have seen the devil
                              a dead mans grin
                         its a liberating experience

               with his free hand weir reaches for the navigation console 
               flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers

               int event horizon  bridge enlarged console

               the display lights up

                         what are you doing

               weir grins as he flips the final switch

               miller lunges for the nailgun weir raises the nailgun to 
               point at millers face miller slowly backs away

                                     miller
                         if you miss me youll blow out the 
                         hull youll die too

                                     weir
                         what makes you think ill miss

               miller sees something out of the corner of his eye

               ext event horizon  bridge

               cooper outside braced in the viewport bracket

               int event horizon  bridge

               weir spins and fires at cooper the nail lodges in the thick 
               quartz glass a web of cracks spreads out from the bullet 
               the glass shrieking under the pressure

               weir takes a step towards the window raises the gun to fire 
               again

               ext event horizon  bridge

               miller dives for the door before weir can fire

               ext event horizon  bridge window hanging section

               the window explodes outward

               int event horizon  bridge

               the ship howls as air rushes out ripping weir off his feet 
               weir catches himself in the broken window trying to pull 
               himself back in

               a monitor tears free smashes into him he is sucked out

               miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut 
               he is safe

                                     starck os
                         dont leave me

               miller turns starck clings to a console barely able to 
               resist the winds that try to suck her into the void

                                     starck
                              gasping for air
                         please help help me

               miller hesitates looking from starck back into the safety 
               of the ship the door continues to shut in seconds he will 
               be safe and she will be dead

               miller yells and rips a compressor from its mount wedges it 
               in the door to keep it open he keeps one hand on the door 
               reaches the other hand to starck

                                     miller
                         give me your hand your hand

               she does frost forms on their bodies as the air cools their 
               veins begin to bulge blood pulses from their noses he yells 
               with exertion

               drags her to the door through the door

               as the compressor tears free sucked into space

               and the door snaps shut missing them by a fraction

               int event horizon  corridor to bridge

               starck and miller collapse against the door a moment passes 
               between them just happy to be breathing

               and then the airlock klaxon goes off

               they enter see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light

               miller looks around for a weapon pulls a zerog bolt cutter 
               from the wall wields it like a bat

                         stay behind me

               the inner airlock door releases with a hiss swings open

                         i dont know the process dr weir

                         i dont want to go where the last

               miller runs down the corridor stops at a bulkhead coupling 
               kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge 
               switch it to manual detonation

               miller runs to the next coupling repeats the process

               cooper exits down a ladder starck turns to the console 
               activates three gravity couches behind her two begin to 
               fill with blue gel

               and one begins to fill with blood the hint of dark 
               shapes moving within

               starck doesnt see it concentrates on the console

               thump thump starck turns sees the bloody tank sees 
               something moving inside it

               she slowly crosses to the tank peers at it

               a corridor beneath the gravity couch bay cooper searches 
               through circuit panels until he finds the emergency beacon 
               breaker he runs a bypass activating it manually the lights 
               begins to strobe

               drip drip a bloodstain spreads over his shoulder he follows 
               the drip to the ceiling

               as starck crashes down bloody but alive

               weir appears at the top of the ladder crawling down headfirst 
               like a spider

               starck gets to her feet staggers away

               he arms the explosives watches the red lights on the

                         me and you did nothing you stood 
                         there and watched me burn

                                     miller
                         shut up shut up

               the burning man yells and raises his arm in accusation

               and fire races out from behind him flowing over the walls 
               the ceiling the floor racing for miller like a rising 
               tide

               int event horizon  main access corridor  by first 
               containment

               miller runs dead ahead the first containment

               int event horizon  first containment

               miller runs fast the fire is faster flooding in behind 
               him

               miller dashes for the second seal as it begins to close the 
               fire gains on him surrounding him

               miller dives through the second seal

               int event horizon  second containment

               barely makes it

               slams into the engineering console miller looks back at 
               the second seal its still open by a fraction when the fire 
               hits it

               sending a lance of flame stabbing out towards miller he 
               rolls aside as the fire hits the console the console 
               explodes

               the second seal shuts tight cutting the fire off the paint 
               on the second seal begins to bubble and scorch and then 
               cools as the fire subsides

               miller gets to his feet almost allows himself to relax 
               then he sees his shadow before him dancing in the growing 
               red light he turns

               int event horizon  second containment

               the second containment is a holocaust fire swarms over the 
               walls burning jelly drips from control spikes the core 
               itself is a blazing orb the gyroscope that holds it glows 
               redhot

               miller stares at the blazing core

                         dont leave me

               miller turns the burning man stands right beside him

               he smashes miller with a backhand that ignites millers 
               clothes and sends him flying the detonator falls from 
               millers grasp lost beneath two feet of coolant miller 
               comes up choking and spluttering

               the burning man stalks towards miller the coolant steams 
               and sizzles at his feet

               miller stares at the burning man as he approaches slowly 
               rises to his feet

                                     miller
                         youre not edmund corrick

               the burning mans flames wane revealing weirs misshapen 
               form

               miller throws a wicked right weir catches millers fist 
               squeezes until blood wells up between his fingers then slings 
               miller against a cooling tank with bone cracking force miller 
               collapses into the slime barely able to raise his head to 
               breathe

               weir slowly approaches

                                     miller
                         what are you

               weirs hands reach down and he grabs miller by the skull 
               miller gasps as he sees

               miller stares deadon into weirs hellish face

               and raises his right hand hes holding the detonator
