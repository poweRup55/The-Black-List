     disjointed calliope music as the wheel of fate and
     fortune goes around until we pull back to reveal

     loses his grip on the unicorn  archer reaches over and
     pulls him into his lap  they happily ride together

     as the horses sweep back into view exposing archer

     now we see the sniper  castor troy is cool efficient
     aggressive sexual  his finger closes around the
     trigger

     boom  a bullet rips into archers back  bleeding he
     drops off his horse and sinks to the deck of the
     carousel  his eyes desperately searching searching
     searching until he sees 

     matthew lies on his back  still  slowly archer
     reaches out and takes matthews hand and now we see

     fbi briefing room

     gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below
     is jon archer older unshaven fatigued his
     eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession


     carousel horse

     sweeps by as if marking time itself


     holy place

     smoky spiritual dominated by a gleaming golden
     cross  a priest kneels before it  deep in prayer  the
     glimmering cross comes into focus but its just a
     lightreflection off the casing of a large bomb  this
     is no chapel but an atrium  somewhere

     and as the priest rubs out his cigarette we see its
     castor troy  carefully installing this complex device


     another carousel horse

     sweeps by


     archer

     pockets his fbi badge then holsters his gun


     castor

     sets the bomb timer  then replaces a wall panel in
     front of it  totally hidden


     briefing room  castors mugshot

               slipped the net by now

               hes here  and were going to
               keep looking until we find him

     a silence descends on the chastised team  as they go
     back to work veteran agent tito biondi takes archer
     aside

                             tito
               jon these people have been
               working round the clock  you
               gotta cut them some slack

     archer considers his best friends advice  then

                             archer
               ill cut them some slack when i
               cut myself some slack

     archer marches out  slamming the door behind him


     int corridor  day morning

     castor quietly shuts the security door behind him  an
     hispanic voice startles him

                             janitor
               what are you doing

                             castor
                      in perfect spanish
               thank goodness i feel like icarus
               in the labyrinth  wheres the
               mens room

                             janitor
                      in spanish
               this area is off limits padre
                      re  security door
               how did you get in that room

     realizing the janitor is already too suspicious castor
     puts a priestly arm around him  and leads him down the
     hall

                             castor
               okay i have a confession to
               make but you arent gonna like
               it  i was planting a bomb

                             janitor
               bomb

                             castor
               you know  boom 
                      patting his
                       neck
               oh never mind

     the janitor suddenly twitches his eyes rolls up in his
     head  as he gasps his last  castor heaves him down a
     stairwell  now we see the needlethin custom stiletto in
     castors hand

     castor kicks the janitors mop and bucket down the stairs
      making everything look like an accident


     int same building  main floor  day morning

     the childrens church choir  200 strong  sing behold
     the lamb of god  clergy and lay persons listen
     reverently

     father castor strolls by the singers  casually
     heading for the exit  as he passes the risers a teenage
     girl drops her sheet music at his feet

     returning it  he whispers in her ear  so close hes
     practically licking it

                             castor
               ive never enjoyed the messiah
               but your voice makes even a hack
               like handel seem like a genius

     he pats her behind and leaves  although a little shaken
     shes also drawn by castors sexual magnetism


     ext la convention center  day morning

     the marquee proclaims  international church choirs 18th
     21st  american bar association

     castor exits  politely holding the door for a beat cop


     int archers office  day morning

     the office is a monument to obsession  photographs
     clues newsclips totems of castor troy surround a pacing
     archer

                             archer
                      on phone

               and i promise  as soon as this
               is over  you can brand my butt
               with the fourth amendment

     the instant archer hangs up  the intercom buzzes

               tell her to hang on 

     as archer punches up line two  tito bursts in

                             tito

               our people on that plane

                             tito
               but theres still no sign of
               castor

                             archer
               where one brother goes the
               others sure to follow

     they rush our the hold button on line 1 still
     blinking


     ext private airport  establishing  day

     a sleek cadillac pulls in stopping next to a land
     rover

     lars mueller  a muscular crystaleyed jarhead  gets
     out of the caddy  an instant later  lunt mueller 
     emerges from the rover  they are identical twins

     the men scan the airport carefully then open the rear
     doors of their respective vehicles  castor emerges from
     the caddy  armani clad

     exiting the rover is castors younger brother pollux troy
      skittish brilliant paranoid  a human hummingbird

                             pollux

     the twins nod then take off  castor heads for the
     jet


     int jet  day

     castor hustles in  exhorting the pilot

                             castor
               lets go lets go

     as the jet turbines start to whine castor sinks into his
     seat  a very sexy flight attendant appears and hands him
     a scotch  he downs it looking her over salaciously

                             flight attendant
               would you like anything else

                             castor
               hell yes
                      pulls her into lap
               its the only way to fly

     she smiles not minding until the jet suddenly slows its
     taxi down the runway


     cockpit

     castor yanks open the door

                             castor
               whats wrong


     at end of runway

     a squat car creeps into view  blocking the runway


     extint humvee  moving  day

     behind the wheel is jon archer  beside him is tito


     back to archer

                             castor
               itsarcher
                      gun to pilots
                       head
               go dammit

     suddenly the gun is blasted from castors hand  he turns
     around to see the flight attendant behind them 
     holding a smoking pistol  this is agent winters

                             winters
               fbi  throttle down captain

     but castor elbows the throttle up  the jet lurches
     forward throwing winters off balance  pollux tackles
     her as the jet picks up speed


     int humvee  day

     archer slams the vehicle into gear

                             archer
               get out

                             tito
               youre not playing chicken with
               two tons of aluminum

                             archer
               get out

     tito obeys as archer peels out  the hummer roars at the
     jet

     the jet picks up speed trying to get aloft

     the humvee is aimed right at it archers eyes narrow


     collision course

     as two hunks of metal bear down  the machines are
     seconds apart when 

     archer looks up to see

     winters face pressed up against the cockpit window
     castor holding a gun to her head

     archer cuts the wheel  just avoiding the jet  the
     hummer skids to a stop as federal backup arrives  but 
     too late  archer watches an fbi chopper  landing in a 
     swirl of dust

     as the jet picks up speed the hatch opens  castor
     blasts winters in the side and tosses her onto the
     tarmac


     inside

     castor smiles at pollux sensing freedom until

     kachunk  something pounds the jet  from above
     castor leans out the hatch and sees

     the chopper on top of them  archer at the controls

     eyecontact  years of hatred pass between these men

     castor blasts at him from the open hatch

     the choppers left windscreen spiderwebs  archer jerks
     and weaves  dodging the bullets  the chopper pulls
     away

     the jet finally lifts off when

     the chopper settles on the jet  slamming at its tail


     tarmac

     tito reacts to this madness  as the chopper plays a 
     deadly game of leapfrog with the jet

     the end of the runway is coming up fast

     archer crushes the jets horizontal elevator flap


     jet pilot

     cant budge the jets jammed yoke  thwarted he powers
     back the throttle  thrust reverse

                             castor
               what are you doing

                             pilot
               the horizontal elevators smashed
               we cant lift off


     castor

     shoots the pilot  then takes the controls  he
     struggles to maneuver the jet  suddenly

     a biplane descends right at them  about to land


     archer

     pulls up just as the jet swerves radically to avoid the
     biplane and slams into the hangar


     jet

     plows through the glass door the nosewheel snaps off
     the plane skids right into the hangar  finally stopping
     at the wings


     fbi chopper

     lands  archer steps out calmly  like a cop about to 
     write a traffic ticket  he hurries to join more fbi 
     agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him


     int hangar  day

     the jet hatch pops open  castor leaps from it firing

     two fbi agents drop  riddled

     pollux appears at the hatch  an fbi sharpshooter fires
     grazing polluxs shoulder  staggered pollux falls 

     castor catches him before he hits the floor 
     simultaneously blasting the sharpshooter

     castor drags pollux back into the smokefilled hangar

     archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents his
     anger building  he signals tito and the others to spread
     out


     deep in hangar

     a maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery  led by
     archer the fbi agents pick their way through it

     rookie loomis snaps alert  did he see something
     advancing carefully he comes up on

     castor  staunching polluxs shoulder wound  pollux
     sees the agent  and fires

     loomis hits the floor  his bleeding ear is shredded

     suddenly a forklift charges down on castor and pollux

     tito is at the wheel  castor fires  forcing tito to
     dive off  the forklift careens on  driving apart the
     brothers

     the forklift upends a stack of heavy crates  pinning
     pollux  castor tries to free his trapped brother

                             pollux
               forget it  gogo

     he slaps his glock into polluxs hand

                             castor
               wherever they put you ill find a
               way to get you out

     pollux starts firing  covering castor as he runs
     through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar

     suddenly wanda presses her machinepistol into polluxs
     head  as pollux raises his gun  tito grabs his hand

                             tito
                not unless you want that 200
               iq splattered all over the
               floor
                      as archer
                       approaches
               we got him now jon

                             archer
               thats what you always say  seal
               it off  im going in

     archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel

     music as archer and castor begin their catandmouse
     dance

     sensing archer castor pauses by an old landing gear  he
     draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on

     archer pauses at the landing gear his own stealthy
     movements mirroring castors

     castor waits behind a stack of steel drums his gaze
     trying to penetrate the darkness he snaps his fingers
     the sound echoes as he tries to draw archer in

     archer reacts to the sound and snaps back  answering
     the challenge  as the deadly beat between them
     continues 

     blam blam blam  archer spins away just as castor opens
     fire from the gloom one step ahead

     intercut as necessary

                             castor
               jon im getting a little annoyed
               by your obsessive need to spoil my
               fun

                             archer
               and how much will your fun net
               you this time

     boom boom boom  halfblind shots send castor spinning
     a moment later archer pursues snap  he fits a new
     clip into his pistol

                             castor
               whats it to you  i declare it
               here i am back in the states for
               less than a week 

                             archer
               youre under arrest  incredibly
               you still have the right to remain
               silent 

                             castor
               ive got something going down on

               to walk

                             archer
               no discussion  no deals

                             castor

               her name janie

     enraged archer steps boldly forward  trying to draw
     his enemy out  silence  then archer senses

     castor is behind him  he fires  archer dives away
     the barrage continues  driving archer back between two
     huge turbine engines  as archer reloads he stares at

     top  brandishing it  he stalks the startled thug


     hallway just outside  continuous action

     lazarro blanches as an obsessed archer repeatedly slams
     the table leg against the wall  above dietrichs head

                             lazarro

     a little boy on her lap  she gently helps him crayola a
     book  this is sasha hassler 30 and her son adam 5


     int interrogation booth  day

     archer hovers over sasha  her maternal warmth replaced
     by an icy hatred  tito and the child are gone

                             archer
               when was the last time you saw
               castor troy

               foster home

     sashas eyes flash her body coils  but she keeps

               when was the last time you saw
               castor troy

     body  although on life support  his signature smirk
     remains

                             archer
               what about lazarro

                             brodie

               take a month  this is a blackbag
               operation  completely off the

               you cant tell anyone  not the

     truth with her  but he cant  instead

     fury erupting eve pushes archer out of the bed


     int another bedroom  night

     archer enters a childs room  neat and tidy like a 
     museum exhibit  a starfield of glowletters twinkles
     faintly

     he lies down on the bed and toys with his wedding band 
     staring up at the words the stars form matthew

                                                dissolve to


     int convention center  machine room  blinking
     lights  night

     the blinking led of the bomb timer continues to count
     down


     intext 56 buickmountain road  moving  day

     tito drives into the hoag compound

     archers beside him juggling castors dossier
     documents photos etc

                             tito
               jon this is goddam insane  you
               cant do it

     archer says nothing its too late for debate  tito
     parks  the men get out and head for the lab

                             tito
               you havent got a chance in hell
               of fooling pollux  castor drinks
               smokes and walks around with a 24
               hour hardon  hes nothing like
               you 

                             archer
               dont worry if hoag can do half
               what he claims ill get pollux to
               talk

     archer reaches for the door  tito stops him

                             tito
               its not that simple jon
               becoming another person 
               especiallyhim nobody can come
               all the way back from that not
               even you

     archer considers his friends words he toys with then
     removes his wedding bang

                             archer
               keep this for me

     as tito takes the ring  a caring but concerned look
     passes between the two friends


     int surgical bay  day

     two huge video screens are dominated by the cgimages of
     archer and castor  as hoag briefs the team the cg
     images glow to reflect the physical characteristic hoag
     refers to

                             hoag
               lets walk through it jon  your
               blood types are different but we
               cant do anything about that
               otherwise nature is cooperating
               nicely  the height difference is
               negligible  within 12 an inch
               eye color  almost a perfect
               match  penis size flaccid
               essentially the same 
               substantial

     from the observation booth above  miller flanked by
     tito and brodie raises his eyebrow

     on the video screens the images morph to signify the
     physical augmentations

                             hoag
               hairline will be adjusted with
               lasershears microplugs for
               the body hair the teeth will be
               bonded to match castors

     hoag eyes castors inert tight body  then turns to
     archer  prodding his love handles like a livestock
     inspector

                             hoag
               how about an abdominoplasty

                             archer
               abdomino  what

                             hoag
               a tummy tuck  on the house

                             archer
               do it


     transformation montage

     intercut huge video screen enlargements of archer and
     castors body parts as necessary

     globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off archers 
     obliques  at the same time

     hoag recreates the great sphinx tattoo on archers
     thigh  we push in on his leg then pull back to
     reveal

     archer and tito  the close up on his leg becomes a full
     shot as he walks across the rooftop  like himself
     tito demonstrated the proper castor gait dangerously
     casual like a panther

     hoag reproduces castors fingerprints then layers them
     over archers fingers

     archer practices castors icy killer glare  tito hands
     him a lit cigarette  archer brings the cigarette to his
     lips  then coughs harshly  but he keeps trying

     castor smiles then smirks and laughs  pull back to
     reveal archer studying surveillance footage of castor on
     a monitorscreen  mimicking him

     archer fusses with his new hair trying to cover the thin
     spots  giving  up he zips up his sweatshirt  getting
     the zipper caught in his new chest hair


     ext hoag institute  grounds  day

     tito tosses a pistol  archer catches it with his right
     hand  but to archers surprise tito frowns

                             tito
               nice catch  but you used the
               wrong hand

     he takes the pistol away  and slaps it in archers left
     hand  then tito shoves him  challengingly

                             tito
               shoot me
                      as archer
                       doesnt move
               shoot me

     tito pulls the gun against his own forehead

                             tito
               you want to be castor troy  if
               you hesitate for abreath youre
               finished  now  shoot me  kill
               me

     archer holds the gun unsteadily  tito is disgusted

                             tito
               you cant do it because castor
               is tougher than you

     boom  the gun goes off  the slug tears past titos
     head  shocked he touches his left ear making sure its
     still there

     then tito looks at archer  and sees the determination


     ext hoags facility  night

     clear and calm  gods night  someones god anyway


     int icu room  night

     hoag leads archer to a fulllength mirror

                             hoag
               lets see if i missed anything
               before i get my hands really dirty

     archer removes the robe  hes amazed to see

     his own head on castors body  a flat stomach hairy
     chest tattoos thinning hair etc  hoag touches
     archers scar

                             hoag
               you realize this has to be
               removed
                      as archer
                       slowly nods
               then here we go commanderthrough the looking glass


     int surgical bay  night

     unconscious archer is wheeled into the surgical bay 
     castor beside him  hoag turns to the video technician

                             hoag
               make sure you get everything 
               ill need to study the tape before
               the reverse surgery

     hoag lowers an aerated plexiglas mask over archers face
     interwoven with integrated laser circuitry  this derma
     inductiondevice did attaches via suction

     hoag sights through the optical memory squeezes the
     trigger  a cobalt beam cuts around the face  cleanly
     slicing it  then hoag lifts archers face  off of his
     skull

     brodie and miller watch from above  tito stumbles into
     the nearby bathroom to throw up

     hoag inspects archers face then turns to his nurse

                             hoag
               vault it

     hoag turns to perform the same procedure on castor

     castors consistent eeg reading suddenly spikes
     radically  for a moment it almost seems to stabilize
     hoag glances over  too late  the spikes have 
     disappeared

     but the camera closes in on castors ear  and we sense
     that somehow his auditory nerves might be functioning

                                                dissolve to


     int recovery room  day

     a head swathed in gauze  the bandages start to fall 
     away

     tito miller and brodie wait as hoag removes the gauze
     the patient looks into a mirror

     jon archer has become castor troy

     he touches his new face  archer stares the cold
     reality chilling his blood

     archer buckles  unprepared emotionally for what hes
     done to himself  for a moment he seems to teeter on
     madness

                             tito
               jon  are you all right

     archer cant respond hes somewhere the others cant
     comprehend  finally he emerges shaken but in
     control

     tito enters  instinctively he grabs for his holster

                             archer
               okay im okay
                      realizes
               but my voice i still sound like
               me

                             hoag
               i implanted a microchip onto your
               larynx

     hoag switches on an audio tape  archer repeats castors
     words as hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box

       it etc                   it etc

     after a few repetitions archers voice matches
     perfectly

     archer yawns squints and furrows his brow  testing 
     every muscle  he stares into the mirror  into the eyes
     of his most hated enemy  now his eyes  archer slowly 
     turns to

     castor  motionless swathed dead to the world  but
     something about castors smile  that mocking smile

                             archer
               now what

               call lazarro  castor troy just
               came out of his coma


     ext fbi heliport  day

     armed agents take their positions around a helipad  a 
     jetblack helicopter drops from the sky like an angry 
     wasp


     ext helipad  day

     as lazarro watches  tito escorts out a heavilymanacled 
     castor  two armed agents leap from the chopper and 
     take charge of castor  he follows them pliantly
     until 

                             tito
               watch this hardcase  hell bite
               your nuts off if he gets the
               chance

     archer gets the message  he starts to resist the agents 
     and must be muscled into the chopper  hes manacled 
     down

     eye contact between archer and tito  both aware of this 
     very real point of departure  the chopper door slams
     shut  it lifts off like a twister and screams away


     ext heliport  staging area  day

     the watching team breaks up wanders back to work

                             loomis
               what a week for archer to go on a
               training op  maybe we should try
               to contact him

                             wanda
               forget it  hes kneedeep in
               georgia swamp by now

     they pass brodie and miller who watch the chopper 
     disappear over the horizon  so far so good     


     int chopper  flying  day

     the agent rechecks archers chains

                             archer
               dont forget  i ordered a kosher
               meal

     the agent smashes his elbow into archers gut  the 
     second agent presses an injector against archers leg
     psssst  archer spasms against the drug  then sags
     unconscious


     int erewhon prison  delousing cubicle

     archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him

     a guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate

     archer lies gasping on the steel floor protecting his
     face  the spray stops  when head guard red walton
     enters

                             walton
               you are now an erewhon inmate  a
               citizen of nowhere  human rights
               zealots the geneva convention and
               the pc police have no authority
               here  you have no right

               when i say your ass belongs to me
                i mean it  bend over

     archers face reflects the degradation as he bends over
     and exposes all to the cavitysearching guard

     satisfied walton lets archer dress  another guard
     places a pair of oddlooking steel boots before archer

                             walton
               step into them

     archer inspects the lockdown boots  hinged steel
     collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle  the
     soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts

                             walton
               dont sniff em you perv  just
               step into them

     archer obeys  a guard squats down and locks the steel
     collars over archers shoes  he tries to move  but
     cant

                             archer
               theyre too tight

                             walton
               sos a noose  now keep your mouthshut

     walton jolts archer with his highvoltage shockstick

                             walton
               the prisons one big magnetic
               field  the bootsll tell us where

               day
                      into commlink
               201 to population

     walton presses his thumb into a standard fbi scanpad
     it forms a print  positively identifying the guard
     the heavy blastdoor automatically opens

                             walton
               ive got fifty bucks says youre
               dead by dinner  dont disappoint
               me

     walton prods archer toward the door  to archers
     surprise  he can now move


     int general population  day

     the inmates eat  silence descends as archer enters 
     intensifying the constant humming of the magnetic field
     huge dubov does a slow burn on seeing castor

     scanning the room for pollux  archer takes a seat next
     to a little goateed man with a french accent

                             little man
               hey castor  remember me

                             archer
               fabrice voisine sure i 
                      catches himself
                i believe jon archer busted you
               for poisoning five members of the
               the canadian parliament

                             voisine little man
               those scumbags should never have
               voted against the quebecois
                      a beat
               we heard you got wasted

     archer sees the other inmates sizing him up

                             archer
               do i look wasted  asshole

     voisine shakes his head no  then his eyes widen as

     wham  dubov leaps onto archer and starts pummeling him
     they slide across the table  spilling everyones lunch

                             guard
                      into communit
               central  i have a disturbance in
               population  go to lock down 

                             walton
                      into communit
               hold that lock down

     walton watches as dubov throws archer across the room
     archer staggers to his feet  and sees the encircling
     inmates and guards looking at him  unimpressed

     especially his brother pollux  who watches
     uncertainly

     dubov attacks again  but archer is ready  he grabs
     dubovs fist  just before it hits his face

                             archer
               never  in  the  face

     holding dubovs fist firmly archer kicks dubov
     repeatedly in the groin  metal boot meeting soft flesh

     dubov staggers back  hurt  archer moves in for the
     kill savoring it

     walton looks skyward

                             walton
               lock em down

     intercut with


     up above  central security

     the prisons nerve center  with videofeeds and
     monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a
     minimum

     the two deputies react to waltons call  identifying
     archer and dubovs signatureblips  they throw the
     appropriate switches and

     zap  the magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor  
     dubov flails hopelessly  but archers just out of 
     reach

     crack  walton punches archer in the diaphragm

                             archer
               what  he started it

     walton smashes archer harder  he hits the floor

                             archer
               when i get out of here 

                             walton
               youll what

                             archer
               im going to have you fired

     his statement is so ludicrous walton laughs  everyone 
     does  from the inmates reactions archer knows hes 
     been accepted

                             walton
                      to dubov
               thats two strikes dubov  one
               more and you know where youre
               going
                      to the others
               back to your suites  or no
               dinner

     as archer drops into the line of cons  he spots pollux
     waiting for him  girding himself for this first 
     encounter  hes got a plan

                             pollux
               hey bro

                             archer
                pollux

                             pollux
               of course its pollux what the
               fucks wrong with you

     archer stares  feigning confusion until walton prods 
     him forward  pollux watches his brother go  very 
     concerned


     int archers cell  night

     archer lies on his cot  staring at the ceiling  
     isolated lonely he realizes how easy it would be to go 
     insane here


     ext hoag institute  night

     an insanely starry night  van goghs night  the night 
     he cut off his ear anyway


     int surgical bay  night

     castors body lies inert  his lifesupport machines
     blipping away  until the eeg spikes  once  twice  
     three times  brain wave activity increases  and 
     stabilizes

     castors fingers twitch  then his fist clenches  hard  
     castors head is swathed in gauze  but his eyes pop 
     open

     reflexively castor wrenches from the bed  tearing out 
     the tubes and wires that tether him to life support  he 
     goes down  in agony  groaning

     he struggles to his feet  staggering through the lab 
     until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in
     the window  he quickly unwraps the gauze

     the discarded bandages fall at his feet we dont see
     what castor sees  but we hear him moan then choke
     then scream  the only moment castor ever loses his
     cool

     finally composing himself  castors hand grips the
     phone and he dials

                             castor
               lars okaylunt then
                      rifling desk
                       documents
               something really fuckedup
               happened im in trouble so
               listen very carefully


     ext hoag institute  night later

     a range rover screeches up  at gunpoint lars and lunt 
     manhandle hoag into the lab


     int surgical bay  night

     lars and lunt hustle hoag in  the lab is on  the 
     screens run  scrolling through the video log of 
     archers surgery

     hoag sees his terrified assistants  bound with duct
     tape

                             hoag
               whats this about  what do you
               want

     lars shoves hoag into a towering figure we zoom in on
     hoags glasses  and through the reflection we see


     man without face

     hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle cartilage and
     bone  the man lifts a cigarette to his lips then 
     exhales

                             castor
               what do you think i want


     int prison  population  day

     a huge wallscreen plays gentle nature scenes  below 
     the inmates engage in their exercise hour

     voisine stares at the screen  while pollux carefully 
     watches his brother play basketball  archer tosses up 
     an airball to the jeers of other inmates

                             pollux
               you realize of course that
               magnetic humming is designed to
               drive us insane  if we all dont
               get brain tumors first

                              voisine
               and that same cloyingbambitape
                over and over

                              pollux
               its like theyrebeggingus to
               riot  where the fuck are we
               anyway
                      the game ends
               gotta go

     pollux trots over to archer  passes him his cigarette
     he studies archer as he takes a drag  and nearly gags

                             pollux
                im worried about you

                             archer
               why

                             pollux
               your jumpshot has no arc  you
               used to swagger now you swish
               youre gumming that butt like a
               catholic school girl
                      notices
               and why do you keep picking at
               your finger

     pollux has caught archer reflexively tugging at his
     phantom wedding ring  archer immediately stops  he
     takes a drag and holds it  then exhales right in
     polluxs face

                             archer
               i was in a coma

     pollux sticks his finger under archers eye and pulls 
     down like a vet examining a sick dog  archer pushes him 
     off

                             archer
               my reflexes my senses my
               memory everythings jumbled  i
               cant even tell you why dubov
               jumped me yesterday

                             pollux
               you pollinated his wife the day he
               was arrested  how could forget
               that

                             archer
               ive forgotten plenty  look
               around  weve screwed over half
               the freaks in here  whats gonna
               happen to us if they think ive
               lost it

     pollux contemplates the other inmates  circling sizing
     up the brothers like hungry sharks  instinctively
     pollux moves closer to archer for protection

                             archer
               i need you to play big brother for
               once  till i can fill in a few
               blanks  think you can handle
               that

     pollux nods grimly  then archer pulls up his sleeve
     exposing the pyramid tattoo

                             archer
               i know i got this on my tenth
               birthday  i just cant remember
               why

                             pollux
               man  that was the worst day of
               our lives

     archer feigns a struggle with his memory  he lights a
     new butt with the old  chainstyle then remembers

                             archer
               oh god  mom odd at county
               general

                             pollux
               retching and convulsing while
               those bastards didnt even try to
               save her sorry ass  you gave her
               mouth to mouth  man  even then
               you had some constitution
                      a beat
               remember what you swore to me at
               the funeral

                             archer
               uh  to kill the doctors

                             pollux
               after that  you promised youd
               always take care of me

                             archer
               and i bet i kept that promise

                             pollux
               only one youve never broken

     pollux curls into archer  in need of comfort  archer
     puts an affectionate arm around pollux  springing the
     trap

                             archer
               screw the past  weve got the
               future to look forward to
                      a beat
               we still have tomorrow

                             pollux
               no shit five million bucks
               now those red militia crackpots
               get to keep it

                             archer
               thats not the worst part

                             pollux
               whats worse than losing five
               million bucks

                             archer
               being stuck in this rathole when
               it blows  what you built was a
               work of art  it belongs in the
               smithsonian

     pollux beams with pride  archer hangs on every word

                             pollux
               yeah  well the la
               convention center will have to
               do

                             archer
               thanks pollux

                             pollux
               thanks  i guess they really did
               fuck you up

     then archer smiles  like jon archer  without knowing
     exactly why  a wave of illease overtakes pollux


     int archers cell  day

     archer paces impatiently as the door rolls open
     walton is looking at him with cool respect

                             walton
               you have a visitor

     archer smiles to himself  pleased at brodies
     timeliness


     int interrogation room  day

     archers boots lock down  as the guillotine door rises
     but his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror  
     because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of 

     jon archer  this man has archers face  his real face

                             impostor
               whats the matter  dont you like
               the new me

               was titanically remote  who
               knows  maybe the trauma of having
               my face cut off pulled me out  or
               maybe god really is onmyside

     limbs are stiff his eyes blank as a mako sharks  but 
     his feet are bare  bootless

               wheres the mop he puked all over
               the place

     an assistant unstraps dubov and drops him on a gurney

                             medtech
                      mopping up
                next time bring them inbeforedinner

     archer cases the place  above is a catwalk leading
     out


     back to scene

     walton muscles archer into the gurney  the medtech 
     smirks

                             medtech
               oh happy day  castor troy

     the medtech wheels the ect headgear cart into place 
     twin needlelike bolts ready to fit into archers ears  
     a single blue static spark jumps from the bolts

     walton roughly wedges archers head into the head gear
     shoving the chewedup bite strap into archers mouth

                             walton
               bite hard scumbag cause youll
               be gumming baby food from here on

     walton unlocks archers first boot and pulls it off  as
     the medtech starts to fasten archers arm  walton 
     unlocks and pulls off the second boot

     archers feet are free  crack  he yanks his foot up 
     hard  walton reels back stunned

     one arm still restrained archer backrolls in the gurney 
     and kicks the headgear cart away  knocking it into the 
     medtech who collapses onto it hitting test 

     zap  the headbolts fire catching the medtech through 
     the shoulder  he drops to the floor his synapses shot

     seeing that archer is still restrained by the arm  the
     assistant darts out of the room

     as archer pulls free  walton looms over him  gun
     poised

     then  wham  dubov wallops walton  using his boots as
     brass knuckles  the head guard collapses

     dubov smiles dumbly at archer  all trace of vendetta
     now obliterated  archer nods gratefully  theyre on
     the same team at least for now

     suddenly the alarm blares

     archer sees guards charging the room  he tries closing
     the door  but the guards arrive  dubov lumbers over
     and puts his massive weight into it  and slams the door
     shut

     os guards pound at the nowlocked door

     archer quickly frisks walton  coming up with a
     cigarette lighter  he pockets it

     scanning around  archer leaps onto a mounted hinged
     lamp  it swings against the wall  archer uses it to
     reach the catwalk above

                             archer
               dubov  come on

     dubov obeys and follows archer up onto the catwalk

     a groggy walton muscles open the door from inside  
     guards pour in  walton grabs an autorifle and opens 
     fire

     slugs chase archer and dubov as they flee through the
     catwalk door


     int central security control

     two guards watch archer and dubov disappear off the
     clinics monitor  they grab their shocksticks and rush
     for the door

     the door opens  revealing dubov and archer  perfectly
     in synch  they double coldcock the startled guards
     archer grabs a shockstick  and fuses the door shut

     he yanks out wires and shatters the computers  dubov
     mimics the behavior  ripping out an entire console 
     and revealing a narrow cable duct

     flames explode  shorting the circuitry  the droning
     hum rises  the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous
     surge


     around prison

     chaos  guards scatter as the huge diamondvision screen
     explodes and inmates are flung like ragdolls by their
     shortcircuiting boots  anything metallic flies into the
     magnetic domes


     security central

     as the men back through the cable duct  archer
     struggles to replace the heavy console

     the door is blown open  walton enters to find no one
     then his eyes light on the console  slightly askew


     int cable corridor

     archer and dubov rush down the tight corridor  and
     around the bend  the corridor ends in a


     storagemaintenance area

     lined with tools toilets sinks a rack of old lockdown
     boots  they race through the far door


     int central tower room

     archer and dubov find themselves in a multilevel
     labyrinth  a hundred feet high  crisscrossed with
     catwalks staircases and high walls

     echoes resound  shouting footsteps getting closer 
     they seem to be coming from all around them

     over the magnetic hum  archer notices loose screws and
     other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall  he pulls one
     screw away  and lets it fly back into the polarized
     wall

     archer gets an idea  and looks back the way they came  

                                                smash cut


     sheer wall

     archer and dubov scale the face  using the old metal
     boots  they climb higher and higher as

     guards crisscross the catwalks and staircases below and
     around them  oblivious

     archer and dubov almost reach the next level when

                             walton
               there

     bullets smack the wall around them  just as archer and
     dubov reach the next catwalk

     archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far
     end  but four guards descend on them  and block their
     way

     fist fight as archer and dubov take on the attacking
     guards  archer heaves one down the stairs  into more
     guards  dubov drops another over the catwalk

     they continue their desperate race for the door 
     reaching the landing  as bullets ping around them 
     hulking dubov rips away a floor panel  he uses it as a
     shield as archer sparks up waltons lighter

     as slugs explode into the shield  archer places the
     flame to his thumb and peels off the skin mold

     he presses his thumb to the doors keypad  to his 
     horror its led reads print unreadable

     walton and guards movie in firing at closer and closer
     range

     dubov staggers under the fusillade of bullets  the
     shield is repeatedly punctured  and is quickly
     disintegrating

     archer licks his thumb tries again  finally it reads
     clearance confirmed the door slides open

                             archer
               lets go

     dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards  but
     as he turns to follow walton blows him away

     archer reaches to pull dubov through but the riddled
     inmate ignores the helping hand  pulling the door shut
     he collapses in front of it  blocking it momentarily


     int high catwalk tower

     archer hesitates for a moment but thats all he has
     he keeps going up the winding staircasecatwalk 
     higher and higher  a step ahead of the onrushing
     guards

     as bullets clang around him  archer reaches the top
     he ignores a sign which reads

                        emergency exit only
                       safety lines required

     he charges straight up a ladder and plows right
     through 

                                                smash cut

     ext prison  dawn

     archers blinded  its daytime in the real world

     a sea gull flies across his face  as we follow the
     bird

     pull way way back to reveal

     the prisons in the middle of the goddamn ocean in what
     appears to be just an abandoned rusty oil rig platform  

     archer rushes over to a transport chopper


     inside cockpit

     archer searches for the keys  no go  he throws
     switches  nothing works

     guards pour out of the hatch  firing  archer leaps
     from the chopper and jumps over the side to the
     platforms 


     lower level

     he lands hard on the slanted corrugated shed roof and
     rolls to the ground  he grabs a highpressure hose 
     and cranks the pressure valve  as the pursuing guards
     close in

     archer blasts the guards with the water cannon 
     knocking walton and others into the sea  archer upends a
     stack of oil barrels  which roll into more guards
     archer spots


     tugboat

     pulling a zodiac dinghy  heading out to sea

     archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail 
     where the end of a cranes hook is tagged back  under
     fire  archer frees the hook which swings away from the
     platform

     hanging on to the hook it swings him out over the ocean
     at the apex  le lets go and plummets down into


     choppy sea

     he pulls himself into the zodiac and frees it from the
     tug  it roars off


     ext zodiac  moving  day

     the nylon craft zips through the waves  approaching san
     pedro harbor  the engine sputters low on gas

                             archer
               come on come on

     archer senses something he looks up and

     whoosh  something swoops down  but its just a
     pelican

     he fiddles with the engine  which finally dies  archer
     grabs the oars  about to start rowing when 

     another swoop  this time its the prison chopper

     archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor  an
     idea


     wide shot

     the chopper settles over the zodiac

     wind and water swirl around archer

     walton drenched but obviously rescued has archer in his
     sights he starts to fire his machine guns

     bullets rain down on the boat  destroying it  as
     archer dives into the rolling swells


     inside chopper

     walton rakes the debris  shredding it

     the chopper does a final circle of the wreckage then
     moves off its rotor wash thrashing the buoy

     archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy  sucking

     st marysbythesea  nearby the ocean roars


     ext st marys cemetery  day

     castor follows eve up a bluff through a phalanx of 
     graves  with no idea where shes leading him

     finally she stops at a crucifixtopped headstone  castor
     joins her and reads the etched marble stone

                       beloved son  brother

     she places a few childs toys on the marker a shark
     a little bulldozer a spaceship  overwhelmed with

     whose mother is weeping into his chest

     the everpresent smirk is long gone as castor stiffly 
     returns eves embrace  maybe just maybe feeling the 
     victims pain

     she drags him onto the glass floor  cindee puts on some
     music as archers head begins to spin  the girls start
     dancing grinding archer between their taut bodies  he
     tries to avoid it but livia kisses him  hot moist

                             livia

     archers eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings

     the twisted renderings make his head spin worse as he
     starts to hallucinate surrounded by enemies  he
     struggles to regain control of his battered psyche

                             livia
               caz  are you okay

     he pulls away and stumbles down the stairs  toward the
     kitchen

                             dietrich
               when even castor troy cant handle

     wondering where archer might be hiding  but something

                             castor
               what are you  stupid

                             jamie

     with a fluid motion castor expertly snaps open a well
     oiled switchblade and hands it to an astonished jamie

     she hugs him tight  taking castor by surprise  but he
     responds momentarily  about to pat her rump  something
     makes him stop

                             castor
               go on get out of here

     jamie kisses him and heads up stairs  after shes

                             castor
               no wonder he spent all his time
               chasing me  who can deal with
               this family shit

     the phone rings  he rushes to the den and picks it up

     for the first time archer sees not a hardened felon 
     but a frightened protective mother  and he realizes the
     effect his own relentless obsession has had on her

                             archer
               i know ive done some things that
               made your life harder

               never looked back

     adam enters heading for his toys  his presence cooling
     sashas deepseated anger  archer finishes dressing

               remember  and for what its
               worth im sorry

     her harsh look softens imperceptively  like that of a
     woman trying to hate someone she still loves

                             archer
               not a bad fit

               you know mommy doesnt like you
               playing with these things

     she kicks the toy aside and lifts adam  offering him to
     archer  awkwardly archer takes the boy

     archers emotions avalanche as his grip tightens  his
     big hands dwarfing the little boys body

                             sasha
               youre not holding him right
               caz

     archer isnt hearing sasha  hes lost in his own
     memory the sound of a carousel a kids laughter
     a gunshot

     then adam smiles  perhaps the way matthew once smiled
     it pulls something up from inside archer  something 
     strong  he regains control dumping the child into 
     sashas arms

                             archer
               hes not my son

                             sasha
               yes he is  

     then something alerts archer  maybe the fleeting 
     shadows that blot out the windowlight for the barest 
     second

     as  buzz and wanda arrive on the scene and see loomiss 
     body

     int fbi  archers office  day

     alone  castor picks up the framed photo of eve and
     jamie  staring at it with unbridled hatred

     fury rising he crumples the frame  and the photo  in
     his clenching grip  he hurls it into other archer family
     memorabilia  shattering more photos and souvenirs

     only then does castor notice lazarro standing in the
     doorway  for how long  he cant be sure

                             castor
               what is it

     lazarro shuts the door behind him

                             lazarro

               me  erratic  victor what are
               you talking about

     castor casually closes the blinds between the offices

                             lazarro
               you start meeting with brodie and
               miller  then they die
               mysteriously  your best friend is
               murdered  and you dont seem to
               give a shit
               suddenly youre smoking drinking
               acting like a man with something
               to hide

               youve lost your mind  but i
               promise im going to find out

     eye to eye castor knows he cant finesse this one

                             castor

                             lazarro
                i dont understand

     castor suddenly jabs his fist into lazarros chest  he
     pleads for mercy as castor pounds and pounds away at his
     heart  until it finally seizes up

     lazarro twitches in a death throe then slumps to the
     ground

                             castor
               now you understand

     he punches up the intercom button

                             castor
               cancel my four oclock
                      beat
               and send for the paramedics
               victor lazarros having a heart
               attack

     castor fixes himself a shot of mescal  he checks his
     watch  as if counting  then kneels beside lazarros
     body

     the door flies open  and two medics rush in  they see
     castor vigorously pumping lazarros chest  applying
     cpr

     the medics gently nudge castor aside  one medic takes
     lazarros pulse then shakes his head

     cop 2 sitting at the dining room table cleaning his
     pistol  he slips upstairs  toward the sound of
     running water


     master bedroom  continuous action

     archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom  passing 
     the bed  he stops  on top of the rumpled covers  eves
     nightgown and a pair of castors black briefs

     overwhelmed he sits down  not noticing the water has
     stopped  eve steps in from the bathroom

                             archer
               eve

     the look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality
     she runs but archer grabs her  she struggles  
     fighting and kicking him  but somehow he keeps her 
     mouth covered

                             archer

     reveals nothing  sirens approach the house the cops are 
     returning  she keeps an eye on the door  playing for 
     time

                             eve
               how did he expect to do that

               the vocal implant everything
               but somehow castor came out of his
               coma  and killed everyone who
               knew about the mission  but not
               before he was transformed into me

     the back door clicks open  a voice booms out

                             cop os

     archer glances at the balcony  as footsteps clomp up 
     the stairs  eve is about to answer  or scream  but 
     then

                             archer
               remember the parachute dream  im
               falling eve im falling

     the blood drains from her face as archer slips over 
     the balcony and disappears


     int study  later

     eve is at the computer  dazed and disoriented  she
     snaps alert on hearing the front door open  castor is
     giving orders to the cops guarding the house

                             castor os
               i want you guys here aroundthe
               clock  and stay off the lawn

     eve feigns interest in her laptop as castor enters  she
     tenses as he starts massaging her back

                             castor
               youre all in knots  maybe
               another date night will help you
               relax

     he studies eve then grasps her firmly by the shoulders

                             castor
               you think ive been acting
               strange  like a completely
               different person

     castor wraps his hands around her slender neck

                i read your diary  ive been
               trying to change  trying to be
               more like the man you want me to

     eve reacts to the explanation  there is a logic to it

                             castor
               and to prove it im taking you

     archer emerges from the darkness of her office  but eve
     pulls a pistol  aiming it with calm authority

               all of you know what a deeply
               spiritual man he was  it was his

     chambers the dart twists a knob on the rangefinder and
     carefully peers over the crucifix

     archer tracks through the mourners  and finds castor
     as the crosshairs neatly cube his head


     back to scene

     weve come full circle from matthews death  with archer
     the sniper and castor the target

     castor reads the panic on eves face but says nothing

     he simply takes jamies hand intertwining his fingers in
     hers

     the honor guard steps forward shouldering their rifles

     ext boathouse yard  various shots  day

     archer emerges into the maze of drydocked boats
     silently checking his clip he discards the empty gun

     castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths
     hearing a noise behind him 

     boom  castor fires  blowing apart an underrepair
     hull  he advances toward the boat gun ready when
     archer appears behind him and follows  one step two
     steps  until 

     castor stops  then whirls as archer leaps

     the men collapse hard  castors pistol clatters across
     the yard toward the docked boat

     archer and castor brutally strangle each other  digging
     their fingers deep into their throats  they throttle
     each other so hard archers larynx vocal chip is
     dislodged

     his voice changes echoing with garbled  static

                             archer
               give up castor  people are going
               to find out

                             castor
               not if i kill you first

     they scramble for the gun  but a hand reaches out from
     the docked boat and picks it up  archer and castor stop
     dead in their tracks because 

     jamie appears holding the pistol

                             castor
               give it here jamie

                             archer

     everybody gawks  because archer and castor are now

     both speaking in archers true voice

     and nobody is more confused than jamie

                             archer
               listen to my voice jamie  im

     he grabs a shocked jamie  shoving the gun under her
     chin

     archer struggles to his feet as 

     castor  using jamie as a shield  backs out the gate
     to the garden  archer follows  cautiously

                             castor
               say goodbye to daddy 

     jamie whips out the switchblade  sinks it into castors
     thigh and twists  she dives away  firing wildly castor
     staggers back through the gate

     archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open


     castor

     limps away from the boatyard towards the slips  alive
     with sunbathers and yachters


     ext marina docks  day

     castor hustles along until he finds what hes looking
     for 

     twin cigarette boats  racing boats  being tuned up by
     their suntanned crews  he jumps into one of the boats

                             boat captain

     boat  the police boats rear smashes into archers
     craft

     archers boat plows up and through the other  explosion
     momentum carries archer across  and back into the
     water

     the boat lands right next to castors

     archer and castor resume their battering approaching
     a 


     tug

     pulling a barge

     castor forces archer into its path  at the last
     moment

     archer leaps onto the bow of castors boat as 

     kaboom  archers boat crashes into the barge which
     explodes


     castor

     swerves wildly  trying to throw archer off

     archer can only watch as castor reaches for another clip

     but the boat hits a wave

     castor loses the gun  which skids away  archer slips
     his head hanging over the side  castor tries to ram
     archer but he pulls himself up just in time

     castor grabs the anchor  swings it  whunk  it sinks
     into the deck beside archer  but the chain is around
     his neck

     as castor tries to strangle him  archer headbutts
     castor who reels  snagging his leg around the chain
     castor falls back  plunging toward the water

     archer tries to hold castor up as the boat speeds
     toward 


     pier

     archer yanks castor back onto the deck as the boat
     bounces off the pier pilings  but as they slug it out

     wham  the boat careens off a piling  and roars
     straight for the shipyard  colliding with a shoreline
     obstruction 

     the boat flips stern over bow

     archer and castor go flying onto the beach


     ext beach  day

     archer and castor lie dazed then stir  castor sees
     the pistol lying halfburied he reaches for it
     but 

     archer gets it first  he aims it at castor as they rise

                             castor
               you wont shoot me jon  im
               unarmed

                             archer

               it youre right i wont shoot

     boom  archer shoots castor in the chest  he jerks and
     reels  dropping to his knees  he looks at archer in
     total disbelief  then he sinks to the ground and lies
     still

     exhausted archer lets the empty gun drop  then he turns
     and sees an fbi chopper heading his way  relieved he
     turns back to castor but  castors body is gone

     castor is crawling toward the flipped boats spinning
     stabilizing screw  archer fires  hitting castor in the
     leg  he buckles but keeps going

     archer leaps on him  they struggle as castor tries to
     bury his face on the spinning blade

                             castor
               itll never be over jon every
               time you look in the mirror
               youll see my face

     they struggle as the propeller blade gets closer
     closer  slicing into archers cheek  at the last
     instant

     archer reaches the anchorchain  he wraps it around the
     screw  stopping the whirling blades

     castor finally sinks to the ground  and no longer
     moves

     archer takes castors hand  trying to tug off his
     wedding ring  just when he almost has it off  castor
     suddenly grabs archers wrist and holds it tight

     eye contact between the two men  castor smirks his
     grasp slackening as he finally fades away  archer
     lets castors hand drop then slides the ring on his own
     finger


     another angle

                             buzz

     with a softness and genuineness that castor troy could
     never feel could never fake

     she rushes to him  the whole family hangs on hugging
     and kissing  for the first time ever really together

               ask both of you
