	hangar several official cars filled with secret service men four
	motorcycle policemen and a caravan of three limousines complete the
	waiting entourage the chief of the secret service looks toward the
	airfield as the plane is heard taxiing in he turns and gets into one
	of the limousines followed by the others

3c	long shot  vehicles on airfield

	coming toward camera the plane looms in the fg a motorized stairway
	is on the way toward the door of the plane the vehicles come to a
	halt before the camera

3d	high angle shot  plane

	the armed soldiers leap out of the troop carriers and form a cordon
	around the plane the secret service men get out within the circle of
	guards wait for the door to open

4	ext jet door

	it opens grant steps out in middle thirties with the air of a man
	who takes nothing seriously  his coverup for involvement he turns
	to help jan benes out of the plane benes is mittel european in dress
	and manner physically he is schweitzer at forty the leonine head
	the shock of hair he carries a battered suitcase in response to
	grants gesture he precedes him down the stairs

5	on the field

	as benes reaches the last step he is greeted by the chief of the
	secret service who shakes his hand introduces him to several of his
	subordinates and leads him to a limousine their words are lost in
	the din of jets about to get into the car benes turns and moves back
	quickly to grant who is near the bottom of the stairs benes extends
	his hand they shake warmly benes moves back toward the limousine

6	grant  on platform stairs

	he watches as benes gets into the limousine and the caravan takes off
	with the motorcycle escort the soldiers are climbing back into the

8a	ext pico boulevard

	down which the cavalcade speeds

8b	ext warehouse district of studio back lot

	the cavalcade races through an area of dark warehouses

8c	ext deserted street back lot

	a rundown area the cavalcade starts down the street in the second
	floor of an otherwise dark house a light is turned on and off an
	evident signal pan down to a heavy car waiting in a narrow alley
	which opens into the street its headlights are off the sound of its
	engine completely drowned by the concerted roar of the oncoming cars
	and motorcycles as the cavalcade nears the entrance to the alley one
	of the motorcyles comes speeding up from the rear of the escort the
	car in the alleyway starts toward the entrance to the alley

915

15a	ext alleyway

	the car starts hurtling forward at full speed the front of the
	limousine is now visible a broadside impact seems inevitable

15b	ext alley

	the motorcycle from the rear reaches the limousine as the kamikaze car
	comes hurtling out like a motorized projectile it hits the motorcycle
	 a totally unexpected obstruction  and sends the policeman flying
	out of scene it is sufficient to deflect the kamikaze car from its
	deadly aim the car hits the rear of the limousine sends it spinning
	out of control the suicide car also out of control careens toward
	the opposite side of the street the limousine smashes into a
	telephone pole which brings it to a jolting stop

16	int limousine

	the impact throws benes to the side his head hits the door handle
	with stunning force almost knocking him out

17	ext street

	the kamikaze car slams directly into a brick wall it instantly bursts
	into fire engulfing the driver the fitful flames illuminate the
	otherwise dark street

18	ext limousine

	the chief of the secret service jumps out of the limousine waves to a
	sedan to pull up his shouts lost in the general turmoil other secret
	service men are helping the dazed benes out shielding him a sedan
	pulls up beside the limousine

19	int sedan

	the chief of the secret service instantly hustles benes into the rear
	as he climbs in beside him and the other secret service men rush to
	the other side to get in there is the sharp crack of a rifle shot it
	shatters the rear window of the sedan narrowly missing benes the
	chief thrusts him onto the floor sprawls on top of benes to cover
	him while shouting to the driver to get going his words
	indistinguishable in the confusion of more rifle shots which sends
	glass and bullets ricocheting through the interior of the sedan

20	ext street

	in the eerie light of the burning car the sedan can be seen speeding
	off flanked and spearheaded by motorcycle police the secret service
	men and those in the sedans are left behind firing toward the top
	floor of a nearby bullding from which the rifle fire came

21	series of impressionistic cuts through credits

	without divulging the nature of the hospital the unconscious jan
	benes is seen undergoing a fast and thorough medical probe by
	technicians and specialists using the latest equipment huge xray
	machines centrifuges whirling blood samples ekgs encephalographs
	and a variety of instruments used in cerebral examinations are
	featured after the last credit

21a	ext city street  night

	it is late a car is speeding along

21b	int car

	seated in the rear grant looks as if he has just been aroused from
	sleep and hustled into the car in a hurry he is getting into his
	shirt helped by a man beside him there is a smudge of lipstick on
	his cheek

					man

21d	int car

	the driver and the man in the rear get out as grant starts to follow

	they close their respective doors leaving grant alone in the car
	looking out mystified into the darkness

21e	ext parking area

	the two men move off together until they reach what they obviously
	know is a proscribed distance from the car then they stop and look at
	it for a moment nothing happens then the ground seemingly starts to
	sink with the car

21f	int car

	grant is startled to see the earth sliding up past the car

21g	long shot  elevator shaft

	it now becomes apparent that the car has been resting on what is
	really the top of an elevator shaft the sides of the shaft now become
	visible it is seemingly bottomless

	the officer behind the desk looks up

					officer
			your id card please

	grant takes out a card with only an embossed number the officer
	places it into an identifier we see its screen is blank after a
	moment grants picture flashes on in color in full view and profile
	the officer looks up at grant sees it is an exact likeness he then
	extracts the card the screen goes blank he hands grant the id
	card the scooter takes off speeding down a long neonlit corridor
	marked off for scooter traffic four lanes two in each direction
	numerous doors leading to offices open on both sides of the walkways
	traffic is heavy grant is the only one in mufti the scooter
	approaches doors over which lights flash

	as the scooter nears the sentry box the mp on duty hits a switch
	the steel doors slide open the scooter goes through into

	he flicks a switch on the tv screen appears the interior of duvals
	office we see duval a brain surgeon in the middle forties he has
	the manner of one totally dedicated to his work at the moment he is
	testing a ruby laser narrowing the beam down to pencillike thinness
	assisting him is cora peterson in the middle twenties her
	attractiveness is matched by her efficiency which is considerable
	they work together smoothly the result of long association it is
	evident neither know they are being observed during

					carter

	circulation system michaels is asaembling charts as if under
	pressure

					carters voice

			ive got a few things to check out

	he moves to another panell is seen throwing on switches monitoring a
	fast series of scenes all of which are indistinguishable in angle of
	shot michaels is seen bustling about collecting charts during

					michaels
			we need you for security purposes
			mr grant

					grant
			at an operation

					michaels
			they know they failed to kill benes
			security thinks theyll try again
			first chance they get were afraid

			assassination

					grant
			surgical assassination but that
			means you suspect 

					carter
				reentering scene
			line of dialogue cut off

					michaels
			i dont agree just because hes
			often difficult 

					carter
			difficult hes impossible

					michaels
			thats no reason to suspect him of
			disloyalty

					grant
			but why take the chance when there
			must be other doctors

					carter
			we have no choice duvals the most
			skillful brain surgeon in the
			country and hes right here at
			hand

					grant
			i wouldnt know if hes trying to
			save him or kill him

					carter
			no question of her loyalty

	as carter leads grant to the scooter and they take their places grant
	looks at the biginsignia on the floor

					grant
			i dont mean to be inquisitive but
			this for all i know it
			could stand for

					carter
				matteroffact

					grant
				blankly
			say that again

	carter starts the scooter and they drive through the big doors leading
	out of the medical foyer

6374

75	int corridor  traveling with scooter

					carter
			we can reduce anything down to any
			size we want people  ships 
			tanks planes

					grant
			general ive heard some wild ones
			but this takes it

					carter
			we can shrink an army  with all
			its equipment  and put it in a
			bottle cap thats why we call it

					grant
				with silent whistle
			if the other side ever gets hold of
			a thing like that

					carter
			they have
				answering look
			but weve both got the same problem
			 lack or control we can only keep
			things miniaturized for exactly
			sixty minutes arter that
			everything starts growing back to
			its original size

	they arrive at the root of the escalator leave the scooter and board
	the moving stairway

76	with escalator

	as they ride up

					grant
			i assume benes knows how to control
			it

					carter
			thats right he wanted us to have
			the secret and not them which is
			why they tried to kill him

					grant
			theyre bound to try again no
			wonder they want me to stand by
			during the operation

					carter
			and take a little trip with them

					grant
				bewildered
			trip where to

					carter
				matteroffact
			well the only way to reach that
			clot is from inside the brain so
			weve decided to put a surgical team
			and a crew into a submarine 
			reduce it way down in size and
			inject it into an artery 

					grant
				jolted
			you meangoing along

					carter
			as part of the crew

					grant
			wait a minute they cant shrink

					carter
				assuringly
			grant our miniaturizer can shrink
			anything

					grant
			but i dont want to be
			miniaturized  

					carter
			its only for an hour 

					grant
			not even for a minute general
			carter sir id like you to
			reconsider your choice im just not
			the right man for a mission of this
			kind

	he starts walking against the direction of the escalator thus
	remaining in the same place

					carter
				taking his arm
			come on grant youre going to a
			briefing

	they have reached the top of the escalator nearby is a door markedcarter opens the door waves him in

77	int conference room

	grant and carter enter in the middle of what is evidently a heated
	argument between colonel donald reid and duval reid is in the uniform
	of the with a cadaceus which indicates he is the medical
	division also present is captain bill owens in naval uniform and
	michaels cora stands beside duval rather abashed since she is the
	cause of the vociferous disagreement

					duval
				irascibly
			miss peterson volunteered to come
			along

					reid
			so did every male technician in the
			unit a woman has no place on a
			mission of this kind

					duval
				brooking no rebuttal
			i insist on taking my technician

					reid
			youll take whoeverassign

					duval
				angrily
			dont tell me whom im to work with
			not on this operation or any other
			ill do whatthink is best
			without any interference from
			anyone

	before reid can reply

					michaels
				diplomatically
			dr duval has relied on miss
			peterson for years and since she
			wants to come along im sure its
			for the best dr reid

					reid
				making best of defeat
			i dont agree with you  but since
			youre in charge you can do as you
			please but i want to go on record
			as being against it

					carter
			grant  colonel reid operation
			commander
				they nod of michaels
			youve met our medical chief

	grant and michaels shake hands in effect their first meeting visa
	vis

					carter
			this is dr duval our head surgeon

					grant
			oh yes ive heard of you doctor

	with the attitude of the completely dedicated professional duval
	throws him a cursory glance nods sits down quickly opens up a
	folder containing the latest lab reports on benes which he scans
	during

					michaels
			miss peterson his technical
			assistant

					grant
				the charmer
			how are you miss peterson

	she responds with an impersonal nod sits down beside duval and opens
	up her sheaf of lab reports handing him the pertinent ones during

					carter
			this is captain bill owens designer
			of an experimental submarine for the
			navys oceanographic research and
			development program

	as they shake hands

					grant
			out of your element arent you
			captain

					owens
			sort of

					grant
			that makes two of us

					carter
			grants uniquely qualified for this
			mission hes a communications
			expert and was a frogman during the
			war besides he brought benes into
			this country and the fewer people
			who know about him the better at
			any rate youll find grant
			invaluable should anything go wrong
			once youre under way
				to reid
			okay don

					reid
			heres the overall target area

	reid presses a switch a large anatomical map of a brain flashes on a
	central screen the ganglia and dendrites form a network much like
	intersecting roads in a detailed war map the clot is a solid
	obstruction in the center grid lines cross the map vertically and
	horizontally as points of reference the entire projection has a
	threedimensional effect since it is drawn in perspective

					duval
			benes brainnear as we can map it
			stereotaxically

	he switches on a flashlight arrow points to the clot

					duval
			the clots right here

	he switches off the arrow and quickly flashes it on again this time
	on the edges of the map the arrow now probes and with draws from the
	base center and top of the brain like the animated technique of
	showing an attack which is repulsed at the perimeter

					duval
			impossible to get at 
				arrow makes vertical
				penetration to give
				impression of wide cut
			 without damage to the intervening
			tissuewhich would prove fatal to
			benes

	he presses another switch a startling overlay of the blood vessels of
	the head and neck appears over the anatomical drawing of the brain
	encasing it the redcolored arteries and bluecolored veins form such
	an intricate maze that finding ones way through it seems virtually
	impossible

					duval
			the only way to reach it is via the
			arterial system

	grant looks at cora she is busy making notes from the projected map
	owens is showing no undue reaction apparently having been apprised

					reid
			phase one calls for miniaturizing a
			submarine with crew and surgical
			team and injecting it into the
			carotid artery

	he points with the arrow to the exact spot

					owens
			how small would that be

					reid
			about the size of a microbe

					grant
			colonel im sure thats quite a
			comfortable size but 

					reid
			reduced proportionately you wont
			find it too strange 

					grant
			all in a days work sure but i was
			thinking of the speed of the
			circulatory system

					michaels
			about forty miles an hour

					grant
			well it seems to me if you reduce a
			ship to microscopic size  and the
			stream remains constant  wed take
			quite a beating

					owens
				very worried
			i hope youve taken that into
			account 

					carter
			we have

					reid
			you wont be going anywhere near
			that fast were putting benes in
			deep hypothermia  that is
			freezing him low as compatible with
			human life itll slow down his
			heartbeat circulation and all
			other physical processes

	owens begins polishing his glasses indicating his inner qualms

					owens
			even so because of our size  i
			mean lack of it  well still be
			cruising mighty fast well be
			smashed to bits if theres any
			turbulence 

					michaels
				pointing with flashing
				arrow
			the only danger of turbulence is in
			the heart  and were not going
			through it
				flashing arrow
			once in the carotid artery well
			remain in the arterial system
			until we reach the point of
			damage 
				flashes around clot
			 where dr duval will attempt to
			dissolve the clot with a laser beam
			after the operation well return by
			way of the venous system 
				coursing down with
				arrow
			 until we reach the base of the
			neck 
				arrow stops
			 where well be removed right here
			 with a hypodermic

					grant
			how will you know where the sub is
			at any particular moment

					reid
			dr michaels  our circulatory
			specialist  will serve as your
			navigator hell know just where you
			are and you can communicate
			directly with us by wireless
			besides the sub is nuclearpowered
			and well be tracking it just as we
			would any radioactive tracer

					carter
			therell be a team of surgeons
			standing by were prepared to
			remove you immediately should
			anything go wrong in any event you
			must be out within sixty minutes
			after that youll be in danger of
			attack

					grant
			attack who  or should i say what
			from

					reid
			benes natural defenses white
			corpuscles  antibodies once you
			begin to grow  and become a menace
			to the body  youll trigger them
			off
					michaels
			with all the unknown factors in the
			body i still say risking five lives
			for one is something we should
			reconsider 

					carter
			we understand your concern but
			weve made our decision doctor any
			questions anybody

					grant
			just one general

					carter
			yes

					grant
			where can i get a cab back to town

	no one responds to the attempted levity carter rises

					carter
				to all
			proceed to the sterilization

	carefully holding the lead box owens starts up the ladder followed
	by duval then michaels grant waves cora to precede him they reach
	the monks steps above the ladder climb upward then one by one
	disappear through the hatch grant is the last one in

94	int proteus

	with grant we see the interior there are plastic windows in the bow
	in the center is the navigation and communications kiosk which
	contains charts reports and a wireless set four swivel chairs are
	spaced about the kiosk behind it a ladder leads to the conning
	bubble above set in the rear of the kiosk is a watertight door
	leading into the escape hatch behind the kiosk is a lab and storage
	section not visible at the moment no power of any kind is on 
	lights or airconditioning the interior is illuminated by the light
	coming in through the plastic windows duval michaels and cora
	instantly move to the kiosk and busy themselves examining the charts
	and reports in the numerous pigeonholes owens hands the lead box to
	grant

					owens
			hold this

	grant takes the lead box owens removes a crank from the tool box
	inserts it into a hole in a circular trap door which readsowens turns the crank the lid of the trap door opens a hollow cradle
	comes up owens then opens the lead box by undoing two butterfly
	screws he removes the seed cage from within the box

					grant
				not relishing thought
			atomic fuel

					owens
			nothing you could see with the naked
			eye but theres a microscopic
			radioactive particle inside

	he puts the seed cage on the cradle and lowers it back beneath the
	floor by reversing the crank during the above

					grant
			if its no military secret how can
			a sub run on a microscopic particle

					owens
			they cant reduce nuclear fuel but
			once the reactors miniaturized 
			along with the submarine  a
			microscopic particle should emit
			enough energy to activate it

					grant
			thats cutting it mighty close 
			for a perfect fit

					owens
			it should work  theoretically if
			it doesnt the missions off the

	the lid of the trap door is now level with the floor owens removes

	side suitable for working on specimens a ruby laser sits on the
	counter at the end its plastic cover removed and to the side at the
	other is a piece of metal on a metal base as grant enters he sees
	cora working with a set of very small tools making minute adjustments
	on the laser

					grant

					cora
			you may learn to like it

	she has finished adjusting the laser she now lifts grants hand away
	from the metal disc

					cora
			excuse me

	she presses a button on the laser with startling suddenness a thin
	pencil of light shoots out cutting a hole through the metal
	instantaneously had grants hand remained the beam would have gone
	right through it

					grant
			for a nice young lady you play with
			the damndest toys miss peterson

	she adjusts the intensity and thickness of the laser beam each new
	one cutting different size holes through the metal during

					cora
				with smile
			thatll teach you where to keep your
			hand

					grant
			now i know

	as she drills metal through again

					grant
			that could be quite a lethal
			weapon it could kill not cure

					cora
			not in the hands of a great surgeon
			like dr duval the beam of this
			laser can be regulated to one
			millionth of a millimeter

					grant
			i understand youve been dr duvals

	she breaks off realizing she may have revealed her feelings she
	switches off the laser averts looking at grant as she fits the
	plastic cover over it into the silence the wireless is heard as a
	message comes in grant starts back into

	up in the bubble he gets the unlimited view  and he is transfixed
	for now the miniaturizer stretches far far up and the honeycombed

	machine is fourteen feet high consists of pulleys on a tripod which
	control a vertical arm angling down from a horizontal extensor two
	sets of mechanical fingers are on the vertical arm about a foot
	apart together they act as clamps all adjustments are controlled by

	owing to its vast proportions

136	int miniaturization room

	the tripod is eased to a stop so that its vertical arm is directly

137	int proteus

	grant reacts as huge steel fingers at the bottom of the arm slowly
	slide into view he glances at cora and the others they apparently
	know what to expect but watch with the interest of scientists the
	mechanical fingers slowly disappear beneath the sub

138	int miniaturization room

	the technician maneuvers the mechanical fingers carefully so that they
	slip under the cradle of the sub in effect becoming its holding fork
	once the steel fingers are in place the zero module sinks below the

	appears to be a huge lake far below bounded by cylindrical glass
	walls in the distance reflected light bounces off the top of the

	inches from its position on the module the reduced cork base still
	encases the bottom the nurse and a technician move to the ampule he
	holds a small instrument case

	into the top of the ampule without disturbing the liquid she then
	gently pulls away the cork remaining at the base of the ampule
	revealing a small opening in the center but owing to the pressure
	above the liquid does not run out she takes a needle out of the case

			if those corpuscles can take on air
			no reason why we cant
				to duval
			all we have to do is hook up the

			better judgment to wait until the

					duval
			ive done all i could with the

					michaels
			all im asking is you test it
			beforehand

					duval
			if it wont work its beyond my
			power to fix it but if it does
			theres no telling how long it will
			hold up its a jury rig at best
			and well need every second of use
			we can get out of it thats why i
			dont want to put any extra strain

					michaels
			dr duvall i insist you test the

					duval
				angrily
			ill do nothing of the sort the

658b	int hospital room

	as grant and owens enter they see benes is propped up on his bed
	with carter duval cora and reid grouped around him grant moves
	immediately to benes

					grant
				warmly extending hand
			hello mr benes hows the prize
			patient

	benes smiles as they shake hands

					duval
				beaming
			hes making a fine recovery

					cora
			he certainly is he should be up and
			about in no time

					owens
			thats great

	grant and owens look toward carter who is pacing visibly upset

					carter
				answering their look
			oh yes great the only problem is
			he cant remember what he came to
			tell us

					grant
			cant remember what do you mean

					carter
			hes blanked out on that one
			particular point

					reid 
			yes he can remember everything 
			except how to control de
			miniaturization

					grant
			oh no

					owens
			after all that

					duval
			a specific area of memory may have
			been destroyed by the laser beam
			when dr michaels interfered

					carter
			as long as it isnt a certainty
			weve got to try everything possible
			to make him remember

					owens
			well if you have no further need
			for me

					grant
			yes wed like to get moving

					carter
				mind only on benes
			why dont you go on well meet you
			at the clearance desk in a few
			minutes

	he paces looking at benes while

					grant
			goodbye mr benes i must say its
			been quite an experience knowing
			you

	benes smiles weakly at the doubleentendre as grant starts out with
	owens

					carter
			now how soon can we try sodium
			pentathol

					reid
			id hold that off awhile

					carter
			well how about hypnosis that cant
			hurt him

	benes closes his eyes wearily

					duval
			i suggest the first thing we try is
			letting the patient get some rest

	as he starts herding them out and they reach the door they are
	startled by a loud crash os they rush out

658c659	two scooters  at intersection

	another scooter has run into the one containing grant and owens with
	such impact that the two have been tossed out the mp is blowing his
	whistle stopping all traffic

660	the group

	carter reid duval and cora are running toward

661	the intersection

	grant is rising holding the side of his head owens dazed but
	uninjured is also getting up as the others reach them

					duval
				of grant
			he may have a head injury
				to reid
			get him to the hospital

	instantly grant grabs owens and hustles him to their scooter

					grant

			right skipper

					owens
				dazed

					grant
				taking off

			were fine  just fine

	in his haste he almost runs into another scooter but averts a crash
	by a matter of inches he keeps going at top speed bypassing the
	stopped traffic by traveling in the wrong lane

662	long shot  scooter

	as it is lost to view down the long corridor
