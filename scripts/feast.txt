               fade in

               ext desert  day

               the white sun beats down on the rocky terrain theres not a 
               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill

               far in the distance a medium sized flatbed truck makes its 
               way to the entrance of a large cavern opening two vultures 
               perched on a barren tree watch the intruders

               ext desert  day

               the truck screeches to a dusty stop three men in matching 
               coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab chief 42 stocky 
               weary lanky 32 withered and college boy 23 clean cut 
               and naive

               chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth 
               before them

                                     chief
                         this is it

                         dont mind me buddy its nothin

               chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck

               the logo on the rear gate reads wigwam waste management 

                                     chief
                         lets get that first barrel

               the gate drops revealing their full load of yellow barrels 
               bearing the familiar biohazard waste symbol

               int cavern  moments later

               as chief moves forward pulling out his pickaxe

               instantly the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight a 
               group of greenpeace hippie activists stand in the cave 
               chained together at the waist startling the men into screams

               mean green 35 crooked glasses on a face that has launched 
               a thousand craps barks into a mini bullhorn that hangs around

               panicked chief drops his pickaxe and stumbles back

                                     chief
                         whoa whoa whoa

               in unison the hippies start chanting

                                     chief

                         its piping provides drainage for our

               hammers at the chain around her waist

               foot by foot shes dragged closer at the last second she 
               breaks the chain popping herself free

               she spins running for safety a guttural howl behind her 
               fills the cavern mean green sprints toward the cave opening 
               shes gonna make it only a few more feet and then jerk

               something grabs her neck and yanks her back into the darkness 
               the whiplash sends her bloody bullhorn flying into the light 
               as it lands it lets out one last weak honk

               roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end the 
               tunnel slightly curves so he cant see the whole way down

                                     roadie

                         move

               the scratching sound increases now heard from the far end 
               of the tunnel as well

                         like moles these things

               then sister beast 1 drops into the tunnel from the far 
               end

               she charges at the last second roadie spots her

                                     roadie

               roadie and coach duck into the water but heroine is unable 
               to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards sister 
               beast 1 lands and turns surveying her prey roadie aims 
               his waterdripping gun but heroine rises and blocks his 
               shot

                                     roadie
                         stay down

               from her knees heroine fires blamblamblam the three 
               shots push sister beast 1 backwards heroine rises covered 
               in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face

                                     heroine
                         go the bitch is mine

               roadie and coach reluctantly turn leaving heroine to fend 
               with the beast

               heroine charges hissing sister beast 1 charges as well

               heroine pumps and fires boom sister beast spins avoiding 
               the shot now too close heroine jams the beast in the mouth 
               with the gun knocking her back

               sister beast 1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm

               heroine bats her away sister beast 1 moves to the others

                                     heroine
                         look out

               roadie and coach sprint until sister beast 2 bursts through 
               the tunnel walls stopping roadie and coach in their tracks

               roadie fires his weapon but it sparks and fizzles

                                     roadie
                         the shells are wet

               with the two beasts closing in the men are trapped coach 
               looks around seeing a plan

               grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling roadie pulls 
               himself from the water coach uses the machete to cut a power 
               cord from above he grabs the exposed sparking end
