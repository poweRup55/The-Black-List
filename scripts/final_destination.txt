an elevator with collapsible metal door lowers into frame pushing the door 
aside alex and clear proceed into the hallway lined with morgue green 
tile stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow 
surgical tubing and thick foot long needles sit in the corridor

a faint light spills from beneath a doorway clear reaches out to the knob 
but alex quickly grabs her hand from a cart behind them he pulls a latex 
glove out of a box and snaps it on

						alex
				good call very quincy

alex tries the doorknob locked he looks at her defeated clear quickly 
points to some morticians tools on the cart

from it alex produces a thin six inch needle he inserted the tool in the 
lock and jimmies the doorknob clack

a lone desk lamp shines across the room laying on a porcelain table fluid 
draining tubes attached lies tod a sheet is pulled up to his shoulders he 
carries the macabre appearence of corspe having been made up by a mortician 
hair combed and sprayed skin tone too orange blush too rouge and lips too

he flashes a dry morticians smile pleased by his won pun alex and clear 
havent recovered from the corspes actions to calmly address bludworth

					alex
				why

alex comletes his question by raising his hand ala tods dead body 
bludworth nods understanding

				mr bludworth

as the startle of the situation settles it dawns on alex that they have 
been busted he nervously offers an explanation

					alex
			im a friend of his his best

				i know who you are

the mortician eyes alex understanding alex senses this and eases clear 
moves toward tods body examining the neck area

					clear
				they said he hung himself
				but theres no marks

					mr bludworth
			i crafted a reconstruction of

clear moves in for a closer look then calls alex over to the body after a 
beat of reluctance alex looks at tods neck

						alex
				what are all those tiny marks

alexs pov  close  tods neck

the wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint at this 
proximity however it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below 
the large cut made by the wire

						alex
				why would he pull at the wire

because of the supernatural message he recieved alex is reluctant to 
answer he eyes mr bludworth who with a wry half smile eyes alex as if 
ware of the reason behind his hesitation

					alex

bludworth moves to tod on the draining table disconnecting the tubes 
connecting the body to hte embalming chemicals

					alex
				design

the mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the 
table he shrugs then continues his work

					mr bludworth
			if life is like a box of chocolates
			death death is like a big milton bradley
			game of mouse trap the day youre born is
			just the boot hanging from the streetlamp
			kicking the marble to get hings rolling growing
			up is only the marble rolling down the curving
			shute you feel immortal having survived school
			sex drugs n rock n roll but youve really
			only upset the big hand holding the steel ball
			that falls into the bathtub marriage and kids
			and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the
			ball hits the seesaw and flips the diving man
			into the big barrel in the old folks home or the
			hospital you just see the big cage rattling down
			until it captures the mouse
					beat
			game over

alex considers as clear eyes him conveying this guyss whacked alex 
moves toward bludworth

							alex
			maybe theres no way to win but
			if you figured out the game you knew
			were the steel ball was rolling couldnt
			you avoid the trap and extend the playing time
			couldnt you cheat death at its own game

mr bludworth looks directly at alex camera moves in on each 
individually this between the two of them

					mr bludworth
			you already did that by walking off
			the plane now you gotta out when and
			how itll come back at you
				beat
			play your hunch alex if you think
			you can get away from it
				beat
			but beware the risk of cheating the plan
			disrespecting the design could inicate
			a horrifying fury that would terrorize even
			the grim reaper
				beat
			and you dont even want to fuck with that

alexs eyes are locked on bludworths chilling pleasant smile the 
mortician yanks on a tube revealing a foot long needle removed from tods 
spinal column the horrific nature of death is vividly demonsrated to alex

the new ending

note
the following message is a spoiler so dont read it if you dont want to be 
spoiled


okay alex does actually save clears life in the end everything up to the 
part when he got elecricuted was all in the movie yes thats right clear 
does not have a baby
alex actually lives about six months later alex clear and carter go to 
paris without the plane crashing
they are outside having dinner on the streets of paris clear and alex are 
together and carter and alex and clear are all friends they make a toast to 
all the people that died on flight 180
then alex desides to bring up the design again so if death kept on going 
alex would have been next
all of a sudden alex looks around his surrondings he sees a man playing 
some sort of guitar he is singing in french he suddenly realizes what he 
is singing yup thats right rocky mountain high by john denver fear 
suddenly comes over him he starts freaking out suddenly a piece of paper 
blows up into him he freaks out and knocks over his glass of red wine it 
spills on the design piece of paper the one with the seating chart of the 
airplane the wine is spilled over alexs name clear and carter ask whats 
wrong and he says nothing alex gets up and starts toward the street alex 
says hes going back to the hotel clear wants to come with him but he 
refuses that she stays there clear suddenly looks in the window of the 
diner and sees a reflection a a bus coming memories flood back to her 
realizing before alex can cross the street clear yells alexs name alex 
just then turns just in time off the curb almost plowed by a bus the bus 
loses control and plows into a street lamp that goes flying and it hits the 
big bright sign of the restarant alex is standing and realizes the sign 
swinging down right in his direction before he can get out of the way 
carter jumps in and pulls alex out of the way before it can behead both of 
them alex is now on the ground shocked with carter standing before him
man i knew you were next carter yells
it skipped me alex breathed
then whos next carter questions
and before alex can say anything the other half of the sign smings down and 
plows right into carter
then it fades to black
credits roll

there was no sex scene in the movie they cut it out they wanted you to 
use your imagination on alex and clear

new line cinema didnt like the ending with alex dead and with clear and 
the baby im not sure why
