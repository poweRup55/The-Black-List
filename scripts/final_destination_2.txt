               kimberly passes a station wagon on her right the driver 
               squinting at a map while driving a mattress and some 
               furniture tied to the top shift as the wagon hits a bump

               him he lowers the joint at once

               speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs

               a horn blasts the truck swerves then speeds by on the right 
               a coiled chain drops down to the highway

                                     dano
                         look first idiot

               shaina turns up the radio and leans over to kimberly

               on log truck

               one end of the rusty chain holding the logs in place rattles 
               on the pavement sparking

               looking in her rearview mirror kimberly turns pale  the 
               cop pulls in behind her

                                     kimberly
                         dano put that out now

               dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window 
               it bounces on the windshield of a ford expedition to their 
               left

               inside the expedition

               kat 28 very corporate america wears a navy blue power 
               suit and speaks into a phone headset while smoking a 
               cigarette

                         get silverstein to come in and

               kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath 
               her windshield wipers a moment later a small flame crackles

                                     kat
                         what the hell  no  not you

               kat flicks on her windshield wiper fluid successfully putting 
               out the joint but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around 
               impairing her vision

               kat turns and looks at 

               dano dead serious all of a sudden staring straight ahead

                                     dano
                         whats the cop doing  did he see 
                         that

               kat sees the tailgating chp smiles then resumes her 
               conversation

                                     kat
                         forget it ill call him myself

               kat hangs up then looks down at her cell phone squints and 
               dials a number

               pan off kat to officer thomas burke

               early 20s rookie cop who seems to have missed the entire 
               exchange

               inside the police car

               thomas speaks into his radio

                                     thomas

               thomas tries to sip from a mcdonalds coffee cup on the 
               dashboard but its too hot he places it back on the dash

               the vibrations of the road make the coffee cup slide closer 
               and closer to the edge of the dashboard

               back to kimberlys suv

               dano nervously looks back

               but kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard check 
               engine light begins flickering

               kimberly spots a road sign  next service 18 miles

                                     kimberly

                         i can live with thaaaa 

               kimberly stops midsentence when the white van in front of 
               her suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder 
               for no reason kimberly screams swerving around the van 
               just in time to avoid an accident frankie instinctively 
               shouts at the van

                                     frankie
                         whats your problem ya fuckin crack 
                         baby

               inside the white van

               isabella cruz late 20s and very pregnant drives a delivery 
               van full of funeral wreaths crosses and classic rose urns 
               most are marked in memory of flight 180

               she chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over

                                     isabella
                         couldnt keep your dick in check 
                         for another month  i knew this would 
                         happen when i got pregnant

               she pounds the steering wheel furious

                                     isabella
                         whatd the doctor say  i have to 
                         come in to test for stds  goddamn 
                         you jorge

               a crate in the back of her van topples over and crashes and 
               a flurry of sunflower petals sails out the window isabella 
               jumps in surprise and wiping tears from her eyes rolls up 
               the windows as petals shower the visor of 

               eugene the harley rider who smears the petals and some 
               squashed bugs around his visor and drops back

               inside nissan suv

               kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as 
               she sees a truck driver guzzling from a flask as it passes 
               the suv revealing its side is an ad for firestone tires

               it finally clears frame revealing a highway billboard that 
               reads drunk driving kills

               kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of 
               laughter from the back seat

               up ahead the rusty chain seems to have more give to it 
               logs strain against it

               suddenly a black cloud of exhaust from a blue 83 chevette 
               in front of them causes everyone to roll up their windows

               oil drips from its rusty exhaust pipe the thick exhaust 
               blinds kimberly

                                     frankie
                         gas it around these idiots  we do 
                         have 1200 miles to go you know

               kimberly tires to enter the passing lane but shes blocked 
               by a suburu wagon in the front seat a sevenyear old kid 
               is sadistically smashing two toy cars together

               kimberly passes the suburu and pulls up to a pacer the harley 
               roars by startling her

               inside pacer

               nora kesner 35 and her son tim 15 tim drums on the 
               dashboard with two tenounce naya bottles

                                     nora
                         tim will you cut that out  i cant 
                         even hear myself think

               tim frowns and then winces holding his jaw

                                     tim
                         damn it really hurts mom

                                     nora
                         i know well be there soon

               tim drops the naya bottles on the seat one of them quietly 
               falls to the floor rolls a bit finally settling under the 
               brake pedal

               inside nissan suv

               kimberly is still behind the smokespewing chevette she 
               passes it on the left frankie rolls down his window

                                     frankie
                              yells to driver
                         ever hear of the ozone layer asshole

               inside chevette

               rory 27 leans down to snort a line of coke off a def leppard 
               cd case s he looks up to see the patrol car is now behind 
               him he reflexively taps the brakes

               rory eyes like saucers sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel 
               and nonchalantly wipes the cd clean on his pants

               inside nissan suv

               she has dropped back behind the chevette and chp car and is 
               running down along side of a black trans am

               up ahead she sees the highway patrol car flick on its lights 
               and pull into the shoulder around the chevette and behind 
               the semi loaded with logs

               inside the cop car

               as thomas pulls in behind the log truck his coffee cup 
               lurches forward spilling hot coffee all over his lap and 
               the floor

                                     thomas
                         son of a bitch

               inside trans am

               its driver evan schaeffer 21 flashes a cocky smile at 
               kimberly clearly making frankie jealous

                                     frankie

               frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on evans window

                         you know hasselhoff before he did 
                         baywatch

               evan pissed off flips off frankie the windshield wipers 
               smear around the thick milky fluid the sun blinding him

                                     kimberly

                         how does a nice mature fuck sound

               kimberly laughs then leans in close to shaina

                                     kimberly
                         hey thanks for talking me into this

                         live again you know

               shaina smiles in understanding

               inside police cruiser

               thomas bends to wipe up the mess he only glances at the 
               road as he tries to soak up the coffee

               suddenly up ahead the rusty chain snaps the logs roll off 
               the side of the truck onto the highway

               one bounces as it hits and slams through thomas front 
               winshield and out the back taking thomas head with it

               eugene slams on his brakes his harley slides out and he is 
               slammed to the ground sliding at 60 miles per hour across 
               the highway right in front of the yellow minibus

               the minibus driver brakes to avoid eugene the football 
               players tumble forward and hit him in the head he loses 
               control and slides off the road onto the grass median

               he blows a front tire and the minibus begins to flip rolling 
               several times into the oncoming lanes of traffic and is hit 
               by a mack truck

               eugene slides into a huge log and hits it with a sickening 
               crunch only to be hit and crushed by his sliding motorcycle

               rory looks up too late and rear ends thomas car exploding 
               the gas tank and hurling rorys dead body halfway through 
               the windshield where it remains half inhalf onto the hood

               kat dialing looks up slams on her brakes but skids on 
               oil from the chevetteshe swerves into kimberly side swipes 
               her then swerves to miss a huge log  only to run head on 
               into two more flipping the expedition end over end right 
               next to kimberly

               kimberly swerves back from being hit by kat just in time to 
               see a huge log ahead she tries to turn hard to the right to 
               avoid it but hits it broadside 

               sending the suv flipping over the top of the log and sliding 
               down the road inside shaina dano and frankie are tossed 
               around like rag dolls shredded by glass and shrapnel  
               frankie is ejected out the side window

               kimberlys suv slides to a stop on its side she looks back 
               to her mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see

               noras pacer

               nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but 
               the fallen naya bottle prevents her from braking and she 
               slams into the back of kats expedition

               the crash test dummy collision folds her pacer and it explodes 
               into a huge fireball

               evan blinded by the smeared windshield is too late he 
               swerves his trans am around the burning cars onto the wet 
               grass

               kimberly sees the topless trans am slowly roll out of a huge 
               wall of fire and coast to a stop evan comes up battered and 
               bloody but still alive he is trapped in his burning car 
               screaming and trying to release the seatbelt

               then just when she thought it was over a huge semi slides 
               through the wall of fire smashing the trans am out of the 
               way spinning it like a top with the back sliding at 90 
               degrees it keeps on coming

               dano shifts in his seat and sees  a highway patrol car 
               ominously cruising up the shoulder of the onramp he shoves 
               a bag of weed along with the joint down his pants

                                     dano

               officer thomas burke exits his car and approaches the 
               passenger side of the suv hand on weapon thomas taps the 
               window with his knuckle

                                     thomas
                         miss please step out of the vehicle

               as she does thomas discretely unsnaps his holster rory 
               nervously eyes the action sneaks a paper bundle into his 
               sock isabella the pregnant woman in the white van gets 
               out she gives thomas her friendliest smile milking the 
               pregnant belly

               her cell phone rings and she leans back inside to answer it

                                     isabella
                         hey hon you got a mysterious caller 
                         on the answering machine from planned

               as she listens growing agitated the harley rider dismounts 
               and pulls off his helmet revealing eugene dix 35 a nebbishy 
               school teacher in cool leathers

               inside pacer

               nora watches the suv distressed

                                     nora
                         what on earth are they doing

               nora gives tim a hard stare then they both break into smiles

               isnt quite sure what kind of insanity hes dealing with 
               yet dano and frankie no help stare dead ahead

                                     kimberly
                              trying to calm herself
                         the radio played the same songs the 
                         old ladys bag broke the exact same 
                         way it did in my premonition

               kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the log truck 
               speed past she grabs at thomas for emphasis

                                     kimberly

               cars and speeds down the onramp in reverse isabella screaming 
               angrily into her cell phone

                                     isabella
                         you couldnt keep your dick in check 
                         for a month

               the other drivers exit their cars craning their necks to 
               see whats happened up ahead kat takes a deep drag off her 
               smoke

                                     kat

               kimberly moves toward shainas window as she leans her head 
               into shainas window an ominous breeze blows back their 
               hair and we hear the blaring horn of a truck

               and kimberly is unexpectedly yanked backward by thomas

               from nowhere a shriek of brakes as a jackknifed truck plows 
               the suv across the frame crash flying debris misses kimberly 
               and thomas by inches

                         was going to happen even before it 
                         did

               something clicks for thomas but he forces himself to speak 
               calmly like a lawyer leading a friendly witness

                                     thomas
                         you knew  you just mean a hunch 
                         right  a bad vibe maybe

               the other drivers stare at kimberly

                         more than that  all the songs on 
                         the radio were about car crashes
                         some kids banging toy cars together
                              looking at her
                         she was dialing her cell phone with 
                         her headset on
                              points to rory
                         his car was leaking oil all over the 
                         road

                                     rory
                         hey dont be knockin the chevette

               but the others listen intently now especially kat who spies 
               her headset buried deep in her purse

                                     kimberly
                         billboards about accidents  kids

                         like what

               kimberly sighs and looks down the room becomes eerily silent 
               except for the flicker of a florescent light

                                     kimberly

               thomas eyes widen  then a startling crash as rory leaning 
               back in his chair tips over thomas rolls his eyes as rory 
               grins sheepishly and picks himself up

                                     thomas
                         you mean alex browning

               eugene sees nora and tim are hooked and speaks in scary 
               campfire tones

                                     eugene

                         irresponsible and unprofessional

               detective subys persistent glare makes thomas uncomfortable

               when detective suby realizes this he stops and listens

                                     kimberly
                         but if i was never meant to pull

                         for us

               detective suby looks pissed off

                                     detective suby
                         way to console the witnesses burke

               at the same time we watch evan enter the other room grab 
               his jacket and wave goodbye to the others

                                     detective suby

               the fluorescent light above flickers ominously nora 
               disturbed stands up in a huff grabbing tims arm

                                     nora

                         whats wrong with you people

               nora pulls a reluctant tim out of the room as she opens the 
               door the others watch detective suby and thomas appear from 
               nowhere to calm her down when the door swings shut an 
               awkward silence suddenly the door opens again and thomas 
               leads mr burroughs inside mr burroughs sees kimberly and 
               chokes back tears

                                     mr burroughs
                         kimberly

               the sight of her father crying is enough to make kimberlys 
               own dam burst she rushes over to him and buries her head in 
               his chest sobbing

                                     mr burroughs

               thomas nods

                         sure you can all go

               by now the fluorescent light flickers out of control when 
               rory kat and eugene stand up thomas looks helpless

                                     kat

                         since the sixth season

               as thomas watches them file out the fluorescent light pops 
               then darkness

               int kitchen  day

               kimberly sits at the table mr burroughs sets down a cup of 
               tea before her both are shaken

                                     kimberly

                                     mr burroughs
                         what feeling

                                     kimberly
                         that its not over yet

               she picks up the tea it clatters in her trembling hands

                                     mr burroughs
                         dont worry  everything will be 
                         fine youll see

               int evans stairwell  day

               a dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell 
               evan appears in the darkness carrying a brand new television 
               with some packages on top hes unable to see the long rickety 
               stairwell he climbs

               the stairs are littered with chinese take out menus and a 
               tonka truck apparently left by some kids

               as evan slowly climbs the staircase a fat man comes down 
               forcing evan to lean against 

               the railing  which creaks and bends after the fat man 
               passes evan slowly continues up again tearing his shirt on 
               a nail

                                     evan
                         motherfucker

               a heating duct clicks on the air blows a tonka truck slowly 
               toward the center of the staircase directly in evans path  
               but evan just misses it

               he continues past more toys nearing the top stair 

               the airduct coughs sending menus fluttering toward evans 
               feet and he slips on them he juggles the tv  but ultimately 
               rights himself and continues down the hallway

               int evans apartment  continuous

               dim cheap probably roachinfested as evan enters the 
               small packages fall off the tv box and onto the floor

               evan places the tv by the door looks at his torn shirt but 
               fuck it who cares hes on a natural high he peels his 
               shirt off revealing his pierced nipples flicks on the radio 
               and dances his way over to the fridge and grabs a drink

               in the tiny kitchenette area a small swarm of flies hovers 
               over a greasefilled frying pan

               evan recoils throws open the window and throws the grease 
               to the sidewalk five stories below an ominous breeze enters 

               and a kitchen cabinet slowly blows open some forks and knives 
               slide forward on poorly stacked plates daring to fall into 
               the toaster

               evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it 
               into the frying pan then dumps in some frozen mozzarella 
               sticks evan puts the frying pan on the stove and turns it 
               on high

               he then grabs a container of chinese food and rests it on 
               the counter next to the fridge on the fridge several 
               colorful magnets spell out hey e

               push in on the h  which mysteriously drops into the chinese 
               food  the word ey e remaining oblivious evan puts the 
               food in the microwave and turns it on

               angle on stove

               the cooking oil creeps toward the range evan hits play on 
               his answering machine and rushes across the room to tear 
               open his packages

                                     voice os
                         dude  you suck  you buy one fucking 
                         ticket in your whole life and win 
                         twenty grand  were going whoring 
                         in prague you know this
                              whisper
                         hold on the boss is coming

               a click then hold muzak acdcs highway to hell

               angle on magnet in chinese food sparking it pops and 
               fizzles and ugly sound

               as many similar messages continue evan unwraps a new rolex 
               he slides it over his wrist admiring it

               angle on knife

               lazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster protruding 
               about an inch and a half hardly noticeable

               by now evan has opened the next package a gaudy gold and 
               diamond encrusted horseshoe ring

               he carries the ring into the kitchenette sees the chinese 
               food is flaming and his hands flash out to turn it off  a 
               small explosion from the microwave startles him

               the ring falls into his draingarbage disposal

                                     evan
                         damn it

               evan reaches into the drain his fingers searching for the 
               ring when he tries to pull his hand back out the rolex 
               catches

               another small explosion from the microwave this one cracking 
               the glass a solo plastic cup nearby begins to melt

               flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan in moments 
               the oil from the pan ignites a small fire

               evan sees all this and yanks with all his might no use as 
               the fire slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes evan starts 
               to panic he continues yanking stuck

               he sees a bottle of palmolive on the other end of the counter 
               his fingers reach for it

               slightly out of his grasp but his fingertips are just long 
               enough to knock the bottle backwards  where it rests against 
               two switches

               the fire alarm goes off the phone rings

               evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to 
               edge the palmolive over by pushing the bottle up against 
               the wall it threatens to turn on one of the switches

               angle on fingers

               in the garbage disposal a switch is flipped  but the light 
               goes on and the palmolive lazily falls resting on the 
               remaining switch

                                     evan
                         come on come on

               evan makes one last push with his foot  accidently flipping 
               the switch  the garbage disposal grinds metal

               evan horrified miraculously yanks his hand free brushing 
               against the knife in the toaster

               when the shock goes through evans body his other hand jerks 
               out knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor

               the entire kitchen is in flames including the new tv blocking 
               the door the window slams shut the room fills with smoke

                                     evan
                         jesus christ

               evan grabs a fire extinguisher a mere dribble of foam comes 
               out he begins coughing in the smoke

               evan tries the window  stuck he has no choice but to smash 
               the kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to 
               the fire escape

               he drops the fire extinguisher starts to climb out the 
               window hears a creak and looks up just as 

               a large jagged shard of glass comes crashing down at him  
               evan jumps back just in time as it shatters before him the 
               fire completely engulfs the kitchen

               he bravely jumps through the window pane landing on the 
               fire escape he runs down the fire escape from floor to floor

               a large blast from his window showers him with glass and 
               brick shrapnel but ultimately he makes it to the fire 
               escapes lowest level intact

               he tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground it 
               budges once then twice but wont go down so he climbs 
               over the railing and gently drops to the ground

               safe and sound he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to 
               walk 

               suddenly he slips on the very grease he threw out the window 
               his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back

               the rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward  
               coming right for evans face  but stops halfway

               as evan laughs breathing a final sigh of relief it suddenly 
               plummets again  impaling evan through his eye socket

               int police station  computer room  night

               thomas sits at the computer terminal he checks to make sure 
               no ones watching as he enters a search for alex browning

               thomas scrolls around seeing the death pix and autopsy photos 
               of flight 180 survivors

               headlines blare freak accident bizarre coincidence 
               describing the way the victims died as thomas begins a 
               localized search of the word premonition 

               spooky humming from behind him

               thomas whirls around to see det suby looking over his 
               shoulder humming the music from an old monster movie suby 
               presses one hand to his forehead the other polishing an 
               apple against his vest

                                     detective suby

               detective suby shrugs and walks away munching the apple

               against her window a porch swing squeaks back and forth 
               adding to her anxiety

               a breeze enters sputtering out the candle kimberly sits 
               upright in bed and sees the window is shut huh  she lights 
               a match and sees the candle wax dripped onto her table 
               forming the gooey shape of a180 the match goes out in

               headlights from passing cars cast eerie shadows on her 
               ceiling shadows resembling planes seem to transform into a

               kimberly freaked out looks around to see the blinking light 
               from the vcr it flashes 180 a few times then 1200

               she cant take it anymore she yanks the vcr cord from the 
               wall and flicks on the lights ridding the room of shadows

                         youre too damn bitter and selfish 
                         to care about another living soul  
                         in my opinion youre already dead

               thomas wearing street clothes peers through the front window 
               of the house he guiltily backs away as kimberly gets out

               thomas nods and leans against the large glass windows that

               suddenly through the reflection of the window glass kimberly 
               sees hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once

               like a scene out of the birds kimberly must duck and cover 
               as the pigeons assault her from every angle

               but when kimberly turns away from the reflection toward the 
               actual pigeons theyre gone all in her head

               intercut kimberly and thomas

               racing to the medical complex throughout

               the waiting room

               the water trickles into the outlet the vacuum sparks and 
               dies just as

               bang sfx broken glass  it sounds like a pigeon finally 
               crashed through the window in the other room

                         goddamn it already

               dr lees marches out of the room to investigate another 
               quick electrical surge and the oxygen compressor flutters 
               off the needle drops but the nitrous flow remains strong

               spinning from a new breeze suddenly a small round puffer 
               fish falls directly into tims mouth

               soft gurgling and choking

               nora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying 
               to fly right dr lees makes a halfhearted attempt to soothe 
               and catch it

               back in dr lees office

               slow dolly up to tim choking gurgling his eyes are open 
               but rolled up his hand limply reaches upthen drops

               sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we 
               continue our slow dolly into tims eyes

               they glaze overthe choking stops and a hand reaches into 
               frame and pulls the puffer fish out of tims mouth

               reveal jean looking petrified at the close call looking 
               around to make sure nobody saw

               nora and tim feeling better now walk past the construction 
               crew a crane operator smiles at tim who smiles back

               from across the mall the tiny running figures of kimberly 
               and thomas appear in the distance pointing and screaming

                                     tim
                         what are they doing here  and why 
                         are they yelling pigeons

               just then tim and nora walk into a large cluster of pigeons 
               who suddenly burst into flight startling the crane 
               operator whose hand inadvertently jerks a lever 

               a metallic chain rattle fills the air and tim looks up just 
               as a huge sheet of glass plummets downward toward him and 
               crushes him his mangled body visible underneath

               as two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk nora 
               screams

                                                               dissolve to

               sinking in bang  a startling pound on the roof of thomas

               the three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy 
               hallway an orange glow flickers from the far room the 
               unmistakable sounds of a furnace make it all the more eerie

               as they near the door theyre able to see inside the room 
               the shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven

               they edge closer they peek inside the 

               int crematorium

               oddly there is no one there as they enter passing the 
               furnace a momentary whoosh of flames startles them all

               they jump back  bumping right into

               as he discards the bloody tooth on a metal tray

               the words slowly take affect kimberly becomes centered 
               getting her breath back and speaks without a hitch

                                     kimberly

                         gone out of control because it crashed

                              confused
                         then it wasnt just a sign it was a 
                         premonition

               thomas gently releases her paces

                                     thomas
                         remember the onramp  there was a 
                         pregnant woman in a white delivery

                         can defeat death

                         new soul that was never part of 
                         deaths design

                                     kimberly
                         it throws the entire death list out 
                         of whack  and a new list has to be 
                         rewritten from scratch  we all start 
                         over with a clean slate

                                     thomas
                         it sounds all well and good but 
                         what if were wrong

                                     clear

                                     kimberly
                              to thomas

                         number we can warn her about the 
                         lake and shell live long enough to

                         oh god

               thomas sees kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor

               forces back the tears and quickly wipes the rest away

               kimberly looks grateful and a moment passes between them 
               but shes already buried the need to cry

                                     kimberly

                                     the monitor
                         back back back until the patrol 
                         car slowly creeps backwards down the 
                         onramp

                                     kimberly

               thomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car 
               cruising past the white van a clean shot of the license 
               plate jackpot

               as thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the 
               plate number the pause function dislodges slowly advancing 
               the tape frame by frame

                                     clear
                         i dont get it  why is everything 
                         happening so fast  after flight

                         died  and now five people are dead 
                         in less than a day

               thomas computer screen finally fills with information

                                     thomas
                         here we go  the vehicles a delivery

                         cruz  and christ theres almost a 
                         dozen domestic disturbance complaints 
                         on these two

                                     clear
                         we need to hurry

               they all get up and leave

               ominously the monitor shows the next vehicle creeping behind 
               noras pacer  a white van

               int cruz house  night

               thomas pulls up to an uppermiddle class house thomas 
               kimberly and clear get out and start up the unlit path its 
               dark hard to see where theyre going so they negotiate by 
               feeling the bushes aligning the walkway

                                     thomas
                         lets lay this on her gently now
                         the stress alone could upset the 
                         pregnancy

               kimberly nods ever creeping closer to the front door  
               when automatic lights flash from over the garage

               all three freeze for a moment during which we hear stomping 
               emanate from within the house and the lights shut off

               but nothing else happens no one comes to a door thomas 
               sighs and as if suddenly remembering his status he walks 
               fearlessly and purposefully to the front door

               he makes a fist is about to knock  when the door flings 
               open and a rottweiler lunges for his throat  only to have 
               its collar snagged at the last second by its owner 

               jorge cruz late 30s handsome cocky he speaks above 
               rottys barking

                                     jorge
                         what

                         an isabella cruz

               suddenly with an unexpected fury jorge screams at his dog

                                     jorge
                         shut up

               the rottweiler cowers and jorge shoves it to the floor 
               where it lands on its feet and fearfully trots away jorges 
               face is once again pleasant but its a thin veneer

               jorge sees clear and kimberly behind thomas and frowns

                                     thomas
                         are you jorge cruz

                                     jorge
                         no  whats this about

               angle on clear  eyeing what appears to be drops of blood on 
               the tile floor she takes in what she can see of 

               the room

               as if a tornado had hit it wedding photos smashed and torn 
               furniture overturned

                                     thomas
                              a little stern
                         its about your wife isabella
                         now is she here

               jorges eyes flicker eversoinvoluntarily behind him

                                     jorge
                         no  im alone

               but by now thomas has seen everything clear has and more 
               he stares through the house into a bedroom and sees  a 
               female foot lying half0buried under the bedspread

                                     thomas

                         but i need to see 

               jorge is already closing the door

                                     jorge
                         forget it  youll need a warrant
                         i know im a lawyer

               clear rushes the door shoulders it and expertly wriggles 
               past jorges grasp

                                     jorge
                         stop  you cant go in there

               clear tears into the bedroom grabs the bedspread and throws 
               it to the floor to reveal a young woman naked trembling

               springs but thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just 
               in time

               staring up at the address he quickly snorts some powder off 
               his key and wipes his nostrils free of crystals he takes a 
               breath and exits the car

               int thomas apartment building  night

               rory follows some people into the elevator the elevator 
               doors close on his shoe  trapping rory in an awkward 
               position

               one man frantically pushes the doors open button to no avail 
               finally as the elevator rises rory yanks his foot free

                         damn is that dogshit

               rory briefly holds the shoe too close to the mans face  
               see  before disgustedly slipping it back on

               ding the doors open the man hurries out and the elevator 
               doors close on rorys smirking face

               reaches for a nearby cardboard box on the desk noticing 
               magazine pages blowing over until their weight tips over a

               swordfish mounted on the wall

               the grabber picks up speed arcs downward and hits the mounted 
               swordfish the supporting brackets give causing the swordfish 
               to tip and slide downward

               clear lurches back in her chair just in time  the razor 
               sharp bill impales the seat cushion between her legs

               kat placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a 
               box nervously pulls out a pack of smokes thomas watches as 
               he takes a hanging mirror off the wall

                                     kat

               kat steps towards the front door then remembers the cell 
               phone and grabs it just in case thomas smiles good job at 
               her

               kimberly unscrewing the light bulb looks up when nora rises 
               from the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket 
               kimberly looks concerned

                                     kimberly

               nora looks more resolute than ever

                                     nora
                         if youll excuse me i have a funeral 
                         to prepare

               everyone looks crushed when nora heads for the door except 
               eugene who stands up as well

                                     eugene
                         yeah why am i listening to a girl 
                         who just got out of the nut house

               as eugene heads out kimberly becomes enraged and grabs him

                                     kimberly
                         seeing you die once was enough for

                         tombstone

               rory presses a cell phone into eugenes hand on his way out

                                     rory
                         be careful  and even if you dont 
                         believe give this to nora

               int thomas apartment building  night

               eugene pushes the elevator button a thousand times nora 
               nervously ties her long hair back in a single braid

               int thomas apartment  continuous

               the nervous group finishes safeproofing the apartment

               rory standing on the couch pulls a police academy diploma 
               off the wall  and slips  stumbling backwards into the 
               closet

               staggering he accidentally knocks some coat hangars and a 
               volleyball trophy from the high shelf to the floor

               thomas whips around and sees that rorys not hurt he then 
               lowers his gaze and sees 

               the figurine of a volleyball trophy is framed by a tangled 
               jumble of wire coat hangars suddenly streetlight flickers 
               on for the evening oddly it only illuminates the 
               trophyhangar array

               from rorys vantage point it looks like a surreal sculpture 
               of a man with hooks emanating from his body the sodium vapor 
               lamp casts an ominous glow around the image

                                     rory
                         man with hooks  i see a man with 
                         hooks  someone

               the others look over trying to see what he does

                                     thomas
                              unsure
                         i kinda see it yeah  sonoras 
                         going to be killed by a man with 
                         hooks

               kimberly and clear stare at the volleyball trophy  the street 
               lamp ominously flickers out and dies

               everyone looks around for a hesitant beat then thomas picks 
               up his cell phone clear first walks then runs out the door

               int thomas apartment building  continuous

               the elevator finally comes eugene and nora get inside 
               standing in front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard 
               box full of prosthetic limbs

               muzak plays acdcs highway to hell

                                     eugene
                         going down right

               the gaunt man says nothing the doors close

               int elevator  continuous

               eugene stares blankly at the concave mirror in the upper 
               corner hes disturbed by the warped reflection of

               the gaunt man leans closer to noras hair and as the doors 
               finally close he leans over and smells it creepy

                                     eugene
                         um by the way your shoes untied

               nora bends down to tie her shoelace the one that snapped 
               she tries tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one 
               as eugenes cell phone vibrates in his hand startled he 
               drops it to the floor then looks embarrassed

                                     eugene
                         probably for you anyway

               nora picks it up static crackles its hard to make out 
               thomas yelling

                                     nora
                         officer burke  i cant hear

               a beat of confusion then she slowly turns to see the clawed 
               hooks and hands of the prosthetic limbs terror she freezes

                                     eugene
                         what is it  whats wrong

               but noras too frightened to speak eugene grabs the phone 
               hearing unintelligible static

               intercut clear

               as she frantically hits the elevator button when it fails 
               to come she runs downstairs

               int elevator  continuous

               nora slowly rises to her feet feverishly mouthing a prayer 
               as the door opens nora rushes out  unseen to her her long 
               braid gets snagged on one of the prosthetic hooks yanking 
               her backwards

                                     nora
                         let me go let me go

                                     eugene
                         oh watch it youve caught your 
                         uh

               the guant mans sweet voice and demeanor are a clear contrast 
               to his outward appearance

                                     man
                         goodness gracious darling let me 
                         help you with

               nora panics as eugene and the man try to untangle her braid 
               nora desperately spins her body around sticking her head 
               back inside the elevator

               kat appears in the lobby smoking a cigarette

                                     kat
                         you alright nora

               the elevator doors begin to close and clamp around noras 
               neck her head inside body outside the elevator

               eugene pounds on the bumpers but they dont seem to work

                                     nora
                         my god someone please let me out of 
                         this 

                                     intercut
                         the up button is lit clear rushes 
                         to the lobby

               the elevator rises

               inside the elevator eugene watches noras head drop to floor 
               level  then he pounds the emergency button  which shorts 
               out

               noras body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator 
               floor

               noras screams of terror and agony fill the air as the 
               elevator repeatedly lurches upwards

               kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above 
               the floor

               it lurches and lurches and lurches the horror never ends

               clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight 
               she runs to the elevator doors trying to pry them apart to 
               no avail

               all kat can do crying is grab hold of noras flailing legs 
               and try to pull her back down

               the elevator lurches a final time noras headless body fall 
               down into kats arms knocking her to the floor kat freaks 
               skittering away as the body convulses

               inside the elevator

               eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear a 
               bloodcurdling moan escapes him he stares transfixed as noras 
               head still aghast in terror rolls around the floor

               the sight clearly sends eugene over the edge he screams 
               claws and pounds desperate to escape the elevator

               int thomas apartment  moments later

               eugene suddenly bursts through the door babbling 
               incoherently kimberly thomas and rory look on bewildered

                                     eugene
                         no escapes my ass  i control my

                         reaper cockscuker

               eugenes in another world he approaches thomas and lunges 
               for his gun  yanking it from the holster

                                     thomas
                         what the hell are you

                         just take it easy

               a twisted insane smile comes to eugenes face as he jams the 
               gunbarrel to his temple the others shrink back in terror

               he pulls the trigger click eugene tries again click

               thomas looks stunned as eugene goes through every round 
               click click click click click click

               kimberly breaths a sigh of relief

                                     kimberly

               thomas eyes disagree he reaches in and grabs the gun away 
               from eugene who stands there trembling thomas cracks open 
               the cylinder loaded

                                     rory

               room in the newly conformed safe house kat and clear relax 
               as best they can in thomas dry clothes

               thomas makes another phone call in the corner eugene shivers 
               to himself desperately looking for signs of danger he looks 
               over to clear

                                     eugene

               a thick retread sheers itself onto the pavement

               brian

               the wood chipper roars loudly suddenly some forgotten stray 
               chunk shoots from the spout 

               the airborne chunk of wood cracks the white vans windshield 
               steve veers out of control

               kat sees the white van ahead swerving into her lane she 
               quickly jerks the wheel to the right

               kats left front tire blows it sends rubber flying and the 
               entire suv pulls hard to the left spinning her out of control 
               into the oncoming lane of traffic  toward the white van

               isabella screams steve jerks the wheel to the left the 
               white van has a close near miss with the expedition and 
               goes off the road toward a lake

                         hang on

               the suv misses the tractor  but sails off the other side 
               of the embankment spinning and rolling towards 

               the gibbons farm

               at the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm a propane 
               tank sits at the edge of the property

               the suv barrels down the hill  coming right for it

               inside the suv

               all kat can do is cover her head with her arms

               the white van

               speeding toward the lake isabella screams in pain not 
               fear the white van is ready for splashdown

               steve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator 
               hes able to right the van away from the water without so 
               much as a hard jerk

                         were okay were okay

               the propane tank

               its about to get creamed  but the bouncing expedition just 
               barely misses it it continues backwards crashing through 
               a temporary fence and right into 

               an agricultural construction site

               the expedition plows past earth movers crashing through 
               irrigation ditches and pipes shrapnel flying everywhere

               just as the expedition comes to a stop an irrigation pipe 
               rockets through the rear window  miraculously missing clear 
               and rory  coming to a rest just behind kats head

               inside the white van

               steve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and 
               slows down isabella squeezes his hand white

                                     isabella

               steve looks ill then sees another car stopping by the crash 
               he floors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop 
               radio

               the expedition

               the dust settles in the silent car the only sound is a quiet 
               wet wheeze  clear dazed looks around carefully avoiding 
               the metal spike that skewers the vehicle

               rory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed 
               to see it kimberly shakes her hair spilling glass onto the 
               floor kat tries to open the door but it wont budge

               a bloody hand seizes his shoulder

               thomas turns to see eugene spasming in the back seat he 
               clutches his ribcage in agony and wheezes blood trickles 
               from his mouth

                                     kat

               hill toward the accident at the edge of the property is a 
               common farm fence made from wooden posts bridged by two thick 
               wires

               brian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a 
               dead oak tree ten feet inside the fence in the bg mr 
               gibbons darts inside a doublewide construction trailer

               to the crash site brians jaw drops as he absorbs the 
               chilling sight of a guy and a girl dragging a bloodsoaked 
               man from the back seat to perform cpr on him

               around brian voices mesh in a surreal haze

               please get me out of here before it explodes

               the color drains from brians face as the dying man on the 
               ground coughs blood and the girl performing cpr recoils

               the moment is still surreal as brian steps back further 
               away from the horrors he cant face into the street 

               and rory yanks him back from imminent death as an ambulance 
               speeds onto the property

               that snaps brian back to reality sounds become normal again 
               brian collects himself and sniffs the air he then drops to 
               ground level looking under the expedition for something

               trapped leg he swipes the broken glass away from the window 
               with this thick flannel sleeve reaches in and tries to 
               yank the door open with all his might

               as eugene shudders with dread the orderly pushes a huge

                         im not sure i dont think isabella 
                         was ever destined to die in the pile
                         up

                                     thomas
                         then whats the premonition of the 
                         lake supposed to mean

                                     clear
                         can you remember anything about it

               kimberly shuts her eyes remembering

               ext lake  day

               pov driver

               greasecovered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a 
               white van speeding out of control toward a lake

               the van crashes through a railing and plunges into the water 
               in moments the van fills with water the driver inside 
               trapped drowning horrible

               and on the rearview mirror six floral scented airfreshners

                                                                   back to

               kimberly looks down at her greasecovered hands and looks 
               ill

                                     kimberly
                         the same hands from the van

               finally everything makes sense to clear

                                     clear
                         its you kimberly  the premonitions 
                         are about you

               kimberly trembles refusing to accept what shes hearing

                                     kimberly
                         no  it cant be

                                     clear
                              suddenly remembering
                         i have to save eugene

               clear leaves kimberly and thomas together kimberly verges 
               on tears and thomas consoles her with a hug

                                     in the background
                         clear looks at passing room numbers 
                         while hurrying down the corridor 
                         she comes to a room with a huge cart 
                         parked outside blocking the door 
                         she looks up to see  b187

               clear leans into it pushing it out of the way of the door

                                     clear
                         eugene  are you in there

               eugenes room

               eugene strains to hear through the thick door

                                     clear os
                         can you hear me  im coming in

               an intense wave of relief washes over eugene

                                                                   back to

               as kimberly hugs thomas she watches clear push the cart 
               past the door

                                     orderly os
                         make way make way lovebirds

               kimberly spins as eugenes orderly passes her a paper pen 
               and a crossword book in one hand a birthday cake in the 
               other

               the cake reads happy birthday gregory the thirteen 
               sparkling candles on top oddly frame clears head

                                     kimberly
                         oh no

               the orderly speeds down the corridor toward clear whose 
               hand reaches for eugenes door handle she leans into it 

                                     orderly
                              to clear
                         thanks hon the henzels are going 
                         crazy for this thing

               thomas and kimberly

               watch as clear opens the door briefly revealing eugene a 
               whoosh of oxygen 

               boom

               clears body is obscenely hurled end over end towards the 
               camera heading straight for kimberly and thomas

               thomas throws himself and kimberly around the corner to 
               prevent being crushed by clears lifeless body

               the hospital erupts in total chaos just as kimberly is about 
               to break down completely she sees 

               a woman hurrying down the hallway in their direction pushing 
               a crash cart

               kimberly sees the nametag kalarjian

                                     kimberly
                         nurse kalarjian

                                     dr kalarjian
                         doctor kalarjian  excuse me please

               angle on cart

               defribulator paddles rest on top and then dr kalarjian 
               passes them toward the area of the explosion

               kimberly ominously turns the camera following her view 
               until she sees a small lake across the street from the 
               hospital

                                     kimberly
                         oh my god  thats it  the lake

               the eeg machine  nurse kalarjian

                                     thomas
                         what

               just then an ambulance skids up to the nearest entrance 
               paramedics jump out and run towards the blast site

                                     kimberly
                         you cant cheat destiny  i know 
                         what i have to do to save us  i 
                         have to die

                                     thomas
                         thats crazy  you cant give up 
                         now  we can still fight this thing

               but kimberly isnt listening she stares through the glass 
               doors at the 

               ambulance

               a red stripe down the side but the hood is completely white 
               six floral scented airfresheners hang from the rearview 
               the van from her vision and its running

                                     kimberly
                         i have to do this

               kimberly wipes tears from her eyes kisses thomas cheek 
               then turns and runs before he can speak

               ext hospital entrance  continuous

               kimberly heads right for the open ambulance the drivers 
               door almost seems to swing open for her as she gets in

               int hospital entrance  continuous

               thomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors 
               which spark and short out he struggles to pry them apart

               ext hospital entrance  continuous

               kimberly shifts into gear and speeds off thomas squeezes 
               through the doors and runs after her an emt the driver of 
               the stolen ambulance rushes outside

                                     emt
                         what the fuck

               ext lake  day

               thomas chases the ambulance watching helplessly as it barrels 
               over curbs pylons and a fence ultimately plunging straight 
               into the lake

               thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can  the emt 
               trailing far behind

               inside the ambulance

               kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she 
               takes a final gasp of air 

               on the lakes edge

               thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as 
               the vehicle descends below the surface  and he dives in

               underwater

               thomas swims into the dark murky water deeper and deeper 
               he gets to the ambulance and tries to open the door stuck 
               he withdraws his baton and bangs on the glass  nothing

               he tries coming up for air but his pants snag on the jagged 
               metal of the twisted bumper he squirms frantically

               and as his exhausted body loses consciousness everything 

                                                             fade to black

               int hospital room  day

               blackness

                                     dr kalarjian os
                         ready andclear

               the shock of defribulator paddles brings kimberly back to 
               life

               kimberlys pov

               looking up at dr kalarjian all she can see is part of a 
               womans face and a partial nametage reading kalarjian

               it would appear as if shes choking kimberly but 

               an eeg monitor turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat 
               the same pov as the premonition

                                     nurse
                         shes back

                                     dr kalarjian
                         five ccs of narcodon  i want her 
                         stabilized and prepped for icu

               kimberly turns her head to see

               thomas

               unconscious cpr being performed on him by the emt whos 
               now soaking wet thomas doesnt respond

               an intern opens an eyelid points a flashlight at his eyes 
               shakes his head nothing the sopping wet emt goes back to 
               performing cpr

               finally thomas coughs up water chokes gasps for air then 
               bolts upright

                                     thomas
                         kimberly

               he turns to see kimberly reaching out for him immeasurably 
               relieved he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased 
               back down to the platform kimberlys eyes fill with tears

                                     kimberly
                              whispering
                         welcome back  we did it  for real

                                     thomas
                         i know  i can feel it too

               outside a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight 
               to flood into the hospital its light covers kimberly and 
               thomas with an ethereal glow there are no more doubts 
               theyve won

               they exchange meek yet triumphant smiles in the smoky 
               chaotic hospital

                                                          slow dissolve to

               kimberly taking a bite relishing the taste and calmly pulling 
               the metal skewer from her mouth

                                     kimberly

                         believe i used to be a vegan

               thomas out of uniform takes a bite of his own as the metal 
               skewer is deep in his mouth 

               a running frisbee player accidentally bumps into thomas but 
               no harm thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back 
               to rewrapping his mouth around the shishkabob

                                     mr burroughs os

               kimberly turns red as mr burroughs appears and takes a seat

                              looking around 
                              lowering voice

                         he got to worry about me for

               mr gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food 
               his wife mrs gibbons joins

                                     mr gibbons

                         to us how you did it

                         well technically when we died we 
                         gave death what it wanted  and by 
                         the time we were revived it had 
                         already moved on to graver pastures

               mrs gibbons makes a face finding the discourse distasteful 
               she changes the conversation

                                     mrs gibbons

               brian enters frame soaking up fresh laughter he holds a 
               plate full of raw chicken fillets and some long wooden 
               matches

                                     brian
                         dad you had the spatula last right

               mr gibbons hands it over and brian saunters away from camera 
               slightly out of focus toward the barbecue his body framed 
               between kimberly and thomas heads

                                     kimberly
                         brian looks like hes having fun

                                     mr gibbons
                         sure does  owes it to that friend 
                         of yours in a way

               mr gibbons immediately regrets having said that

                                     kimberly
                         hows that

                                     mr gibbons
                         well brian was nearly hit by an 
                         ambulance the daybut your friend 
                         rory pulled him back at the last 
                         second

               kimberly and thomas ominously turn their heads around in 
               the bg brian fidgets in front of the barbecue

                                     mrs gibbons
                         you never told me that peter
                         boy that was lucky

               boom the propane tank blows brian to smithereens a 
               deafening silence follows punctuated when brians arm lands 
               on mrs gibbons plate plop

                                                             fade to black
