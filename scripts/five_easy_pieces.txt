		ext ferry crossing  day
		
		bobby gets out of his car and wanders the deck of
		the ferry he stops to look out over the sound to
		one of the islands off the washington coast then
		glances back to the mainland receding in the
		distance
		
		ext bobbys car  ferry landing  day
		
		bobby drives off the ferry onto the island
		
		ext bobbys car  country road  day
		
		the car moves over a treelined country lane and
		presently turns off onto a private road leading to
		a large victorianstyle house it pulls to a stop
		behind two other cars
		
		bobby gets out of the car and moves up the porch
		steps to the front door
		
		closer on him as he hesitates listening briefly to
		the faint sound of two pianos coming from within
		
		then he opens the door and goes inside
		
		int dupea home  day
		
		two pianos over
		
		bobby tentatively wanders the first floor of the
		house taking in the ghosts of the past
		
		in the living room he pauses at a table to look at
		several framed photographs he picks up one of his
		mother and father looks closely at it then gently
		returns it to its place and resumes wandering
		
		he stops at the music room and looks in through the
		halfopened door
		
		pov into music room
		
		on the far side of the room near windows which
		give view to a verdant exterior are two concert
		grands his brother carl is seated at one of the
		pianos and a young woman catherine van oost is
		seated at the other
		
		on bobby
		
		looking from carl to catherine he watches her
		briefly then steps out of the doorway
		
		 and moves down a hallway to a closed door he
		reaches down and opens it looking inside to
		
		tita
		
		grooming the hair of an elderly man nicholas
		dupea seated in a wheelchair with his back to
		bobby
		
		she looks up and seeing bobby smiles happily
		then reaches down and turns the wheelchair around
		
		on nicholas
		
		his eyes are halfclosed and are cast down to the
		floor
		
		bobby moves over to him bending down and looking
		into his face nicholas opens his eyes slightly and
		gazes through bobby into an absolute elsewhere
		
		bobby raises his eyes to tita
		
					bobby
			he doesnt even know who the hell i
			am
		
		int dupea dining room  night
		
		nicholas dupea sits at the head of the table being
		fed his dinner by a male nurse spicer
		
		bobby at the opposite end of the table is seated
		next to tita unable to bear looking at his father
		he glances over at catherine seated next to carl
		on his right
		
		she raises her eyes from her plate to ask him
		something just as tita is moved to reminisce
		
					tita
			remember bobby what mother used
			to say when
		
					catherine
				to bobby
			how long have you been
				to tita
			oh excuse me
		
					tita
			no its all right you go ahead
		
					catherine
			i was just going to ask robert how
			long hes been away from here
		
					bobby
			four or five years
		
					carl
			no the last time was three years
			ago
		
					tita
			oh no its been much more than
			that
		
					carl
			away from the piano tita you have
			no sense of time at all
		
					tita
			i dont think thats true
		
					carl
			it is true
		
					tita
			besides being very rude
		
					catherine
			what have you been doing since
			then
		
					bobby
			what have i been doing different
			things different jobs here and
			there nothing that interesting
		
					catherine
			and you no longer play at all
		
		bobby starts to reply and is interrupted by
		
					carl
			you know just after i came back
			off tour with the betenthaller
			quartet dad myself and herbert
			had a summit conference about
			you
		
					tita
			oh my a summit conference i
			wonder where i was polishing
			silver behind the coal bin
		
					carl
			i dont know where you were penis
			envy
		
					tita
			i hope i didnt hear that
		
					carl
			at any rate dad wanted to hire a
			private detective to ferret you
			out and i said what for
			whatever the hell hes doing even
			if its a completely wasteful
			escapade its entirely his
			business simple as that
		
					bobby
			well i really appreciate it carl
		
					tita
			i dont think you should infer
			daddy was wrong in front of him
		
		she looks at spicer pushing a spoon at nicholass
		closed mouth
		
					tita contd
			dont force him like that spicer
		
		spicer lays the spoon down and begins eating his
		own dinner
		
					bobby
				to catherine
			how long have you been staying
			here
		
					tita
			a couple of months
		
		he starts to ask another question and is again
		overridden by
		
					carl
			did you hear about my misfortune
			robert
		
					bobby
			what
		
					carl
			its still nearly impossible for me
			to turn my neck if i wanted to
			turn toward catherine for
			instance id first have to twist
			the whole base of my body around
				demonstrating
			 like this
		
		tita gets up from the table and taking her plate
		exits to the kitchen and as carl readjusts himself
		in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass
		bobby looks at catherine to find her looking at
		him she quickly alters her gaze to carl
		
					catherine
			i wouldnt mind doing a little
			work if youre finished and not
			too tired
		
					carl
			no im finished
				placing a hand on his
				stomach
			satiety is my father and mother
		
		finding hes amused himself and nobody else he
		gets up and addresses bobby
		
					carl contd
			shes tremendously gifted this
			girl
		
					bobby
				looking at her
			is she
		
		catherine stands up and wanting to change the
		subject
		
					catherine
			excuse me i dont want to hear
			this
		
		she exits and carl on his way out pauses at
		bobbys chair
		
					carl
			i hope you feel at home robert
				patting him on the
				shoulder
			im really glad youre here
		
					bobby
			thanks carl
		
		he looks down table to see spicer stacking his
		plate onto nicholass and his eyes follow him as
		he too moves out of the dining room to the
		kitchen
		
		close on bobby
		
		in extreme discomfort at being left alone with his
		father he looks down at his plate poking at the
		remainder of his dinner then braves a look down
		the table
		
		on nicholas
		
		looking back at him his eyes devoid of interest or
		cognition
		
		ext dupea grounds  day
		
		bobby and tita walk away from the house down toward
		the ocean accompanying them is a borzoi hound
		belonging to her
		
					tita
			he has ways of communicating
			robert i can tell when hes
			expressing approval or disapproval
			just from his eyes
		
					bobby
			uhm hmm some range
		
					tita
			its not that bad
		
					bobby
			yes it is i cant take seeing
			him sitting there like a stone
		
					tita
			a week or two isnt going to ruin
			your life for godsakes
		
		he doesnt respond
		
					tita contd

					bobby
			no i dont
				a pause then
			you shouldve left a long time ago
		
					tita
			we cant all get up and leave can

		she stops walking and moves to one of the garden
		chairs facing out toward the bay
		
					tita contd
			and anyway i want you to stay so
			i can spend some time with you and
			ask you some questions
		
		he leans his back against a tree
		
					bobby
			what questions
		
					tita
			well do you  i mean have you
			enjoyed all these strange things
			youve been doing
		
					bobby
			sometimes
		
		she stares at him for a moment and taking note of
		it
		
					bobby contd
			why am i some kind of freak to you
			or something
		
					tita
			no no i dont think that im
			just curious about it
				a pause

		she laughs
		
					tita

					bobby

					tita
			i probably am but i dont care i

			unless i get up before the birds i
			cant get in any practice time for

					bobby
			uhm hmm
		
					tita
			actually its very admirable the
			way she works shell probably be
			enormously successful because
			shes attractive as well not that
			thats so important in music
			but
		
					bobby
			youre attractive tita if you
			just did a little more with
			yourself
		
					tita
			like what
		
					bobby

					tita
			oh lets not talk about my hair
			it does what it wants to and
			anyway who cares i want to talk
			about you
		
					bobby
			theres nothing to say tita
		
		he offers nothing further and looks out over the
		bay then after a brief silence
		
					tita
			well youre not going to run out
			on me right away are you
		
					bobby
			i dont know
		
		int dupea home  day
		
		bobby strolls casually about the house  in truth
		looking for an opportunity to run into catherine
		
		he moves to the music room and looks inside
		
		through the doorway
		
		catherine can be seen seated at the piano carl
		stands above her and they engage in some exchange
		about the score resting on the pianos music stand
		
		on bobby
		
		as he moves down the hallway and sees
		
		spicer descending the staircase with the brittle
		nicholas in his arms
		
		he ducks into the nearest room to avoid them
		
		int den  dupea home  day
		
		tita startled in the act of appraising herself in
		a mirror above the fireplace turns around to
		bobby
		
					tita
			oh god dont sneak up on me like
			that
		
		we see she wears a little makeup and has done
		something different with her hair
		
					bobby
			sorry
		
		he turns and exits the den
		
		ext dupea house  day
		
		bobby stands on the front porch looking toward
		
		 catherine coming up from the ocean she wears a
		bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a
		towel and as she approaches
		
					catherine
			hello
		
					bobby
			i guess you fell in the water
		
					catherine
				amused
			yes intentionally
		
					bobby
			thats dangerous you know
		
					catherine
			swimming
		
					bobby
			playing piano all day and then
			jumping into cold water you could
			get a cramp
		
		she laughs and begins drying her hair with a corner
		of the towel
		
					catherine
			i love to swim and i dont mind
			the cold at all its invigorating
		
					bobby
			well i wouldnt want to get too
			invigorated myself
		
					catherine
			why
		
					bobby
			what would i do with it run amok
		
		she comes up the stairs
		
					bobby contd
			besides piano and swimming what
			else do you do
		
					catherine
			well theres fishing and boating
			theres concerts on the mainland
			and but i feel silly telling
			you this is really your home you
			probably know better than i what
			there is to do
		
					bobby
			nothing
		
					catherine
			nothing then it must be very
			boring for you here
		
					bobby
			thats right have you anything to
			suggest
		
					catherine
			i dont know let me give it some
			thought
		
		she moves toward the front door with bobby
		following
		
					bobby
			whatre you doing right now
		
		int dupea home  day
		
		catherine comes inside and moves toward the
		stairway with bobby behind
		
					catherine
			right now im going to run a hot
			tub and soak myself
		
					bobby
			then after that
		
		she goes up a few steps and turns back to him
		
					catherine
			after that i plan to read some
			music and rest for awhile
		
					bobby
			tomorrow then
		
					catherine
			tomorrows a full practice day
				continues up the stairs
			but the day after is kind of open
		
		at the top of the stairs she stops and looks down
		at him
		
					catherine contd
			carl has hydrotherapy on tuesdays
		
					bobby
				as if it were a year
			the day after tomorrow
		
					catherine
			if youre free
		
					bobby
			yeah ill probably be free
		
		she turns and disappears into the secondfloor
		hallway
		
		int dupea kitchen  night
		
		dinner has concluded and tita moves around the
		table distributing cups and saucers carl is
		remote and off his feed spicer attends nicholas
		and catherine looks across the table to bobby as he
		drinks from a bottle of beer
		after a moment a loud belch comes from nicholas
		and tita quickly requests
		
					tita
			dont laugh
		
		she attempts to stifle her own amusement as do
		bobby and catherine then changes the subject
		
					tita contd
			whats wrong carl you hardly ate
			anything
		
					carl
			i took some aspirin and it really
			upset my stomach
		
		catherine begins pouring the coffee
		
					catherine
			one thing thats hard to understand
			is how you could have this
			incredible background in music and
			then just walk away from it
			without a second thought
		
					bobby
			i gave it a second thought
		
		tita seats herself at the table addressing spicer
		
					tita
			he looks tired to me spicer i
			think you should put him to bed
		
		he nods and as he gets up and wheels nicholas from
		the room
		
					catherine
			i mean how could you not play
			anymore thats so strange to me
		
					bobby
			i have played a few times here and
			there as a matter of fact i was
			once a rehearsal pianist for a las
			vegas musical revue
		
					catherine
			you dont call that music though
		
					bobby
			of course i do its music you
			know
		
		he places his hands on the table and simulates the
		playing of a rousing productiontype showstopper
		simultaneously vocalizing as he does
		
		though tita and catherine are amused carl winces
		disapprovingly and breaks into bobbys act
		
					carl
			robert do you mind
		
					bobby
			what
		
					carl
			nothing will you excuse us for a
			while
		
		he takes hold of catherines hand and stands up
		
					catherine
			we really dont have to carl if
			youre not feeling good
		
					carl
				a bit martyred
			well maybe if we put the
			thermaphore on me for a while
			first
		
					catherine
			oh all right
		
		and as they move to the door she glances
		apologetically back at bobby
		
		deflated and embarrassed he looks away from titas
		sympathetic gaze after a brief silence she
		reaches to a platter on the table
		
					tita
			do you want some gingerbread
		
					bobby
				elsewhere
			what
		
					tita
			with applesauce
		
					bobby
			no thanks
		
		int dupea living room  night
		
		bobby stands in the living room it is dark and the
		only light comes from some burning logs in the
		fireplace he listens briefly to the sounds of a
		beethoven sonata coming from the music room
		
		 then moves to a chaise near the fireplace and
		lies down staring absently into the flames after
		a moment he closes his eyes
		
		another angle
		
		on his sleeping face as the sonata begins to fade
		
		int dupea living room  morning
		
		on bobby
		
		still asleep in the chaise he is suddenly jolted
		awake by a loud thud and sits up looking out the
		window to
		
		pov of spicer
		
		lifting a barbell with heavy weights attached to
		it he does a series of vigorous presses with it
		before he again lets the bar drop heavily onto the
		porch
		
		int dupea home  upstairs hall  day
		
		bach violin over
		
		bobby stands in the hallway a phone to his ear
		listening to rayette and looking down the hall
		toward the open door to catherines room
		
					bobby
			yeah well fine you know what i
			suggest ray
				listening
			because i dont know how long
			things are not going that well

		around in her room

		he hangs up and as he starts down the hall to
		catherines room the violin stops and carl steps
		out into the hall ahead of him he carries his
		fiddle and detains bobby with
		
					carl
			only 10 minutes of playing and its
			already killing my neck
		
		bobby looks past him to catherine as she glances
		out at them and then closes the door to her room
		
		ext dupea grounds  day
		
		bobby and carl playing a game of table tennis
		tita stands leaning against a tree watching them
		in the bg spicer can be seen meticulously
		oiling and cleaning the wheelchair
		
		as they volley the ball back and forth
		
					bobby
			you sure you should be playing
			carl
		
					carl
			what do you mean aside from my
			neck im in superb shape
		
		carl hits into the net and as the ball rebounds to
		him he tosses it to bobby
		
					bobby

			wrong with the way you move
		
		carl hits the net again
		
					carl
			im not aware of it like what
		
					bobby

					bobby contd
			id hate to see you walk across a
			concert stage like that
		
		carl tries a smash and mishits the ball
		
					bobby contd
			two  nineteen
		
		 and as he retrieves it
		
					carl
				irritated with bobby
			ive walked across a stage a number
			of times without exciting any
			particular response
		
					bobby
			thats what i mean
		
		carl comes back to the table
		
					carl
			any particular humor i meant
		
		he angrily serves the ball
		
					bobby
				returning
			i think you should get someone to
			coach you how to walk i think its
			a substantial problem
		
		he hits a smash and it sails past carl into some
		shrubbery several yards away
		
					carl
			dammit
		
		as he moves after the ball bobby gestures at him
		
					bobby
			look at that
		
					tita
			why are you being so mean
		
					bobby
			im not he does walk funny dont
			you see that
		
		she looks at carl bent over and searching through
		the shrubs
		
					tita
			i dont think id notice im so
			used to carl
		
					bobby
				wanting to go on about
				it
			yeah well hes
		
		she interrupts him looking toward spicer
		
					tita
			bobby do you think spicer is
			attractive
		
		he looks over at spicer polishing the frame of the
		wheelchair
		
					bobby
			i think hes got a terrific
			personality
		
					tita
			you know he was formerly a sailor
		
		bobby gestures his paddle at carl on his way back
		with the ball
		
					bobby
			look cant you see that what im
			talking about
		
					tita
			sailors are sadistic i feel
		
		carl comes up to the table asserting
		
					carl

			way i walk now where are we
		
					bobby
			at game carl
		
		carl serves and they volley briefly then bobby
		angles the ball sharply and puts it away
		
					bobby contd
			thats three games to none carl
		
					carl
			all right lets have a rematch
		
					bobby
			i thought you had to go to the
			mainland today arent you going to
			miss the ferry
		
		carl takes a quick glance at his watch then drops
		his paddle onto the table
		
					carl
			too bad just when i was hitting my
			stride
		
		he starts away then turns back
		
					carl contd
			say goodbye to catherine for me

					bobby

					tita
				ignoring the question
			my turn
		
		he hands her the paddle
		
					bobby
			why dont you and spicer play
		
		 and moves off toward the house
		
		int dupea home  upstairs hall  day
		
		bobby knocks on catherines door and hearing no
		response opens it and steps inside
		
		int catherines room  day
		
		he wanders about discreetly touching nothing but
		taking in some essence of catherine from her
		belongings and from the scent of her that lingers
		in the room
		
		his journey brings him into proximity with the
		windows and he pauses to look out at
		
		tita and spicer below
		
		playing table tennis
		
		he starts to move from the windows when he sees
		
		catherines car
		
		pulling into view and parking near the garage she
		gets out and carrying a shopping bag and a
		wrapped bouquet of flowers pauses on her way to
		the house to have some exchange with tita
		
		int dupea home  staircase  day
		
		on bobby
		
		quickly descending the staircase and following
		with him as he moves to the music room and goes
		inside leaving the door open
		
		int music room  day
		
		he crosses to one of the grands seats himself and
		rubs his hands together to warm them then
		scanning his mental repertoire he places his hands
		on the keyboard and begins to play a chopin etude
		
		presently catherine appears in the doorway she
		stands listening for a moment then places the
		shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the
		doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and
		sits down
		
		bobby glances at her then returns his eyes to the
		keyboard
		
		on catherine
		
		her features intensely concentrated as she listens
		to his playing
		
		on bobby
		
		apparently deep into the music on the wall behind
		him are the series of photographs seen in the
		opening and the present angle favors an 8yearold
		bobby in his dress suit playing a recital
		
		the camera moves down to his hands
		
		 then to catherine profoundly moved
		
		angle including both
		
		as bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude
		he lets his hands linger on the keys until the last
		overtones fade then he removes them to his lap
		
		after a brief silence
		
					catherine

			surprised
		
					bobby

					catherine
			i was really very moved by the way
			you
		
		unable to keep up the serious musician pose a
		brief derisive laugh issues from him
		
					catherine contd
			is that funny
		
					bobby
			it wasnt supposed to be it just
			struck me that way
		
					catherine
			why
		
					bobby
			nothing its just that i picked
			the easiest piece i could remember
			i think i first played it when i
			was 8 years old and i played it
			better then
		
					catherine
			it doesnt matter it was the
			feeling i was affected by
		
					bobby
			i didnt have any
		
					catherine
			you had no inner feeling
		
					bobby
			none
		
					catherine
			then i must have been supplying it
		
		she gets up and crosses toward the settee
		
					bobby
			wait
		
					catherine
			well at least youre accomplished
			at something
		
					bobby
			what
		
					catherine
			at being a fake
		
		and as she picks up the flowers and the shopping
		bag
		
					bobby
			catherine
		
					catherine
			no youre very good at it im
			really impressed
		
		she goes out the door
		
		bobby looks down at the keyboard he closes the
		cover and softly utters
		
					bobby
			shit
		
		int catherines bedroom  day
		
		she stands in front of a dresser mirror pinning up
		her hair preparatory to taking a bath her
		attention is drawn to
		
		 bobby entering and as he crosses to her she
		quickly turns back to the mirror
		
					bobby
			you think im a fake
		
					catherine
			i think its what you think
		
					bobby
			no it isnt what i think
		
					catherine
			look you made a very calculated
			move and then made me feel
			embarrassed for responding to you
			that wasnt necessary
		
		she moves away from him and he follows her
		
					bobby
			yes it was youve made it clear
			that if i can cut a little piano i
			might get a little response
		
					catherine
				stops and turns to him
			i dont think thats accurate
		
					bobby
			up to now what ive been getting
			from you are meaningful looks over
			the dinner table and a lot of vague
			suggestions about the day after
			tomorrow
		
					catherine
			im not conscious of having given
			you any meaningful looks and as
			for the day after tomorrow this is
			the day after tomorrow and i am
			unfortunately seeing you now if
			youll excuse me id like to take
			a bath
		
		she moves back to the dresser and as she begins
		searching through an array of bath oils on top of
		it bobby steps in beside her
		
					bobby
			its convenient to fake looking for
			something right now isnt it
		
					catherine
			im not faking anything im
			looking for some bath oil
		
					bobby
			some bath oil
		
		he lifts up one of the bottles
		
					bobby contd
			what about this one
				picking up another
			or this one
				and another
			how about some jasmine
				and another
			what about some musk
		
					cathfrine
			what are you doing
		
					bobby
				knocking the bottles
				over
			what are you doing screwing around
			with this crap
		
		a little intimidated by his aggressivity
		
					catherine
			i dont find your language that
			charming
		
					bobby
			its direct anyway which seems to
			be difficult for you
		
					catherine
			id like you to leave now is that
			direct enough
		
		he makes no move to go
		
					catherine contd
			youre not a serious person by
			your own admission and that may be
			interesting but it doesnt
			interest me
		
		needing the safety of distance she moves over to
		the windows next to the bed again he follows
		after her
		
					bobby
			serious thats whats important to
			you
		
					catherine
			yes thats whats important to
			me
		
		he takes her by the shoulders
		
					bobby
			okay lets be serious
		
		 and forces her onto the bed
		
					catherine
			no dont do that
		
					bobby
			shut up
		
		he hesitates for a moment full of things he wants
		to say and cannot catherine looks up at him
		uttering a quiet challenge
		
					catherine
			no inner feeling
		
					bobby
			thats right
		
					catherine
			i dont believe vou
		
		he leans down to her begins kissing her her arms
		encircle him and laying back on the bed she pulls
		his body onto hers fervently returning his kisses
		and as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery
		and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings a fade
		over begins to
		
		int catherines bedroom  day
		
		catherine and bobby lie side by side he watches
		her as she addresses the ceiling
		
					catherine
			i married him when i was 17 he was
			a cellist and i thought he was the
			most brilliant man id ever met
			and im sure he was because at
			that age i hadnt met that many
			but he was insidious you know he
			had me convinced that i was a
			mediocrity musically as a woman
			as an intellect but in this
			completely imperceptible pleasant
			way so that you werent even sure
			he was doing it anyway i just
			woke up one morning and i said you
			know something joseph youre full
			of beans and i left him
		
					bobby
			thats what you said
		
					catherine
			something witty and devastating
			like that
		
		she moves onto her side looking over at him
		
					catherine contd

			who introduced me to carl
				a pause then
			how are you
		
					bobby

		chopin over
		
		bobby and catherine walk over a path through a
		thickly wooded area that presently brings them in
		sight of the dupea house he stops and taking hold
		of her leans back against a tree kissing her
		when they break off and resume walking she takes
		one of his hands in both of hers and after looking
		at the scars and callouses accumulated by his years
		of manual labor she lays the hand against her

		the angle alters from them to
		
		ext dupea house  day

		int fishermans bar  mainland  night
		
		tammy wynettes dont touch me over
		
		bobby finishes the last of several drinks he ships
		a half pint into his jacket pocket lays some bills
		on the bar and moves toward the door
		
		ext fishermans bar  mainland  night
		
		wynette over
		
		thoroughly anesthetized he wanders aimlessly
		through the harborfront streets as he disappears
		into the dark the music fades
		
		ext wharf  mainland  dawn
		
		on bobby
		
		lying huddled on the boardwalk next to the boat
		slips the crying of the gulls and the sound of
		outgoing fishing launches awaken him disoriented
		he gets to his feet and hugging himself against
		the cold moves unsteadily down the dock
		
		ext ferry  morning
		
		bobbys car pulls off the ferry and approaches a
		line of cars waiting to board he sees catherine at
		the wheel of the first car and pulling abreast of
		her stops and rolls down his window
		
					bobby
			where are you going
		
					catherine
			im going to pick up some friends
			of carls are you all right
		
					bobby
			i have to talk to you
		
					catherine

		impatiently and continue to under the following
		
					bobby
			no i want to talk to you now i
			have to explain something about
		
					catherine
			no you dont have to it isnt
			necessary

					catherine
			please ill see you later this
			evening
		
		she pulls ahead and moves onto the ferry
		
		int dupea living room  night
		
		favoring samia glavia
		
		a friend of carls somewhere under the following
		the angle alters to include two other friends as
		well as carl catherine bobby and rayette seated
		around the living room variously captive to her
		monologue
		
					samia
			but the point is man is born into
			the world with a preexistent
			adversary both real and imaginary
			so youd have to say that
			aggression was one of his primary
			psychic inheritances which
		
		john fincher a professorial type attempts to
		interject
		
					fincher
			if i may beg to differ
		
					samia
			beg all you like john but the
			fact remains that man takes
			enormous delight in aggressive
			acts as well as the portrayal of
			aggressive acts and to be
			triumphant over another no matter
			how seems fundamental to his
			having a sense of well being as
			well as
		
					fincher
			no i dont quarrel with your
			inference but you draw too long a
			bow in your conclusions which seem
			unnecessarily harsh and
		
					samia
			well i dont make poetry as an
			analyst i
		
		rayette interrupts calling across the room to
		carl
		
					rayette
			is there a tv in the house
		
		carl starts to answer and is preempted by samia
		
					samia
			john believes in the basic goodness
			of man and thats fine but gaze
			into the pit like i have and that
			view seems a little soporific and
			not unlike television it hardly
			represents the real world
		
					rayette
			theres some good things on it
			though
		
					samia
			pardon me
		
					rayette
			the tv theres some good things on
			it sometimes
		
					samia
			i strongly doubt it but i wasnt
			really discussing media
		
					fincher
			if you really hold such bleak
			views how can you in good
			conscience carry on a practice
		
					samia
			oh theres always hope i think
			for a few individuals if theyre
			courageous enough to shed their
			illusions and their
		
					catherine
				cutting her off
			and what about love
		
					samia
			what about it wouldnt you agree
			that a great deal of mischief has
			been done in the name of love
		
					catherine
			no i wouldnt
		
					samia
			well youre a romantic catherine
			as are most musicians and whats
			more about to be married
		
		on bobby
		
		and his reaction as samia goes on
		
					samia
			 which should exclude you from
			any objective discussion but keep
			in mind even the arts arent free
			of aggressive content nor the
			institution of marriage
		
					catherine
			i think these cold objective
			discussions are aggressive
			samia
		
		she gets up and starts to move away
		
					samia
			but id like to say so that i
			dont dampen the spirit of your
			adventure
		
					catherine
				cutting her off
			you havent dampened my spirit
			samia excuse me
		
					samia
			well i should hope not
		
		she leaves the room with bobbys eyes following
		her and as carl moves over to sit beside rayette
		samia resumes to fincher while the other friend
		moves in beside bobby and tries to engage him in
		conversation
		
					samia contd
			because obviously there are loftier
			classes of people that do establish
			a kind of relating thats
			relatively free of etc
		
		on carl and rayette
		
		as she indicates titas dog lying near the
		fireplace
		
					rayette
			what kind of doggy is that
		
					carl
			its a borzoi
		
					rayette
			oh uh huh i had a little kittycat
			once that bobby give me
		
		she calls across to bobby interrupting samia
		
					rayette contd
			remember bobby the little
			pussycat you gave me
		
		bobby now feeling trapped by the other friend
		looks across to her ass she returns her attention
		to carl
		
					rayette contd
			she had four little white paws an
			oh was i crazy over her we hadda
			go an leave her one time at some
			friends an she went out an got
			smashed flattern a tortilla right
			outside their mobile home
		
		samia gestures toward rayette as if she were an
		example to prove her point
		
					samia
			there you see what i mean
		
		bobby looks over at samia
		
					samia contd
			the choice of words squashed
			flat juxtaposed against the image
			of a fluffy kitten
		
					rayette
			well she was
		
					samia
			perhaps
		
		she addresses fincher gesturing toward rayette
		again
		
					samia contd
			but you see how close that is to
			what im trying to
		
		bobby stands up cutting her off
		
					bobby
			dont sit there pointing at her
		
					samia
			i beg your pardon
		
					bobby
				advancing on her
			i said dont point at her like
			that what gives you the right to
			sit there and tell anybody about
			class and who the hells got it
			and what she typifies you
			shouldnt even be in the same room
			with her you creep
		
					samia
			carl this is really too much
		
					bobby
				to samia
			youre totally full of shit
		
					carl
			robert i think you better just
		
					bobby
				cutting him off
			youre all full of shit
		
		he turns away and exits the room
		
		int dupea home  night
		
		following with bobby
		
		running up the stairs and down the hall to
		catherines room he goes inside and not finding
		her comes quickly back into the hall as he moves
		down it opening other doors he begins calling her
		name
		
		he comes back down the stairs and runs into rayette
		at the bottom landing
		
					rayette
			bobby
		
					bobby
				moving past her
			i cant talk to you right now
			leave me alone
		
		he moves to the music room to the den then down
		the main hall to the kitchen which gives off to
		two other doors he opens one of them to see
		
		int spicers room  night
		
		tita and spicer though both are clothed they are
		caught in some stage of intimacy on top of spicers
		bed tita sits up immediately mortally
		embarrassed as bobby steps into the room
		
					bobby
			tita what the hell are you doing
		
		spicer stands up
		
					spicer
			hey this is my room
		
					bobby
				moving over to the bed
			whats going on here
		
					tita
			its none of your business
		
					bobby
			wheres catherine
		
					tita
			i dont know where she is
		
		spicer moves to bobby taking hold of his arm
		
					spicer
			dont you believe in knocking pal
		
		bobby roughly pushes him away and advances on tita
		
					bobby
			im talking to you tita
		
					tita
				close to tears
			cant i have anything to myself 
			dammit
		
					spicer
				grabbing hold of him
				again
			come on now out
		
					bobby
				struggling with him
			keep your fucking hands off my
			sister nurse
		
		spicer goes into sudden rage pushing bobby
		violently toward the door and yelling
		
					spicer
			did you hear me move out
		
		bobby leaps at him and as their struggle carries
		them into the kitchen tita begins yelling
		
					tita
			stop it bobby will just you stop
			i mean it
		
		spicer gets bobby into a painful headlock and is
		being bulled around the kitchen by him
		
					spicer
			hold it just hold it
		
		they crash into the kitchen table knocking chairs
		over
		
					tita
			carl somebody get carl
		
		bobby rams spicer into the refrigerator
		
					spicer
			take it easy dammit
		
		he hurls him against the kitchen wall still
		holding him in a headlock as tita enters the
		kitchen
		
					tita
			stop it right now just stop it
			carl
		
		and as she runs from the room spicer begins
		violently jerking his forearm up against bobbys
		trachea punctuating each jerk with the repeated
		command
		
					spicer
			give up give up give up give up
			give up give up
		
		he feels bobbys body slacken he releases him and
		bobby drops to the floor as
		
		 carl catherine and tita run into the kitchen
		looking to
		
		bobby gasping for air tries to get up from the
		floor and unable to slumps back against the
		kitchen wall
		
					tita
			oh god bobby look what youve
			done
		
		he looks past her to catherine
		
					bobby
			i just wanted to talk to you for a
			minute
		
		ext bayfront  day
		
		catherine and bobby sit on a low stone wall
		bordering the dupea property each is staring out
		at the ocean and after a moment
		
					catherine
			no its useless robert it
			wouldnt work not ever
		
					bobby
			just give me a chance will you
		
					catherine
			im trying to be delicate with you
			but youre not understanding me
			its not just because of carl or
			my music but because of you
				she looks at him
			i mean what would it come to if a
			person has no love for himself no
			respect no love for his work his
			family his friends something
			how can he ask for love in return
			i mean why should he ask for it
		
		profoundly wounded he looks away from her
		
					bobby
			and living out here in this rest
			home asylum thats what you want
		
					catherine
			yes
		
					bobby
				looking back to her
			thatll make you happy
		
					catherine
			i hope it will yes
				she pauses then
			im sorry
		
		needing to distance herself from witnessing his
		pain she gets up and moves out of frame
		
		his eyes move from her to look out over the bay
		and after a brief silence he softly utters
		
					bobby
			okay
		
		ext country  day
		
		bobby pushes nicholass wheelchair along a path
		between fields of tall grasses and wildflowers he
		stops and moves around to the front of the chair
		
					bobby
			are you cold
		
		he leans over to adjust the blanket covering
		nicholass legs and hunkering down in front of
		him glances around at the fields searching for
		articulation
		
					bobby contd
			i dont know if youd be
			particularly interested in hearing
			anything about me my life i
			mean most of it doesnt add up
			to much that i could relate as a
			way of life that youd approve
			of
		
		he pauses briefly then
		
					bobby contd
			id like to be able to tell you
			why but i dont really i mean
			i move around a lot because things
			tend to get bad when i stay and
			im looking for auspicious
			beginnings i guess
		
		he breaks off again resuming with evident
		difficulty
		
					bobby contd
			im trying to you know imagine
			your half of this conversation
			my feeling is that if you could
			talk we probably wouldnt be
			talking thats pretty much how it
			got to be before i left
				another pause
			are you all right
		
		he searches his fathers face entreating him for
		some kind of answer some sign of response and
		seeing none
		
					bobby contd
			i dont know what to say
		
		 he breaks down barely able to utter the
		following
		
					bobby contd
			tita suggested that we try to i
			dont know i think that she
			seems to feel weve got some
			understanding to reach she
			totally denies the fact that we
			were never that comfortable with
			each other to begin with
				pauses trying to gain
				control
			the best i can do is apologize
		
		he looks silently at his father for a moment
		
					bobby contd
			we both know i was never really
			that good at it anyway
		
		 then bowing bis head
		
					bobby contd
			im sorry it didnt work out
		
		ext dupea house  day
		
		bobby comes out the front door he carries his

		int gas station  mens room  day
		
		bobby removes his jacket and lays it on top of the
		waste container he moves to the wash basin and
		stands a moment gazing absently down at it his
		mind searching for that inward oblivion in which
		nothing much is demanded nothing much felt
		
		then leaning over and placing his hands on the rim
		of the basin
		
		 he lifts his gaze to the mirror and after
		minutely perusing the features of his face looks
		into his own eyes as he had into his fathers
		silently beseeching them for guidance
		
		ext mens room  gas station  day
		
		sound of semis motor over
		
		remote angle as bobby comes out of the mens room
		he has left his jacket inside and stands for a
		moment looking at the
		
		 driver bending down to check the undercarriage
		of the semi as he stands up and circuits the front
		of the truck heading for the cab
		
					bobby
				faintly audible
			hey wait a minute
		
		he moves over to him and after a brief exchange
		the driver nods his bead and continues on to the
		cab bobby moves to the passenger door and climbs

		giving view to bobbys car the attendant is
		cleaning the windshield and rayette can be seen
		opening the passenger door as she gets out and
		surveys the area for some sign of bobby the semi
		moves into view going north on the highway
		
		rayette looks over the hood of the car addressing
		the attendant he gestures toward the mens room
		and as she moves across the station and disappears
		off the screen
		
		 the semi recedes in the distance leaving a
		black trail of smoke from its exhaust stack
		dissipating in the air
