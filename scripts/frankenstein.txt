               titles unfold in blackness as we are lulled by the distant 
               flutelike sounds of a recorder overall the effect is 
               mournful and haunting elegant and serene

               and we crash to

               ext  barents sea  night

               a storm of inconceivable force and violence merciless 
               arctic winds whip the sea in a frenzy of thirtyfoot swells

               this is the last place in gods creation that any human being 
               should be and yet

               the prow of a threemasted ship rises massively before 
               us looming from the darkness and chaos it crashes upward 
               through a swell and slams back down again plunging nose 
               first into the trough the sails on the forward mast are 
               still deployed its insane in this weather they should be 
               stowed as is already the case with masts 2 and 3

               hurtling toward us rising and falling thundering through 
               the swells and as she sweeps past camera within a seeming 
               hairbreadth we pan with the ship and find ourselves

               ext  ship  night

               aboard the alexander nevsky along for the ride whether 
               we like it or not there are men all around us dark screaming 
               figures glimpsed and halfglimpsed heavy oilskin clothes 
               flapping in the gale a group of men are in a lifeordeath 
               tug of war

                                     walton
                         pull you bastards pull

               riiiiippp all eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears 
               loose the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing 
               tatters the jibarm wrenches free and plummets toward us 
               trailing rope and fabric the men dive aside as the jib 
               smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb splintered 
               shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel

               walton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face 
               down on the pitching deck

               grigori the first mate scrambles to waltons aid walton 
               shoves him off pushes painfully to his knees lightning 
               throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury 
               blood is streaming from his hairline freezing in his eyes 
               staining his teeth he gazes up at the mainsail still intact 
               and straining against the wind we hear a huge crack

               the base of the mast is starting to give

                                     walton
                         cut the damn rigging free before we 
                         lose the mast

               longhandled axes are grabbed from their mounts frantic men 
               begin hacking at the ropes walton snatches an axe from a 
               passing crewman and elbows his way to the front he attacks 
               a guyrope with primal fury camera rising and falling with 
               the motion of his axe suddenly a chilling cry from high 
               above

               the lookout is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope 
               knotted at the chest he points ahead

               walton and the others spin to look as a panoramic shot of 
               the barents sea reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury 
               the ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting 
               the ocean like boulders in a quarry the nevsky is plying 
               these waters like a man running pellmell through a mine 
               field

               an iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the 
               foreground rumbling within yards of the camera wiping us 
               into darkness

               ext  nevsky  night

               and we wipe from darkness as a flapping piece of canvas 
               billows away to reveal walton and the crew gazing in 
               breathless horror as an iceberg looms from the gale before 
               them like a ghostly white mountain walton finds his voice

                                     walton
                         hard to port

               the pilot fights to turn the wheel men rush to his aid 
               throw their backs into it straining to the limit the wheel 
               is grudging fighting them every inch of the way

               push in on walton and the crew

               the lookout fumbles under his coat grabs the rosary around 
               his neck clutches the crucifix tightly in both hands face

               world and the audience on its ear iceberg looming  for a 
               brief moment we seem to be veering past but then we swing 
               back in a final churning vertiginous plunge

               and smack the ice

               various quickcut angles

               base with a thunderous crack and begins to topple in a 
               symphony of shattering wood and tangled rigging

               the lookout on mast 2 is vaulted through the railing of the 
               crows nest screaming through the air arms and legs 
               windmilling as he plummets headfirst toward the deck below 

               and is jerked to an abrupt stop by the safety line around 
               his chest we hear another horrible crack the sound of 
               his back breaking

               men are sliding tumbling screaming mast 1 completes its 
               fall slamming massively to the deck shattering a section 
               of the gunwale to splinters utter panic total chaos

               sheer mortal terror and as the sequence builds to a final 
               brainsplitting crescendo of sound and fury we

               total stunning silence

               a glittering wasteland of ice breathlessly cold even the 
               sun seems frozen barely hanging on the horizon pellets of 
               snow scour the permafrost like broken glass driven by a 
               desolate arctic wind its as if hell had erupted through 
               the floor of the earth in the form of ice nothing could 
               survive here nothing 

               slow pan reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice tilted at 
               a permanent list silent we see no signs of life

               various lingering angles provide ominous detailshots of the 
               nevsky

               a flap of frozen canvas creaks in the wind

               the pilots wheel is now a crystalline sculpture of ice the 
               forward mast lies across the deck like a broken limb 
               extending out over the ice on a tangle of rigging

               the ships prow is smashed open above the water line

               a familiar rosary lies broken on the deck beads scattered 
               a tiny christ figure lies with arms thrown wide painted 
               eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice

               from the top of mast 2 a breathtaking perspective of the 
               entire ship below guaranteed to induce vertigo the corpse 
               of the lookout is suspended below us at the end of the frozen 
               rope his posture mimics the christ figure his arms thrown 
               wide dead eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet 
               of ice a ghastly stilllife the corpse twisting everso
               slightly on the wind rope creaking

               a sailor thrusts into frame swaying precariously in the 
               rigging widen to reveal two more men as they reach out with 
               long gaffing poles to snag the corpse

               walton watches them reel the body in angle shifts as he 
               turns revealing the rest of the crew working desperately to 
               free the ship axes and picks rise and fall in waves slamming 
               into the ice throwing up frozen chips the men are near 
               collapse exhaustion carved in their faces the dogs are 
               nearby huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow walton 
               rejoins the men rams his axe fiercely into the ice

                         the ice will break and when it does 
                         we proceed north as planned

               cries of dismay from the men grigori thrusts his arm toward 
               the sky pointing at the corpse on the mast

                                     grigori
                         at the cost of how many more lives

               hes interrupted by a long chilling howl the lead husky 
               rises to its feet hackles up howling at some unseen thing 
               in the distance the other dogs start rising around him 
               joining in staring off across the ice

                                     grigori
                         theres something out there

               the dogs are going berserk the lead husky breaks free and 
               launches himself across the ice the men scramble to restrain 
               the animals but three more break away and take off after 
               their leader walton snatches up his rifle

                                     walton

               ice toward us the men trail substantially behind

               boom down to the icy boulders fg a massive hand comes 
               briefly to rest in one of the crags ghastly gray skin 
               rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins brutal 
               surgical scars marring the wrist a huge dark figure wipes 
               frame fleeing into the rocks the dogs come bounding past 
               in pursuit snarling and slavering

               the running men hear an inhuman howl rise amidst those of 
               the dogs a vicious freeforall echoes from the rocks

               barking gives way to shrill squeals an object is launched 
               from the crags catapulted through the air in a high arc

               some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground 
               with tremendous impact before them

               and they find themselves staring in horror at the sight 
               of the lead dog silence now those who have fallen rise

               walton cocks his rifle the group proceeds picks and axes 
               held ready slowly skirting the rocks

               and the massacre is revealed bloodstained ice dead 
               mangled animals strewn about one twitching survivor crawls 
               toward them on broken limbs whining piteously dragging its 
               entrails in a red smear

               they follow his gaze bloody tracks lead away from the bodies 
               ascending the rocks most are smeared and vague but one 
               is clearly a bare human footprint several men cross 
               themselves walton shoulders the rifle aims down at the 
               surviving dog blam a single bullet to the brain ends its 
               misery punching a halo of blood onto the ice the shot echoes 
               for miles

               huddled against the cold breath punching the air with billows 
               of vapor a massive crackling is heard a young sailor spins

               rifle aimed at the sky the men wait holding their breath 
               scanning the darkness

               an apparition looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe 
               of ice silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis 
               the figures pose is uncanny and weird neither standing nor 
               kneeling but something in between arm dangling at its side 
               and lolling slowly with the motion of the current

               the pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box 
               spotlight and swings it around the beam seeks out the specter 
               and pins it in a dim circle of light revealing a man 
               collapsed on a dog sled lashed to tiller upright stanchions 
               with frozen leather straps dead dogs lie in icy heaps around 
               him

               grappling lines are unslung and thrown the ice floe snagged 
               gaffs reach out drawing it closer men clasp arms forming 
               a human chain grigori is the first to reach the motionless 
               figure on the dog sled

               grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the 
               furred hood to search the neck for a pulse

               and the figure scares the shit out of him with a 
               convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath the hood 
               rises up revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost 
               beard frozen solid eyes blazingly intelligent and aware 
               walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with 
               victor frankenstein

               ext  nevsky  on deck  night

               a howling wind has kicked up pelting the huddled sentries 
               with sleet camera tracks past moving steadily toward the 
               dimlyglowing window of waltons cabin

               int  waltons cabin  night

               where we find walton and grigori in tense discussion

                                     grigori
                         captain i implore you the men are 
                         frightened and angry they want your 
                         assurance

                                     walton
                         they knew the risks when they signed 
                         on ive come too far to turn back 
                         now

                                     grigori
                         then you run the danger of pushing 
                         them to mutiny

               walton pulls a pistol from his drawer and slams it flat on 
               the table before him

                                     walton
                              low tight
                         let them try

               grigori is taken aback he hears a shifting of blankets and 
               glances to the captains bed walton follows his look

               frankenstein has awakened and is watching them

               grigori exits uneasy under frankensteins gaze walton rises 
               retrieves a pot from the stove

                                     walton

               victor draws a hand from under the blanket and holds it before 
               his face fingers skeletal and black

                                     victor

               int  grand ballroom  frankenstein mansion  day

               we hear a harpsichord begin playing as a wider angle reveals 
               a huge magnificent room with vaulted ceilings thirty feet 
               high floortoceiling windows hanging tapestries

               victor sits at the harpsichord a very serious 7 yearold in 
               his little gentlemans suit and stiff starched collar

               lesson her daughter justine age 4 sits with her doll in a 
               huge wingback chair making it dance to the music as she 
               listens but her eyes are on victor she adores him

               an enormous door swings open victor stops playing his 
               parents enter ushering a somber and beautiful elizabeth 
               age 6 across the vast expanse of floor victor slides off 
               the bench and faces them

                                     father

               and elizabeth as her mother whisks her off

                         sister you must look after her and 
                         be kind to her

               victor stares at elizabeth she returns the gaze evenly 
               selfpossessed and dignified even at this young age

                                     arctic victor vo

               a massive bolt of lightning hammers from the sky reducing a 
               centuriesold oak tree to smoldering ruin

               int  downstairs parlor  night

               while victor gazes at the storm face pressed against a 
               window astonished at the sight

               lightning throws seething shadows of the rain on his face

                                     mother

               staircase from below as lightning sends wild banister shadows 
               skittering he caroms down the hall toward

               int  elizabeths room  night

               victor enters elizabeth is a tiny figure huddled in an adult
               size bed gazing up with tearstreaked face at the huge 
               skylights in the vaulted ceiling dreading the next scary 
               boom and flash victor approaches and whispers

                                     victor

                         well build a fort so the lightning 
                         cant get us

               he races about the room grabbing every pillow he can find 
               and hurling them to her big decorative pillows from the 
               chaise bed pillows from the armoire they all come flying 
               she giggles as a big one knocks her flat victor scampers 
               onto the bed with her they pile the pillows around and above 
               concealing themselves in a bulging heap of cushions

               inside the pillowfort

               victor pokes his hand up widening a space so they can still 
               see lightning glistens in their upturned eyes

                                     elizabeth
                         are you sure it cant hurt us

               victor and elizabeth gamely work their way across the vast 
               room tripping on each others toes they pass within inches 
               of camera bodies wiping frame

               int  grand ballroom  day ten years later

               and they sweep from before our eyes waltzing away from 
               camera to reveal victor now 17 intense and handsome as he 
               approaches manhood elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful 
               beauty at 16 mrs moritz is still conducting the lessons

               theyre certainly the envy of justine who gazes at victor 
               as he sweeps elizabeth around the room in his arms she isnt 
               concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard her mother throws 
               her a look of reproval

                                     mrs moritz
                         justine surely you can maintain

                         yes mama

               flustered she puts her attention back on the keyboard as 
               victor and elizabeth keep dancing swirling fluidly about 
               the room their attention only on each other

               int  upstairs hallway  night

               a skylight above us a storm is raging rain drumming the 
               glass we hear screaming in the house tilt down to victor 
               perched at the edge of a settee seething with tension

               waiting elizabeth is with him she squeezes his arm trying 
               to reassure him

                         shell be all right

               another scream rips down the hallway justine comes scurrying 
               up the stairs about to enter his parents room with a fresh 
               load of sheets victor lunges to his feet and intercepts 
               trying to push past her but finds the doorway implacably 
               blocked by mrs moritz

                                     mrs moritz
                         you can do nothing here wait 
                         downstairs

               he can see his mother in the dim kerosene light writhing 
               and screaming on the bed belly swollen and distended his 
               father sleeves rolled up works feverishly to save her

                                     victor

               justine glances at victor longing to comfort him she 
               squeezes past into the room the door slams in his face he 
               turns to elizabeth eyes brimming with terror

               the stump of the longdead oak tree pokes from the earth in

                         to say the least i came here to 
                         expand my mind but honest inquiry 
                         seems strangled at every turn all 
                         we do is cling to the old knowledge 
                         instead of seeking the new

                                     waldman
                         you disdain accepted wisdom

                                     victor
                         no i embrace it as something to 
                         be used or discarded as we advance 
                         the boundaries of what is known

                         these are exciting times henry 
                         were entering an era of amazing 
                         breakthroughs look at edward jenner 
                         he wasnt content to bleed people 
                         with leeches he pioneered a new 
                         frontier of thought

                                     henry

                         has been virtually eliminated ive 
                         heard this speech before

                                     victor
                         but you havent listened never in 
                         history has so much seemed possible 
                         were on the verge of answers undreamt 
                         of but only if we have the courage 
                         to ask the questions

                                     waldman
                         i understand your frustration i was 
                         young once myself

                         show you

               int  waldmans home  workshop  night

               the gaslights come up with a soft hiss the first thing victor 
               and henry notice is an artists nook situated adjacent to 
               big windows where the light would be best during the day 
               easels are lined with inprogress work on a variety of 
               subjects everything from landscapes to anatomical studies 
               all quite excellent

               the rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floortorafter 
               with arcane equipment taking off his coat and rolling up 
               his sleeves waldman leads victor and henry down rows of 
               tables crammed with experiments and clutter

                                     waldman
                         you know for thousands of years the 
                         chinese have based their medical 
                         science on the belief that the human 
                         body is a chemical engine run by 
                         electricity they say we all contain 
                         streams of energy which flow through 
                         us like currents in the ocean or 
                         rivers in the earth

               they arrive at a table waldman roots through a tray of 
               knickknacks holds up an acupuncture needle

                                     waldman
                         their doctors treat patients by 
                         inserting needles like these into 
                         the flesh at various key points to 
                         manipulate these electric streams

               he directs their attention to an ancient chinese silk on the 
               wall it depicts the human body from front and side angles

               acupuncture points are clearly marked

                                     victor
                         preposterous

                                     waldman
                         i once saw it done as a boy in 
                         canton my parents were missionaries 
                         the cure was nothing short of 
                         miraculous
                              off their looks
                         ive never forgotten it been 
                         fascinated ever since

                                     henry
                         it smacks of magic

               waldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal 
               an enormous dead toad in dissection copper mounting pins 
               trail wires to a small panel of switches the switches in 
               turn are connected to a series of galvanic batteries

               waldman starts throwing switches victor and henry jump as 
               the toad convulses with motion they watch stunned as 
               waldman puts the toad through its paces legs kick feet 
               flex mouth opens and closes lungs breathe

                                     waldman
                         magic seems alive doesnt it

               waldman shuts the thing down strips off his gloves his arm 
               at the array of wires and batteries

                                     waldman
                         electricity

                                     victor
                         its utterly fantastic this is the 
                         sort of thing im talking about we 
                         should be learning this

                                     waldman
                         why god alone knows what it means 
                         until it has proven value its 
                         nothing more than a ghoulish parlor 
                         trick hardly fit for the classroom

                                     victor
                         but the possibilities combining 
                         ancient knowledge with new something 
                         like this could change our fundamental 
                         views

                                     waldman
                         it is a thrilling direction to 
                         explore thrilling and dangerous
                              off his look
                         nature can be wonderful and terrible 
                         science is not a realm for the 
                         reckless it needs a conscience we 
                         must proceed cautiously assess as 
                         we go

                                     victor
                         i doubt that decision is still mine 
                         to make

                                     waldman

                         apology to professor krempe

               victor starts to object but waldman overrides him with a 
               stern gesture for silence listen

                                     waldman
                         a sincere and heartfelt apology 
                         which you will then read aloud to 
                         him before the assembled student

               dangled before him by a smiling jeweler he glances to henry 
               for an opinion

                                     henry

               tight angle on the locket lying open against canvas dangling 
               from an easel frame tilt down to reveal a magnificent 
               miniature oil portrait of victor in progress no more than 
               three inches high within its penciled oval

               waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch 
               jewelers glasses riding low on his nose eyes unnaturally 
               large behind the magnifying lenses victor sits patiently 
               for the portrait suffused with daylight

               henry leans in over waldmans shoulder studying the portrait 
               waldman stiffens a bit aware of his presence he clearly 
               hates people looking over his shoulder

                         shouldnt the nose be above the mouth

               waldman heaves a longsuffering sigh he abruptly jabs his 
               brush at henrys nose daubing it with paint dignity upheld 
               he resumes his careful work as victor laughs

               it happens this fast theres an innocuous blur of motion as 
               the man seems to tap waldman lightly in the stomach then he 
               darts away slamming past victor and henry victor looks 
               after him running away hears something clatter to the floor 
               he glances down a thin knife victor looks to waldman 
               puzzled it still hasnt really dawned

               waldman turns to them face drained of color hand pressed 
               to his sternum lips tight he looks more annoyed than 
               anything else he exhales slowly

               thats when the blood starts pumping through his fingers 
               they catch him as he collapses cradling him as he sprawls 
               to the floor people are pushing and crowding to see

                         thereafter to be consigned to an 
                         unmarked paupers grave so the court 
                         has spoken

               the executioner draws the hood over the murderers head 
               cinches the noose tight the condemned man is blubbering 
               pleading for his life

               victor stands in the crowd watching waiting we hear the 
               thump of the body dropping the crack of a snapping neck

               dark as hades pissing down rain a flash of lightning and a 
               crash of thunder the dead man still hangs from the scaffold 
               lashed by the wind

               victor looms from the storm hands jammed in the pocket of 
               his greatcoat he pulls out a thin glittering blade the 
               very weapon which took waldmans life he gazes up at the 
               dead man at the rope from which he dangles

               the dead murderer lies pale and naked on a slab victor leans 
               close still dripping studying the face closely a flash of 
               lightning throws wild skittering shadows through the dormer 
               windows and skylights softly

               flopping and convulsing eyes opening and closing mouth 
               gaping open and shut he falls back limply as victor shuts 
               the power off making careful notations in his journal

               tracking the dissection table up the length of the 
               murderers body now in an advanced stage of decay we 
               hear the soft buzzing of flies

               we find victor standing over the corpse gaunt and hollow 
               eyed exhausted and obsessed wearing a butchers apron 
               staring down at one of the dead mans forearms maggots are 
               swarming in the flesh he abruptly raises a cleaver and whacks 
               it off at the elbow

               tracking slowly past the forearm lying in a steel pan we 
               find victor performing an intense chemical analysis dead 
               tissues are breaking apart in solvents distilled over a 
               slowburning flame victor smears a glass slide places it 
               under a microscope

               victor pulls on a chain hoisting the body off the slab via 
               blockandtackle mounted on a ceiling track the body rises 
               limply into the air spinning slowly arms and legs dangling 
               long black hair covering its face

                                     arctic victor vo
                         a patchwork man of my own devising

               victor reaches up with one hand to stop the body spinning

               he pushes it down the length of the lab rolling it along 
               its ceiling track like a side of beef in a meat locker

               int  victors garret  night

               the creature lies on an improvised bier of crates surrounded 
               by shadows and clutter drapedsprawled like christ taken 
               from the cross in michelangelos pieta

               beakers bubbling and dripping intravenous lines seeping and 
               secreting a misty chemical haze in the air  victor is 
               watching his patchwork man glowering waiting

                                     arctic victor vo
                         it took nutrients like a child 
                         receiving milk blushed like a 
                         young girl with the blood i forced 
                         through its veins

               a flash of lightning rips through the skylights bathing the 
               scene purplewhite eerier and eerier

               victors garret  day

               we find victor passed out in a chair his creation is still 
               taking fluids gray daylight streams through the windows

               theres commotion in the street outside shouting horses 
               hooves clattering on cobblestone an occasional scream or 
               wail victor doesnt stir dead to the world somebody starts 
               pounding on the door victor rouses takes a moment to 
               remember where he is he lurches from his chair grabs a 
               canvas tarp throws it over his patchwork man

               henry peers past him

               victor shifts blocking his view

               heads back down the stairs

               ext  victors building  street  day

               henry exits into a nightmare refugees are streaming from 
               the city horses and wagons people on foot carrying their 
               possessions henry steps into the street and is nearly run 
               down by a carriage

                                     voice os
                         out of the way

               henry glances up to see schiller at the reins struggling to 
               control the animals as the carriage eases past

                                     henry
                         schiller youre leaving wheres

                         to hell with them and you

               he snaps the reins not caring who he runs down the carriage 
               lurches away scattering refugees before it

               henry keeps walking jostled by the hostile crowd looking 
               around dazed dead bodies are stacked along the street like 
               cordwood waiting for the death carts angle widens as henry 
               stumbles along through utter despair and devastation stunned 
               at the human suffering around him as we

                                                                   fade to

               int  victors garret  night

               victor glances at the clock scribbles in his journal

                                     victor
                         time running out rate of decay 
                         accelerating must strike now or 
                         start again from scratch

               he gazes down at his creation lying once again on the slab 
               before him but now the creature lies on a full bodylength 
               steel grate steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling 
               above along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped 
               with glittering needles big enough to knit with

               victor glances up at the da vinci the study of man has been 
               daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points victor dips 
               a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine starts dabbing 
               identical marks on the body before him

               now hes ramming the huge wirefed needles deep into these 
               spots brutally working them around in the flesh to get good 
               contact the forearms the neck the rib cage

               now hes attaching the steel chainhooks to the four corners 
               of the steel grate

               now hes pulling on a rope straining to hoist the whole rig 
               into the air it lifts slowly from frame body needles 
               wires and all

               high wide angle

               and we get our first spectacular look at frankensteins 
               gloriously lowtech and stupendously arcane lab the creature 
               dangles below us from the ceilinghoist lying fulllength 
               and horizontal on its steel grate spinning slowly thick 
               copper wires trailing from its arms and legs rib cage and 
               neck armpits and groin the copper cables trail upward 
               coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary 
               slack meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous 
               array of galvanic batteries steam engines and generators 

               frankenstein reaches slowly up fingertips straining toward 
               the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly 
               above his head in a perfectlydescribed circle not at all 
               unlike the da vinci

               and he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it 
               spinning with a mighty heave he sets the whole thing gliding 
               in motion camera tracking faster and faster as he rolls it 
               along the ceiling track through the lab passing table after 
               table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps lightning 
               blazing through the windows to mark his way with wild and 
               sinister shadows

               and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper 
               sarcophagus amniotic fluid steaming and murky within he 
               positions the platform unties the rope lowers the creature 
               down and down lower and lower sinking into the vat the 
               steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape

               faster now moving furiously reaching into the murk 
               unhooking the chains arraying the copper wire through air 
               tight guide holes spinning on his heels and reaching up 
               grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also 
               suspended from the ceiling stunningly heavy gleaming with 
               reflections and secrets camera rockets down on victor as he 
               swings the upper shell into position lowers it into place 
               with a thudclank working the wingnuts on the bolts 
               spinning frantically tightening them down sealing the 
               sarcophagus airtight faster now faster

               the frenzy builds and the camera goes wild rocketing 
               zooming gliding spinning the audience on its ear

               frankenstein turning up the heat on the burners cooking 
               the copper from below double double toil and trouble

               frankenstein gazing through the thick glass portholes 
               checking on his creation drifting in the murk

               frankenstein whipping up the galvanic batteries 
               supercharging them with steam generators watching as they 
               send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables 
               along the ceiling beams building up a charge

               frankenstein gazing at his gleaming handiwork lightning 
               painting his features into a twisted mask hand on the switch 
               ready to rev it up and throw the throttle

               over it goes wham overdrive

               the body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first 
               jolt of electricity hits thunkthunkthunk blazing with 
               energy and arcane light fingers of light throbbing through 
               the portholes sparkling glittering seeking

               frankenstein races to the sarcophagus a long glass tube 
               two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel gets lowered on 
               a boom and rammed into a hole collate spun tight inner dam 
               wrenched out like a polaroid plate

               he reaches up and grabs holds of a pullchain fingers going 
               knucklewhite on the wooden handle one hard yank a dump 
               tank is released murky water cascading down the glass tube 
               and heres the final perversion the ultimate icing on this 
               twisted cake the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb 
               with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming 
               phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels 
               wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm

               eel pov in the tube

               rocketing down the tube slithering and squirming faster 
               and faster racing into the sarcophagus seeking out the 
               creation in the murky wombfluid lashing at the hapless 
               gray flesh zapping it again with highintensity voltage 
               the creature convulsing thrashing jerking from side to 
               side raising its head against the top mouth gaping open 
               and shut jaws snapping with electrical surges

               frankensteins face appears at the porthole peering in 
               watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child

                                     victor
                              muffled through the 
                              glass
                         live you bastard

               a huge bony hand slaps against the porthole fingers clawing 
               and spasming against the glass

               frankenstein jerks his head back stunned the fingers are 
               scratching he turns runs to the electrical rig shutting 
               the whole thing down it cycles off whining into silence

               inside the sarcophagus

               and the body relaxes shutting down with it going limp 
               and lifeless in the murk spasms trailing off

               frankenstein stares at the sarcophagus realizing his creation 
               has stopped moving nothing now he sags to his knees utterly 
               devastated at the loss of his dream nothing

               it was all for nothing

               inside the sarcophagus

               and the creature opens its dim yellow eyes aware its 
               mouth goes wide teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries 
               to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid

               frankenstein is wrapped in his despair face cradled in his 
               hands a soft tap he glances over his fingers thinking he 
               imagined it no theres another tap and another

               we see it in his eyes sheer joy and stunned exultation

               triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime a bare whisper

                                     victor
                         its alive its alive

               and then hell breaks loose massive convulsions wrack the 
               sarcophagus damn near shaking it off its cradle thump 
               thumpthump pounding from within head ramming against the 
               inner lid he races over frantic fingers fumbling on the 
               wingnuts spinning them loose trying to free the drowning 
               man within he unscrews the final bolt reaches for the rope 
               to hoist the lid away

               and the lid launches itself across the room propelled 
               from below with rocketbooster force the massive copper 
               shell goes hurtlingspinningcartwheeling across the lab 
               demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path and 
               thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry 
               and splintering coat rack victors greatcoat goes flying

               silence frankenstein is frozen staring at the roiling 
               surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles an eternity 
               passes in the space of a heartbeat

               the creature erupts from the vat like a vision from hell 
               thrashing and gagging murky fluid cascading in all 
               directions the creature seizes victor by the shirtfront 
               trying to pull itself from the vat slipping and sliding 
               like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil damn near dragging 
               victor in eels leaping and frothing and crackling with 
               electricity victor screaming trying to pull away trying 
               to break the creatures grip

               and the whole thing tips over victor reels back falling 
               as the vat slams to the ground cascading its murky contents 
               washing the creature limply across the floor like a body 
               tossed from the ocean eels flipping and flopping snapping 
               electrical discharges into the air victor scrambles back 
               slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck desperately jerking 
               his legs away he finds his traction and scrambles to his 
               feet

               the creature is grasping and crawling toward him flopping 
               and jerking gripped by seizures and convulsions vomiting 
               murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the 
               fluid swiping the air with palsied hands malfunctional

               victor stands dripping fluid and goo chest heaving staring 
               down at the creature not quite able to believe he was midwife 
               to this ghastly birth softly

                                     victor
                         what have i done

               the creature lunges to its knees grasping him clutching 
               his clothes pawing him

                                     victor
                         let go of me

               victor cant break free panicking he snatches a hammer 
               from a nearby table and brings it down on the creatures 
               head thud again and again beating the thing down pounding 
               it into submission the creature finally collapses sliding 
               down victors legs curling up like a fetus twitching and 
               jerking in its own afterbirth

               silence now

               a ghastly tableau victor stands in the middle of his ruined 
               lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a 
               dying heap a flash of lightning silently bathes the room 
               jerking wild shadows across the walls

               victor steps over the creature dazed he drops the hammer 
               it clatters to the floor he stops to jot a final entry

                                     victor
                         massive birth defects result is 
                         malfunctional and vile
                              beat
                         have chosen to abort

               he walks stiffly away disappears into the bedroom

               int  bedroom  night

               where he staggers to the canopied bed beyond exhausted 
               and collapses facedown into oblivion weeping

                                                                   fade to

               a frightened child peering from under a blanket lost and 
               confused

               creature watches through the wire and wood as felix approaches 
               and stops only his legs visible feed is scattered through 
               the wire the chickens begins to eat the creature backs up

               pigsty  dusk

               and finds himself in the company of pigs the animals 
               grunt and squeal in alarm

                                     felix os
                         yes yes im coming

               the creature scurries further back into the shadows as felixs 
               feet stop just outside a pail is upended slop pours into 
               the trough felix walks away the pigs scurry to eat the 
               creature leans forward intently food

               he crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs they 
               jostle but he jostles right back wanting his fair share 
               he laps up the slop with his fingers dribbling it down his 
               chin not much on taste but its edible

               he stops hearing the recorder music again turning toward 
               the sound he follows it crawling back into the darkest 
               recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house he 
               places his eye to a chink between the logs

               and sees grandfather playing the instrument near a 
               fireplace of glowing embers the creature shifts for another 
               view sees the family preparing the table for dinner felix 
               and his wife marie are helped by their children maggie and 
               thomas ages 6 and 8

                                     marie
                         bring grandfather to the table

               the old man stops playing as the children scurry over as 
               maggie helps him to his feet thomas tosses another log on 
               the fire it blazes up fire and sparks in the pigsty the 
               creature draws back with a fearful moan

               that nobody but grandfather hears he pauses to gaze 
               blindly toward the wall eyes milky with cataracts wondering 
               what it might have been probably nothing he lets the 
               children lead him toward the table the meal is brought from 
               the stove and ladled out

               the creature eases back to the chink in the wall smelling 
               it from here a string of drool spills from his mouth its 
               humble fare not very appetizing but it looks like a feast 
               compared to pig slop

                                                               dissolve to

                         the god of nature did his soul 
                         inspire and pliant still the 
                         ethereal energy which wise prometheus 
                         tempered into paste

               the creature leans back into the shadows grappling with the 
               concept of book he reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat 
               and pulls out whats been there all along

               approaches to listen grandfather stops turns

               the creature studies grandfather for a time the old man 
               waits finally starts to play again the creature finds a 
               spot to listen he opens victors journal

               camera pushes slowly in as he puzzles over it

               int  pigsty  day

               and we continue pushing slowly in as the creature reads

                                     creature
                         of sscience and to ccreate

               he turns the page and discovers his own rough likeness its 
               victors sketch of his patchwork man the rendering includes 
               suture marks where the pieces were joined

               the creature gazes for a long time his finger traces the 
               penciled sutureline where an arm joins the torso eyes going 
               wider revelation slowly dawning no it cant be its too 
               horrible to conceive

               and he drops the journal clawing at his coat in a surge 
               of panic wrenching it away to reveal his arm and the 
               massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an 
               exact match to the drawing he throws his head back in an 
               animalistic primal scream face twisted in a mask of utter 
               horror munchs painting made flesh

               in the woods

               and his scream echoes across the countryside felix turns 
               from chopping wood his family gathers eyes wide listening 
               to the sound trail off softly

                                     felix
                         god in heaven

               in the pigsty

               a massive hand rips the page from the journal raises it in 
               a clenched fist

               angle widens to reveal the creature huddled in a corner 
               dropping his head into his arms to hide his face sunlight 
               throws streaks of light and shadow through the slats he 
               sobs wracked with despair as we

                                                                   fade to

               the house is distant below felix and his family are heading 
               out across the fields now sparse with snow herding the cow 
               before them only grandfather is missing

               the gentle music of the recorder drifts up from the house

               angle widens to reveal the creature hunkered on a hill 
               watching waiting the family dwindles in the distance

               int  house  day

               for the first time we actually see the inside of the house 
               from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall

               grandfather is by the fire playing his recorder

               the creatures face appears at a window peering in he ducks 
               from view appearing at another window making sure the house 
               is otherwise empty he vanishes again the door swings 
               silently open his figure fills the doorway

               grandfather stops playing silence

                                     grandfather
                         would you like to sit by the fire

               the creature enters sits holds his hands toward the embers 
               feeling the warmth

                                     creature

               grandfather offers him the recorder the creature hesitates 
               takes it inept where such delicacy is required he puts it 
               to his misshapen lips and blows a few hollow tones he gives 
               it back huffing air delighted

                                     grandfather

               runs his fingers over his features gently

               clutched bitterly to his heaving chest wondering why the

               a ridge greatcoat billowing in a freezing wind

               the creature rises from below the crest and gazes down

               ext  pond  late day

               and comes into view of the pond theres a figure sitting 
               halfconcealed among the tall reeds gazing off across the 
               water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly
               pleasing dissonance again a simple variation of our familiar 
               waltzlove theme

               listening to the music the figure in the reeds still hasnt 
               noticed him

               and then his head abruptly whips around an ogre right 
               out of a storybook willies eyes go wide the locket drops 
               from his fingers into the dust the boy turns and runs as 
               the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet

               the pond still calling after him he picks up the dropped 
               object as he rises he finds himself staring at the locket

               at the small painting it contains victor frankenstein he 
               raises his gaze after the fleeing boy maybe willie does 
               have reason to be afraid

               the creature starts after him locket clenched in his fist 
               teeth grinding in greater and greater rage eyes wild

               as she collapses into victors arms all of them cradling

                                     prosecutor
                         rejection can be a powerful wound 
                         people have been known to do uncanny 
                         things

                         but to commit so ghastly and terrible 
                         a crime against a child she loved

                         merit

                                     elizabeth

               and then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs 
               his shoulder victor whirls and finds himself staring up 
               into the last face he ever expected to see again the hideous 
               necrotic features bathed in a purplewhite glare of lightning 
               he screams as the creature lashes out grabs him by the coat

                         do you know this man is there 
                         something between you

                                     victor
                         i know only that he is a killer  
                         and i shall bring back his carcass

               victor heaves himself into the saddle and rides off tilt up 
               to the mountain shrouded in snow waiting

               mont blanc  day

               a lone horse and rider appear on his mission of revenge

               victor ascends the mountain the mountain is brutal and 
               unforgiving victor dismounts leading his horse onto the 
               glacier a bitter wind blows

               they plod on searching magnificent rugged vistas unfolding 
               before our eyes primeval and vast

               the horse suddenly spooks victor calms him staring is 
               that a figure down there he shades his eyes against the 
               cutting sleet somebody in the distance down there on the 
               snow field a tiny speck watching him

               the figure starts running leaping across the ice with great 
               bounds right toward victor victor wrenches the carved box 
               from the saddle bag the horse bolts victor drops to the 
               snow throws open the box frantically snatches up the pair 
               of revolvers

               he glances up the figure is gone vanished in drifts of 
               white victor rises with a revolver in each hand cocks the 
               flintlocks of both turning slowly around gazing at the 
               rocks and crags searching

                                     victor
                         where are you

               he hears nothing but his own voice echoing back and then 
               feet crunching through the snow he turns the creature is 
               running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed 
               greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings

               victor raises the first pistol hesitates as frightened and 
               angry as he is a small part of him pauses to admire the 
               achievement of actually having created life

               he pulls the trigger boom a huge flash of powder an 
               eruption of smoke the creature dodges the shot still coming 
               victor raises the other gun boom another flash of smoke 
               still the creature comes

               victor frantic manually spinning the cylinders cocking 
               firing boom a miss boom another miss spinning cocking

               firing boom boom spinning cocking

               and the creature is on him slapping the pistols clean 
               out of his hands the guns sail through the air spinning 
               off across the ice victor panics turns to run and slips 
               over the edge of the precipice

               victor falls screaming arms and legs windmilling through a 
               30foot drop and slams bodily into a snowdrift he looks 
               up the creature is peering down and leaps over the edge 
               to follow sailing through the air to land before him in a 
               catlike crouch he pulls victor from the snow and sends him 
               sliding across the ice with a mighty heave

               int  ice cave  day

               right into the mouth of an icecave victor comes tumbling 
               and sliding down the entrance spinning and careening to 
               sprawl heavily to the cave floor

               winded battered barely able to move he glances up to see 
               the cave filled with possessions books provisions extra 
               clothing the embers of a fire burn low there is even a 
               rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates

               a huge shadow fills the cave entrance the storybook ogre is 
               coming home to his cave breath huffing like a steam engine 
               victor scrambles back terrified pressing into a corner as 
               the creature enters

               but the creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers 
               down he tosses a few more sticks on the flames pause

               into view victor turns the creature tosses victor his 
               journal victor hesitates jams it into his saddlebag

               and with that the creature turns and scrambles back down 
               the nearlyvertical cliff face leaping from crags and 
               boulders with superhuman agility victor watches him vanish 
               from sight

               from the saddlebags and caught a strong whiff of powder

               he leans forward to kiss her and pauses hearing the 
               distant music of a recorder echoing from the hills

               is a weak and frail shadow of his former self

               approaches a stack of crates as if facing an old adversary 
               one in particular is quite large he rams the bar into the 
               wood prying it open and camera pushes in to reveal a 
               dull gleam of copper lurking within the packing straw

                                     victor

               wire along the ceiling beams hooking up the galvanic 
               batteries and generators testing the electrical circuit 
               with goggles and thick gloves getting a huge cascade of

               ext  cemetery  night

               camera drifts among the tombstones to reveal an eerie sight

               someone hunched in a grave digging madly dirt flying we 
               hear the thunk of a shovel hitting wood

               int  coffin  night

               and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the creature he 
               peers down at us almost close enough to kiss

               ext  frankenstein mansion  angle from roof  night

               the creature nimbly climbs the outer wall fingers grasping 
               the brickwork a dark shape slung over his shoulder he pauses 
               as a pair of stablehands pass far below he pulls himself 
               onto the roof crosses the gables and pushes open a dormer 
               window we see victor inside as it swings open the creature 
               enters with his prize

               int  attic  night

               and the mottled corpse of justine moritz flops onto the 
               table before us

               victor stares down in utter horror her cold dead face 
               blue lips already beginning to shrivel purple sunken eyes

               knowing that she loved him knowing its his fault shes 
               dead he can barely get the words out

                                     victor

                         my words

               he turns back forcing himself to examine the body trying 
               not to view it as someone he knows he cradles the head 
               probing the back of the neck with his fingers

                                     victor

               figure in the shadows staring she approaches with her best

               her mouth his other arm wraps around her waist pulling her 
               off the ground she gazes up eyes wide screams muffled in

               claude as a flash of lightning reveals the creature 
               clinging in the branches above their heads with a malevolent 
               smile he scurries  silently up further and further into 
               the tree closer and closer to the balcony

               floor a bony hand reaches for the latch

               the doors burst open on a crust of wind and rain elizabeth 
               spins as candles blow out all over the room the creature 
               enters massive and unseen gliding in shadow softly

               inexorably toward her her eyes dart toward the door she 
               makes a break for it he catches her halfway across the room 
               spinning her around by the arm her face is lit by the light 
               of the fireplace

               the creature pauses stunned at her beauty a moment passes 
               between them she senses the softening in his heart she 
               peers at him trying to understand realizing

                                     elizabeth
                         you dont want to hurt me

                         youre more lovely than i could ever 
                         have imagined

               footsteps come pounding up the stairs a heavy crash of men 
               throwing their shoulders at the door

               and it changes back in an instant the creature snarls

               she tries to wrench away he spins her around so he wont 
               have to look at her in the light casting her face in shadow 
               he cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest 
               with piledriver force

               and her scream is cut short the men give one last mighty

               and they burst in just in time to see elizabeth cascade 
               back onto the bed her chest a massive red stain the creature 
               whips toward them fist glistening with blood

               and he races across the room as the men open fire 
               shredding the walls to splinters with an explosive fusillade 
               of shots but the creature is too fast he hits the leaded 
               window headon with the force of an anvil

               and goes sailing out into empty space in a hurricane of 
               shattering glass he drops 40 feet to the grass below and 
               vanishes like the breeze greatcoat whipping into darkness

               of all he sweeps his limp murdered bride into his arms 
               cradling her to his breast screams trailing off into wracking 
               moans and sobs of despair

               gazing at the gleam of copper

               montage

               and we launch into the final throbbing madness victor hacking 
               and chopping discarding pieces sewing the creation yanking 
               the catgut tight ramming the needles deep hoisting the 
               body in the air slamming the sarcophagus lid tightening 
               the bolts powering up the galvanic circuit throwing the 
               switch screaming at god as the lightning flashes and the 
               body convulses wind and rain sweeping through the lab 
               battering a window open and shut open and shut lowering 
               the glass tube ramming phallus into womb releasing the 
               eels huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the 
               spasming egg the body convulsing lashing screaming in the 
               copper womb hair whipping in the fluid

               victor shuts down the machinery he opens the tank and reaches 
               into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves he pulls out 
               his creation cradling the head and neck as one would cradle 
               a newborn infants

               and wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal 
               elizabeths face massive suture marks bisect her neck and 
               collarbone where pieces were joined a whisper

                                     victor
                         live

               her eyes flies open as consciousness hits mouth gaping to 
               draw air but finding fluid in the lungs she erupts thrashing 
               in the vat he clutches her tight pounding her back to start 
               her breathing calming the convulsing creaturess with soft 
               murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave 
               violently to dispel the fluid

               he lifts her gently out wipes off the muck as she shivers 
               and shakes spasms easing off cleansing her face clasping 
               her hand in his comfort and strength

               helping her to her feet jerky and unsure lean on me

               replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body 
               draping it and finally exhaustingly tilting her chin up 
               with his fingers to gaze into her eyes a whisper

                                     victor
                         say my name

               blank dazed stunned not a flicker of recognition

                         remember say my name

               nothing he leans forward and kisses her dead lips

               gentle as a sigh a flicker in her eyes

                                     victor
                         you must you must

               maybe his imagination still whispering

                                     victor
                         say my name say you remember

               and slowly ever so slowly she raises her bony white 
               hand before her eyes staring at it trying to puzzle it 
               out its meaning perhaps the vaguest shred of 
               recognition and the hand continues to rise creeping 
               slowly toward his shoulder and coming to rest there he 
               smiles blinking back tears

                                     victor
                         yes ill help you remember

               and he takes her other hand in his at first its 
               imperceptible just the slightest motion perhaps nothing 
               perhaps just a shift of balance and then it grows into 
               the vaguest sway and tears are glistening in victors 
               eyes as she begins to move lurching faltering unsure

               you must lead victor the lady will always look to you for 
               guidance so your steps must be sure and strong

               trace memories

               a waltz

               and here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and 
               hairraisingly demented image of the film frankenstein dances 
               with his dead bride showing her the way begging her to 
               remember please remember and now our waltzlove theme really 
               comes back to haunt us as the music swells incredibly lush 
               and deranged dissonant and echoing through victors head 
               music only he can hear

                                     victor
                         onetwothree twirltwothree

               and the worst part the very worst thing of all there on 
               the shelf a large formaldehyde jar justines severed head 
               watching them through the glass with dead sightless eyes 
               watching them dance still a wallflower no shes finally 
               finishing her dance with victor most of her anyway under 
               the circumstances itll have to do

               and the waltz goes on madder and madder sweeping in 
               glorious circles as a dazzling array of lightning bathes 
               them in its wild jittering spotlight shadows careening 
               across the walls insane music swelling louder and louder 
               climbing higher and higher reaching toward its crescendo 
               with jagged glass claws

               and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in 
               music echoes abruptly away into silence nothing now but 
               rain and distant thunder in the doorway

                                     creature
                         shes beautiful

                                     victor
                         shes not for you

                                     creature
                         im sure the lady knows her own mind 
                         doesnt she let her decide the proper 
                         suitor

               the creature raises his hand beckoning she takes a faltering 
               step drawn to him

                                     victor
                         elizabeth no
                              she turns puzzled
                         say my name

               her face reflects horror and shame like a braindamaged 
               child whos wet the bed she knows shes supposed to 
               remember but cant remember what remembering means

               they both motion to her murmuring begging shes caught 
               between them pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war

               please come with me please remember she finally tilts 
               toward the creature gazing into his eyes studying his face 
               fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh a beat a 
               frown a puzzlement this isnt right people dont look 
               like this theyre not stitched together out of pieces of 
               flesh like a patchwork

               she looks at her own hands dead and white not even hers

               one belongs to justine another to a prostitute suture scars 
               marring the wrist she looks down at herself the dead 
               sagging breasts the body that isnt hers either realization 
               creeping into her eyes realization and horror turning to 
               victor why do i look like this whats happened to me oh 
               god whats happened to me

                                     elizabeth
                         vic tor

                                     creature
                         no

               and she lets out a shriek a banshee wail from the deepest 
               pits of hell screaming at them both screaming at herself 
               she goes berserk trying to claw her flesh away trying to 
               find the real elizabeth underneath the horror trying to 
               peel it away clawing at her face trying to claw out her 
               own eyes

               victor lunges to restrain her screaming himself veering 
               toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin 
               the creature grabs him hurls him aside

                                     creature
                         get away from her shes mine

                                     victor
                         shell never be yours she said my 
                         name she remembers

               yes she remembers not much but enough she breaks away 
               from them as they grapple still shrieking as she sails across 
               the room tipping furniture equipment flying

               over straight to the kerosene lamp snatching it up before 
               they can stop her

                                     victor
                         no

               she spins to face them holding them breathlessly at bay 
               with the threat of the lamp twitching from one to the other 
               but its not just the lamp its the look of sheer loathing 
               in her eyes loathing for them for what theyve done to her 
               loathing for herself for what shes become

               it turns out the lady does know her own mind she wants no 
               part of it or them decision made she crushes the lamp 
               in her bare hands drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene 
               whoooosh she goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts 
               past them still shrieking still trying to claw the dead 
               flesh away pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as 
               she careens out the door and down the steps victor and the 
               creature racing after her

               int  upper hallway  night

               and she sails down the hallway setting fire to everything 
               she passes screaming for the final torment to end she hurls 
               herself over the railing drapes catching ablaze as she 
               plummets to the floor far below a pillar of flame leaps up 
               on impact

               victor and the creature face each other as flames sweep the 
               walls combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in 
               hell

                                     victor
                         you killed her you killed her

               he hurls himself at the creature who backhands him spinning 
               down the hallway sprawling to the floor the creature gazes 
               down at his maker one last time

                                     creature
                         we killed her

               and then vanishes through the smoke and flames

               ext  frankenstein estate  day

               the oncemagnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath 
               a merciless gray sky charred beams and drifting smoke are 
               all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family

               victor stands gazing at the house a windswept hollow man 
               bundled in a rough coat flintlock rifle dangling at his 
               side henry moves into frame some distance behind softly

                                     henry
                         victor

               no reaction for a long moment it seems victor hasnt heard

               he rouses as if from a trance turn and walks to his pack 
               horse the animal stands saddled and ready

               he starts to mount up but henry intercepts him with a 
               restraining hand victor snaps a look as if seeing a 
               stranger and then his features soften

                                     victor
                         all that i once loved lies in a 
                         shallow grave by my hand

                                     henry
                         let it go

               victor pauses emotions swirling wishing he could grab the 
               dangling thread of sanity henry has offered but knowing 
               the thread is a bittersweet illusion a bare whisper

                                     victor
                         you should have been my fathers 
                         son he would have been so proud

               victor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his 
               horse henry runs after him shouting

                                     henry
                         victor come back

               but victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance 
               the past is dead henry watches victor until hes gone from 
               sight as willie did so long ago

               ext  mont blanc glacier  day

               the solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept 
               glacier 

               int  the creatures cave  day

               victor slides down the entrance rifle cradled the cave is 
               now deserted all possessions gone a scorched black spot 
               where the campfire had been

               ext  glacier  day

               a panorama of snow pristine save for the long trail of 
               footprints stretching off before us

               victors face thrusts into frame gazing at the craggy 
               horizon breath punching the air with billows of vapor

               he slogs onward following the tracks leading his horse by 
               the reins dwindling across the frozen landscape

                                     arctic victor vo
                         i followed his trail north always 
                         north and always one step behind 
                         never stopping driven by my fires 
                         of rage and revenge

                                                               dissolve to

               int  waltons cabin  twilight

               victor lies in waltons bed sallow as a corpse barely able 
               to speak drained now of everything

                                     victor
                         a year now ive followed him perhaps 
                         more only to arrive at this place 
                         tired so very tired i never did 
                         find whatever it was i was 
                         looking for and neither will you 
                         my friend
                              off waltons look
                         value life above ambition or those 
                         glittering prizes you seek will 
                         crumble to dust in your fingers 
                         as they have in mine
                              reaches out feverishly
                         see your loved ones again i cannot

               walton takes victors hand lays it gently back to his chest 
               softly

                                     walton
                         rest now

               victor is silent his breathing shallow walton just sits 
               and waits

               a slow dissolve marks the passage of waltons long vigil

               victors eyes flutter open as if staring at something unseen 
               perhaps the faces of those he loved the eyes glaze a 
               peaceful death walton rises puts on his heavy coat to ward 
               off the chill exits the cabin

               ext  nevsky  on deck  twilight

               grigori is leaning on the gunwale staring off across the 
               ice his coat is open walton joins him surprised at how 
               warm it is he holds up his hand testing the breeze

                                     walton
                         a warming wind

                                     grigori
                         this ice will break yet
                              glances over
                         hows our guest

                         aye captain

               grigori moves off to gather help walton turns and heads 
               back to his cabin

               int  waltons cabin  night

               walton enters and freezes at the sound of soft weeping

               he cant see the bad from here could it be the dead man he 
               glances down wet footprints lead across the floor

               he eases forward the tiny bed chamber comes slowly into 
               view a dark figure is hunched and weeping at bedside holding 
               the corpses hand walton is stunned

                                     walton
                         who are you

               the figure swivels its head revealing its face to the dim 
               yellow light

                                     creature
                         he never gave me a name

               walton hisses a terrified intake of breath he lunges to the 
               desk slaps his hand on the pistol lying there a frozen 
               beat wondering if he should snatch it up eyes dancing with 
               fear and speculation the creature makes no move unconcerned

                                     creature
                         you were with him at the end

                                     walton
                              finds his voice
                         yes

                                     creature
                         i was watching

               walton glances to the porthole ajar and creaking in the 
               breeze chilled at the thought the creature returns his 
               gaze to victor

                                     creature
                         i longed to be with him but i wanted 
                         his final moments to have peace i 
                         could see you were a friend to him

                                     walton
                         what is that to you evil as you 
                         are

                                     creature
                              swivels his gaze
                         i am as he made me in his own image

                                     walton
                         you drove him to his torment

                                     creature
                         and he drove me to mine

                                     walton
                         then why weep for him

                                     creature
                         would you not he was father and 
                         mother we fell from grace together 
                         he from his god i from mine

               the creature gently strokes victors cheek he reaches up 
               with two fingers closes the staring eyes a whisper

                                     creature
                         could we ever have forgiven

               the question goes unanswered the creature rises gliding in 
               shadow to the door pauses

                                     creature
                         ive never been shown a kindness 
                         show me one now

                                     walton
                         what kindness

                                     creature
                         build for him a pyre light up the 
                         sky with his passing

               and then the creature is gone vanishing smoothly into the 
               night

               ext  arctic  twilight

               the crew of the nevsky are on the ice chopping up the fallen 
               mast axes rising and falling in waves

               ext  arctic  twilight

               the body of victor frankenstein lies on an impressive bier 
               of wood stacked and lashed his body is wrapped in rough 
               canvas his face as dead and white as the ice

               walton and crew stand facing the bier walton silently reads 
               a passage from the bible oily black smoke from a small 
               campfire drifts past

               walton closes the book amens are muttered walton glances 
               to grigori and nods grigori moves forward with two other 
               men they begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil soaking it

               walton moves to the campfire picks up an unlit torch he 
               dips it into the fire igniting the pitch turns the men 
               back away preparing for the coming blaze

               and a dog starts howling on deck others joining in the 
               men pause gazing across the ice dread seeping into their 
               bones theres a figure out there huge and humanlike in 
               frame loping slowly over the ice approaching

                                     pilot
                              softly
                         christ

               grigori snatches up the rifle shoulders it smoothly cocks 
               the flintlock walton glances over pushes the muzzle skyward 
               denying his aim

                                     walton
                         it has a right to bear witness

               grigori hesitates nods if you say so the men grow more 
               unsettled as the creature draws nearer frightened muttering 
               men start backing toward the ship

                                     walton
                         stand fast all of you

               the men stand fast the creature stops some thirty yards 
               out a silent tableau on the ice the men facing the creature 
               walton holding the torch the pyre waiting for the kiss of 
               flame walton moves forward

               and a thunderous crack is heard the men whip their heads 
               as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some 
               fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again

               its like tectonic plates building pressure toward an 
               earthquake once it goes it goes with terrifying speed and 
               force crack another eruption crack and another crack

               ice cascading skyward

                                     old sailor
                         the bitch is breakin up

                                     grigori
                              whips toward walton
                         torch the damn thing

               walton rushes forward crack the ice erupts before him the 
               torch goes flying walton sprawls flat on his back

                                     walton
                         back to the ship

               the men dont have to be told twice theyre already in full 
               retreat scrambling for their lives ice is detonating for 
               miles around as if pounded by artillery grigori helps walton 
               to his feet the torch lies burning not ten feet away a 
               heartbeat of hesitation walton wondering if he should go 
               for it grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve

                                     grigori
                         leave it

               and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift 
               opens at their feet running an explosive zigzag course 
               across the ice separating them from the torch

               they fall back to join the retreat stumbling after the 
               others pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels

               the creature watches his last wish for victor frankenstein 
               snatched away by gods whim and breaking ice

               no

               he starts forward behind him a detonation of ice throws a 
               massive fist into the air creating a magnificent halo of 
               cascading water and spinning fragments

               the nevsky

               the first wave of fleeing men reach the ship crowding to 
               the dropnet for salvation scrambling up the side

               walton and grigori stumble along closing distance to the 
               ship walton glances back amazed to see

               the creature

               racing across the ice making for the torch teeth set in a 
               wide grimace of effort detonations threaten to swallow him 
               from all sides suddenly things go from bad to worse

               the nevsky

               breaks free with an enormous groan heeling slowly over 
               triggering massive eruptions in all directions the crew 
               hang onto the dropnet for dear life several men plummet 
               into the icy water

               the creature is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped 
               on a land mine cartwheeling helplessly through the air to 
               plunge headfirst into the water huge plates of spinning ice 
               crashing down after him gone

               walton and grigori  are knocked flat as a fissure appears 
               between them grigori dazed is lifted into the air on a 
               teetering table of ice desperately trying to scramble back 
               but sliding forward nonetheless rising up and up a gaping 
               maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him

               walton grabs the back of grigoris coat and tries to drag 
               him off but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the 
               ice seesaws forward in a complete flip and slams grigori 
               thunderously into the drink

                                     walton
                         grigori

               the nevsky finishes righting itself swaying ponderously as 
               she finds honest ocean beneath her hull some men are reaching 
               the top of the net hurling themselves over the gunwale to 
               the deck those lower on the dropnet are helping their 
               fellows from the water hauling them to safety

               frankensteins bier is now corkscrewing in slow circles on 
               its own ice floe

               the torch is drifting on a chunk of ice still burning

               angle at water level

               walton is on hands and knees scrambling on shifting pieces 
               of ice thrusting his arms into the water screaming

                                     walton
                         grigori

               the first mate breaks surface in the foreground gasping and 
               strangling for breath face already turning blue arms 
               thrashing wildly dragged down by the nowimpossible weight 
               of his own clothing

               walton strains to reach him nearly going into the water 
               himself grigori keeps thrashing and gasping dying hes 
               dying right in front of waltons eyes

                                     walton
                         somebody throw me a gaff

               too late grigori goes down for the final time vanishing 
               for good beneath the frigid water gone walton throws his 
               head back with a bellow of anguish

               and grigori breaks the surface again rising slowly and 
               impossibly from the water arms and legs windmill against 
               the air propelled from below with nearly aulic strength he 
               gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest 
               and the arm that grows and grows rising lifting him up and 
               up and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath 
               him the face of a nightmare

               the creature lunges hugely hurling grigori through the air 
               right into waltons arms both men go sprawling walton 
               scrambles to his knees makes eye contact with the creature

               the monster is exhausted near his limit walton thrusts out 
               his arm fingers grasping to help

                                     walton
                         swim

               the creature swivels his gaze the burning torch is drifting 
               away he looks grimly back to walton walton beckoning to 
               him come grab my hand

               the creature swims away knifing through the water after the 
               torch walton turns drags grigori gasping to his feet helps 
               him limp toward the nevsky across the lurching ice

               creature struggles through the water crushed and battered 
               by ice floes on all sides going under

               walton and grigori slog grimly on across the disintegrated 
               ice kneedeep and nearly walking on water they sink finding 
               nothing beneath their feet lines are thrown down and caught

               walton and grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water 
               and hoisted up the side of the ship the last ones aboard

               burning torch is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice bony 
               fingers break the surface of the water a straining hand

               the creatures eyes rise from the murk bleary with exhaustion 
               and cold he seizes the torch raises it high

               swims grimly on

               aboard the nevsky

               the crew bundle walton and grigori in blankets both men 
               shivering with exposure walton lurches to the gunwale gazing 
               off the men crowd to hisside

               the creature swims on head barely breaking the water torch 
               held high to keep it burning relentlessly determined this 
               is the most grueling effort weve ever seen gasping and 
               sinking beneath the surface

               and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe 
               upon which lies frankensteins funeral pyre he hauls himself 
               from the water moving now in a slowmotion litany of 
               exhaustion climbing the pyre scaling the wood seeking the 
               top never giving up

               the creature joins his maker atop the bier straddling the 
               wood holding the torch aloft as if lighting his masters 
               way to the netherworld frankensteins personal boatman across 
               the river styx frankenstein himself lies serenely at his 
               creations knees content to be shown the way

               the creature turns his face to the sky gulping air spreading 
               his arms wide in sublime triumph feeling the wind on his 
               skin the sleet on his face the grim joy in his heart cold 
               so very cold

               he glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand 
               pitch almost gone sputtering and trailing smoke he looks 
               down at frankenstein the oilsoaked canvas the saturated 
               wood theres that smell yes he scoops victor up with his 
               free arm and cradles him to his breast as tender as a mother 
               comforting a baby

               walton and the crew gaze in horror realization dawning

                                     grigori softly
                         dont do it
                              screaming
                         for gods sake dont do it

               the creature

               turns his gaze one last time toward heaven eyelids fluttering 
               in nearreligious ecstasy finding in these last moments the 
               sympathy held so long sought a whisper

                                     creature
                         for gods sake i will

               and he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him whitehot 
               ignition ultimate redemption whump a massive ball of flame 
               engulfs the bier pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky 
               blossoming roiling

               walton and the crew gaze on in wonder and horror as

               the creature rides the burning pyre a shrieking revenant 
               wrapped in a caul of fire screaming in the flames hair 
               going up at a sizzling flashpoint cheeks billowing out 
               peeling back in the blastfurnace heat flesh cleansing from 
               bone teeth charring and turning black still cradling victor 
               still screaming waiting for the final torment to end perhaps 
               it never will

               frankensteins pyre drifts off into the arctic twilight 
               trailing a huge column of flame and smoke inhuman screams 
               echoing endlessly lost in the darkness and distance

               walton stands at the gunwale his crew at his side the 
               borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon distant slivers 
               of lightning kiss the world softly

                                     walton
