	fade in

	ext camp crystal lake  day

	a beautiful mountain landscape pine trees snowcapped 
	mountains and a clear blue lovely lake nestled amidst it 
	all camera pans down to reveal an old wooden sign that 
	says camp crystal lake

				voice os
		the first thing were gonna do is 
		change that fucking name

	move to reveal a man and a woman the man is ken biller  
	early forties slick clothing a lot of money the woman 
	janet davenport is in her twenties and wears a chic 
	business suit shes a realtor and is holding an armful 
	of papers and documents she looks dubious at billers 
	idea

				janet
		i dont think the people who live 
		around here would like that very 
		much

				biller
		do you think they like the fact that 
		tourism has dropped ninetyeight 
		percent in the last ten years

				janet
		no but

				biller
		and do you think they like the fact 
		that half the country thinks crystal 
		lake is filled with corpses

				janet
		thats not true

				biller
		were not talking about truth were 
		talking about perception 
		and the perception is that crystal 
		lake means inbred psychopaths running 
		around the hills with axes and hockey 
		masks chopping up teenagers
			beat
		that my dear is what we call an 
		image problem

	the woman cant argue with this  its a familiar story 
	biller starts strolling down the dirt road

				biller
		youre lucky im up here at all most 
		of my investors think im crazy

	as she moves to catch up to him

								 cut to

	ext forest  day

	biller and janet walking through the deep woods shes 
	checking the map trying to keep track of where they are 
	while biller strides forth confidently

				biller
		beautiful trees sturdy trunks 
		lots of branches
			beat
		we can do some great logging up here

				janet
		logging well need an environmental 
		impact study for that

				biller
		i dont think youre getting in the 
		spirit of things janet well buy 
		whatever studies we need 

	suddenly a deer bolts from the brush and takes off in the 
	forest its a jarring moment and biller nearly jumps out 
	of his shoes

				biller
		jesus christ

				janet
		just a deer mister biller part of 
		the local wildlife

				biller
			stern
		get rid of them

	janet looks dubious  isnt sure what to say biller 
	glances around

				biller
		ive seen enough its getting dark 
		lets head back

	janet looks at the map with a little anxiety shes not 
	quite sure where they are but doesnt want to admit it

				janet
		okay well i think its this 
		way

				biller
		great

	he takes off and she follows

								 cut to

	ext another part of the forest  dusk

	its now nearly dark biller is striding through the 
	forest janet trying to consult the map in the fading 
	light

				biller
		you people wouldnt have this image 
		problem if you didnt let all those 
		hollywood types come up here and film 
		slasher movies
			beat
		homicidal maniacs may sell movie 
		tickets but they dont sell vacation 
		getaways

	janet finally stops

				janet
		mister biller

				biller
		yeah

				janet
		i think were lost

				biller
		you have a map

				janet
		i know but we left the main 
		trail and i cant find any 
		landmarks around here ive been 
		trying to figure it out but

	biller seems unfazed by this

				biller
		why dont we ask them

	he points to something over janets shoulder she turns 
	to follow his gaze and in the distance we can see what 
	looks like an old rundown house its covered with 
	vines bushes tall grass  the building is only barely 
	discernable through the forest janet frowns at the 
	sight

				janet
		i didnt think there were any houses 
		up here

				biller
		you learn something new every day 
		lets go

	they head toward the house

								 cut to

	ext jasons house  dusk

	the house was obviously nice at one time but has been 
	abandoned for many years 
	the forest has crept in on the grounds and has almost 
	reclaimed the house itself  trees shrubs weeds are 
	everywhere biller and janet walk up to the front porch 
	janet looks over the house with some concern

				janet
		doesnt look like anyones lived here 
		for years

	biller turns around and glances back at the way they 
	came

				biller
		wow look at that view

	angle on lake

	revealing that from this vantage a vista of crystal lake 
	is visible with the setting sun glistening across it

	resume biller and janet

				biller
		this is prime real estate i want it 
		who owns the house

	janet is shuffling papers

				janet
		i dont know theres no listing of 
		a private residence in this area

	biller is inspecting the house with interest

				biller
		structure might be salvageable 
		lets see what the interior looks 
		like

				janet
		mister biller now that we can see 
		the lake i think we should follow the 
		shoreline to 

				biller
		help me with this

	biller is trying to pull off one of the boards thats 
	nailed across the front door janet reluctantly helps 
	him and the two of them wrench the board off with a 
	great effort biller tries the door  its unlocked but 
	the door is swollen with age he kicks at it to force it 
	open

	int jasons house 

	the front door crashes open letting in the soft golden 
	light of dusk biller and janet enter and peer around 
	what was once the living room of the house the windows 
	are all boarded shut letting in only a few random 
	streams of light from outside the only pieces of 
	furniture visible are a single upholstered chair sitting 
	in the middle of the room both are covered with grime 
	and dirt

				biller
		whew whats that smell

	biller walks up to a wall thumps it soundly

				biller
		walls are in good shape

	janet hesitates at the doorway not wanting to come 
	inside

				biller
		there doesnt seem to be any water 
		damage kind of cozy actually

				janet
		i really think we should go back

				biller
		i want to look at the rest of the 
		house

	biller moves off into another room janet pushes her 
	fears aside and walks slowly into the living room almost 
	afraid to touch anything she swipes a finger across the 
	mantle leaving a trail through a thick layer of dust 
	she glances down at the chair there is an imprint of a 
	person in the layer of dust as though someone was 
	recently sitting there

	janet frowns curious then walks into a nearby 
	hallway

	int kitchen

	biller is looking around the room its dirty and 
	obviously hasnt been used in a long time but on one 
	countertop we see a large whitestone  a sharpening 
	stone for knives he eyes it curiously reaches up and 
	opens a large cupboard directly above the countertop 
	inside is a vast collection of knives which gleam 
	brightly in the dim light  everything from bowie knives 
	to steaks knives to machetes

				biller
		wow

	he carefully takes out a large butcher knife the blade 
	is pristine and razor sharp he eyes it and is about to 
	test the sharpness of the edge with his thumb when 
	suddenly there is a loud chirping sound biller is 
	startled and slices the ball of his thumb on the edge

				biller
		shit

	biller quickly realizes its just his cellular phone 
	ringing he sucks on his thumb and jams the knife down 
	into a butcher block biller then pulls the cell phone 
	out of his jacket pocket

				biller
			into phone
		hello

				bruces voice
		ken its bruce listen weve got a 
		nibble on the pendleton financing

				biller
		really how much

	over this dialogue biller continues to look around the 
	kitchen he opens a walkin clost  inside is a 
	collection of meat hooks all neatly arranged

				bruces voice
		fifty

				biller
		fifty we need seventyfive

				bruces voice
		ken weve been through this

	biller slides out a large cutting board thats inset into 
	the counter its stained with a deep dark reddish color 
	 what might be blood biller barely notices slides it 
	shut

	int bedroom

	janet enters and looks around the eerie room everything 
	has been perfectly preserved  the bed is neatly made 
	photographs are neatly arranged on tabletops etc the 
	dust all over is thick  it doesnt look like anythings 
	been touched for years

	she walks up to a night table next to the bed sees an 
	old blackandwhite photograph sitting there she picks 
	it up

	close on photo

	it shows a young boy about eleven yearsold sitting on 
	the front steps of the house the boy is staring directly 
	into the camera with a vacant haunted look

	janet

	who for reasons she cannot name is a little disturbed by 
	the photo she sets it down and turns away

	she continues to walk around the room stops at a 
	dresser which is cluttered with junk and things that 
	look like theyve been shoved aside as she cautiously 
	starts to sort through the clutter

	int kitchen

	as before biller snooping around on the cell phone

				biller
			into phone
		you tell them if they come up to 
		seventyfive ill cut them in on the 
		crystal lake package

				bruces voice
		dont tell me youre still thinking of 
		buying casa de psycho

				biller
		hey smartass im up here right now 
		in a luxury alpine retreat with a 
		two million dollar view of the lake

	as he speaks he opens the door to a broom closet 
	glances inside and closes it then does a doubletake 
	and looks inside again

				biller
		all we have to do is put in

	there are four chain saws of various sizes hanging in the 
	closet he reacts

				biller
		chain saws

				bruces voice
		you want to put in chain saws

				biller
		no no listen when i get back to 
		new york well meet with the board

	he walks up to the door of a pantry grabs hold of the 
	handle

				biller
		tell pendleton to wait until weve had 
		the meeting theyll give us seventy
		five

	he opens the pantry door and steps inside

				biller
		but im telling you this lake is a 
		gold mine waiting to 

	hanging on a wall hook is a dirty pair of coveralls 
	and a hockey mask he reacts to the sight

				biller
		 happen

	int bedroom

	janet is poking through the junk on the dresser when she 
	sees a pile of yellowed newspaper clippings lying on the 
	floor she bends down to examine them

	headlines boy drowns at crystal lake mother blames 
	counselors for death of son teenaged counselors 
	murdered at crystal lake hollywood plans movie about 
	crystal lake slayings  city council hopes for economic 
	boom

	janet shuffles through the clippings for a few moments 
	then suddenly hears a series of loud thumps from 
	somewhere in the house she drops the clippings stands 
	up

				janet
		mister biller

	silence worried she exits

	int living room  night

	its dark now janet enters and looks around

				janet
		mister biller

	we hear a small faint voice

				voice
			faint

	she heads toward the kitchen

	int kitchen

	janet walks in finds the source of the voice  its 
	billers cell phone lying on the floor

	her breath is coming faster now she grabs the butcher 
	knife seen earlier out of the butcher block for 
	protection

				janet
		i dont know but im outta here

	she opens what she thinks is the back door but its 
	actually the walkin closet she screams at what she sees 
	inside 

	biller is hanging from a meat hook  dead

	janet bolts for the living room

	int living room  

	janet races to the front door which is now closed she 
	tries to open it but its locked she pounds pulls on it 
	with all her strength but its no use she turns around 
	wildeyed then freezes at something she sees

	new angle

	sitting calmly in the chair in the middle of the living 
	room is a large hulking figure of a man its jason 
	voorhees hes wearing the hockey mask and seems to be 
	watching her in the dim light janet stares at him 
	frozen in shock

				bruces voice
		janet are you okay are you there

				janet
		oh my god this is his house 
		were in his fucking house

				bruces voice
		janet goddamnit whats going on

				janet
		jas jason voorhees hes here

	jason calmly watches her after a few seconds he slowly 
	and deliberately rises up out of the chair and as he 
	does the following happens in the blink of an eye

	 janet hurls the knife at jason in desperation

	 the knife flashes through the air

	 jasons hands whips up plucks the knife out of the 
	air and flings it straight back at janet in one single 
	motion

	 the knife flashes back across the room the blade 
	gleaming in the light it plunges deep into janets 
	forehead and knocks her off her feet

	the cell phone

	hits the floor with a spray of blood the impact closes 
	the flip phone and it comes to a rest against the wall 
	the display screen says the word end

	but the phone is still active a small green light 
	continues to blink on and off as we push in on the tiny 
	green light we hear the sound of a telephone 
	conversation starting with the ringing of a phone 
	someone picks up

	as the fbi agent looks over the document harding moves 
	over to ruby

				harding

	int jail cell  corridor  night

	a small town jail facility with five cells total ruby 
	and sheriff hayes are walking toward the end of the tiny 
	cell block at the very end of the hall there are two 
	deputies armed with shotguns wearing bulletproof vests 
	standing nervously by a cell ruby is keeping a neutral 
	even expression on her face  but it hides a genuine 
	nervousness

				ruby
		a house

				hayes
		thats right wasnt on any of the 
		maps we could barely see it through 
		the underbrush place mustve been 
		abandoned for twenty years 

	they come to the cell at the end of the hall and ruby 
	gets her first glimpse of her client

	angle on jason

	who is sitting on a prison bed wearing jail house 
	clothes 
	his arms and legs have been shackled and he looks like he 
	couldnt move even if he wanted to jasons head is bowed 
	and hes staring at the floor most of his features 
	obscured by shadow but we can tell that his head and 
	face are disfigured by numerous scars

	note this is not the hideously deformed mutant seen in 
	the other jason movies but a real man hes no less 
	frightening however and he bears the scars of countless 
	fights and wounds 

	ruby 

	takes in a breath a little disturbed just by being this 
	close to him hayes takes note of her reaction but keeps 
	his eyes on jason

				hayes
		yeah everyone feels that way when 
		they see him somethings not right 
		about this guy 

	ruby gives him a sharp look

				ruby
		hes just a man sheriff a man that 
		needs to talk to his attorney 
		alone

	the deputies exchange a look  is she crazy

				hayes
		ruby this guy almost took out an 
		entire tactical response team you 
		cant expect me to just leave you 

				ruby
		he doesnt look like hes going

				hayes
		fine have a pleasant conversation

	hayes nods to the deputies who open the jail cell door 
	for ruby she takes a confident step inside and then they 
	slam the door closed behind her

				hayes
			dry
		scream if you need anything

	hayes and the deputies go down the hall and exit to the 
	sheriffs station leaving ruby alone once they are 
	gone some of the bravado leaves her countenance shes 
	standing four feet away from the one and only jason 
	theres a tense beat and then she opens her file folder 
	and tries to proceed normally

				ruby
		mister voorhees my name is ruby 
		jarvis ive been appointed by the 
		court to act as your defense counsel 
		is that acceptable to you

	jason never even stirs throughout the scene he remains 
	motionless staring down at the floor ruby is frightened 
	of this man repelled by his appearance and his 
	chilling demeanor

	she tries to do her job but it isnt easy

				ruby
		unless you object im going to take 
		that as a yes
			beat
		all right mister voorhees youre 
		going to be charged with multiple 
		homicides which under laws of this 
		state make you eligible for the death 
		penalty do you understand

	no response she takes a beat then sits across from him 
	on the cot and takes another tack

				ruby
		look theres a lot of evidence 
		against you and theres a lot of 
		people who would like to see you get 
		the chair but im not one of them my

	lifting his arm to scratch his other hand the two 
	deputies come racing in with shotguns attheready ruby 
	stands there for a moment heart pounding then she 
	picks up her files as if nothings wrong and turns toward 
	the door

		a chance for that but lets give it a 
		shot anyway 

	kwan scribbles a few notes

				kwan
		are you going to plead insanity

				ruby
		i think its our best bet theyre 
		taking apart his house right now 
		they found weapons blood a mountain 
		of evidence we cant say he was 
		framed

	she thinks furiously its obvious that this is an 
	impossible case to defend

				kwah
		thisis kind of a nightmare case 
		isnt it if theres anyone who 
		deserves to get the chair its jason

	she whirls on him her voice suddenly harsh kwan has 
	accidently struck an emotional chord in ruby

				ruby
			hard
		dont say that around me ever again 
		were his attorneys we have a duty to 
		defend him  not judge him remember 
		that danny or you wont be on this 
		case much longer 

	kwan is taken aback he didnt expect this kind of 
	reaction

				kwan
		sorry

				ruby
			softening a little
		its all right
			beat
		now were going to need a really 
		good headdoctor for this someone who 
		can get up on the stand and tell the 
		jury that our client is mentally 
		insane and has been for years
			beat
		well go through a dozen doctors 
		before we find one whos willing to 
		testify for us 

	she gets a thought

				ruby
			continuing
		maybe we should call joe sena

	kwan gives her a look

				ruby
		yeah i know hes a little wacky 
		but hes the best psychoneurologist 
		in the state
			beat
		get him down here by morning i want 
		him to interview jason tomorrow 
		afternoon

	kwan nods flips the page on his notepad to a clean one 
	ruby glances at her watch

				ruby
		we have to argue every possible

		incompetence and the fact that 
		jason cant get a fair trial anywhere 
		in the country much less this state
			beat
		wheres the horror section 

	kwan points and they head in that direction

	new angle

	as they round the corner and head into the horror 
	section

				ruby
		so why cant jason get a fair 
		trial

				kwan
		because everyone knows hes guilty

				ruby
		wrong jason cant get a fair trial 
		because of these

	she indicates the wall of videotapes boxes the covers 
	are all lurid  lots of images of killers with knives 
	axes and chain saws chasing scantilyclad women

				ruby
		for the past fifteen years jason 
		voorhees has been portrayed as a
		brutal remorseless killer
		people have a preconceived notion of 
		his guilt based on these movies
			beat
		so i intend to enter these films into 
		evidence and argue that media 
		saturation has prejudiced my clients 
		right to a fair trial

	 kwan gives her a sidelong look

				kwan
		you think thats going to work

				ruby
		i dont know if anythings going to 
		work in this case therefore we have 
		to try everything 

	she eyes the countless movies

				ruby
		i dont even know where to begin

	kwan pipes in revealing himself to be the quintessential 
	horror film buff

				kwan
		well id start with friday the 
		thirteenth 1980 director sean 
		cunningham a breakthrough picture 
		that set the standard for the movies 
		to follow the gore and high body 
		count made this slasher film an 
		instant classic

	ruby looks at him

				ruby
		you watch this garbage

				kwan
		this is a legitimate cinematic genre 
		just like westerns comedies film 
		noire science fiction

	she picks out a title at random reads it

				ruby
		zombie sluts from beyond the grave

	as ruby and sena exchange a look

								 cut to

	int medical records room  night

	ruby and sena are walking through the rows and rows of 
	shelves of medical records an attractive nurse is 
	leading them to a specific shelf

				nurse
		voorhees voorhees right here

	she pulls out three file folders

				nurse
		pamela voorhees elias voorhees 
		here we are jason
			flipping through folder
		theres not much birth certificate 
		a few office visits nothing after 
		1967

				ruby

	the nurse hands her the files hands the other half to 
	sena

				nurse
		ill be up front if you need me

	sena stares after the nurse with an appreciative leer as 
	they flip through the file folders

				sena
		nurses thats why i went into 
		medicine

				ruby
		this sexual obsession of yours have 
		you considered going into therapy 
		yourself

				sena
		no need im selfdiagnosed i have 
		severe nympholepsy
			beat
		and im a bedwetter

				ruby
		well i definitely feel sorry for you
			reading from case file
		august fourteenth 1956 jason was 
		brought in by his mother who said the 
		boy hadnt slept for two weeks doctor 
		prescribed valium

	she flips to another page

				sena
			reading shocked
		i dont believe it jasons mother 
		died of ovarian cancer in 1969

				ruby
		so

				sena
		i thought she was a killer too you 
		know that she chopped up a bunch of 
		teenage camp counselors before she 
		was decapitated

	ruby is annoyed

				ruby
		thats the problem with this case 
		everyone thinks they know jasons life 
		story but they dont what youre 
		remembering is a movie fiction	in 
		the movie jasons mother runs around 
		killing people after jason drowns in 
		crystal lake

				sena
		none of thats true

				ruby
		well jason was in a canoe accident 
		in 1967 and presumed drowned his 
		mother died a few years later after a 
		long bout with cancer some time in 
		the early eighties there were a 
		string of murders out by crystal 
		lake
			spooky voice
		people started saying it was jason 
		back from the dead

				sena
		so what are you saying that he 
		didnt kill all those people

				ruby
		my job is not to determine his guilt 
		or innocence thats up to the jury 
		my job is defend him 

	sena gives her a look

				sena
		thats a nice bit of lawyerspeak why 
		dont you just say it  your clients 
		a psychotic killer whos murdered 
		dozens of people and youre trying to 
		set him free right

	she gives him a dirty look

				sena
			continuing casual
		dont get me wrong i dont care but 
		the professional part of me is 
		interested in how you rationalize what 
		you do

				ruby
		i dont rationalize anything im 
		his lawyer  hes my client thats 
		all

				sena
		that didnt sound very convincing

	ruby looks at him squarely

				ruby 
		what do you want  a tidy 
		psychological profile you want to 
		hear that i was falsely accused of a 
		crime i didnt commit and thats 
		driven me to defend others or maybe 
		you want to me to get in touch with my 
		feelings talk about my childhood

				sena
		no youve told me all i need to know

				ruby
		oh

				sena
		youre obviously going through a 
		critical moral dilemma and youre 
		putting up barriers against anyone who 
		tries to probe your conscience
			beat
		but it is heartening to know that you 
		do have a conscience 

	theres a beat she looks at him

				ruby
		are you charging me your hourly rate 
		right now

	he smiles

				sena
		no that was a freebie 

	she looks at the file again

				ruby
		not much here jason was brought in a 
		couple more times for insomnia 
		thats about it

				sena
		wait a minute let me see that she 
		hands him the file

				sena
			off file
		the mother said the boy hadnt slept 
		for over three months a physical 
		examination showed dilated pupils 
		temperature of oneohtwo blood 
		chemistry highly imbalanced

				ruby
		thats pretty weird is it possible 
		for someone to not sleep for months

				sena
		its rare but there are cases where 
		people go for years without sleep
			reads
		they diagnosed jason with simple 
		insomnia but thats not what it 
		looks like to me he has every 
		indication of having insomnolesence

				ruby
		insomnolesence

				sena
		its a neurological disorder affecting 
		the hypothalamus the part of the 
		brain that causes sleepiness is 
		inactive they didnt know about it 
		back in the sixties even now its 
		not understood very well

	ruby considers intrigued by this new revelation

				ruby
		so jason doesnt sleep how does 
		that help us

				sena
		insomnolesence has been known to cause 
		psychotic episodes delusions

				ruby
		if we could prove that jason suffers 
		from this disorder and that his 
		homicidal behavior has been a direct 
		result of a medical condition

				sena
		not guilty by reason of insanity case 
		closed

				ruby
		how do we prove it

				sena
		simple we sedate him induce a 
		somnolesent state and study his rem 
		patterns when hes unconscious
			beat
		if he has the disorder his rems will 
		be highly abnormal ruby smiles

				ruby
		then id say its bedtime for jason

	kwan smiles but then sees ruby isnt amused she keeps 
	her eyes on jason off the image of jasons face  his 
	eyes are drooping and hesstarting to fall asleep 

	ext hospital  night

	a few cars in the parking lot and some extra sheriffs 
	deputies providing security  but otherwise all is 
	quiet

	int jasons hospital room  night

	a while later layton is sitting at the console watching 
	the monitor with a bored look kwan is doodling on the 
	legal pad the deputy is slouching against the wall 
	jason is sleeping only ruby seems still interested in 
	jason  she watches him closely a quiet moment then 
	ruby looks up catching something out of the corner of 
	her eye

	jasons hand

	his finger twitches slightly

	jasons eyes

	his eyes begin to move back and forth beneath his 
	eyelids

	resume

	layton reacts as his console sends out a beep

				layton
			off console
		there he goes rem sleep began at 
		twentytwo fifteen hours
			beat
		sweet dreams you psycho 

	on the monitor we see the distinctive eeg of rem sleep  
	a single squiggly line theres also a hard copy print
	out being generated off to the side on a long narrow 
	sheet of paper piling up on the floor

	jasons face

	eyes shifting under closed lids  rapid eye movement 
	push in on jasons eyes closer until they fill the 
	frame

	suddenly his eyes fly open and we pull back to reveal 
	that we are actually looking at eyes of the young jason 
	seen in the earlier dream sequence we are in jasons 
	dream the boy is lying wide awake on his bed staring 
	up at the bedroom ceiling unable to sleep 

	the boy hears a distant screaming noise the moans of a 
	womans voice it sounds like shes in pain the boy 
	frowns climbs off his bed and follows the sound into the 
	nearby hallway

	int jasons house  hallway

	instead of the dilapidated abandoned house seen earlier 
	the house is in fine condition filled with normal 
	furniture and has a livedin look were in jasons house 
	as it appeared over twenty years ago the young boy 
	scared worried is walking toward the bedroom door at 
	the end of the hall the moans and screams grow louder 
	he finally reaches the door and slowly opens it

	int mothers bedroom

	the bedroom seen earlier but as it appeared over twenty 
	years ago a woman is tied to the bed with leather straps 
	and shes screaming in ecstasy a man is on top of her 
	fucking her hard enough to make the bed slam against the 
	wall 

	young jason stands in the doorway wideeyed not sure 
	what to think

				boy
		mommy

	the woman looks over sees him

				mother
			angry
		jesus christ jason what are you 
		doing get out of here

	the man turns his head to the boy in anger  its freddy 
	krueger as he appeared when he was mortal  no burns 
	hes naked but the distinctive fedora sits on a nearby 
	chair

				freddy
			to mother
		i didnt know you had a son	i just 
		love kids

	freddy gets up off the bed moves toward the door

				freddy
		come here little man want to play 
		with freddy

	but the boy backs off at the sight of freddy moving 
	toward him and the boy takes off running

	int living room

	the boy heads for the door opens it but krueger is 
	standing in the doorway fully clothed now in his 
	distinctive garb and with burns on his face  this is 
	the familiar nightmare image of krueger freddy grabs the 
	boy by the shirt hoists him up to eyelevel with one 
	hand

				freddy
		its been a while little man i 
		thought you were dead

	he runs one of his fingerblades across the boys cheek 
	not hard enough to draw any blood

				freddy
		you got away once but not this 
		time

	he spreads the blades wide lifts his arm to strike 
	and as his hand flashes toward his face the blades 
	suddenly hit a hockey mask which has appeared over 
	young jasons face freddy stops confused

				freddy
		what

	he drops the boy who falls heavily on the floor and as 
	freddy watches in shock the boy stands up and as he 
	gets to his feet his body starts to transform into adult 
	jason an arm a leg torso his head  features 
	morphing incredibly one by one until the towering figure 
	of jason stands before him freddys eyes narrow forced 
	to suddenly reevaluate the situation

				freddy
		so all grown up i see

	a tense moment as the two circle each other warily there 
	is clearly a prior relationship between the two men  
	and there is a deep hatred between them

	jason edges towards the fireplace where there is an axe 
	leaning against some firewood he lunges grabs the axe 
	and swings it toward freddy it connects  biting deep 
	into freddys chest freddy roars in pain jason advances 
	on him chopping and hacking at freddy who staggers back 
	at the vicious blows

	int jasons hospital room  night

	as before the console starts beeping and jasons rem 
	pattern starts jumping erratically

				layton
		what the hell 

	ruby moves to him

				ruby
		whats going on

				layton
		i dont know ive never seen anything 
		like it

	on the bed jasons hand twitches more violently his arm 
	jumps slightly

				layton
		he must be having one hell of a dream 
		his rems are all over the place

	jasons dream  living room continuous

	jason is literally hacking freddy to pieces blood 
	spraying around the living room freddys limbs have been 
	severed  arms and legs chopped clean off 

	jason lifts the axe and decapitates freddys head the 
	head rolls a few feet away 

	but freddy isnt dead the severed head smiles and 
	looks up at jason

				freddy
		nice try

	without warning freddys disembodied arm grabs jason by 
	the ankle pulling him off his feet jason crashes hard 
	onto the floor one of freddys dismembered legs kicks 
	him in the side another leg puts its foot on jasons 
	throat pinning him to the ground freddys head rolls 
	like ball onto his bloody torso reconnects itself the 
	torso leaps up and in the flash of an eye his entire 
	body starts to reassemble itself

	int jasons hospital room

	jason starts thrashing violently on the bed kwan is on 
	his feet now standing a safe distance away

				layton
		somethings wrong im bringing him 
		out
			to deputy
		give me a hand

	layton and the deputy move to jasons bedside layton 
	grabs a hypodermic off a medical tray starts filling it 
	with a solution kwan quickly takes notes trying to 
	capture every detail the deputy moves to the opposite 
	side of the bed tries to hold jason still while layton 
	prepares the hypodermic

	jasons dream  living room

	freddy is now whole again and he is standing with his 
	foot on jasons throat pinning the man to the ground

				freddy
		i make the rules around here and rule 
		number one is freddy always wins

	he plunges his finger blades straight down into jasons 
	chest

				

	int jasons hospital room

	the assistant pricks the needle into jasons arm he 
	starts to press the plunger on the hypo

	freddys entire forearm bursts straight out of jasons 
	chest there is no blood its an otherworldly effect  
	as though freddy is breaching into our reality 

	everyone freezes in shock at the image freddys hand 
	moves like lightening and slashes the deputy and layton 
	in one fluid move they collapse blood squirting from 
	the razor cuts in their necks 

	the syringe is still deep in jasons arm  but the drug 
	has not yet been injected

	jasons dream  living room

	freddy is digging his arm deeper into jasons chest 
	jason is writhing in pain his hockeyclad face inches 
	away from freddys now freddy frowns digs his arm in 
	deeper

				freddy
		theres more to you than meets the 
		eye

	he plunges his arm yet deeper 

	int jasons hospital room

	 where we see freddys entire arm and part of his 
	shoulder bursting out of jason freddys hand whips 
	around searching for something to grab onto blades 
	scraping against the wall ripping at bedsheets 

	ruby opens the door and yells out 

				ruby
		we need help in here now

	kwan turns to avoid the thrashing finger blades but a 
	blade snags in kwans ponytail he yells out tries to 
	untangle the blade but its too late freddy knows he has 
	somebody the hand grabs hold and yanks him up onto 
	the bed kwan struggles but its too late  freddy 
	pulls kwan down into jasons chest

	jasons dream  living room

	freddys pulls kwans head out of jasons chest into the 
	dream kwan blinks and looks around in abject terror 
	freddy looks amazed at the sight

				freddy
		youre not from around here are you
			realizing
		youre from the other side

	int jasons hospital room

	where ruby has grabbed onto kwan trying desperately to 
	pull him out of jasons chest jason thrashes breaks an 
	arm restraint

	close on jasons arm

	as ruby and ewan struggle kwans body presses up against 
	the plunger on the syringe  and inadvertently injects 
	jason with the drug

	jasons dream  living room

	freddy is laughing now he rips at kwans face with the 
	blades then shoves kwans head straight down 

	int jasons hospital room

	 kwan is catapulted out of jasons chest knocking ruby 
	down and he slams into the far wall he slumps to the 
	floor covered in blood and gore dead ruby sits up 
	with a dazed look

	jasons dream  living room

	freddy smiles leans down as though to enter jasons body 
	headfirst when suddenly the scene drains of color 
	freddys head snaps up looks around

				freddy

	the entire scene distorts and fragments jasons dream 
	breaking up finally dissolving to

	int jasons hospital room  close on his face

	as his eyes fly open  hes awake

		kill you in the real world

				sena
		uhhuh

				ruby
		dont you see jason was asleep and

	bars his knees drawn up to his chest and his arms 
	wrapped tightly around him sena is working at his 
	damaged console checking readings jason is still in a 
	deep troubled sleep ruby is kneeling next to the boy 
	trying to get though to him

				ruby
		i saw you up at the house what were 
		you doing there

	the boys voice is small and flat there is something 
	haunting about this boy

				boy
		i live there with my mommy

				ruby
		your mommy where is she

	the boy shakes his head  doesnt know sena comes over 
	crouches down hes holding two sensor pads with wire
	leads in his hand

				ruby
		what are you doing

				sena
		checking out a theory just keep 
		talking to him 

	ruby focuses on the boy

				ruby
		whats your name

				boy
		jason

	ruby reacts in surprise

				sena
		i think hes telling the truth

	ruby looks over in surprise and sena motions her over to 
	the console hes looking over some neural patterns and 
	technical readouts on a monitor there are two neural 
	patterns on the monitor side by side and theyre 
	identical

				sena
			off monitor
		this is jasons rem pattern and 
		this is the boys rem pattern theyre 
		identical

				ruby
		hows that possible

				sena
		jasons asleep maybe hes dreaming 
		of himself as a young boy and that 
		boy is sitting right here
			beat
		i think hes some kind of projection 
		from jasons subconscious

	she looks at the boy with renewed intent

				ruby
		so in essence that boy is jason

	sena nods ruby moves to the boy kneels down

				ruby
		jason do you know a man named fred 
		krueger

	the boy suddenly looks terrified retreats against the 
	cell bars ruby speaks gently

				ruby
		you do and youre afraid of him

	the boy nods

				ruby
		he tried to hurt you didnt he in 
		the canoe on the lake

	the boy starts to panic at the memory

				boy
			yells
		get away from me help me mommy	

	the boy cringes and	 cries out as four long lacerations 
	appear on his forehead four more cuts appear on his arms 
	and tear at his clothes then another set on his neck 
	the boy is bleeding crying its a terrifying sight 
	jason is tossing and turning on the bed ruby isnt sure 
	what to do next  follows her instincts

				ruby
			to boy
		its okay jason he cant hurt 
		you i wont let him hurt you

	she takes off her coat tries to use it to staunch the 
	flow of blood but stops as the lacerations suddenly heal 
	before her eyes and turn into nasty scars the blood 
	disappears a breathless moment as the boy calms down 
	and a stricken look comes across his face

				ruby
		he attacked you in the canoe you 
		fell in the lake and then what 
		happened

	the boy speaks in a flat voice

				boy
		i was under the water the water 
		came into my mouth
			beat
		i couldnt breathe anymore 
		everything got dark

	the boys voice deepens slightly  older more adult 
	its an eerie moment

				boy
		i opened my eyes and i was lying on 
		the shore of the lake and everything 
		was different

				ruby
		different how

				boy
		it was hard to think pain i was 
		mad

	the boys voice distorts and lowers into a frightening 
	growl

				boy
			deep growl
		i was very mad

	suddenly he goes limp and stares blankly as weve seen 
	adult jason do previously ruby looks at him for a long 
	moment then stands and joins sena

				ruby
		so krueger thinks jasons dead 
		leaves him in the lake but the boy 
		actually wakes up on the shore 
		crawls off into the woods where he 
		lives the rest of his life alone

				sena
		alone but with a murderous fury 
		inside him which led him to kill 
		dozens of people 

	ruby thinks

				ruby
		if im right this happened before the 
		krueger murders in springwood
			beat
		that means that jason mightve been 
		kruegers first victim

				sena
		except this victim got away i wonder 
		if 

	suddenly the boy leaps to his feet with a guttural yell 
	and a murderous rage on his face he grabs a nightstick 
	off the floor and with both hands and swings it at sena

	sena throws up both arms to protect his face and but his 
	arm breaks with a sickening crunch the boy hits him 
	again in the shoulder and sena crumples to the ground

	the boy turns to ruby moves to attack ruby grabs both 
	his arms but its difficult to hold on the wildly 
	flailing boy who is growling and screaming like a crazed 
	animal

				ruby
		jason no were not your enemies 
		listen to me listen

	on the bed jason struggles in his sleep and one arm 
	breaks a shackle taking part of the bed railing with it 
	ruby manages to pin the boy against the wall the boy is 
	still struggling eyeswide spittle drooling out of his 
	mouth its a terrifying moment but ruby holds firm

				ruby
		jason no the man who hurt you is 
		fred krueger hes the one who did 
		this to you 

	the boy stops screaming for a moment looks at her with 
	a look of disbelief and fear on his face ruby realizes 
	she might be getting through to him

				ruby
		kruegers still out there hes 
		killing innocent people just like 
		he tried to kill you
			beat
		hes the one you want not us not 
		anyone else

	the boy looks uncertain scared ruby cant help but feel 
	sorry for this damaged little boy

				ruby
			quiet
		come here jason ill take care of 
		you everythings going to be all 
		right

	she holds out her arms and after a long moment the 
	boy drops the baton tears well up in his eyes

				boy
		mommy

	he moves into her arms holds on tight she hugs him 
	strokes his hair for a moment

				ruby
		its okay jason its okay

	she holds him for a second and then the boy slowly fades 
	away until hes gone and ruby is holding nothing

	jason on the bed

	his eyes open and he sits straight up on the bed in one 
	quick motion a tense moment as sena and ruby wonder what 
	hes going to do next jason breaks the remaining 
	shackles one by one swings his legs off the bed 
	stands up 

	he towers over sena and ruby who look at him in fear 
	jasons eyes flicker from sena then to ruby 

	he stares at her with a neutral expression for a long 
	moment she returns his gaze staring up at the horribly 
	scarred face 

	finally jason turns away from her and walks out of his 
	cell with an even deliberate gait sena and ruby 
	exchange a look

	quick cuts

	bodies all around 

	 close on a desk with plastic evidence bags strewn 
	across it jasons hand grabs one of the bags  inside

	standee of jason promoting the latest movie jason 
	2010 jason is in a dramatic pose with a futuristic 
	weapon resembling a steel pipe raised high this is a 
	strange robotic terminatorlike jason with a steel 
	hockey mask and glowing electronic eyes its robojason 

	ruby takes a breath moves past the standee to the third 
	door 

	she looks inside  empty she comes back into the hall 
	starts to cross the hall to the other set of doors 
	then stops freezes turns around and looks at the 
	standee 

	the picture of robojason is gone leaving only the 
	background of the image ruby stares at this for a 
	moment then we hear the distant laughter of freddy ruby 
	tries to steady herself and locate the sound of the 
	laughter

	then at the end of the hall she sees robojason 
	dressed exactly as he was on the standee holding the 
	weapon 

	robojason taps a control in the weapon and an array of 
	terrible blades and spikes jut out of the pipe  the 
	ultimate chopping machine 

	he starts walking toward her with that slow deliberate 
	walk made more frightening by the whirr and click of his 
	mechanized body

				ruby
		this isnt real

	she closes her eyes tries to shake off the image 
	opens her eyes again the image of robojason fades and 
	wavers for a moment as if its going to disappear

	but then the image solidifies

				ruby
		oh shit its wearing off

	robojason is coming closer shes cornered theres 
	no way out of this hallway robojason raises the bladed 
	weapon to strike ruby takes aim and fires at the 
	nightmare image 

	the shotgun blast seems to pass right through his chest 
	not fazing him ruby continues backing up terrified

				ruby
		no

	freddy steps out from behind a standee for a movie called 
	my favorite unicorn a treacly childrens classic

				freddy
			to ruby
		counselor i think your clients 
		unhappy with his representation 

	ruby turns tries to level the shotgun at freddy but its 
	too late robojason is on top her 
	he swings the weapon and she is barely able to deflect 
	the blades with the barrel of the shotgun she loses it 
	in the process and the gun clatters to the floor 

	robojason swings at her again catching her in the knee 
	with a blade she goes down scrambles away on her back 
	until she hits a wall robojason continues to advance on 
	her

	freddy watches with a smile on his face his back is to 
	the entrance to the hall which leads out to the lobby

				freddy
		verdicts in bitch youre guilty of 
		fucking with the wrong guy

	at this moment we see a shape creeping up behind freddy 
	he senses it and whirls around to see 

	the real jason

	has arrived hes holding the fire axe and stops a few 
	feet away freddy smiles

				freddy
		well well the little man in the 
		mask is back for more

	angle on ruby

	the nightmare image of robojason fades away she sits 
	up watching the two men face off

	jason and freddy

	jason watches freddy for a moment murderous rage in his 
	eyes behind the hockey mask his fist clenches around the 
	axe handle

				freddy
		whats wrong waiting for mommy to 
		tell you what to do
			beat
		id like you to meet a friend of mine  
		 someone youre very familiar with 

	the nightmare image of robojason suddenly appears next 
	to freddy the real jason hesitates looks at himself for 
	a moment then robojason attacks 

	real jason swings the axe at the image of himself and 
	for a bizarre moment the two jasons fight a vicious 
	axefuturistic weapon battle in the hall 

	clanking weapons sparks flying  real jason collects a 
	couple of wounds along the way

	ruby watches from her point of view jason is struggling 
	against nothing she looks around sees the shotgun 
	nearby she crawls over to it freddys attention is on 
	jason she picks up the shotgun points it at freddy and 
	pulls the trigger  

	click	the gun is empty freddy turns at the sound 

	he holds up the finger blades moves for ruby she takes 
	the shotgun swings it like a club hits freddy in the 
	knees taking him down as he falls robojason seems to 
	falter and stumble in response 

	the real jason plants the axe directly in robojasons 
	head dropping him to the ground dead 

	freddy rolls off the carpet and speeds out into the 
	lobby and disappears into the mall before jason can get 
	to him

	jason looks over at ruby shes holding her bloodied leg 
	in pain their eyes meet for a moment 

	jason turns and runs out into the mall

	int mall  third level  night

	jason steps onto the darkened promenade looks around we 
	hear freddys laughter he turns freddy is standing at 
	the far end of the mall across the openair courtyard 
	from jason hes also on the third level standing on the
	opposing rail at this distance we can only see his 
	silhouette against firelight 

	jasons eyes harden and he starts striding down the 
	promenade towards freddy utterly determined to destroy 
	him 

	but he stops lined along the promenade are literally 
	fifty body bags which are standing up and leaning against 
	the wall some are behind jason too trapping him in the 
	middle

				freddy
		some old friends of yours would like 
		to see you

	the body bags start unzipping by themselves one by one 
	and the corpses of all of jasons victims step out onto 
	the promenade its a ghastly sight some are badly 
	decomposed others looks freshly mutilated

	among them we also see biller and janet from the 
	beginning of the movie both with gaping wounds from when 
	they were killed 

	the victims turn toward jason and start converging on him 
	with vengeful expressions

				freddy
		its a regular family reunion

	jason is momentarily frozen to the spot hes not sure 
	what to do when confronted with these specters from his 
	past biller is the first one to attack jason  he leaps 
	at jason with his bare hands jason throws him off then 
	janets on top of him he slams her to the ground then 
	another victim and another fifty of them swarming 
	over jason like ants

	jason is almost smothered by the crush of bodies but 
	jasons strength is unbelievable  he keeps pressing 
	forward hacking and fighting his way through the crowd 
	of frenzied victims trying to tear at his body 

	but the victims are taking their toll he throws victims 
	through plateglass windows hacking others to 
	pieces but they just keep coming the fight is 
	destroying the mall in the process  merchandise 
	crashing to the floor windows shattering columns of 
	plaster crumbling 

	jason has made it halfway to freddy at this point but it 
	doesnt look like hell make it all the way the crowd is 
	pressing him back against the railing and toward the 
	steep drop below theres no way out its a panicky 
	moment 

	jason manages to raise his axe and swings it down hard 
	and connects with the rail itself the rail is split in 
	two the entire rail gives way and jason and the crowd of 
	victims fall over the edge 

	jasons hand grabs a metal strut and he holds on as the 
	victims plummet to the first level bodies smash and pile 
	up on the ground below 

	jason hangs there for a moment then is forced to drop 
	the axe and grab the edge of the promenade hes about to 
	pull himself back up when suddenly finger blades move 
	into view 

	he looks up to see freddy leaning down finger blades 
	pointed directly at his face he scrapes the blades along 
	the hockey mask toying with him 

	the tip of two blades stop inches jasons eyeballs

	with the tiniest flick of his wrist freddy could put the 
	blades into jasons eyes

	angle on ruby

	who has dragged herself to the far railing where she can 
	see jason and freddy down the promenade

	freddy and jason

	freddy poised to kill his longlost victim	

				freddy
		i shouldve finished you off a
		long time ago but then again maybe 
		fate has brought us	 together

	freddy leans in close facetoface with jason keeping 
	the finger blades pointed at his eyes

				freddy
		youre my creation jason all that 
		you are you owe to me 
			beat
		were stronger together than we are 
		apart join me and this world will be 
		ours 

	jasons eyes never leave freddys a long tense beat 
	then jasons eyes widen at something he sees 

	freddy has become jasons mother still wearing the 
	finger blades aimed at jason

				mother
			sweetly
		trust me jason mommas going to take 
		care of you everythings going to be 
		all right 

	she smiles gently at him jason drops his eyes slightly 
	as if considering then in a lightning move he takes a 
	hand off the ledge and grabs freddys finger blades and 
	stabs them into his mothers throat

	new angle

	as freddy stands up the blades buried deep in his neck 
	blood squirting from the deadly wound he claws 
	desperately at the blades gurgling and stumbles off 
	down the promenade

	jason

	heaves himself up over the railing and onto the third 
	level freddy is gone he glances around then jason 
	crashes his arm through the window of a sporting goods 
	shop grabs a baseball bat out of the hands of a manikin 
	and begins looking for freddy

	ruby

	watches jason for a beat thinks gets an idea 
	looks down to the first level

	her pov the syringe and the medicine	bottle can be seen 
	floating in the large water fountain ruby heads off

	jason

	is walking along the promenade suddenly he hears rubys 
	voice coming from inside the dental clinic

				rubys voice
		jason help me jason

	jason rushes inside the clinic

	int dental clinic

	the office is dark as jason enters he peers into a 
	treatment room where ruby has now been strapped to a 
	dental chair hoses in her mouth and a dentists drill 
	buzzing inches away from her face jason moves to help 
	her the expression on rubys face changes she smirks 
	at him in contempt and when she speaks its in freddys 
	voice

				ruby
			freddys voice
		youre getting soft in your old age 

	suddenly jasons grabbed from behind freddy pounces on 
	him knocking him against a wall 

	freddy has a small portable gas cylinder  on the side 
	it says nitrous oxide he aims the tank at jasons face 
	presses a nozzle and a blast of gas comes out

				freddy
		sweet dreams

	jason struggles but its a few seconds before he can get 
	freddy off of him and knock aside the gas tank the 
	image of ruby in the chair is now gone

	int mall  third level  night

	jason stumbles out onto the promenade trying to hold 
	onto consciousness but its a losing battle he took in 
	too much gas freddy whos bleeding profusely and is 
	dying stumbles after him 

	the fire has now consumed most of the ground floor and 
	is spreading to the second and third levels threatening
	to engulf the entire building 

	freddy chases jason down the promenade jasons steps are 
	getting slower  the effects of the gas taking its toll 
	hes seconds away from losing conscious finally freddy 
	makes a desperate lunge at him catching him off guard	 

	the two men tumble over the rail  

	 and through the air down down into the water 
	fountain on the first level with a tremendous splash 

	theres a beat the bodies of the two men float in the 
	water for a moment then freddy lifts his head and 
	pulls the form of jason over to him jasons eyes are 
	fluttering hes falling asleep

				freddy
		once im back in your dreams ill 
		be whole again then youre mine

	jasons eyes close hes asleep freddy takes a hand 
	and pushes it into jasons chest the same effect seen 
	before  hes escaping back into the dreamworld 

	freddy manages to get his arm and then his shoulder 
	into jasons chest he smiles  victory is at hand 

	suddenly a hand flies into frame from off camera and 
	plunges a needle into jasons neck its ruby she 
	injects jason with the dream inhibitor

				ruby
		time to face reality krueger

	suddenly jasons eyes fly open hes awake and freddys 
	doorway between reality and the dreamworld has been 
	closed trapping him inbetween the two realities 

	the effect of this is startling 

	freddys arm shoulder and part of his torso are halfin 
	halfout of jasons chest the two men have been fused 
	together in a horrific image freddy roars in pain and 
	outrage 

	ruby recoils at the sight as the creature that is now 
	freddyjason heaves itself up out of the water with a 
	superhuman effort carrying them out of the fountain and 
	onto the floor jason and freddy continue to struggle and 
	claw at each other like wild animals 

	but the flames in the mall are getting higher support 
	beams and material from the upper floors catching fire 
	and crashing down below jason in his agony looks over 
	at ruby and for a moment their eyes meet	jason speaks 
	his voice low and hoarse

				jason
		get out 

	this surprising statement brings ruby back to the reality 
	of her situation 

	she heads off through the thickening smoke and flames 
	leaving freddyjason struggling in the helllike cauldron 
	of the burning mall

	on sena

	whos collapsed near a stairwell overcome by the smoke 
	ruby coughing and struggling picks him up in a

	to the pavement as two paramedics rush up to help him

	we see that many of the shoppers in the mall seen earlier 
	are being tended to by rescue teams in the park parking 
	lot in the bg 

	ruby tries to catch her breath and looks back up at the 
	burning mall

	int mall  ground floor  wide shot

	ground floor we see the writhing form of freddyjason

	closer on freddyjason

	jason tries to strangle the hideous	form of freddy who 
	is slashing at him in fury

				freddy
		let me go you freak 

	jason staggers a few more feet falls into the entrance 
	of a store called camping world he glances off to the 
	side sees a stack of propane tanks meant to fuel 
	outdoor gas stoves 

	he takes his hand off freddys neck reaches out for 
	the tanks 

	freddy stabs his finger blades again and again into jason 
	 desperate to kill him 

	jason gets his hand around one of the tanks brings it 
	close freddys eyes widen as he realizes what jasons 
	about to do

				freddy
		no

	tank lets out a jet stream of propane from the tank
