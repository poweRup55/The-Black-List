            the theory of black holes was developed before there was
            any indication from observations that they actually existed
            i do not know of any other example in science where such a
            great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis
            of thought  it shows the remarkable power and depth of
            einsteins theory  there is still much we dont know such
            as what happens to objects and information that fall into a
            black hole  do the reemerge elsewhere in the universe or in
            another universe  and can we warp space and time so much
            that one can travel back in time  maybe someone will come
            back from the future and tell us

            gallon esso oil truck barrels over wet studded pavement
            heading towards manhattan  its going fast  too fast

            up aheadat the base of the bridge

            a large reflective sign  lit up by arc lights men at work

            there are two work crews several hundred feet apart

            the first crew is con ed  a corrugated vacuum tube feeds
            into an open manhole  a worker drops into the hole

            the second crew is construction  theyre at the apron of the
            bridge securing lumber supports for the roadbed

            its late and the men are tired  a mistake is made  a fork
            lift loaded with lumber fails to negotiate a turnwhacks
            into an abutment spilling its load onto the roadway

            bad timing because right now that esso oil truck hits the
            off ramp  not a lot of time for the driver to react to a
            roadway spewed with lumber

            he does his best  slams the brakes spins the wheel hits
            the horn but it doesnt matter 18 wheels skid across the
            blacktop  spitting thick smoke and burnt rubber lifting off
            the slick pavementtwistingflippinghemorrhaging oil
            from its ruptured tanksgrinding its way towards

            men at work  seconds to react as an 80000 pound juggernaut

            gordy jr sticks out of the closet attempting to drag out a
            large black steamer trunk stenciled with yellow letters

                                gordo

            crouches down beside his son checks out the dusty contents

            gordy jr reaches in and takes out fdny helmet  jackets
            briefly puts on the enormous helmet then sets it aside

            reaches back into the trunk and pulls out the disassembled
            pieces of a 12 gauge shotgun

                                gordo
                      hey  gimmie that

            gordo takes the shotgun from the boy and places it gingerly
            inside the closet

            simultaneously gordy jr hands off a leatherbound scrapbook
            to john  before john can react gordy jr lifts up an
            amateur radio transceiver

            john puts down the phone  stares at the fdny trunk  he
            stumbles to it  sits down and opens it up  its filled with
            his dads stuff  he picks up and leafs through the old
            scrapbook  photos and clippings illustrate family history

            down  he cant deal with those wounds  he glances up at the

                                larry king
                      is this anomaly connected to the space

                      disappeared in 1969

                                hawking
                      we dont know  but given the
                      similarities of their location and
                      appearance this is a question that
                      merits further investigation

            note  larry kings show plays for the duration of this
            scene

            on a tshirt  we notice a nicotine patch on his arm
            doesnt stop him from burning another marlboro

            john is suddenly startled by a noise from the study  a loud
            burst of static

            in the background of franks voice we barely hear walter
            cronkite interviewing someone

            as john releases the squawk bar the distant sound of franks
            tv filters out of the ham

            john dog tired and more than a little wasted gets up from
            the desk inadvertently leaving the ham radio on and
            shuffles for the family room through the glass doors

            kid more than anything in the world

            blue sky  a softball soars into view  it drops down and
            into a willie mays style basket catch by frank sullivan

            ext little league baseball field  queens  day  1969

            the same little league field that frank circled on his harley
            yesterday october 10 1969  and the same field at which
            john sat in the stands drinking last night october 10 1998

            we are in the 9th inning of a friendly softball game between
            the local cops and firemen  a lot of nypd and fdny tshirts
            sweats and caps  plenty of mets stuff too

            having made the catch frank coolly pulls the ball from his
            mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond
            tagging up at 3rd sorely tempted to try for home is satch
            deleon 30 nypd detective  satch feints for the plate
            frank feints the throw  for a maddening gleeful moment
            frank has satch caught between 3rd and home

            in the stands johnny sullivan marge hersch and the families
            of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win
            this game of chicken

            on the sidelines johnny gordo and the other kids serving as
            batboys and waterboys jump around in anticipation

            at home butch foster stations himself to take the throw

            suddenly satch fakes to 3rd then bolts for home  frank
            pegs it to butch who tags the sliding satch  game over

            black clouds earth shattering thunder  a massive bolt of
            lightning rockets out of the menacing sky striking through a
            window on the 3rd floor of the warehouse  a fire begins

            watching from the doorway to the kitchen

            we are in the bottom of the 9th with the baltimore orioles
            brooks robinson coming to the plate

                                gibson

                      were gonna be dead

            suddenly the alarm sounds moving the groaning firemen
            reluctantly to action and freezing frank in surging anxiety

            gibson is up and passing frankwho begins to move like hes
            in a trance

            a rapid montage of frank butch and the others readying to

            john lost in thought rounds a corner towards the bar

            ext street  ladder truck  moving  afternoon  1969

            the ladder  engine trucks barrel out of the firehouse

            as sirens scream frank and gibson secure themselves into
            position  gibson excitedly switches on his radio to the
            game  he notes that frank is not the least bit into it

                                gibson
                      sully you cool

            green  whites are already there uniform cops keeping a few
            onlookers at a safe distance

            flames shoot out from the 4th and 5th floor windows
            starting to lick their way up to the 6th floor and roof
            smoke billows out of the windows on the 3rd and 2nd floors
            lighter smoke spirals out from the door on the 1st floor

            frank gibson and other firemen under butchs command take
            stock of the situation and start to deploy

            hoses are run from hydrants to the pumper trucks

            the ladder is swung into position for an assault on the roof

            sky with a huge roar  rain starts to fall

            and in the distance as if from inside the burning building
            a faint screaming is first heard and growing louder

            stairway before them  they sprint towards it and start up
            one floor  two floors  three floors and suddenly they are
            face to face with a wall of fire blocking access to the 4th
            floor

            and he barrels through the line of fire onto the 4th floor
            gibson starts to do the same when the 5th floor gives way
            above frank sending burning timber and debris cascading
            around him and cutting off gibsons route

            beam crashes down onto the stairway behind him forcing
            gibson and butch to scramble like hell back down the stairs

            the house looks different  cleaner furnishings less ragged
            john moves through his home taking in the subtle changes
            he reaches the study  and there beside the desk is
            something that makes him stop

            a photograph on the wall beside the desk  frank julia

            inferno

            john turns stares at the radio questioningly  he starts to
            sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front
            edge of it  words carved into the wood 29 years ago by fire
            fighter frank sullivan  the day john saved his fathers
            life im still here chief

                      fear  but mostly its like theres this
                      logic problem  and if they could only
                      solve it everything would be okay
                          a breath
                      but if you look real close  look at
                      their eyes  you can see it  just a
                      glimmer  but somewhere they know  they
                      know their world is never gonna be the

            a woman waits to pay for a mini pack of kleenex and some gum
            karen reynolds  a wool coat over her nurses uniform

            franks and johns voices continue over the scene

            as karen moves to the cash register the camera widens to
            reveal frank awkwardly pretending to read a magazine

            frank readies to follow her when he suddenly trips over a
            crate of vegetables and goes down on one knee

            karen looks in the direction of the accident and for a split
            second her eyes lock with franks  embarrassed frank looks
            away as he rights himself

            frank edges out of the grocery store as karen steps into the
            street and dodges traffic towards a corner barrestaurant at
            the end of the block past a heavily overgrown vacant lot

            frank follows karen across the street and finds himself just
            as karen enters the bar at a point near the murder site
            described by john  he pauses to stare at it

            int cozys bar  restaurant  moments later

            frank enters the place  sort of a singles atmosphere but a
            comfortable one  its happy hour  on the tv the mets gil
            hodges offers his analysis of game 3

            frank looks about down the bar and into an area with booths
            and tables  a few folks at the bar  a group of young women
            laughing in a booth  but no karen reynolds  franks blood
            runs cold in a spasm of panic when

                                womans voice
                      hey chuck

                                bartender
                      hey karen

            frank wheels around just as karen passes him from teh ladies
            room  there is the trace of a bump enough for karen to take
            note of frank  ad lib excuse me  she then starts moving
            down teh bar towards the booth of young women

            frank checks out everyone in the bar not knowing quite what
            hes looking for

            karen slips into the booth with her friends  ad lib hellos

            frank orders a beer but his eyes are fixed on the booth
            karen and a friend take note of frank staring at them
            embarrassed he turns away checking his watch 640pm  and
            at just that moment a scraggly man passes by taking a seat
            at the end of the bar  we have seen this man before

            killers balls  killer goes down like a stone but frank is
            too battered to take advantage

            he collapses on top of killer who pushes him off scrambles
            up and delivers a massive kick to his head  frank is out
            cold

            finding his wallet  he grabs something from it then tosses
            it aside  he then takes something out of his pocket a thin
            leather garrote  he coils it around his hands and snaps it
            taut  he bends down to start the job when suddenly the
            bathroom door opens and

            two very stoned men stumble in

                      kissing the porcelain

            and killer muscles frank into a toilet stall and puts his
            head in the bowl  he closes the door quickly leaving

            in the stall frank spills onto the floor his legs sticking
            out into the bathroom  his face flush to the tile his eyes
            trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall

            his wallet

            the vinyl and is scratching against the label

            the wind catching a curtain allows the shaft of a street
            light to beam brightly into the room and in one swift
            moment frank is staring at a nightmare sissy clarks

            bends over and blows his dinner then mounts the bike and

            that he can use to get the hell out of there

            his minds racing fire fighter training kicking in  and

            2x2 electrical conductor box

            follow franks eyes to something else  an air conditioner
            mounted in the window

            bottom for the gun  but hes getting weaker fading out
