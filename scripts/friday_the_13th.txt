               fade in

               ext road  day

               the track is silent

               the camera looks at a sign it reads

                                     established 1935

               gradually we can begin to hear in the bg the sounds of 
               children playing

                                                                    cut to

               years old she is pretty she wears a tshirt with assistant 
               counsellor written on it she fills out the shirt very well

               failing to find whomever she is looking for claudette walks 
               quickly in the opposite direction

               the camera holds on the game for a few seconds and we 
               superimpose

                                       july 4 1958

               the children’s voices fade slowly

                                                                    cut to

               ext rifle range  day

               ecu as a counsellor squeezes off a shot

               the paper target is ripped in the black

               the counsellor hands the weapon to a camper who snaps in at 
               the line

               claudette shouts up to the counsellor from the bg

                                     claudette
                         have you seen barry

               the counsellor smiles shrugs

                         he and chloe were at the lodge last 
                         time i saw him

               claudette leaves the counsellor smiles

                                                                    cut to

               ext main lodge  day

               two children run by carrying indian headdresses claudette 
               passes them impatiently as she sees barry and chloe

               barry is leaning against the front rail of the porch his 
               arms behind his head  the better to show off his physique 
               to chloe and assistant counsellor who is currently looking 
               at him with cow eyes in the bg we can hear a portable radio 
               blaring out an everly brothers hit

               barry is 17 handsome and out for all he can get he is not 
               ashamed for being caught with this other goodlooking girl

                                     claudette
                         we’ve got to talk

               barry looks at chloe then eases off the rail nods

                                     barry
                         okay

               barry puts an arm around claudette looks over his shoulder 
               at chloe and saunters off with the former

               the everly brothers continue as we

                                                                    cut to

               ext lake  day

               from over the tops of a rack of canoes we see barry and 
               claudette walking along the shore

                                     claudette
                         you said we were special

                                     barry
                         i meant everything

               in the bg children leap into the water

                                     barry
                              continuing
                         you know what i said though

                                     claudette

                                                                    cut to

               ext forest  day

               the track goes silent

               barry  claudette walk along a path this is not an aimless 
               walk for barry knows exactly where he wants to go he leaves 
               the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing 
               claudette hesitates then goes to sit next to him

                                     barry
                         i care very much

               he puts an arm around her and draws her close they kiss 
               they separate

                                     claudette
                         does chloe kiss as good as i do

               barry decides to be politic

                                     barry
                         i wouldnt know

                                     claudette
                         oh you

               she kisses him and they are locked

               a bird calls wheels across the patch of sky above

               the camera shifts to another angle just beyond the thicket 
               of lacy vines it is a slow tracking shot which gives the 
               impression that we are watching the action from the pov of 
               another person an unseen visitor watching the two teen
               aged assistant counselors making their first sexual 
               encounters

               this unseen observer will be called the prowler

               barry reaches up outside claudettes tshirt to hold her 
               breast she reaches up to take his hand away

                                     barry
                         claudette

                                     claudette
                         somebodyll see

                                     barry
                         no they wont

               he ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her tshirt 
               so that part of her bra is exposed he seals her protesting 
               lips by kissing her

               from the prowlers pov the camera moves to get a better 
               angle a hand moves into frame and pulls back some branches 
               to clear the field of vision a branch pops

                                     claudette
                              in a thick whisper
                         somebodys there barry

                                     barry
                         come on claudette a mans not made 
                         of stone

                                     claudette
                         lets go back barry

                                     barry
                         i need you so much claudette

               barry leans in and unhooks her bra they kiss again 
               passionately

               the prowler pauses then moves never seen  except for a 
               bit of foot or hand  from the pov of the camera closer 
               and closer as the two teenagers become more and more 
               oblivious

               closer the theme has snuck in it becomes discordant it 
               swells closer

               quick cut to barry  claudettes faces their eyes closed 
               the perspiration streaking their flushed skin

               suddenly claudette looks up into the camera with terror

               a hatchet flashes into frame and claudette goes down under 
               the blow

               the camera turns to barry the prowlers powerful hand has 
               him by the throat he backpeddles trying to get away

               another angle as barry is stopped against a tree

               a hunting knife soars against the leafy sky barry grabs the 
               knifehand at the wrist the knife falls to the mossy floor 
               of the clearing

               two hands go for the free blade barrys hand has it

               there is a confused jumble of struggle

               onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the prowler

               reaction shot barry horrified by the sight

               the prowlers hand has the knife it moves quickly forward 
               we can hear the blade strike

               barry stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek

               mcu the moss where the finger fell the prowler reaches into 
               frame picks up the finger and exits frame

               quick cut to chloe out searching for the missing counselors 
               she stands at the edge of the clearing her hands pressed on 
               her temples her throat filled with a scream of terror the 
               music has stopped abruptly

               the screen bleeds to white

               it is completely silent

                                                                    cut to

               title sequence

               the screen is completely black a small white shape starts 
               to zooms towards the fg the shape becomes a threedimensional 
               rendering of friday the 13th just as it gets to its final 
               position the friday 13 logo shatters a previously unseen 
               pane of glass there is a loud crash the logo shifts to the 
               upper left corner of the frame as we rolls titles white on 
               black

               the theme music is a reprise of the theme we heard during 
               the forest sequence now done in a childlike arrangement

               titles end and the music fades out

                                                               dissolve to

               ext rural town  early morning

               the track is silent

               in a long shot we see the one main street a newspaper 
               delivery truck drives away from the camera a girl walks 
               down the street superimposed title

               brenda rolls a straw target out from under the leanto shelter

               the camera closes in tighter and tighter on her as she gets 
               closer to setting up the target

               in mcu she lifts a target up her head is very close to the 
               face of the target she gets it up lets the tripod take the 
               weight and then just as she lifts her weight back an arrow 
               streaks into the center of the gold missing her head by 
               eighteen inches

               the room is small there is the metalframe cot an old wooden 
               dresser with a cloudy mirror on top the walls are a light 
               blue freshly painted the wall on the inside does not go 
               all the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor whats 
               going on in the campers section of the cabin on the other

               alice looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes

               the camera watches jacks actions tightly in a reverse pov 
               we see jacks tongue come out the side of his mouth as he 
               concentrates he bites down on it

               another angle as jack pulls the starter cord the engine 
               roars into action

               switch a spark arcs and we pull back to see jack with a 
               perfect connection running through his body there is a 
               sparking sound the little light in the shed blinks jack 
               screams the generator chugs roughly hundreds of volts are 
               streaking through jacks body and grounded through his wet

               bill reacts quickly knowing better than to touch him and 
               continue the connection he takes a halfstep backwards 
               aims at an oblique angle and executes a perfect bruce lee
               type dropkick on his friend severing the contact

               jack stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead the

               jack shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in 
               eerie shadows she flashes hers at him

                                     marcie

                         a dozen times there is a 
                         thunderstorm the rain comes down 
                         like pebbles i can hear the sound 
                         i try to close my ears off it doesnt 
                         work the sounds gets louder the 
                         rain turns to blood and the blood 
                         washes down in little rivers and 
                         the sound stops

               a loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart marcie 
               is startled and reaches out for her lover

                                     jack
                         its just a dream

               they look at one another in the two lights they grin rain 
               drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind 
               them

                                     jack
                         this is no dream want to escape for

                         lead the way

               jack turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin marcie is only 
               a half step behind laughing

               from a distant angle we watch them run there is no theme 
               just the rumble of thunder

                                                                    cut to

               the door bursts open a flashlight pierces the shadows and 
               jack and marcie rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the 
               nearest bed

                                     marcie

                                     jack
                         just a little wait a minute woman

               he reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points 
               straight up and gives them some light to see by

               they go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by 
               marcies hand coming up from behind jack and tugging his t
               shirt up towards his head he leans back and takes it off 
               and tosses it at the camera

                                                                    cut to

                         im not always this stupid

               she turned back into the cabin

                                                                    cut to

               tight on jack and marcie as they make love under a camp 
               blanket their breathing and noises are heard just above the 
               sounds of the rain outside

               the camera becomes interested in a droplet which appear to 
               have leaked from the ceiling hit the vertical member of the 
               bed and dribbled down as the bed shakes with its lovemaking 
               the camera pans up the bunks strut to trace the droplets 
               course

               as the camera pans upward it pulls back slightly and we see 
               ned lying in the upper bunk in a flash of lightning we 
               realize he is dead his throat has been slashed

               another angle jack and marcie lie completely still beneath 
               their blanket the camera pans along their quiet bodies 
               marcies face is contented jack is ready to doze off

               alice waits by the couch as mrs voorhees crosses the room 
               to the back window

               mrs voorhees turns back and as she passes the pingpong 
               table she picks up the lantern

               alice waits at the fireplace

                         have been a camp not for children 
                         they had so much trouble here

               the fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace a log burns 
               through and rolls off throwing up a small shower of sparks

                                     mrs voorhees

                         you know a boy drowned the year before 
                         those two others were killed an 
                         accident it was inadequate 
                         supervision the counselors were not 
                         paying enough attention they were 
                         making love when that boy drowned

               alice looks up as the woman strokes her hair

               another angle mcu as the older womans hand strokes the 
               younger womans hair the hand is missing its little finger

               the theme enters upon the track in a lyrical childlike 
               version echoing back to another era pretty and light

                                     mrs voorhees
                              continuing

                         maybe we should wait for mr christy

               mrs voorhees shakes her head gently

                                     mrs voorhees
                         no that wont be necessary

               as she speaks mrs voorhees reaches into her slicker in a 
               surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting 
               knife

                                     alice
                         i dont understand

               mixed on the track filtered echoed and distant is the 
               sound of a ten year old boy jason crying for help in a 
               fantasy version of what might have happened when he drowned 
               in 1957

                         why shouldnt we wait for mr christy

               mrs voorhees has gone through some subtle changes while 
               her voice remains warm and comforting her face has started 
               to slip into her other manifestation all of this is in 
               concert with the visibility of her weapon

                                     mrs voorhees
                         it was my son they killed they said 
                         he drowned but i know it was 
                         inadequate supervision

               alice starts to become increasingly anxious she cant see 
               the knife rise behind her

                                     alice
                         mr christy will be back soon

               mrs voorhees shakes her head from side to side

                                     mrs voorhees
                         no he wont i killed him as well

               the shock of recognition hits alice in cu her eyes look up 
               and see the knife which mrs voorhees now has poised and 
               ready to strike

               alice bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the 
               fireplace scattering ashes and sparks

               mrs voorhees stands and steps forward

                                     mrs voorhees

               alice in panic looks for an escape she grabs the fireplace 
               poker

                         i wont let you

               alice swings the poker back and forth

               mrs voorhees raises her arm to slash downward with the knife 
               alice swings the poker hard to mrs voorhees other arm and 
               rib cage

               mrs voorhees is in pain her face a mask of rage

               alice drops the poker to run for the door mrs voorhees 
               hesitates for a moment then follows alice deliberately

               lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder

                                                                    cut to

               of the screen somebody has latched it

               closer on alice taking one look over her shoulder kicks at 
               the door snapping the latch

               another angle as alice runs out into the rain the mud the 
               thunder and the lightning the theme is going fulltilt as 
               alice makes a quick turn to run towards the road

               twoshot as alice bumps into an object which swings from 
               above a slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body 
               of steve christy hanging from the tree a rope is looped 
               under his arms his head is down on his chest and a long 
               blade protrudes from his heart

               alice is hiding in the shadows behind a table we hear the 
               sounds of the generator starting outside and suddenly three 
               bright overhead lights come on

               alice looks across the room to the light switch afraid to 
               reveal her hiding place

               she looks for an escape theres a window she starts for 
               it then stops and turns and dives under an arts  crafts 
               table

               another angle mrs voorhees opens the door and walks in a 
               few feet

               she carries a machete in her hand we see this instrument in 
               cu as we hear over the sound of her son jason calling to

                         please

               the camera pans up to her face and we see that the voice of 
               jason is coming from within her in lip sync she is both 
               characters  though the childs voice is authentically 
               dubbed

               alice can just make out what is happening and can hear the 
               voice of jason

               alice is very still her eyes widen as she listens to mrs 
               voorhees rave

                         breathe help me breathe

               mrs voorhees is having trouble catching her own breath  
               she strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of 
               the child stops

                                     mrs voorhees
                              in her own voice
                         i cant let them kill any more 
                         children come out now

               she wades through table after table pushing them out of her 
               way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the 
               prowler

               when mrs voorhees is too quick for her shoving a table 
               across her path like a barred door before alice can think 
               twice mrs voorhees has shoved a second table in behind her 
               so that now alice is sandwiched between them she can duck 
               down or climb over or come out the only open end  the end 
               where mrs voorhees is standing

               alice looks behind her and sees a shelf on the shelf is a 
               box

               mrs voorhees is coming down the aisle between the two tables 
               her machete is coming up in an attack

               alice reaches into the box in cu and pulls out a handful of 
               leatherworking tools she hurls them at mrs voorhees as 
               hard as she can

               mrs voorhees has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning 
               knives one cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low 
               animal bellow

               alice leaps up climbs over the table and runs for the door

               mrs voorhees shoves the tables over and hurries after her

               alice gets to the door shuts off the light switch and runs 
               out

               alice runs out the door

                                                                    cut to

               alice huffs past the dead camper van through the mud to the 
               front door of the main cabin she runs in quickly there is 
               no sign of mrs voorhees she turns off the lights and runs 
               into the kitchen

                                                                    cut to

               int kitchen area  night

               alice looks from side to side hoping to find a place to 
               hide she spots the halfopen door to the larder looks inside 
               and then hides there closing the door behind her

                                                                    cut to

               int larder  night

               there is some light that comes through the cracks and 
               crevices alices hands fasten onto the inside lock  the 
               dead bolt type which requires a key to unlock it from the 
               other side

               alice relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside

               as soon as she relaxes we hear the front screen door slam 
               then we hear some shuffling around outside the lights are 
               turned on

                                     jason vo
                         please kill her mommy help me 
                         please kill her mommy

               there is the sound of pots being rustled through then the 
               sound of another door being slammed

               alice relaxes again

               then there is a silence alice thinks about unlocking the 
               door now she reaches out for the lock then thinks better 
               of the idea

               she cases down the door frame to the floor on all sides are 
               the cans of food and cooking implements there is a large 
               skillet some bags of flour etc

               alice covers her head with her arms the doorknob above her 
               head a few inches away turns very slowly we see it but 
               she does not mrs voorhees hand finishes turning and now 
               starts to push gently there is almost no give but we see 
               that the door is being tested

               the voice on the other side is very young very singsong

                                     jason os
                         come out come out wherever you 
                         are

               alice jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small 
               room

               fists bang in a rage on the floor

                                     alice
                         please

               alice folds her hands at the side of her face

               the fistbanging gives way to a short silence

               the silence is interrupted by a new sound mrs voorhees has 
               begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the 
               door to the larder

               reaction shot alice oh my god

               at first we see nothing on our side then gradually we see 
               little slivers of lights admitted by the blades chops 
               alices eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon 
               a defense anything

               larger holes are now made mrs voorhees stops just long 
               enough to take a peck inside we can see her eye at the 
               largest hole she goes back to whacking away at the door 
               the hole is near the lock it is soon big enough for mrs 
               voorhees to reach inside with her hand and turn the rachet

               alice realizes she must defend herself she reaches down and 
               picks up a heavy skillet and as the door opens alice raises 
               her weapon and screaming charges the woman who is trying 
               to come through the entrance

               mrs voorhees chops down with the machete alice fends off 
               the blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands 
               above her head as the machete blade bounces off the skillet 
               alice is able to swing the skillet downward and hit mrs 
               voorhees with a solid blow on top of her head mrs voorhees 
               sprawls sideways across the table and then collapses in a 
               heap on the floor

               alice raises the skillet again to strike she crosses 
               carefully to mrs voorhees and pushes her gently with her 
               foot the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway

               another angle mrs voorhees lies totally inert there is a 
               small puddle of blood under her head

               angle on alice she relaxes puts down her weapon and crosses 
               slowly out of the room

                                                                    cut to

               the moon comes out from behind a cloud alice pushes a canoe 
               into the water and paddles as rapidly as her tired body 
               will permit out in the lake to safety

                                                                    cut to

               exhausted alice puts her paddle across her lap and falls 
               forward slumped across a thwart

                                                                    cut to

               the first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the 
               horizon promising a hot and sunny summers day the birds 
               are up foraging for food

               as the camera scans the peaceful scene we see the sky 
               reflected in the calm waters of crystal lake the canoe 
               holding alice is drifting in big slow circles across the 
               surface of the lake

                                                                    cut to

               alice lies in mcu in the canoe sleeping she has not 
               changed her position since collapsing a few hours before 
               the water laps gently against the side of the canoe very 
               slowly she wakes she opens her eyes

               the canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree 
               boughs that overhang the edge of the lake

               they shade alice from the bright rays of the sun the canoe 
               rocks gently alice is still listening to the sound of the 
               lapping water

               suddenly there is a bloodcurdling scream a musical stinger 
               and the screen is filled with the flying whirling form of 
               mrs voorhees who leaps from the overhanging boughs into 
               the canoe barely missing alices slumped form

               the canoe immediately overturns and both mrs voorhees and 
               alice try to find their footing in the shallow water mrs 
               voorhees is covered in mud and blood she sees alice 
               struggling to get up and move toward her brandishing her 
               bloodspattered machete alice turns sees mrs voorhees 
               coming alice grabs a paddle floating near her mrs voorhees 
               pushes the canoe to one side wading through the waisthigh 
               water as fast as she can she screams with rage her face 
               goes through a horrifying transformation from her mouth 
               comes the voice of jason

                                     jason
                         mommy mommy mommy

               alice cant move fast enough to get away from mrs voorhees 
               who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit 
               alice alice slips falls in the water gets her footing 
               back and has to turn and block the blow of the machete with 
               the paddle using it like a staff to ward off the blow the 
               machete cuts the paddle nearly in half mrs voorhees raises 
               the knife for another blow and alice lunges for her knees 
               and succeeds in throwing mrs voorhees into the water the 
               machete flies out of her hand and lands in the water the 
               two women roll in the water mrs voorhees is trying to 
               strangle alice her hands stretching to reach around her 
               throat they roll over and under the water we cannot see 
               who is winning

               suddenly mrs voorhees finds her footing and stands up 
               looking for alice she is screeching madly

               alice shoots up out of the water holding the machete and in 
               one wild swing decapitates mrs voorhees whose head flies 
               off into the water

               the body stands for a minute then falls heavily into the 
               lake

               alice drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to 
               shore

                                                                    cut to

               alice walks slowly down the road away from the camp we hear 
               the sound of a car approaching now it comes into view it 
               is a state vehicle black and white with an emblem on the 
               door that says state department of health and safety there 
               are two middleaged bureaucrats inside

               alice waves down the car which pulls up beside her
