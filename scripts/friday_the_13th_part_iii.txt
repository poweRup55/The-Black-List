              title and credits
 
              a piercing high note is sustained on the soundtrack as the
              main title crystal japan speeds straight at the audience
              in 3d and seems to jump right out at them
 
              the opening credits follow  ominous theme music fills the
              soundtrack growing darker and more dissonant
 
              the theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio
              news broadcast as the credits continue to unfold

              shooting over a line of ruffled bushes with leaves just
              turning towards a rural timeworn country market  a wide
              gravel parking area makes it accessible to the highway
              running past it otherwise this mom  pop store seems almost
              like a vision of times gone by
 
              the bushes and overgrown grass unrestrained by any human
              care strengthen the sense of isolation  the dying sun
              shoots its last rays through the trees behind the market
 
              the market has a battered secondstory the living quarters
              of the people running it  a truck roars by  then silence
              and then again the sound of the radio news report

                        judging from the sheer
                        brutality of the murders police
                        theorize that they must have been
                        committed by at least four
                        persons
 
              ext the house  store  another angle
 
              sagging clotheslines cluttered with drying laundry run across
              a narrow backyard all the way to a rickety old shed  the
              clotheslines are supported by one solitary pole  linen and
              garments billow in the rising evening breeze
 
              cold foreboding music accompanies the camera as it moves
              toward a pair of flapping khaki pants and an olive green
              workshirt hanging side by side on the line
 
              the radio news report grows louder as the clothing snaps
              directly into the lens

              heavy footsteps
 
              and then a man parts two shrouds of wet laundry making his
              way back towards the house  this is harold 40ish paunchy
              unshaven and so clumsy that he hits the clothesline pole and
              knocks it down burying himself under a heap of linen  a
              transistor radio pops out of the pocket of his threadbare
              shirt still broadcasting the news  one of the upstairs
              windows opens with a creak and

                        shows how much you care about me

              harold watches her from under the pile of laundry  then he
              grabs the radio staggers up increasing the radios volume
              as he does so to drown out the voice of his wife
 
              above him edna raves on for a moment we cant make out what
              she is saying then furiously slams the window shut

              the room is musty and cluttered like an old attic  edna
              stomps away from the window and turns her attention to the
              partially functional old clunker of a black and white tv
              she plops herself down onto the lumpy couch and picks up two
              knitting needles and returns to work on a sweater  a news

                        have been combing the area since
                        just before dawn  reports of
                        cannibalism and sexual mutilation
                        are still unconfirmed
                        nevertheless these murders are
                        already being called the most
                        brutal in local history

                        the motive behind the grisly
                        murders remains a mystery at this
                        hour as does the identity of the
                        killer or killers  the search

              it is

              no sign of anyone but there is an empty span of clothesline

              back  the market is dark save does shafts of dying sunlight
              through the grimy front windows

              soup cans and stands on its hind legs on the aisle trying
              to guess ednas next move  still calling harold she turns
              starts at the sight of the rabbit she grabs a tomato from

              the sunlight is almost gone stretching the shadows even
              more  in her nightgown edna pushed open the creaky screen
              door and steps out into the backyard
 
              shooting towards her through the laundry flapping on the
              clothesline  as she touches a set of pajamas and finds out
              that they are still wet
 
              a shoulder suddenly enters the flame and someones
              silhouette blocks the screen just for a couple of seconds
              before the intruder slips behind another curtain of drying
              clothes revealing edna again  shes still checking the
              clothes and hasnt noticed anything
 
              she comes to where the trousers and workshirt were and no
              longer  thats a shock but shes not quite sure that they
              were here in the first place so she goes on and starts
              talking to herself to fortify her ailing courage

              edna hears a noise and whips around  her imagination is
              working overtime

              a bedsheet is swelling slowly in the breeze taking the shape
              of a human body  is anyone behind it  ominous music

              she charges forward  she rips the sheet off the line and
              falls in a heap with it  there is no one behind it
 
              she turns over and lays on her back  above her theres only
              the dark evening sky and the branches of a tree rustling
              back and forth
 
              edna gets up and quickly pulls the remaining laundry off the
              lines tossing it into the basket  as she does she passes
              near the wooden shed at the back of the store
 
              ext yard

              the white rabbit that gave edna such a scare is now hopping
              across a row of canned goods  a mans hand enters frame and
              grabs the rabbit by the nape of its neck and lifts it off the
              shelf into his arms
 
              its harold  he places the rabbit on his shoulder and grabs
              a jar of peanuts from the shelf  he twists open the vacuum
              sealed jar and wolfs down a handful of its contents  with
              another handful he feeds the rabbit who sniffs and partakes
 
              harold rescrews the lid and places it back on the shelf  he
              turns on the radio in his breast pocket  music blares
 
              he grabs his broom and starts sweeping down the aisle the
              rabbit remaining contentedly on his shoulder
 
              harold stops at the dairy case and grabs a halfgallon jug of
              milk  he breaks the seal and pulls off the cap  he first
              offers the rabbit a taste then gulps down a swig himself

              in the background
 
              an unidentified face in soft focus peers in through the
              storefront window then disappears almost as quickly  harold
              is unaware
 
              harold
 
              screws the cap back on and replaces the jug in the case

              harold turns around  the the produce section the cellophane
              packages of carrots on display are moving slightly
 
              he reaches in and pushes off the top few packages to reveal
              underneath another rabbit a grey one this time nibbling on
              a carrot
 
              he lifts the rabbit out of the case and places it on his
              opposite shoulder

              on his way to the back door harold passes a rack of cakes
              and pies  he stops long enough to open a box of six
              chocolatecovered donuts  he takes one out and shoves it
              into his mouth
 
              unbeknownst to harold a human form in shadow appears at the
              back door  the door is quietly pushed open  someone is
              watching him

              checks filled to capacity  harold closes the package and
              puts it back in place on the rack hiding it under several
              unopened packages

              startled he jumps back and chokes on the doughnuts  the

              harold exits by way of the back door

              harold puts the grey rabbit on his shoulder the white rabbit
              remains wrapped in his arms  he swallows the rest of the
              doughnut in his mouth as he flips a flashlight out of his
              back pocket and ambles across the yard
 
                                                       cut to
 
              int shed  night
 
              light filters through the cracked walls partially
              illuminating a variety of tools old barrels various odds 
              ends  and a rabbit hutch
 
              harold flicks on the flashlight as he enters  the rabbit
              atop his shoulder jumps off and scurries away  the rabbit in
              his arms squirms and squeals  the animals sense that
              something is wrong
 
                                  harold
                               stroking the white
                                rabbit
                        whatre you little guys so nervous
                        about
 
              he scans the shed with the flashlight to locate the runaway
              as he tries to contain the jittery ball of fur in his arms

              the flashlight searches each corner until the beam finally
              stops on
 
              the rabbit hutch
 
              music pounds hard on the soundtrack as through the hutch
              grillwork we can see a mass of dead rabbits lying one next
              to the other staring up with glinting glass eyes
 
              harold stands immobilized in a state of shock  he looks
              down upon the limp bodies of his beloved pets his face
              turned into a sad mask of outrage  he holds onto the white
              rabbit even tighter
 
                                  harold
                        who would do this
 
              trembling harold reaches to lift the lid of the hutch  the
              music throbs
 
              a big timber rattlesnake springs out of the hutch mouth wide
              and open twin poisonous fangs shining in the beam of the
              flashlight
 
              the music drops out as the snakes loud kiss dominates  the
              muscles of its dark lean body push the deadly mouth ahead
              into the lens of the camera
 
              instinctively harold slams the hutch down dropping his
              flashlight and the white rabbit  the snake hisses and spits
              at the camera through the wife mesh
 
              literally scared shitless harold races out of the shed
              holding his stomach with both hands

                        what happened  whats the matter

              harold cant talk  he rubs his stomach and heads straight

              she reaches for her knitting bag and empties its contents
              one of her two long thin knitting needles is missing

              the room is a combination  storing place mostly there are
              two ample cupboards facing each other each leaning against
              a wall a mess of crates and boxes lying on top of each other
              behind a dusty curtain and a toilet bowl left from the
              days when this was just an oversized bathroom  the toilet
              bowl is against the fourth wall at an angle behind the door
 
              the sound of the tv filters through the door as harold
              trousers down to his knees sits on the toilet sighing with
              relief as the first bout of diarrhea is over
 
              he loosens his collar wipes some sweat from his brow
              reaches behind the toilet tank and produces a hidden bottle
              of whiskey
 
              he unscrews the cap and takes a hardy swig  he leans back
              and shut his eyes
 
                                  harold
                               to himself
                        those poor little creatures
 
              another swig  some of the liquor spills over his chin and he
              wipes it with his sleeve  his eyes wander around aimlessly
              then focus on

              the dusty curtain
 
              partially masking the mess of boxes and crates  it seems to
              ripple subtly moved by an ever so slight movement of air
              perhaps someones breath
 
              harold waits  the curtains seem still  harold is about to
              relax when a brief hollow noise is heard
 
              harold tries to locate the noise but its over before he can
              tell its source  pants around his ankles he rises shuffles
              to one of the closets  it takes some courage to yank the
              door open and the camera moves fast into a
 
              flat closeup of empty shelves  nothing has touched them in
              a long time except dust
 
              breathing relief harold pulls up his pants again just
              enough to be able to hobble grotesquely to the dusty curtain
              he rips it apart stares at the odd assortment of boxes and
              crates  empty lifeless and uncannily menacing because of
              their lifelessness
 
              reassured harold gives the other closet a glance almost
              decides against checking it  and then changes his mind and
              stumbles pants still around his ankles towards it
 
              looks like this one hasnt been opened at all for a long
              time  harold tugs at the door  a creak followed instantly
              by a musical stinger as a huge hand holding a meat cleaver
              rips into the shot strikes harold imbedding the cleaver in
              his chest
 
              harold manages a halfscream that mixes incongruously with
              the laughter from the tv in the living room  as the hand
              twists the cleaver the scream becomes a raspy cough
 
              harold stumbles backwards and crashes to the floor

                        harold
 
              no answer  she gets up from the couch and goes to the
              bathroom door  she listens and hears the noise of the toilet
              flushing and flushing as if someones hand never released
              the lever

                                  edna
                               rattling the door

                        harold whats taking you so
                        long in there  you all right
 
              she pushes against the door  it doesnt budge  she looks
              down and notices some kind of liquid seeping out from
              underneath the bathroom door  she dips her fingers in it and
              sniffs

              she goes over to a desk opens a small drawer and finds a
              skeleton key
 
              she hurries back to the bathroomstoreroom door ready to
              insert the key  to her shock the door is now open a crack

              closets the boxes and crates
 
              int bathroom  night
 
              edna steps inside and inadvertently kicks the halfempty
              bottle of whiskey  she picks up the bottle while the
              flushing noise persists maddeningly
 
              she turns toward the toilet which is behind the door and
              screams at the sight of harold sitting there
 
              harold
 
              pants down like a grotesque dummy blood drooling out of the
              corners of his mouth the meat cleaver sticking out of his
              chest and one elbow stuck against the flushing handle
 
              the whiskey bottle falls from ednas hand hits the floor and
              shatters
 
              edna screams uncontrollably
 
              from behind her a huge hand enters the flame and pierces the
              back of her head with the previously missing knitting needle
              the needle is pushed out through her mouth right at the
              camera

              she gags on her own blood and slums out of frame

              although he has a pleasant face shelly is overweight greasy
              haired and unkempt
 
              chris and debbie lead the way for andy and shelly up the

                               looking across the

              white smoke billows out of the van windows engulfing the
              vehicle and the luggage tied to the top
 
              the whole group rushes off the porch and races to the van
              the first one there andy opens the passenger side door and
              jumps in  chris runs around to the drivers side and does
              the same
 
              int van
 
              through thick acrid smoke chili and her boyfriend chuck

              with marijuana  each wears a stereo headset that is plugged
              into their own sony walkman portable cassette players

              rear of the van
 
              chili and chuck are sprawled out on the floor taking
              inventory of their numerous joints and bags of marijuana
 
              shelly sits crosslegged near the very back of the van
              opposite vera who sits with her legs open  daydreaming she
              gazes upward at the sky and treetops through the back window
 
              shelly cant stop staring at vera admiring her sexy body
              vera senses that shelly is undressing her with his eyes and
              quickly turns her head around and catches him looking at her
              breasts  shelly averts his eyes in embarrassment and looks
              over at chuck who lights up a joint inhales and hands it
              chili
 
                                  shelly

                        against it
 
                                  shelly
                               persisting

                        your life
 
                                  chuck
                               confused
                        like what
 
                                  chili

              she offers the joint to shelly  he declines  chili offers
              it to vera
 
                                  vera
                        sure why not
 
              vera comes forward on her hands and knees reaching out for
              the joint  as she does she inadvertently thrusts her
              shapely rear end almost into shellys face  shelly makes no
              attempt to retreat from it  actually he rather enjoys it
 
                                  vera
                               as she draws on the
                                joint
                        is this stuff any good
 
                                  chuck
                        home grown man  of course its

                        strictly organic  no
                        preservatives man
 
              andy sniffs at the air around him filled with the aroma of
              good grass
 
                                  andy
                        hey lets share the wealth with
                        those less fortunate up front here
 
              vera passes the joint to him and sits back down across from
              shelly
 
              shelly is rummaging through a small black suitcase its
              contents are concealed from veras view

                                  vera

              vera turns away and looks out the back window
 
              we can hear the faint sounds of sirens
 
              ext highway  day
 
              in the distance two police cruisers with lights flashing
              in hot pursuit

              they all look at one another perplexed  vera is amused
              without a word and simultaneously chili and chuck begin to
              stuff loose grass and joints into their mouths

                                  chuck

              side of the driveway as one approaches some thirty yards
              diagonally across from the house there is a tall red barn
              with a hayloft equipped with a block and tackle to bring up
              the bales of hay into the lofts square window

              to the right of the house is an outhouse with a heartshaped
              venthole in its wooden door
 
              to the left of the house is a large lake with a knotty old
              dock and a small treecovered island in the middle  the
              whole area is surrounded by a lush landscape
 
              the sound of a vehicle approaching
 
              the camera reveals this serene idyllic panorama and picks up
              chris van as it bumps along the dirt road and slows down to
              a crawl to pass over a creaky dilapidated wooden bridge that
              runs over a driedup stream
 
              int house
 
              the camera peers overtheshoulder of an unidentifiable
              figure as he moves from one living room window to the other
              watching the van as it sweeps under the low branches towards
              the house
 
              ext house
 
              the van comes to a stop  chris jumps out and looks towards
              the house  a collection of memories posses her for a moment
              before she reaches for the knotted rope and unties the tarp
              covering the bulk of the baggage on top
 
                                  chris
                               loud so the others
                                can hear
                        lets bring in the luggage first
                        then ill give you a tour of the
                        house and the barn and then we can
                        hang out at the lake all right
 
              no response  just the distant sound of feet running and
              laughter
 
              chris walks around to the other side of the van and finds the
              doors left wide open and no one about  she turns to see her
              friends running towards the lake unable to resist the
              splendor of the shimmering water and sun dappled landscape
 
              debbie turns back and gestures for chris to join them
 
                                  debbie
                        come on down
 
                                  chris
                               shaking her head
                        you go ahead

              in the background behind chris the shadowy figure out of
              focus appears behind a curtain in the living room
 
                                  chris
                               to debbie
                        im gonna take my bags into the
                        house first and look around
 
              chris turns toward the house  the figure disappears from
              view  chris grabs a piece of baggage in each hand and
              innocently strides up the path and porch steps to the front
              door
 
              it has been a while since she has last visited the family
              country home and she is actually pleased to have this moment
              to herself
 
              she rifles through her handbag comes up with the keys and
              reaches for the doorknob to find that the door is already
              open ever so slightly  a look of concern flashes across
              chris face
 
                                  chris
                               continuing
                        hello
 
              only the distant sounds of her friends by the lake can be
              heard
 
              cautiously chris pushes the door  creaking it opens wide
              she hesitates a moment then takes a step inside
 
                                  chris
                               hearing a noise
                        whos there
 
              from out of nowhere a hand grabs chris by the neck and pulls
              her out of frame  she screams
 
              then the soundtrack becomes coldly silent
 
                                                       cut to
 
              int living room  cottage  day
 
              pinned up against the wall chris is being embraced and
              kissed passionately by a man whose face is not yet visible
 
              resisting chris pushes him off

              chris embraces derek  behind them passing the porch
              windows out of focus is the shadowy figure of jason
              neither chris nor derek is aware of the presence

                                  chris

              away from the windows out of sight

              chris moves around to the opposite side  the sliding door
              which was previously wide open is now closed
 
                                  chris

                        nothing
 
              the sound of the others thrashing about in the lake can be
              heard as chris reaches for the handle and whisks the door
              aside  instinctively she braces herself but nothing jumps
              out at her  annoyed with herself for being so suspicious and
              jumpy chris just leans in and grabs for the first bag she
              sees
 
              a hand springs into frame and wraps around chris wrist  she
              gasps and jumps back
 
              shelly sticks his head out the side of the van
 
                                  shelly

              doorway are chili and chuck just come from the lake drenched
              and dripping in their wet clothing

                        down there either
 
              chili flicks a wall switch next to her  a naked light bulb
              springs to life glowing dimly
 
                                  chili
                        theres nothin to be afraid of
 
              she takes chuck by the hand and leads him down the stairs
              their sneakers sodden with water squeak and squish as they
              go  water drips from their hair and clothes forming little
              puddles that follow their every step
 
              the basement is overrun with cobwebs and spiderwebs  rusted
              gardening tools broken bicycle parts and boxes of old toys
              are strewn helterskelter  an old washer and dryer sit just
              to the left of the electrical fusebox

                                  chili
                               continuing
                        gimme your threads man
 
              chuck pulls off his shirt and hands it to chili  she rings
              it out onto the floor creating a pool of water under the
              fusebox
 
              as chuck zips down his pants chili turns on the dryer
              annoyingly the dryer rattles and shakes
 
              suddenly the light bulb goes off plunging the twosome into
              near darkness
 
              foreboding music enters the soundtrack
 
                                  chuck
                        you broke the electricity man
 
              but yet the dryer clatters on
 
              from over by the stairs the sound of a metal object being
              kicked against the door
 
              chili and chuck whirl around to look
 
              a rusty old roller skate bounces down the stairs and hits
              bottom with a clunk
 
                                  chuck

              flooding the room with light  she opens the windows  a
              cool breeze blows in
 
              debbie surveys the cheerful room with antique furniture that
              includes a folding  japanesestyle dressing curtain  but
              there is one important element missing in this bedroom
              theres no bed

                        uh chris i dont mean to be
                        picky but where do we sleep
 
              with an impish smile chris goes over to the closet and pulls
              out a crumpled mass of netting  she hands it to debbie
 
                                  debbie
                               perplexed

              debbie begins to unravel the nylon mesh when suddenly a gust
              of wind topples over the japanese dressing curtain  it hits
              the floor with a sharp slap  at the same exact moment the
              door is kicked open with a bang slamming against the
              opposite wall
 
              debbie jumps  its andy  he squeezes through the door with
              the bulky baggage

              with the back of his foot andy kicks the door to close it
              an instant before the door slams shut we see a fleeting yet
              ominous glimpse of jason behind andy in the hallway

              the floor some linen strewn about the dresser drawers are
              pulled out and left hanging
 
              derek comes into the room carrying a box full of wooden
              paddles with little rubber balls attached by a long elastic
              thread

                        someone coming after you  thats
                        no way to live
 
              chris looks at derek thoughtfully but unconvinced  they
              finish making the bed in silence

              several six packs of empty beer bottles line a picnic table
              which is further cluttered with halfeaten sandwiches and the
              usual array of picnic goodies

              shelly and vera sits across from each other in the midst of
              a beer chugging contest  derek andy and chuck sit on either
              side shelly encouraging him to victory  chris chili and
              debbie on either side of vera do likewise
 
              vera downs her next bottle with apparent ease  shelly balks
              as another beer is thrust in front of him
 
                                  shelly
                               nauseous
                        no more i cant
 
                                  andy
                        yes you can  come on shelly
 
              shelly relents and suffers the beer as it goes down  the
              accomplishment is met with a pat on the back
 
              vera too hesitates for a moment then chugs her beer this
              time more slowly and with a degree of difficulty
 
              tipsy shelly rises to his feet
 
                                  shelly
                               as if in control
                        if youll all please excuse me
 
              shelly picks up his small black suitcase and walks off on
              wobbly legs
 
                                  andy
                               yelling after him
                        how could you let her beat you
 
              shelly
 
              grabs his mouth and runs past the house into the outhouse
              slamming the door behind him
 
              the sounds of shelly vomiting can be heard
 
              int outhouse
 
              leaning over the hole shelly wipes his mouth with his
              sleeve  weakened and defeated he sits down and leans his
              head back against the wall closing his eyes
 
              an ominous tone enters the soundtrack
 
              from behind shelly the camera moves past him and looks out
              from the heartshaped venthole carved in the door

              from this distant vantage point we can see up to a second
              floor window where a shadowy figure jason looks down from
              behind a sheer curtain
 
              shelly
 
              opens his eyes and listens to the others by the lake having
              fun without him  he stands up and out of frame
 
              ext outhouse
 
              shelly comes out of the outhouse  alone with his black
              suitcase he starts for the front door of the house
 
              the ominous tone returns to the soundtrack
 
              the camera cranes up to the secondfloor bedroom window where
              moments before the shadowy figure stood watching  the figure
              is now gone from the window  only the curtains rustle in the
              breeze
 
              the sound of the front door slamming  shelly is inside

              camera is behind shelly as he ascends the spiral staircase
              halfway up he hears a loud thud  pausing to listen he
              turns his face around right into camera  he hears nothing
              further and continues up the stairs
 
              when he reaches the landing he hears screaming coming from
              the lake  he rushes into the bedroom which faces the water
 
              int bedroom  day
 
              its andy and debbies bedroom where the hammock is now set
              up draped with a bedspread  shelly looks out on the lake
 
              shellys pov
 
              the screaming is nothing more than playful activity
 
              suddenly the sound of a window in the room slamming shut
              startled shelly whips around to see the window beside the
              japanese dressing curtain now closed  dust around the window
              has been unsettled  the japanese curtain wavers  shelly
              cannot see behind it
 
              he edges over to the curtain and flings it aside  theres
              nothing there  he exits

              int hallway  day
 
              he walks to his room at the far end of the corridor and
              pushes on the door to open it  it doesnt budge  leading
              with his shoulder he bashes into the door  this time it
              gives  shelly stumbles offbalance into the room this is
              the same room which looks directly down on the outhouse
 
              a highpitched foreboding note enters the soundtrack
 
              shelly takes a long look back down the hallway as he closes
              the door
 
              camera holds for a moment on the closed door as the musical
              note intensifies

              a chilling bloodcurdling scream from inside the house
              shatters the calm by the lake

              int second floor hallway
 
              she looks both ways down the corridor and sees shellys

              tries the knob and pushes  the door is stuck  she kicks it
              open with her foot  the door slams against the wall of the

              the room is in order  chris takes a few hesitant steps
              inside looking all around  theres no trace of him
 
              there are two closets in the room  chris reaches out for the
              nearest one and pulls open the door
 
              musical stinger
 
              shelly
 
              an axe imbedded in his head and bleeding profusely falls
              forward into chris arms  she shrieks as shellys lifeless
              body slides down her arm and slumps to the floor  chris
              recoils screaming in horror

              calisthenics  chili and chuck sit together on the porch
              swing opposite andy sharing a joint  they watch andys awe
              inspiring performance as they rock back and forth
 
                                  chuck
                        maybe we should do some exercise

                        this is all the exercise i need
 
              she raises the joint to her mouth and tokes on it
 
              in the background debbie comes jogging out of the woods
              over to the small bridge and towards the house  behind her
              the wartorn volkswagen beetle winds its way down the dirt
              road  debbie turns and jogs backwards as the car approaches
 
              chili chuck and andy see the car coming the damage is
              evident even from a distance  they run from the porch as the
              vw passes debbie and comes to a halt just in front of the
              barn
 
              chili chuck andy and debbie surround the car  chuck puts
              his hand through the frame of the windshield and touches
              veras face

                                  chuck
                        wheres your windshield man

              shelly and vera grab the bags and get out of the car  they
              hand the packages to chili and chuck
 
                                  vera
                        we had a slight misunderstanding
                        with that motorcycle gang
                               she puts her arm
                                around shelly
                         but shelly made them see the
                        error of their ways
 
                                  shelly
                               heroically
                        it was nothing
 
              together shelly and vera head for the house  andy and
              debbie linger by the car
 
              barn
 
              through the musty darkness a hulking hand reaches out and
              stealthily pushes open the creaky barn door  its jason  he
              peeks through the crack and watches the group
 
              derek and chris
 
              come running out of the house  derek is dumbfounded at the
              sight of his abused and battered car
 
                                  derek

              derek runs up to his car  chris follows  shelly and vera go
              inside the house  chili and chuck follow behind carrying
              the packages in
 
              the barn door slowly closes unseen by anyone
 
              derek
 
              examines the injuries sustained by his car
 
                                  derek
                        this is too painful to look at
 
                                  chris
                        why dont we drive over to the

                        mellow you out
 
              derek considers it for a moment

                        might be nice to get away from
                        these crazy friends of yours
 
              they jump into the car  the camera pans with the vw as it
              drives off revealing andy and debbie leaning against a tree
              kissing
 
                                  debbie
                        why dont we go take a swim

                        sounds disgusting  lets go
 
              he grabs debbie by the hand and runs with her towards the
              lake  as they run past the van debbie breaks away from andy
 
                                  debbie
                        you go ahead  im gonna get a
                        blanket

              andy continues to the lake walking on his hands when he
              reaches the dock
 
              van
 
              debbie slides open the side door and crawls inside
 
              ominous music invades the soundtrack
 
              a pair of dark booted feet approach furtively
 
              debbies rear end is practically sticking out as the boots
              sneak around the back of the van and edge their way towards
              her
 
              abruptly debbie backs down out of the vehicle blanket in
              hand and scampers away without seeing the prowler
 
              prowler
 
              camera tilts up from the boots to reveal ali the black
              motorcyclist  hes carrying an empty gas can and a siphon
              his eyes scan the area  theres no one on sight  debbie is
              already down by the lake
 
              he signals with his hands and out from the bushes come loco
              and fox  they scurry over to the van and duck down next to
              ali who is unscrewing the vans gas cap
 
                                  fox

                        nobodys gonna get hurt baby
 
              ali sticks the siphon down into the fuel tank and lays the
              gas can on the ground below it  loco tries to grab the
              siphon from ali
 
                                  loco

              foxs attention is drawn to the barn as her cohorts continue
              with the task at hand

              barn
 
              fox cautiously pulls open one of the two doors  it creaks
              loudly  she stops and looks around to see if anyone has
              heard  the coast is clear  she slips into the barn and
              pulls the door closed behind her

              int barn  dusk
 
              spears of fading sunlight thick with dust cut across the
              musty interior
 
              fox scans the premises  her face lights up with the smile of
              a child in a toy store trying to decide which area to explore
              first
 
              this is your typical barn with a variety of heavy duty tools
              some rusting saw horses wooden benches and ladders a horse
              stall haybins haystacks and a second floor hayloft and
              several storage rooms
 
              with the fascination of a street kid who has probably never
              seen the inside of a barn fox wanders through the rustic
              interior  in her highheeled boots she has trouble
              maneuvering around on the muddy hay covered floor
 
              as she approaches the toolshed one of her heels sticks deep
              into a sticky patch of mud and she falls forward offbalance
              to stop her fall fox reaches out for the toolshed handle
              she grabs it but the rotting old door tears off its hinges
              and she topples to the ground  her face landing inches away
              from a pitchforks prongs aiming upwards at her
 
              her eyes focus on the sharp teeth of the pitchfork  alarmed
              by the close call fox tosses the implement away gets up and
              dusts herself off
 
              looking skyward to the loft area fox moves over to its
              ladder and starts up  the ladder quivers as she ascends
              apparently dislodging a bale of hay at the top and sending it
              crashing towards her  or was it jason  fox swings her
              body out of the way just in time  the bale whizzes by her
              and hits the barn floor with a thud
 
              she continues up the ladder and disappears through the loft
              flooring

              ali and loco have just completed filling up one gas can and
              are starting to fill the second one  ali sticks the siphon
              in his mouth and draws on it  the gas begins to flow as loco
              shoves the container into place to catch all the fluid
 
              the sound of fox wailing like a wounded animal
 
              ali and loco spin around and look up
 
              pov of barn
 
              fox comes swinging out tarzanlike from the hayloft on the
              rope attached to the block and tackle  shes having a hell
              of a good time
 
                                  fox
                               shouting

              ali and loco
 
              watch her incredulously

                               shouting in a loud
                                whisper
                        quiet woman  get off that thing
 
              fox
 
              disappears from view through the square opening in the loft
              a second later she reappears swinging out on the rope again
 
                                  fox
                        but it feels so goooooood
 
              she swings back and disappears from view once more
 
              ali
 
              is not pleased
 
                                  ali

              this time the rope swings out from the loft without fox
              attached  theres a dead silence  the rope dangles

                        go get her out of there
 
              loco hunches over keeping his body low to the ground as he
              hightails it to the barn and zips inside

                        shit
 
              he hears the sound of banging against the wall of the loft
              above him  he starts up the ladder
 
                                  loco
                               continuing

              loco comes through the opening and steps onto the floorboard
              the deep shadows hide the corners of the loft and loco has to
              squint his eyes to see
 
              right behind him he hears the sound of the banging again  he
              whips around
 
              musical stinger
 
              in front of him foxs body raised off the ground and
              impaled with a pitchfork through her and into the wall

              her eyes are open wide with a deathly stare while her feet
              kick against the wall with final spasms of life  blood flows
              from the penetrations in her torso
 
              the horrific sight is even too much for loco  he gags and
              grasps his mouth with his hand choking back a scream
 
              he turns to run
 
              another musical stinger
 
              locos face registers shock and horror as he runs smack into
              the teeth of an onrushing pitchfork being thrust at him
 
              he cringes and gurgles up blood as the prongs are jammed
              through his stomach and out his back
 
              he staggers the pitchfork handle sticking straight out of
              his gut

              just outside the barn doors  to gain entrance he kicks on
              the doors and looks around to see if anyone has heard him
              he waits for one of the two to let him in

              he rages over to the ladder and looks up  his eyes widen and
              mouth drops open  directly above him loco the pitchfork
              still protruding from his stomach falls through the opening
              in the loft floor right at ali
 
              the two crash to the barn floor together  ali throws locos
              body off of him and struggles to his feet  he backs away
              fixated on locos engorged corpse and cries out for fox  a
              deep moanful bellow
 
              the camera dollies quickly into a close shot on his face
              his eyes focus directly in front of him as he screams right
              into camera  its jason
 
                                  ali
                               trembling
                        noooo
 
              ali turns and makes a mad dash for the door  in his panic
              he trips over one of the gas cans  frantically he crawls on
              his hands and knees to the door
 
              he reaches to pull himself up by the door and a large monkey
              wrench comes smashing down on the side of his face bashing
              in his skill  he slumps to the floor
 
              in the distance andy and debbies voices can be heard
              approaching
 
              from behind jason the camera moves with him to a side window
              and peers out
 
              through the window we see andy and debbie wrapped in the
              blanket coming up from the lake  theyre wet and dripping
              andy pulls debbie along with him towards the barn
 
                                  debbie

              andy moves right up to the grimy window  shading his eyes
              he peeks inside  he seems to be looking right at jason and
              camera but he apparently doesnt see him

                                  andy

              all its vulnerability and sensuality

              he puts his arm around her  she tenses up  derek wants to

              over his face  he turns away from the window and moves over
              to the fireplace looking into the flame
 
              foreboding music
 
              jasons dark hulking frame moves into the shot as he looks

                        when you dropped me off at the
                        house it was very late  my
                        parents were waiting up for me
                        as soon as i got in the door they
                        starting yelling and cursing at
                        me  i was so upset i told them
                        i slept with you  my mothers
                        slapped me  that was the first
                        time shed ever hit me  i
                        couldnt believe it  i ran out of
                        the house and into the woods as
                        fast and as far as i could run
                        i was crying  they had destroyed
                        the most beautiful night of my
                        life and i wanted to punish them
                        for that  i decided to hide out
                        all night  theyd be so worried 
                        that theyd be sorry for what they
                        did to me  the woods were cold and
                        damp from the rain  i found a dry
                        spot under a rotted oak tree and i
                        guess i fell asleep
                               takes a deep breath
                        all i can remember next is being
                        startled out of sleep by the sound
                        of footsteps  i thought it was my
                        father so i hid behind the tree
                        but the footsteps just stopped
                        the woods were dark  i couldnt
                        see anything
                               intensifying
                        i heard a cracking noise behind
                        me  i turned around and and
                        oh god there was this hideous
                        looking man  so grotesque he was
                        almost inhuman  he had a knife
                        and he started to slash away at
                        me again and again  i was so
                        hysterical and i dont know how i
                        was able to get away  i ran and
                        ran but he kept coming  he was
                        big but so fast  he caught me and
                        pulled me down to the ground and
                        he he ripped my blouse off
                        i was screaming but who could
                        hear me  then oh god he
                        dragged me by the hair along the
                        ground  i was kicking and
                        yelling  he dragged me deeper and
                        deeper into the woods  oh
                        please please

              beneath her
 
              only the flowing water can be heard as a darkened
              indistinguishable figure enters frame  directly in front of
              camera  and lowers himself all the way into the lake by the
              waterfall
 
              vera rolls her pant legs up to her knees  she dangles her
              long legs over the dock  her toes break the surface of the
              water swooshing it back and forth

              figure as he swims beneath the surface of the water

              she begins to softly sing a song form her childhood in

              the figure jumps out of the water and grabs veras leg and
              pulls her  vera screams and lurches forward almost sliding
              off the dock  she reaches out and clings to the side
 
              the figure holds her calves and tugs harder  veras grasp is
              slipping  she tries to kick him off
 
              suddenly the figure releases her limbs and submerges
              underwater

              clad in a black scuba suit and white faceless mask the
              rotund figure rises out of the water onto the shore  in one

              himself down on the porch swing still clutching the mask and
              speargun
 
              in a contemplative mood he slowly swings back and forth

              emanating from the barn  he looks over and sees a shadow
              cross in front of one of the windows  the cry continues
 
              shelly jumps off the swing and heads for the barn with his

              the light goes on an owl swoops down and aims straight for
              his head and camera  shelly drops the speargun and the
              mask to thwart off the bird with his hands  the owl flies

              pushing a wallet out of the pocket onto the dock  vera
              reaches behind her and picks it up  its shellys wallet

              she looks up to see the speargun pointed right at her head
              and camera
 
                                  vera
                               panicked
                        whatre you doing  who are you
 
              musical stinger
 
              jason pulls the trigger releasing the spear  with a whoosh
              the arrow penetrates veras skull  a look of unmitigated
              disbelief on veras face as she sinks into the water  blood
              seeps to the surface
 
              long shot
 
              of lake and dock  jason in the distance his back to
              camera just stands at the edge of the pier looking down into
              the bloody water
 
              camera pans over to the house and cranes up to a second floor
              bedroom window glowing from candlelight and peers in
 
                                                       cut to
 
              int bedroom  night
 
              the room is darkened save for pools of light emanating from
              several candles  one in each window the others on the
              opposite side of the room  lending an atmosphere of warmth
              and intimacy
 
              camera dollies in towards the hammock which wildly rocks bath
              and forth accompanied by the sounds of lovemaking
 
              debbie and andy are not visible in full  only glimpses of
              their naked limbs and torsos can be seen above the curved
              side of the hammock  blankets and sheets hang sloppily over
              the edges to the floor
 
              camera continues to dolly in as the sounds grow more heated
              until debbie and andy are framed in a two shot as they climax
 
              the thrashing about stops and the hammock slows down to a
              gentle swaying

                                  debbie
                        that was the best yet  was it

                        i vote for the hammock
 
              debbie attempts to get out of the hammock  its not a simple
              move  she nearly falls to the floor taking andy with it
 
                                  andy
                        im seasick  get in or get out of
                        the boat
 
              debbie gets out  she heads into the bathroom and flicks on
              the light  bright and a strain to the eyes  she turns on
              the shower
 
                                  andy

                               poking her head back

                        youre too clean for me
 
              debbie responds by closing the door
 
              int staircase  hallway
 
              foreboding music pierces the soundtrack
 
              displaying a thickbladed machete jason ascends the spiral
              stairs  andy can be heard offscreen calling loudly to
              debbie in the shower
 
                                  andy os

              jason reaches the landing at the top of the stairs and
              disappears into the shadows
 
              int bathroom
 
              behind the sheer curtain debbies naked silhouette can be
              seen lathering herself in the shower
 
              shower
 
              debbie luxuriates in the soap and hot water
 
              distorted through the plastic curtain the door opens
 
              debbie remains blissfully unaware as she soaps her face  she
              hears a banging noise  her eyes are closed due to the soap
              and shower spray
 
                                  debbie
                        andy
 
              no response  concerned debbie turns off the water and wipes
              the soap from her eyes
 
              looking up she sees a shadowy figure poised in front of the
              curtain  quickly she reaches out and rips the curtain
              aside
 
              staring her in the face is a pair of mens feet and jean
              covered legs  its andy walking on his hands
 
                                  andy

                               relieved
                        sure
 
              andy turns himself around and handwalks out of the bathroom
 
                                  andy
                        ill be back in a minute
 
              debbie jumps out of the tub and shuts the door  she returns
              to the shower and turns the water back on

              close shot on andy upsidedown  camera moves with him as he
              handsteps out of the bedroom  he whistles an upbeat tune as
              he goes
 
              an ominous tone enters the soundtrack a haunting counterpoint
              to andys whistling
 
              jasons hulking frame is braced up against the wall in the
              hallway corridor at the entrance to the bedroom  andy is
              unaware of jasons presence as he handwalks right past his
              boots towards the staircase
 
              offscreen debbie calls out to andy over the sound of the
              shower

                        andy are you still out there
 
              at the head of the stairs andy stops and pivots around 180
              degrees turning headon into jasons boots  surprised he
              looks up

              his head
 
              musical stinger
 
              before andy can react the machete is thrust down between his
              legs slicing through his upsidedown body  andys ghastly
              scream reverberates as he topples backwards down the spiral
              stairs
 
              jason retrieves his body  he drags andys halved corpse up
              the stairs and back into the bedroom closing the door behind
              him

              with the shower running full blast the door closed and
              humming to herself debbie remains oblivious to the sounds of
              the murderous activities  she rinses her hair and turns off
              the faucet
 
              the camera moves slowly in close on debbie as she steps but
              of the tub and dries herself off

              she hears a crashing sound that seems to have come from the
              bedroom  she stands still and listens
 
                                  debbie
                        andy  you can have my beer  i
                        dont want it
 
              humming again she wraps herself in her robe and swings the
              bathroom door open
 
              int bedroom
 
              the room is quiet untouched  andy is nowhere in sight
              debbie shrugs it off moves to the bedroom door opens it and
              sticks her head out

                               calling downstairs
                        andy dont bring me a beer  do
                        you hear me
 
              she stays at the door for a moment listening for andy  behind
              her in the bedroom jason creeps across room  debbie is
              unaware
 
                                  debbie
                               continuing
                        andy  answer me  i hate when you
                        do that
 
              she slams the door shut  peeved at andy she picks up a book
              stephen kings newest novel from a table and rolls into the
              hammock top of the covers which hang all the way to the floor
 
              she settles in  the hammock sways slightly  she finds her
              place in the book and playing with her damp hair she starts
              to read
 
              quite unexpectedly from above her a large drop of blood
              falls and splatters all over the white pages of her book
              alarmed she touches the fluid with her finger tips
              examining it
 
                                  debbie
                               incredulous to
                                herself
                        blood

              wrapped around the rafters is andys mangled bloodied corpse

              before debbie can scream
 
              musical stinger
 
              from beneath the hammock hidden by the covers jasons hand
              reaches up and around and snaps her head back down pinning
              her to the pillow
 
              the carving knife is driven through the back of her neck and
              pops out the front right at camera  blood spurts all over
              debbies horrified face

              a flashlight beam sprays directly into the camera lens
              bleaching out the frame
 
              derek and chris silently walk along the dirt road leading
              back to the house  derek holds the flashlight
 
              their footsteps add to the cacophony of night sounds  chris
              eyes dart about shes becoming quite uneasy

              they start to job  the beam from their flashlight bounces
              all over the road as they run

              his ankle and falls forward  the flashlight falls from his
              hand  derek lands in the arms of a dark figure standing on
              the side of the road  derek gasps as the man clutches him

                        be a man man
 
              chili takes a kerosene lamp down from the window sill as
              chuck reluctantly opens the cellar door and starts down the
              stairs
 
              chili ignites the lamps wick illuminating the kitchen with
              a yellow glow
 
              she carries the lamp over to the stove and sets it down
 
                                                       cut to

              int cellar  night
 
              barefoot chuck tiptoes down into the dark musty basement
              the flashlight beam preceeds his every step as he slowly
              advances
 
              to calm his anxieties he talks to himself outloud
 
                                  chuck
                               his eyes roving all
                                around
                        theres nothin to be scared of
                        man  just go over to the fusebox
                        and check it out  you can do
                        that  yeah sure
 
              his bare feet slosh in the line of the water puddles on the
              cellar floor as he nears the fusebox  he raises the
              flashlight at the open box  the fuses and electrical wiring
              exposed  the main switch is in the off position
 
              chuck lifts the switch into the on position  the naked
              basement bulb glimmers
 
                                  chuck
                               turning to go
                        whew thats better
 
              musical stinger
 
              backlit and silhouetted by the bulb is jason  a threatening
              sight
 
              chuck is startled and scared  before he can speak jason
              grabs his face with both hands lifts him off the ground and
              throws him into the open fusebox
 
              chucks feet land in a pool of water as his hands make
              contact with the exposed electrical wires  electricity zaps
              through his entire body electrocuting him  the lights blink
              on and off
 
                                                       cut to
 
              int kitchen  night
 
              chili is standing at the stove shaking a second pot of
              popcorn kernels  the blinking lights are an annoyance
              causing her to squint  then the blinking stops and the
              lights go completely dead  the lantern remains the only
              light source

                                  chili
                               calling out
                        whats goin on chuck
 
              theres no answer  then abruptly something heavy bashes
              against the kitchen door
 
                                  chili
                               continuing
                        whats goin on around here
                        whos there
 
              she picks up the lantern and goes to the door  she hesitates
              then pulls it open
 
              musical stinger
 
              shellys corpse  his skull split open his face and chest
              bloodied  falls into the kitchen at chilis feet
 
                                  chili
                               nonchalant
                        get up shelly  stop foolin
                        around
 
              she believes this to be another of shellys ruses  stepping
              over his body she goes to the basement stairs and calls down
              to chuck
 
                                  chili
                               continuing
                        whatre you doin down there man
 
              int basement
 
              holding the kerosene lamp in front of her chili starts down
              the stairs  foreboding music drones on the soundtrack
              accompanying her
 
                                  chili
                        chuck
 
              no answer  she stops at the bottom of the stairs and pans
              the lamp from side to side
 
              musical stinger
 
              suddenly as though suspended from the ceiling chucks head
              and shoulders flop down in front of her his arms outstretched
              and his face stark white

                                  chili
                               trembling
                        oh my god
                               shouting
                        help
 
              she turns and runs up the stairs the kerosene lamp shaking
              wildly in her hand
 
              int kitchen
 
              she bolts out of the basement and stumbles over shellys
              body falling to the floor  she looks back at shelly and
              realizes that this is not a joke and that he is indeed dead
 
              she gags and screaming grabs the still lit kerosene lamp
              and scrambles to her feet  she runs into the living room
 
                                                       cut to
 
              int living room  night
 
              the fireplace is burning bright as chili dashes to the base
              of the spiral staircase
 
                                  chili
                               looking up
                        andy  debbie  somebody help me
 
              of course no answer
 
              fireplace
 
              unseen by chili jasons hand reaches for a sizzling poker
              left in the fire and pulls out the redhot iron
 
              chili swings open the front door  the camera moves in on her
              from behind  crying she screams out into the darkness
 
                                  chili
                        vera  chris  where is
                        everybody
 
              she steps out onto the 
 
              ext porch  night
 
              the camera continues towards her from behind
 
                                  chili
                               at the edge of the
                                steps
                        oh please is anybody here

              she looks all around  its deathly quiet  she whips around
              and runs back into the 
 
              living room
 
              right at jason and into the scorching poker  it burns
              through her blouse and fries the skin around where it
              penetrates
 
                                                       dissolve to
