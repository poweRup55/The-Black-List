	fade in

	ext crystal lake  night

	a dark rumbling sky haze clings to the lake as we float 
	across it clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into 
	view a few scattered streetlights dilapidated cabins 
	an abandoned campsite camp crystal lake 

	we continue to drift towards it hearing the faint sound 
	of seductive music and an occasional giggle a small 
	houseboat floats into our foreground its interior light 
	flickering as two bodies move around inside

	int houseboat  night

	a teenage boy and girl jim and suzy are slowdancing 
	jims lips softly touch her lissome shoulders

				jim
		wellhow do you feel

				suzy
		ask me in about five minutes

	she bites his ear giggles then kisses him fully

				jim
		im talking about graduation being 
		totally free to do whatever we want 
		now

	her hands slip inside his pendleton shirt he sighs

				suzy
		it feels excellent

	her mouth finds his again after a long kiss he gently 
	pulls away from her with a teasing smile

				jim
		gotta throw the anchor over

	he leaves the cabin she slips under the bed sheets

	ext houseboat deck  night

	as jim tosses a small anchor overboard

	tight on water surface

	as the weighty object splashes sinking into black 
	oblivion pulling its cable down with it 

	jim 

	glances at the lake at their eerie surroundings he 
	feels a chill heading back inside

	ext underwater  night tank

	as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom dropping a few 
	feet from a thick power cable which rests in the lake 
	silt

	int houseboat  night

	as jim returns with an uneasy expression he crawls on 
	top of the bed kissing her again but not with the same 
	enthusiasm as before

				suzy
		whats wrong

				jim
		nothing

	he starts to pull off his shirt and join her she senses 
	his anxiety

				suzy
		cmon jimmy somethings bothering 
		you

	jim pauses turning off the mood music

				jim
		its just that were right around that 
		old summer camp where all those 
		murders took place

	the boat creaks shes instantly nervous

				suzy
		what murders

				jim
		never mind you dont want to know 
		about it

				suzy
		tell me

				jim
		theres nothing to worry about suzy 
		the guys dead now somewhere at the 
		bottom of this lakeif you believe 
		the stories
			beat
		lets drop it okay

	he starts to kiss her again she stops him

				suzy
		what stories

	he doesnt want to go into it but suzys face insists

				jim
		there was this boy named jason 
		voorhees who drowned in crystal 
		lake

	flashback

	eight year old jason is desperately trying to tread 
	water flailing his arms like a marionette to get 
	attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water

				young jason
		hhhhelpmeim drowning

				jim vo
		none of the counselors heard him

				young jason
		mmmmmmommy

	and jason finally slips under the surface for good

	int houseboat  continuous

				jim
		a bunch of years went by and everybody 
		forgot about it
			beat
		thats when the murders started

	flashback montage stock

	as our senses are bombarded with quick cuts of assorted

	teenagers just about to die their screams echoing over 
	each other we do not see the attacker as the 
	cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo cut back to

	int houseboat  night

	as the silence hits us hard again

				suzy
		jason did it

				jim
		thats what some people thought but 
		they were wrong

	flashback stock

	as mrs voorhees comes directly at camera wielding a huge 
	knife and a primal scream

	int houseboat  night

				jim
		his mother blamed the counselors for 
		his death and tried to kill them all
			dramatic pause
		she got her head chopped off by one of 
		them

	we dont need to see this clipsuzys reaction is quite 
	sufficient

				suzy
		so the murders stopped

	he gives her a long penetrating look

				jim
		no

	flashback montage stock

	were bombarded with quick flashes of a hockey masked 
	jason wreaking havoc on assorted teenagersbrandishing 
	everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws just as 
	jason is about to stab us cut back to

	int houseboat  night

	suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife

				

				jim
		legend has it that jason came back to 
		avenge his mothers death vowing to 
		kill every teenager from the area 
			beat
		and every now and then the murders 
		start up again 

	the boat lurches slightly tugging at the anchor cable 
	shes scared hes frightened himself a little too

				jim
		forget about it suzy theyre just 
		stories

	he brushes her hair back kissing her cheek gently 
	finding the nape of her neck again she closes her eyes 
	trying to dismiss what hes dredged up but she cant 
	suzy begins to rationalize

				suzy
		were the last graduating class 
		right 

	jims kissing her body putting jason behind him

				jim
		right

				suzy
		i mean lakeview high just closed its 
		doors for good right

				jim
		right

				suzy
		so theres no reason for him to come 
		back because there wont be any of us 
		aroundright

	jim stops looking her squarely in the eyes

				jim
		right except that jason isnt real 
		so none of it matters anyway

	she starts to relax returning his kisses

	ext underwater  night tank

	as the anchor drifts along the lake floor tugging hard 
	on the power cable camera tracks along the cable 
	coming to a rusty set of chains tangled around it

	int houseboat  continuous

	as jim slides on top of suzy thoughts of jason are 
	starting to slip away along with their clothes

	ext underwater  night tank

	as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the 
	tugging anchor camera continues to track againand we 
	find to our horror that the waterlogged fisheaten body 
	of jason is secured by these same chains note jasons 
	face is obscured

	int houseboat  continuous

	teenagers in love lost in notsoinnocent passion at 
	the same moment

	ext underwater  night tank

	the anchor tugs one last time and rips through the cable 
	sparks instantly fly chasing along the cable finding 
	the chain which secures jason and engulfing him in 
	electricity

	ext houseboat  on lake surface efx

	as bright flashes of blue light strobeunder the surface 
	arcing current chases up the anchor cable sparking 
	across the hoist

	ext camp crystal lake  wide shot from water

	as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly 
	extinguished plunging the campsite into darkness

	int houseboat  continuous

	as suzys eyes flash open

				suzy
		did you hear that

				jim
		hear what

	he pulls her back down

				suzy
		cmon im serious

	he knows the mood is broken

				jim
		all right ill check it out

	he slips on his jeans exiting the cabin she pulls the 
	sheet up around her fearfully

	ext underwater  night tank

	as the cable smolders void of electricity now track to 
	find the chains againbut theyre dangling loosely 
	jason is gone

	int houseboat  continuous

	suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now the black void 
	of night is all she sees out the cabin door which jim 
	has left open an uncomfortable amount of time passes

				suzy
		jimmy

	no answer her heart starts to pound

				suzy
		jim

	again nothing she wraps herself in the sheet moving 
	towards the open door the ship creaks again

	suzys point of view

	as she grows closer to the doorway nothing but pitch
	black beyond it

				suzy
		stop screwing around jim i mean 
		it

	and just as she reaches the door

	a hockey masked monster

	leaps out clutching a huge knife suzy barely has time 
	to scream before jason plunges the knife into her chest

	suzy

	stands there in speechless shock looking down at her 
	mortal wound but theres no blood

	the monster

	pulls the knife back out pushing the blade in and out 
	with his hand its a retractable rubber knife jim 
	pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin tossing it 
	aside

				jim
		gotcha good baby cakes

	she doesnt know whether to hug him with relief or kick 
	him in the balls he pulls her back onto the bed 
	laughing

	ext houseboat  close on hockey mask

	sitting dormant on the deck where jim tossed it a 
	shadow falls across itfollowed by a slimy decomposing 
	hand the hand grabs it like its an old friend pulling 
	it away

	int houseboat  continuous

	as jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed trying 
	unsuccessfully to kiss her

				jim
		all right all right  im a major 
		ass

				suzy
		and youll never do it again

				jim
		and ill never do it again forgive 
		me

				suzy
		no

	shes resisting only for effect her legs curl around 
	him finally giving in

	ext houseboat  night

	a deadlysharp spear gun rests in its rack outside the 
	cabin jasons hand removes it

	int houseboat  continuous

	the sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each 
	other thoughts of jason are nonexistent now

	angle  cabin door

	nothing there for a momentthen a pair of mosscovered 
	bare feet slosh into frame

	suzy

	closes her eyes with pleasure

	angle  cabin door

	and camera rises from the mossy feet up the bloodless 
	legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockeymasked 
	face of our antihero jason voorhees

	suzy 

	lets out a broad smile her eyelids fluttering they stay 
	open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway 
	she tries to choke out a warning to jim whos just 
	collapsed himself

				suzy
		jjjjjjjjason

	he doesnt follow her glance smiling instead

				jim
		uhhuh you must really think im an 
		ass

	but she continues to stare in horror as

	jason

	raises the spear taking aim

	angle  suzy and jim  

	hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood
	curdling scream a second later jason fires the spear 
	piercing her neck pinning her to the head board

	jim stares pointblank at his dead girlfriend not able 
	to assimilate it quickly enough he spins around to see 
	the monster himself

				jim
		ohmygod

	jim springs off the bed looking around for anything to 
	defend himself with grabbing the bedside lamp he 
	smashes it over jasons head which has little effect jim 
	scrambles to get past him but jason lifts jim in the 
	air slamming him down on one of the spiked bedposts

	ext crystal lake  night

	as the houseboat silently drifts onward the lone 
	silhouette of jason emerges from within taking the helm 
	hes back

	her playback the generators are causing a breeze which 
	makes her hair dance steam flowing between her legs 
	shes lost in her music building to a crescendo bending 
	the high e string above the upper octave fret she 
	opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees

	swings the guitar downward and buries it in jjs skull

	the chief engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the 
	admiral steps off the bridge onto the stormy deck 
	contemplating the sea the chief engineer moves to the 
	radiointercom console he lifts a telephone punching in 
	a three digit number push in tight on his face

				chief engineer
		this is the bridge approaching 
		weather suggests we secure the main 
		deck and

	his sentence is sharply cut off his head jerking from 
	excruciating instant pain 
	his mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he 
	stares into the face of

	jason

	holding the opposite end of the harpoon he shoves it 
	forward with one more staccato jerk and

	close up  chief engineers back

	 the harpoons bloody corroded tip pierces through 
	his oncewhite uniform

	admiral robertson

	returns to the bridge as lightning flashes outside

				admiral robertson

	admiral robertson stops cold upon the sight of mr

	sloshing through the slime all is silent until seans 
	foot trips over a barrel labeled hughes chemical plant 
	a vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of 
	the container sizzling on the around

	carefully sidestep it continuing on they make it 
	another ten yards when a figure leaps out from an alcove 
	gripping a huge wrench rennies scream echoes through 
	the tunnel

	but its a middleaged sanitation engineer who lowers 
	the wrench as frightened as they are

				sanitation engineer

	he clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly 
	leads them down

	no less threatening than the one they just left when 
	they pass a lightless intersecting corridor jason ejects 
	himself from it tackling the sanitation engineer and 
	sean

	rolls through the muck its beam splashing erratically 
	across the polluted walls

	begins bashing jasons head in with his wrench but the

	rennie is blinding us with the sanitation engineers 
	flashlight giving us only brief glimpses of herself in 
	the reflective wet surroundings

				rennie
		you never got me in the lake jason 
		and youre not going to get me now 
		either

	drags sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed 
	woman pulling him over to a service ladder attached to 
	the intersecting alcove wall

	everything hes got to obey her rennie shoots a stare 
	back down the tunnel
