               out of nowhere richard whips out his fortyfive automatic 
               and shoots mcgraw in the head

               mcgraw goes down screaming

               richard stands over him and shoots him twice more

               while pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding 
               from his bullet wound he opens his floor safe and pulls out 
               a gun from it

               seth releases his brother

                         yes it does kelly we have already 
                         alerted the mexican authorities

                         what about the report from an 
                         eyewitness at the liquor store who 
                         said one of the brothers was shot

                                     stanley chase
                         this cant be confirmed at this time 
                         but we do believe it to be true we 
                         have reason to believe it was the 
                         youngest brother richard and he was 
                         shot in the vicinity of his neck and

                         is it safe to assume that because 
                         the death count involved and the 
                         loss of life of law enforcement 
                         officers that the bureau the rangers

                         is it safe to assume since the law

               the horn snaps seth back to this world a smile breaks out 
               on the escaped fugitives face and he politely steps to one

                         exactly how hes going to cross the 
                         border whistling a happy tune he

               from the other side of the door comes a friendly voice

               seth sitting at the table playing guitar singing mexican 
               songs some bikers truckers and whores have gathered around 
               their table everyones groovin seth finishes the song 
               everybody applauds

               razor charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone 
               that he uses to announce dancers

                                     razor charlie
                              announcer voice in 
                              spanish
                         and now for your viewing pleasure 
                         the mistress of the macabre the 
                         epitome of evil the most sinister 
                         woman to dance on the face of the 
                         earth lowly dogs get on your knees 
                         bow your heads and worship at the 
                         feet of santanico pandemonium

               the lights go down low a light hits the stage the opening 
               notes of the coasters down in mexico fills the room

               the crowd hushes up

               and on the stage steps santanico pandemonium

               this mexican goddess is beautiful but not the beauty that 
               stendhal described in as the promise of happiness but the 
               beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom

               she dances to the raunchy music not like she owned the stage 
               but like she owned the world

               and if the patrons of the titty twister are her world the 
               world is proud to be her possession

               all activity in the bar save santanico stops even the 
               fullergecko table falls under her spell especially richard 
               scott and kate seth knows this song and accompanies from 
               the table with the guitar

               when the music builds to its explosive section

               santanico leaps from the stage landing in the middle of the 
               room

               she does an eyesclosed voodoo dance in perfect step with 
               the beat as the music continues to play a very fuckedup 
               looking chet pussy walks in he goes over to razor charlie 
               and points at seths table describing what happened

               as the last verse plays santanico like a snake comes up 
               from the ground on top of the fullergecko table

               richard kate and scott are enraptured

               santanico scans the table zeroing in on our boy richard  
               she stands over him

               while moving her body to the music she lifts up the whisky 
               bottle from the table and pours the whiskey down her leg

               she lifts up her foot with the whiskey dripping from her 
               toes and sticks it in richards face

                                     santanico
                              to richard in spanish
                         drink up

               richie mesmerized sucks the whiskey off her toes the crowd 
               goes wild santanico smiles master of all she surveys

               jacob and scott are embarrassed

               kate oddly enough is turned on by the controlling power 
               this woman has over a man shes deathly feared

               seth laughs out loud a mexican yi yi yiii laugh keeping 
               the beat with his guitar

               across the room razor charlie chet by his side motions 
               over big emilio he begins explaining with pointing what 
               seth and company did to chet

               richard continues to suck her toes

               the song ends santanico extracts her foot from richards 
               mouth steps off the table takes a drink of whiskey looks 
               down at the seated richard

               she grabs the back of his hair yanks his head back his 
               mouth opens because shes hurting him she leans her face 
               over his like shes going to kiss him then lets the whiskey 
               from her mouth fall into his they never touch the crowd 
               applauds she lets go of richards hair except for jacob 
               and richard both for their own reasons the table applauds 
               none louder than seth

                                     seth
                         bravo bravo bravo now thats what 
                         i call a fuckin show

               one of santanicos flunkies brings the naked woman a robe 
               which she puts on

               richard still in a daze looks up at his new friend

                                     seth
                              snapping his fingers

                         red riding hood is walking through 
                         the forest and she comes across little

                         your dress and squeeze your titties 
                         then little red riding hood hitches 
                         up her skirt and taps a 357 magnum 
                         she has holstered on her thigh and 
                         says no he wont

               emilio and chet moving rapidly towards their table

                                     jacob

               seth waves him away

                                     seth
                         not now so finally she comes across 
                         the big bad wolf and the big bad 
                         wolfs laughing and says little

                         eat me just like the story says

               seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously richard 
               kate scott and santanico join in too before jacob can say 
               anything 

               the titty twister trio stand over the table

                                     razor charlie
                              to chet in spanish
                         which one

                              pointing at seth
                         this piece of shit broke my finger 
                         and my nose
                              pointing at richard
                         then this fag kicked me in the ribs 
                         while i was down

               thats all big emilio has to hear

                                     big emilio
                              to the gecko brothers
                         up

                                     richard
                         fuck off ape man

               big emilio leans in with his beefy hand grabs richard by 
               the shoulder richard lets out a howl as blood pours from 
               his wounded shoulder

               santanico steps back from the table

               seth jumps to his feet and fires a round from his 45 into 
               big emilio sending his bulletridden body to the floor  
               razor charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake 
               and slashes seth across the face

               seth screams at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to 
               his laid open cheek

               richard who has fallen to the ground holding his wound 
               brings up his 45 and starts blasting

               razor charlie takes a bullet in the head chest and belly 
               before he hits the floor

               jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay 
               out of gunfire

               the bikers truckers waitresses and whores all stop what 
               they were doing

               the music continues to play though the dancers stop dancing

               santanico whos closest to the two brothers smells 
               something

               her nostrils flare

               richard moves to his brother who takes out a handkerchief 
               and puts it to his face

                                     richard
                         how are you

                                     seth
                         scarred for life thats how i am

               seth looks up and sees chet still standing there

                                     seth
                         you thought it was pretty funny 
                         didnt you

               both brothers fire on chet chets blown left right 
               left right then drops pointing their guns towards the 
               crowd

                                     seth

               sitting on customers laps sink their teeth into unshaven

               truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size  
               the patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the 
               monsters chairs chair legs broken bottles switchblades 
               anything

               jacob kate and scott make a dash and dive behind the bar  
               they hide and watch

               seth stands where his was limp dick of a 45 in his hand 
               too freaked scared and stunned to do anything he stands 
               motionless watching what he cant believe

               behind him santanico who lies next to the dead richard 
               eyes pop open

               she rises in her snakedance way

               seth feels her and spins in her direction gun raised

                                     santanico
                         lets see if you taste as good as 
                         your brother

               she approaches seth who fires at her bam bam bam  
               click click click click she laughs and gives her 
               hair a toss back seth moving backwards is terrified

               santanico gives seth a swinging round house punch to the 
               jaw that sends him flying over a table sliding across the 
               floor and into the wall

               a badass biker named frost with a hideous burn on the side 
               of his face stands on top of a pool table swinging a pool 
               cue left to right fending off vamps

               big emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade 
               and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the 
               other

               the bikerwinner of the bare knuckle fight sex machine 
               goes head to head with a stripper

               the vamp might have superhuman strength but sex machine has 
               close to superhuman strength and hes matching the vamp 
               bitch blow for blow

               then he grabs her by the waist lifts her up over his head 
               and brings her down hard on an upturned table impaling her 
               on the wooden leg

               frost is still swinging his pool cue when razor charlie 
               appears straight razor in hand

               frost jumps off the table to meet the challenge razor charlie 
               swings at him frost leaps back swinging his pool cue at 
               him they do this dance till frost cracks charlie upside 
               the head with the pool cue breaking it in half  charlie 
               feels the hit frost plunges the splintered end of the cue 
               in razor charlies heart

               green blood comes out of his chest as charlie screams the 
               vampires death scream

               seth comes to and finds santanico standing over him he tries 
               to rise but santanico places her bare foot on his chest 
               pinning him down to the floor he tries to move but the 
               pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed 
               on his chest

                                     santanico

                         be spot welcome to slavery

               slow motion a whiskey bottle flies through the air sailing 
               end over end

               closeup santanico

               looking down at seth her face contorts to feed mode when 
               the bottle hits her square in the head shattering

               we see that jacob behind the bar threw it

               santanico bathed in whiskey and broken glass is momentarily 
               dazed she looks down at seth

               seth sits up 45 in hand and fires

               santanico is hit in the chest the bullet from the gun makes 
               the liquorsoaked robe ignite

               santanico screams as she goes up in flames

               big emilio sees santanicos fiery death he lets out a cry

                                     big emilio
                         noooooo

               he turns his hateful gaze on the two humans

               seth and jacob see big emilio zeroing in on them then they 
               see him move his big frame in their direction seth turns to 
               jacob

                                     seth
                         we may be in trouble

               big emilio walks steadily through the bar like godzilla walks 
               through tokyo tipping over tables knocking fighting vamps 
               and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp out seth 
               and jacob a trucker jumps in his path to attack him with a 
               quick swing of his hand the trucker is brushed aside 
               receiving a broken neck for the effort

               big emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off 
               seth and jacob

               seth and jacob both grab pieces of wood holding it like a 
               weapon but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent

               big emilio stands in front of them the two men hold their 
               wood tight fangs grow in big emilios mouth that make him 
               look like a huge walking shark

               just when big emilios ready to strike he hears behind him

                                     voice os

               both seth and jacob attack big emilio from behind he 
               effortlessly knocks them away

               they both hit the ground

               sex machine gestures with his hand to big emilio to come 
               ahead

               big emilio charges towards sex machine like a runaway 
               locomotive

               sex machine stands his ground waiting for impact the two 
               huge men collide what follows is literally a war of the 
               gargantuans the two mastiffs pound each other till one 
               buckles finally the one who buckles first is big emilio 
               who hits the floor

               once on the floor seth and jacob stand over the huge vamp 
               beating him with clubs and pipes like las finest the 
               vamp can do nothing except squirm on the floor from the savage 
               beating

               sex machine holds a pool cue in his hand he snaps off the 
               end tip making it jagged and like a spear sticks it into 
               big vamps fallen body big emilio screams twitches and

               over the top they both let out a scream scott goes to 
               protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his 
               trouble chet dives at kate

               her crucifix he recoils backwards scott grabs hold of his 
               head from behind kate jumps up from the floor rips off her 
               cross and grabs chet by his beatnik beard opening his mouth

               chet has swallowed the crucifix a sizzling sound is heard 
               moving down from his throat to his belly he opens his mouth 
               and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle he jumps up 
               from behind the bar doing a wild dance from pain he jumps 
               from wall to wall and floor to ceiling screaming all the 
               while

               kate and scott watch him from the bar mischievous grins on 
               their faces

               chet is on his knees arms stretched out yelling at the top 
               of his lungs like a vamp king lear

                                     chet
                         iaminagonnnyyyy

               chet breaks off a chair leg muttering to himself

                         the pain stop the pain stop the 
                         pain

               he plunges the stake into his own heart but instead of the 
               vampires cry that escapes from the others upon being staked 
               chet lets out a sigh of relief

               by this time there are not too many people left most of the 
               vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the 
               customers have been butchered or drained

               all thats left on the vampire side are two naked dancers 
               and two whores on the human side are seth jacob and his 
               kids sex machine and frost aside from the children who 
               are hiding behind the bar all the humans are holding wooden 
               stakes

               charge teeth exposed snarling and dripping with blood  
               seth jacob sex machine and frost raise their weapons and 
               slam almost simultaneously the four vamps all four staked 
               bodies hit the floor

               kate and scott run from behind the bar to their fathers 
               side

               they all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has taken 
               place the floor is littered with dead bodies

                                     frost

               face the sound of quick burning flames fills the air 
               everybody shields their eyes from the intense light which 
               lasts only a split second

               it vanishes along with the bodies of the vampires all that 
               remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once 
               lay

               they all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then run 
               for the door its locked they bang on the door but its 
               useless it aint budging yet they all go on banging

               except for seth he never ran for the door he walks over to 
               his dead brothers body and kneels beside it

               he takes his dead hand

                         just as well be a piece of fuckin 
                         shit but hes one of the boys only 
                         one problem his faith aint what it

               sticks out his hand and shakes seths

                         im a mean mother fucking servant 
                         of god

               the laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only sound 
               to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing it 
               immediately reminds the group of the deep deep shit theyre 
               in

                                     kate

                         hour after hour

               as frost goes into his monologue the sound fades out and

               cant hear anything hes looking at frost speaking but he

               and closer until he can see the veins on frosts neck actually 
               pulsating throbbing beckoning to him sex machine has turned 
               into a vampire

               the sound comes back as frost finishes his story

                                     frost
                         and then when i came back to my

               frost screams as sex machine grabs hold of him and bites 
               into his neck

               the group tries to pull the two men apart

               jacob gets his arm around sex machines neck and tries 
               pulling

               sex machine takes his teeth out of the bikers neck and sinks 
               them in jacobs arm

               bleeding neck

                         together

               just then they hear jacobs voice booming from the bar room

               int bar room  night

               jacob holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting 
               appropriate verse from the bible is keeping the vampires at 
               bay but as seth predicted it is the shining power of his 
               restored faith that is his mightiest weapon jacob is making 
               his way through the vampires toward the back door a lot of 
               the bats have transformed into batdevilhuman creatures

               the creatures stand at the edge of jacobs force field of 
               holiness many bat things fly around the bar like mad 
               whirling dervishes a cluster of batthings over above and 
               in front of jacob they all growl and hiss at the man of 
               god for every one step forward jacob takes the vampires 
               take one step back jacob recites the verse from the bible 
               in a threatening mean mother fucking servant of god tone  
               as he speaks with authority and strength he sees frost lying 
               on the ground batthings on him like ants on a candy bar 
               but jacob is too much in control to let even this repugnant 
               sight trip him up

               jacob has backed himself up by the door

                                     jacob
                         open the door

               the door flies open jacob jumps inside the door slams shut

               jacob hugs daughter and son as he hugs them we see his 
               bloody arm

               when he releases them they cant help but notice

                                     seth
                         did he

                         yep

               seth explodes knocking over boxes busting chairs tipping 
               over tables and cussing a blue streak

                                     seth

               seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the 
               creatures on the other side

                                     seth

               kids will never have the courage for what they must do

                                     jacob

                         thirty minutes our friends outside 
                         will bust in this door and ill 
                         probably turn into a vampire within 
                         the hour now you have two choices  
                         you can wait for me to turn then 
                         deal with me then wait for them to 
                         burst inside here and the three of 
                         you will deal with them or we can 
                         kick open that door and the four of 
                         us can hit em with everything we 
                         have and carve a path right through 
                         em to front entrance but if were 
                         gonna go at em we gotta go at em 
                         now i confused them i scared them 
                         i took them off guard but theyre 
                         going to get unconfused theyre 
                         going to get unscared theyre going 
                         to get together and theyre going to 
                         hit that door like a ton of bricks 
                         and when that moment arrives we 
                         gotta be ready

               jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled 
               with boxes and crates

                                     jacob
                         whats this stuff

                                     seth
                         my guess is that this little dives 
                         been feeding on nomad road waifs 
                         like bikers and truckers for a 
                         longtime this is probably some of 
                         the shipments they stole off the 
                         trucks

                                     jacob
                         well i say lets tear this place 
                         apart for weapons so when they burst 
                         through that door well make em 
                         wish they never did

                                     seth
                         i dont give a shit about living or 
                         dying anymore i just want to send 
                         as many of these devils back to hell 
                         as i can

                                     jacob
                         amen

               montage

               the survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates a 
               lot of what they find is bullshit pantyhose coffee teddy 
               bears etc but a few of the boxes are just what the doctor 
               ordered cases from a sporting good supplier yield a shipment 
               of baseball bats meant to arrive at toy stores are a shipment 
               of uzi replica squirt guns and a box of balloons and captured 
               en route to a hardware store are shipments of power tools 
               saws and jack hammers

               seth and scott saw the bats into wooden stakes

               kate fills the uzi squirt guns with tap water from the 
               backroom sink

               jacob with seths knife etches a cross into every bullet 
               in the 45 automatics last full clip of ammo

               vampires all start converging on the back room door getting 
               their courage back

               kate makes water balloons

               scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools seth 
               attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer

               jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons 
               turning it into holy water

               our heroes work together preparing for the battle to come  
               the back room door barricaded with crates and boxes begins 
               to be pounded on by the undead on the other side the room 
               tone is a combination of chewing scratching pounding 
               squeaking and screaming

               finally theyre ready

               jacob turns to his kids

                                     jacob

               and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like 
               grenades jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden stakes 
               and the 45 with the cross bullets seth is holding the 
               jackhammer the survivors walk out of the back room into the 
               bar the vamps back up letting them inside

               what we have here is a mexican standoff a la the wild 
               bunch a moment of peace before the battle the vamps just 
               watch the humans the humans just watch the vamps then

               the kids spray the crowd with uzi fire burning vampire flesh

               the pack of vamps retreat while the fuller squad walk forward

               they are attacked on all sides but they keep moving towards 
               the door

               seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps it speeds 
               in and out of vampire chests each time spraying him in green 
               vamp blood

               jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand 
               and shoots three vampires with blessed bullets with the other

               flame bursts from the vampires chests when the bullets hit

               kate and scott both whip water balloons off their belts and 
               toss them into the crowd

               they burst and fry several of the vamps who fall screaming 
               in pain

               from its perch on a wood ceiling beam a batthing drops and 
               hurls toward the group

               jacob sees it raises his gun and fires

               the batthing bursts into a ball of screaming fire

               seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming 
               the hammer stake into vampire chests

               the front door is barricaded again by a big table and other 
               junk

                                     scott
                              yelling
                         why did they block the door again

                                     jacob
                              yelling

                         where they sleep get to the door

               seth tries to get to the front door when sex machine now a 
               half bat half devil vamp about six foot seven drops from 
               above in front of him seth rams the stake in its chest the 
               sex machinething screams out lifting the hammer and seth 
               off the ground

               seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room 
               he crashes into a table

               the sex machinething falls back with the jackhammer sticking 
               out of his chest dead

               kate spraying uzi fire like rambo sees seth fall she 
               screams

                                     kate
                         seth

               seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires 
               on all sides with no weapons he puts up his dukes

                                     seth

                         bite and feel all right

               kate clusters with her father and scott

                                     kate
                              yelling

               kate turns into a squirt gun firing waterballoon throwing 
               onewoman army as she breaks from her father and heads in 
               seths direction

                                     kate

               kate mows down the group by seth they lie on the floor 
               burning in agony kate takes seths hand and gives him a 
               couple of water balloons and a stake

                                     kate

               cutting through vampires the two make their way across the 
               bar

               jacob firing the 45 takes out several more vampires in 
               fiery death

               scott fires the uzi and chucks more water balloons

               as jacob fights all of a sudden the sound goes out he cant 
               hear anything he wonders if hes gone deaf he starts to 
               hear the words thirst thirst thirst he notices the 
               vampires have stopped attacking him they look at him with 
               happy smiles on their devilish faces fangs begin to grow  
               his eyes are yellow

               scott turns to his dad he sees his father is a monster

               jacob with a devilish grin on his face grabs scott and 
               sinks his teeth into scotts forearm scott screams bloody 
               murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood

               scott takes one of the water balloons hes wearing and smashes 
               it against jacobs head

               the holy water melts half of jacobs face away he lets go 
               of scott screaming and drops the 45 on the floor

               scott drops to the ground picking up the gun he brings it 
               up to fire

               a totally evil jacob with only half a face matches stares 
               with the boy he once called his son

               scotts eyes turn to steel

                                     scott
                         i swear to god in jesus christs 
                         name

               he fires sending a holy bullet into jacobs forehead 
               creating a hole from which fire shoots out jacobs entire 
               head bursts into flames then explodes

               from across the room kate sees her daddy ignite she cries 
               out in the thick of the battle seth yells

                                     seth
                         fight now cry later

               kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face 
               with a holy water balloon which melts his head

               a batthing lands on the back of scotts neck he screams as 
               it bites into him he drops the 45

               kate sees scott get bit

                                     kate
                         oh my god

               another batthing lands on scotts arm and takes a bite  
               scott screams

                                     kate

               she goes to spray them when her uzi runs out of water

               now seven batthings are on scott biting and sucking blood  
               scott is in agony

                                     scott
                         kill me kate

               kate runs for her brother does a dive and a roll coming up 
               by the 45 snatching it in one motion and firing three times

               one two three batthings are hit shoot flames then 
               all of them explode blowing up scott

               the remaining vamps approach

               all the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy 
               balloon

                                     seth
                         how many bullets left kid

                                     seth

                         just start cold cocking em make 
                         em sing for their supper

               the two survivors are backed up against a wall two bat things 
               do a kamikaze dive from the air toward seth seth throws the 
               holy balloon at them direct hit the two batthings burst 
               into flames and spiral to the floor

               the two survivors look at the vampires who stand before 
               them a moment of stillness before the attack kate stands 
               holding the 45 arm outstretched

                                     kate
                              to seth

                         these parasites that try to bite 
                         you

               the vamps begins to close in kate lines up the 45 sights 
               on the face of an approaching vampire

               seth holds the uzi like a club ready to bash in the first 
               vampires head that gets in swinging distance

               beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that kate shot 
               through the wall approaching vampires burn the scorched 
               vamps scream like theyve never screamed before

                                     seth
                         shoot more holes

               kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall 
               behind him daylight comes through providing kate and seth 
               with a safe lighted area

               the 45s empty

               the vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being 
               able to get at them

               the two survivors hold hands when

               all of a sudden the door to the titty twister is pounded on 
               from the outside

               the vamps look towards it in horror

               from the other side of the door we hear a voice with a 
               spanish accent

                                     voice os

               the vamps are totally fucking freaked out they run and fly 
               around the bar in a panic crying howling grabbing onto 
               each other

               the front door is torn apart from shotgun fire coming from 
               the outside punching holes the size of basketballs in the 
               door

               the table in front of the door gives and falls forward

               the door caves in and sunlight invades the bar many vamps 
               are instantly fried bursting into flames

               the mexican gangster carlos and his two henchmen danny and 
               manny are horrified at what they see they cross themselves 
               in fright

               vampires search for dark corners but all is lost sunlight 
               hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling sending hundreds 
               of beams of sunlight scattering through the room vamps try 
               and dodge the beams no dice all around the vamps combust 
               in fiery explosions

               the titty twister is now on fire burning out of control

               seth and kate run through the building and leap through the 
               door into the parking lot

               seth signals carlos to wait a minute while he catches his 
               breath then he hauls off and punches carlos square in the 
               kisser danny and manny aim their shotguns at seth

               kate turns around faces endless desert before her and begins 
               her long walk home
