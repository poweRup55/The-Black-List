size cloth doll his tape player is on the sidewalk playing
and instrumental version of beautiful dreamer and there is
a cigar box for donations a few people look on from a
distance the man wearing an old cutaway with running shoes
and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown

nicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly
past the dancing man

nicky crosses the courtyard to buchanan apartments

int foyer

joanna bourne reaching for the door joanna is fiftyish
handsome stylishly dressed

int buchanan apartment  seconds later

nicky and joanna embracing with wordless abandon

they are in the hallway clutching each other stumbling the
walls on either side are hung with expensive art

they grapple past the living room fleeting look at the
paintings by longo and fischl a poster by the guerilla
girls

the edge of the bedroom nicky is crawling into the room and
joanna is hanging on to him being dragged they are fully
dressed except for one of joannas shoes

roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed

int hallway

muffled sounds from the bedroom we track to

the maids room the maid is smoking a cigarette and reading
new york magazine the cover is partly obscured by her hand
but we can see a blurry blackandwhite photo of a man
hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face
shielding himself from the camera over the photo three
words visible the phantom who  a second line of type is
too small to be legible

int bedroom  later

nicky and joanna are undressing after the fact very slowly
and distractedly joanna stands by a chair near the window
nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates
between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes

int steven schwimmers loft

steven is just waking up the radio plays soft music

he reaches over and hits the off button then activates the
cassette player he struggles out of bed and sufi music
begins to fill the room

he stands at the foot of the bed a man in his midtwenties
hollowchested slightly potbellied wearing rumpled pajama
bottoms and a mostly mozart tshirt

he does not remove the sleep mask

the music has a sensuous driving beat voices begin to
chant

steven holds his arms parallel to the floor slowly he begins
to turn clockwise the beat picks up and he whirls more
quickly his mouth coming open

now he begins to whirl about the room the chanting grows in
intensity although he is blindfolded steve deftly avoids
running into furniture and other objects

steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops
playing he is back at the foot of the bed arms stretched
wide

               he doesnt want to hear it

he leads them toward a booth

int coffee shop  later

nicky is launched into a full breakfast laurel has a tea bag
in a cup  no water

                         nicky
               if lawyers for the mob are called
               controversial why are divorce
               lawyers called prominent

                         laurel
               because they get outstanding
               settlements and mother is
               determined that this time theres
               no turning back

                         nicky
               i just had breakfast with her she
               didnt say a word about this

a young waiter recognizes nicky and unobtrusively points him
out to another waiter

                         laurel
               because you refuse to believe shes
               serious youve always refused

                         nicky
               dont be so steelyeyed its that
               course youre taking in
               criminology

                         laurel

               she wants you to stop seeing whats
               hername finally now and forever
               do you think thats too much to
               ask for a wife of nineteen years

                         nicky
               youre too young to be studying
               criminal behavior its making you
               obsessive

                         laurel
               she is kicking you out

                         nicky
               your mother and i have something
               between us thats too strong to
               damage permanently believe me i
               know this thats right nineteen
               years and what about the days and
               minutes sharing small moments
               sharing memories raising a
               beautiful child were wedded in
               the deepest and strongest ways
               lillian isnt only my wife shes
               my best friend

nicky shrugs

                         laurel
               bullshit daddy

int coffee shop  near the cash register  later

nicky and laurel stand on a short line at the cash register
each holding a check

                         laurel
               mother wont tell me how long
               youve been seeing this person
               shes embarrassed to tell me so
               why dont you tell me

                         nicky
               dont call her mother all the time
               it makes her sound tragic and
               unforgiving what happened to mom

                         laurel
               i didnt turn her into mother you
               did

                         nicky
               this person and i are a thing of
               the total past i promise you

nicky takes laurels check away from her intending to pay
himself

laurel snatches it back

                         laurel
               know what mother said to me
               daddys demons are so intense he
               doesnt even know hes lying

nicky rides again

                         nicky
               its life its taxis people
               trying to make contacts make

               without taxis i was proud of my
               taxi i kept my taxi clean

nicky shifts his gaze he sees elliot litvak slinking across
the street looking faintly unclean and shows a trace of a
smile he watches elliot enter the lobby of the chemical
bank

int bank

elliot is at a cash machine making an elaborate transaction

nicky appears approaching the adjacent machine elliot sees
him

                         elliot
               nicky i was thinking about you i
               went to the preview last night

                         nicky
               i dont want to hear about it

nicky attends to his own transaction

                         elliot
                    whispering
               a lovely piece of theater small
               but important

                         nicky
               shut up elliot

                         elliot
               quietly effective

nicky takes his cash and begins to move away

we dont appreciate what theyve
built for us were artists who are
too dumb to see that this is the
peak moment of western culture

                         nicky
               youre an artist im a craftsman

                         elliot
               press a button and they give us
               money

                         nicky
               ride with me we need a haircut

int taxi

stalled between park and madison the driver has opened the
door and is standing just outside the cab trying to
determine the cause of delay

                         elliot
                    whispering
               how is lillian i havent seen her

                         nicky
               she wants a divorce

                         elliot
               dont talk like that

                         nicky
               its over finished and done with

                         elliot
               that sounds so final but are we
               really surprised

                         nicky
               im completely stunned i dont
               want this to happen

                         elliot
               but didnt we know it would happen

                         nicky
               dont needle me elliot tell me
               how bad you feel were suppose to
               feel bad together this is what
               friends do

                         elliot
                    whispering
               joanna bourne so rich and crisp
               this woman lets you touch her body
               you put your hands on her personal
               parts

nicky hits elliot  a token blow to the arm elliot thinks
about it then hits back

they swat each other half kiddingly each of them leaning
away from the other to prevent being hit in the face

ext the street

a whitish brown mist is building the west there is a sense
of scurrying people

as the man backs off

               writers nicky how we have our

int restaurant  later  same table

the food has arrived nicky is eating compulsively  in
contrast to elliot who sips his mineral water dabs his
mouth with a napkin looks around the restaurant between
bites when nicky is finished with his food he begins
picking among the items on elliots plate elliot uses his
fork to deflect nickys fork and the two men have a brief
duel with utensils fencing silently but intently using
knives and spoons to vary action

ext street

the asbestos mist still clings men in protective suits and
masks move slowly like moon walkers halted traffic
abandoned cars mud covering the sidewalks and shop windows
a gauzy stillness dreamlike

int steven schwimmers loft

stillness a slow whirling 360degree shot the kitchen area
is empty the door of the portable toilet is open and no one
is inside the makeshift wardrobe is empty except for four or
five hangers with shirts and jackets there is no one at the
desk or exercise bike

a sound faint but persistent like an intake of air

the bathroom the toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken
away leaving a hole in the floor brownish water drips from
the tap into the wash basin which is indelibly stained the
drip makes a twopart sound and it matches the rhythm of the
intake of air onetwo pause onetwo the bathtub has been
sprayed by a graffiti artist multicolored swirls and
arabesques
steven is sitting on a mat in the tub arms in the air and
folded so that his fists are close to his ears he is in
lotus position breathing in serious meditation  a deep
intake of breath followed by a softer expulsion matching the
beat of the dripping faucet

he is still wearing the sleep mask

int restaurant  main room  later

the kitchen staff is eating at a group of tables pushed
together nickys table has been absorbed by this cluster and
he sits reading the sports section in a tabloid and having an
espresso with his cigar

elliot paisley and actorwaiter stand at the small bar in
conversation

next to nicky two kitchen workers talk about the ball game

                         first man
               i got a good feeling about tonight

                         second man
               we got ojeda going he pitched
               beautiful last time out

                         first man
               plus darryls due for a big game

                         nicky
               i hate the mets

                         second man
               how come

                         nicky
               when the mets lose they just lose
               its a flat feeling but the red
               sox  here we have a rich history
               of interesting ways to lose a
               crucial game defeats that keep you
               awake that pound in your head like
               the hammer of fate

paisley walks across the room toward the kitchen nicky
pauses to watch her then resumes speaking

                         nicky
               you can analyze a red sox defeat
               day and night for a month and still
               uncover layers of complex feelings 
                feelings you didnt know you were
               capable of the pain has a memory
               all of its own

between them at the sink

                         elliot
                    quoting steven schwimmer
               one thing saves elliot litvaks
               work from complete mediocrity and
               this is his lack of ambition

                         waiter
               it gets funnier

                         elliot
                    zipping up
               it gets funnier see nicky they

nicky goes back inside the theatre paisley walks west on
47th street

elliot waits for a moment then follows her

int steven schwimmers loft

the portosan steven emerges and goes to the stacked
cardboard boxes against the wall his hate mail he is
wearing a bath towel like a prayer shawl over his sweat
clothes

he drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair he sits in
the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward the
earlysetting sun

he takes a letter from the box opens it reads it lets it
fall to the floor takes another letter opens it 

there is a knock at the door

steven tenses does not move

another knock

he moves warily toward the door

                         paisley vo
               steven its me will you open
               please

steven releases the deadbolt lock and opens the door

                         steven
               youve come to me i wanted to
               believe you would one day

                         paisley
               i havent come to you

                         steven

               come to me

int steven schwimmers loft  a little later

steven is back in the chair by the window paisley nervously
prowls the loft

                         paisley
               in other words i never understood
               until today how much pain and
               anxiety youve been causing with
               your reviews steven its so
               unfair

                         steven
               of course its unfair the truth is
               always unfair why do you think i
               live this way hiding out stealing
               electricity from a lamp post
               because people who write the truth
               are outcasts of society i cant
               live openly in a nice clean
               doorman building with my name on
               the mailbox theyd come after me
               in packs

                         paisley
               not if you stopped hurting people
               write the truth gently

                         steven
               the truth is never gentle listen
               to me carefully each of us lives
               in the thinnest possible wrapping
               of wishes and dreams truth is the
               force that penetrates this wispy
               skin it hurts and maims

                    reaching down to clutch a
                    fistful of letters
               look how they hate me for telling
               the truth its an education
               paisley the college of raw nerves
               letters dripping blood cries of
               revenge

                         paisley
               yes ive seen your victims one
               past and one future i thought i
               might convince you to reconsider

                         steven
               and i thought at last shes here
               she wants me

                         paisley
               i dont want you steven

paisley moves towards the door

                         steven
               stay teach me to be compassionate

                         paisley

scrambled eggs takes a bite and heads for the door

                         michael
               so i know who im letting in

nicky leaves the apartment

ext the street

the man in the cutaway dances with his doll the tape machine
plays in the still of the night

 the street is completely empty except for the dancer
nicky a small paper bag in his hand reenters his fathers
building

int michael rogans living room

the room bears some resemblance to the living room set at
the barrymore michael sits at the end of the sofa weary
nicky is taking an athletic bandage  about four feet long
and three inches wide  out of the package

he sits in a chair that is set perpendicular to michaels end
of the sofa so that nicky is looking at his father in
profile

                         michael
               why doesnt he come live with us
               because everything is here

               im lucky they dont knock down the
               building it could happen anytime
               and everything worth remembering is
               right here

                         nicky
               i think the buildings okay at
               least for the time being

                         michael

               you lived here you wanted to get
               out so fast i thought you were
               running a marathon

                         nicky
               normal boys ambition i like
               coming back you know that

                         michael
               you tell your friends your father
               used to work the docks callused
               hands but you had an attitude when
               you were growing up that wasnt
               easy for your mother and me to
               understand

nicky is gradually unbuttoning his fathers shirt so that he
can wrap the bandage around the old mans chest and back

                         nicky
               i was in a hurry to do big things
               make big mistakes any mistakes
               were okay as long as it was big
               but im trying to see these things
               clearly and honestly thats the
               play theyre going to kill starting
               tonight theres a guy out there
               getting ready to rip it apart and
               thats us who we were and where we
               come from

                         michael
               so what are you going to do about
               it

                         nicky

                         michael
               show him who we are

nicky takes off the shirt

michael struggles out of his tshirt and we see that he is
wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost

he is sitting with his head tilted up eyes closed and is
unaware that he is wearing the bandage

nicky takes the new bandage winds it tightly and puts it
back in the box

his father has gone to sleep

ext street building

it is dark and cold nicky emerges and walks west diagonally
across the street to a barbershop on the other side of ninth
avenue

lliot is on the stoop waiting for him

int the barber shop

nicky sits in the barber chair elliot pulls up a customers
chair and sits with his back to the mirror more or less
facing nicky the barber an elderly hawkeyed man named
dodgie begins his preparations for nickys haircut

                         nicky
               he carries a gun

                         elliot
               then you should carry a gun

he places the sheet over nickys upper body and fastens it at
the neck

                         nicky
               i used to carry a gun when i drove
               a cab

                         elliot
               where is it

                         nicky
               i gave it away i thought im a
               writer now

                         elliot
               that was a big mistake

                         dodgie
               you should never be without a gun
               in this city

                         elliot
               if he carries a gun you have to
               carry a gun

                         nicky
               were making too much of this

                         elliot
               no were not

                         nicky

               you nursing a hundred grudges im
               a man who loves life

                         elliot
               were talking about something
               deeper than grudges how do we
               respond to personal attack

                         dodgie
               in this city and you dont carry a
               gun

                         elliot
               how do we maintain our dignity and
               selfrespect

                         nicky
               in other words why should we suffer
               silently at this kind of abuse the
               man is out there ruining lives

                         elliot
               its your best play nicky

                         nicky
               hell hate it

                         elliot
               hell kill it hell write a review
               so devastating it will shatter your
               career and cause the most
               unmanageable psychic grief what
               happens to your apartment on the
               east river your house in
               connecticut where you watch things
               grow

dodgie goes to the cabinet on which the cash register sits
he opens the cabinet door slides out a drawer and removes
some hand towels there is something there he wants nicky to
see an old pockmarked revolver

nicky sees the gun

                         nicky

               pool

                         elliot
                    quoting
               the most interesting thing about
               elliot litvak is that he writes the

chair

expanding out of the tv screen to fill the larger

fields the bouncing ball and heads toward the bag he beats
wilson to the base by an eyelash and the inning ends with the
teams tied at 55

frozen moment buckner holding his glove hand aloft the ball
securely gripped in the drama of the moment buckner seems
to be crying out a word or name but his face is twisted with
tension and exertion and we cant make out what he is saying

int the barrymore

laurel rogan seen from behind is somewhat slumped in her
seat she turns off the radio removes the headset and rises
she moves along the row toward the aisle

she appears to be the only person in the theater

she moves trudgingly up the aisle toward the exit at the
head of the aisle she is startled by a figure standing in
dimness

it is steven schwimmer

they look at each other sound of the cleaning crew in the
lobby and then a door opening at the rear of the orchestra
light from a flashlight plays across the seats and walls the
beam hits laurel first and then steven

the beam holds on steven what laurel sees is a strikingly
handsome young man dramatically lighted  he takes off his
dark glasses so she can see his eyes

they are all over the sofa working on the removal of
stevens shirt

int the entranceway

nicky makes his way past the debris the front door is gone
the inner door smashed and battered  door knobs gone and
locking mechanism ripped out

he starts up the stairs past a dead or sleeping body

int the loft

on the sofa laurel is straddling steven whose shirt is
almost completely off exposing his bulletproof vest laurel
is blouseless and barefoot with her unzipped skirt still on
and her bra dangling from one shoulder

                         laurel
               i have this thing where i have to
               know a person is being honest with
               me before you know i can feel
               completely free to be myself

               were strangers in the night the
               last thing we want is honesty

                         laurel

                         steven

               deception isnt something i
               personally consider sexy

                         steven
               whats sexy

                         laurel
               knowing who a person is down deep

                         steven
               even if the truth about a person is
               sad or depressing or shocking

                         laurel
               you wont even tell me your name
               whats shocking about a name

steven maneuvers himself into a sitting position so that he
and laurel face each other at equal height and at close
quarters 

                         steven
               even if the truth requires a
               certain adjustment

steven begins removing the cosmetic putty around his
naturally shallow chin he uses laurels hair clip to scrape
his jaw clean then he peels off his fake mustache and
borrows laurels dangling bra cup to wipe the bronzing agent
off his face

int the landing

nicky stands with his back to stevens door his gun is out
he holds it up near his face muzzle pointed up

he looks at the gun as if it had feelings and personality
and he speaks to it as to a sympathetic friend

                         nicky
               i used to go to the movies all the time
               i saw a hundred situations like
               this a man and a gun  and a
               locked door lee marvin or steve
               mcqueen and i used to say to
               lillian because we went to a
               hundred movies that we saw together
               or that i saw because she had seen
               them and id say watch him kick
               in the door with one kick and it
               might be steve mcqueen or jeff
               chandler holding the gun up like
               this and he would turn and kick
               the door and it would fly open at
               once and i would say to lillian
               how completely phony whoever made
               this movie has no idea how hard it
               is to kick in an actual door in
               real life i still love lillian
               but its not easy to kick in a
               door i knew they would lose and
               they lost so what are we so upset
               about they lost tonight theyll
               lose tomorrow its written on the
               wind

int the loft

laurel is on her feet backing away slightly steven removed
his shoes and stands in his stocking feet noticeably shorter
than hed been earlier

he begins to unstrap the bulletproof vest causing laurel to

                         nicky
               these wives named lillian i used
               to say to her you dont kick a
               door once or twice and expect it to
               open its only in the movies a man
               can kick in a door with such
               amazing ease because a real door
               requires a tremendous and prolonged
               pounding before it finally gives
               way hes a great playerhow
               could that ball go through his
               legs

nicky turns steps back and kicks the door it opens at once

int the loft

steven and laurel are briefly immobilized by shock as the
door comes flying open

nicky moves toward the candlelit couple

laurel realizes who he is and stands by the sofa she zips
her skirt

nicky is trying to understand what he sees then he gets it

                         nicky
                    quiet
               laurel

nicky holds his gun hand aloft repeating the image of bill
buckner with the baseball in his glove  nickys
hallucination

then nicky issues a cry a sound from the time before humans
acquired language it is the audible anguish of his life
from the fetus onward

we hear what he is saying in overlapping echoes and we
realize he is crying out a name we recognize the look on his
face and the formation of syllables on his lips as elements
wed seen earlier  on buckners face when he shouted
something as he made n
the third out of the tenth inning

                         nicky
               stevennnn schwimmerrrr

laurel reacts with horror to the revelation of stevens
identity she rearranges her bra

nicky stumbles drops his gun it goes off

steven flees toward the shadows at the back of the loft his
hand moving toward the gun in his shoulder holster

nicky picks up his gun and begins to stalk him

steven fires twice striking a nearby lamp the room is dark
now lit only by the blue glow of the tv

the tv sports roundup which has been showing football
highlights has switched to baseball  highlights of the red
soxmets

nicky reaches laurel

                         nicky
                    crying out
               this is my daughterrrrr

steven is wideeyed at the news

                         laurel
               i dont think he knew daddy

nicky sees the photo of steven and his cat he shoots twice
blows it away

                         laurel
               daddy im sorry but he was so
               beautiful i trusted him when i
               saw what he really looks like 

a voice from shadows

                         steven
                    os
               am i really so deeply repugnant

                         laurel
               yes

                         nicky
               go home laurel tell your mother i
               will be late

nicky walks toward stevens voice toward the shadows

                         nicky
               youre going to die youre a dead
               man youre dead

he notices laurel following behind him

                         nicky
               look im sorry you keep running
               into dishonest men but youre only
               eighteen we can still turn it
               around

                         laurel
               except i wont have a father
               anymore

                         nicky
               ill see you all the time ill get
               a place right nearby one room no
               distractions well talk

he shouts into the darkness

                         nicky
               youre dead

laurel puts her hand on his shoulder

                         laurel
               what will we talk about

                         nicky
               everything

nicky sees one of the new york magazine ads steven
schwimmers face mounted on the cardboard he fires three
times wiping out schwimmers eyes

                         laurel
               will i believe you when you tell me
               something

                         nicky
               theres nothing left for me to lie
               about

nicky starts into the darkness only to see steven emerge from
the shadows his gun lowered oddly he seems distracted by
something on another part of the room he is looking at the
tv set on the counter

nicky watches him approach the kitchen area he follows gun
raised

steven sits on a stool to watch tv

nicky approaches warily his gun aimed at stevens head
which is bluelit by the tv screen

                         nicky
               youre dead i see you on a morgue
               slab drained of all fluids

laurel follows at a distance to see what theyre so
interested in

nicky puts the gun muzzle flush against stevens temple

                         nicky
               i see the outline of your body in
               chalk on this very floor

                         laurel
                    whispering
               daddy wait

steven is watching slowmotion footage of bill buckner
missing the slow roller

                         steven
               then they lost

                         nicky
               why does it matter

                         steven
               if they lost tonight theyll lose
               tomorrow its all over

                         nicky
               why do you care

                         steven

nicky lowers the gun

               trouble and expense to rent a car

                         steven
               an artistry and sensitivity youve
               never shown before

                         nicky
               and youre not saying that because
               of the gun in my hand

                         steven
               youre out of bullets

nicky points the gun at the palm of his own left hand and
pulls the trigger a click

                         laurel
               see daddy

                         steven

               these pauses were exquisitely
               timed he made us wait and wait he
               built a gorgeous tension and
               suspense

                         nicky
               we worked very hard on the pauses

nicky places it on the counter

                         steven
               i called sports phone from lhasa
               tibet freezing in my little rented
               fiat sheep on a hillside rocky
               debris dating back millions and
               millions of years from the time
               the himalayas thrust up when the
               plates of india and asia collided
               red sox 3 white sox 2 a moment in
               the history of the world

nicky takes stevens head and moves it tenderly against his
chest when nicky releases the head he has stevens toupee
in his hand he looks at it briefly then hands it to laurel

ext 48th street near eleventh avenue

a yellow taxi comes speeding past moving eastward on 48th
street we see it from various perspectives and elevations
it is a large checkered cab the only thing moving in the
night steam comes billowing from funnel vents the taxi
catches every light just before it turns red

int taxi

nicky is driving his face showing intense satisfaction
laurel sits next to him

drivers name plate 

                         memluk
                         suleyman

the driver sits in the middle of the rear seat looking
somewhat nervous

                         laurel
               faster daddy

ext 48th street

the taxi crosses park avenue speeding past the bronze statue
of a man hailing a cab

it approaches first avenue where a road divider bisects the
thoroughfare nicky swings into a sharp turns barely
averting contact with the divider and stops abruptly

three doors open on the empty street nicky hands the driver
a wad of bills then he and laurel step over the divider he
puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue
to the glass tower where they live

the sun begins to climb out of the east river

                         the end
