               old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper

                         in a thin glass  

               the barman sighs petulantly transfers the beer into a 
               thin glass and puts it on the counter

               a telephone rings the second barman answers it

               the car draws alongside a steel mesh separates the 
               pedestrian way from the traffic so the two men cant get 
               to carter until he reaches the end of the bridge con leans 
               out his usual cheery self

                                     con
                         peters very upset about his car

                         margaret

               and with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated 
               roof con jumps out of the jaguar

                                     peter
                              shouts above the

               ext wasteland  day

               carter arrives at the top of some narrow steep overgrown 
               steps leading down to the river road where his car is 
               parked he leaps down the steps as the jaguar screeches to 
               a halt at the top con leaps out of the jaguar and gives 
               chase peter backs the jaguar and roars off

               ext river road  day

               carter comes running down the steps with con not far behind

               his parked car   

               as he nears the car park peters jaguar comes down the 
               hill its going to cut carter off from his car

               a sunbeam alpine sports car waits there its engine roars 
               into life and it races out of the car park it reaches him 
               just before the jaguar and slows down

                                     glenda

               so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off

               the sunbeam swings round narrowly missing the oncoming 
               jaguar and roars away peter hasnt a chance hes facing 
               the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre

               glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at 
               the top of the hill

                              pause
                         one of my lads gets a bit over
                         anxious and flogs some machines in 
                         a club thats already got some 
                         the upshot is ive had to eat shit 
                         and stop flogging my machines to 
                         other clubs
                              pause
                         so far as im concerned thats 
                         it apparently not these people 
                         ive offended get the idea that it 
                         would be good to take over my whole 
                         outfit
                              pause
                         so im worried i cant fight them 
                         — i havent that kind of setup 
                         but ive got to fix them before 
                         they fix me trouble is if i try 
                         and they find out im dead

               carter is sitting up on the mattress amused by the soft

               off and goes to do the same with the girl she takes her

               his trousers the reel runs out and flaps like a fish 
               carter doesnt move tears form in his eyes he looks old 
               and defeated his is a wasted life then the anger that

               eric scamper down to the level below eric sprints for the

               in the distance factory chimneys belch out smoke  carter 
               appears for a moment he watches eric stumbling along at 
               the far end of the beach he climbs down to the beach and

               headland carter follows

               ext beach  early day

               on the other side of the headland the scene is 
               extraordinary the deserted beach is like the edge of the 
               world the sand is black as far as the eye can see its 
               littered with rubbish several old lorries are sunk deep 
               in the sand high grasscovered cliffs flank it on the 
               left its deserted

               in the distance a continuous line of giant black buckets 
               move like cablecars out to sea before they deposit 
               their load of coal slag and move inland again the coal 
               mine itself is inland hidden away behind the cliffs the 
               sea like the sand is black as it crashes on to the shore  

               eric is halfway along the beach struggling in the mud 
               carter closes on him

               eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the 
               mine  carter has nearly caught up the buckets grind and 
               crash as they move along the cable

               eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal 
               slag travels he is panting horribly carter is close on 
               his heels  near the top where the buckets are practically 
               at ground level eric stumbles and falls he is too 
               exhausted to get up

               carter stands over him

               eric just manages it carter pulls the bottle of scotch 
               out of his pocket

               eric takes the cap off and looks at carter hes in a 
               terrible state

               eric pours the whisky into his month it spills over and 
               runs down his face

                                     carter
                         drink up eric

               eric begins to stagger about

                         it was you who poured it down him

               eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at carter no 
               mercy there

               journey it reaches the end of the line where an automatic 
               catch tilts it erics body drops into the sea the coal 
               slag follows in a cloud of black dust the waves pass over 
               and everything is gone

               quiet whooshing sound carter drops to the ground
