               a moment later the manager an old italian guy in a black 
               suit joins him in the doorway

               the manager looks off screen and begins speaking in italian

               chili reacts as we hear the name ray barboni mentioned a 
               couple of times

               collection book listens a moment to nothing

               he opens the desk drawer and pulls out a 38 he aims the 
               gun at the open doorway

               over chilis shoulder

               as ray bones a bandage on his nose appears in the back 
               hall then the doorway to the office his face showing 
               surprise to see a gun aimed at him

               ray bones begins firing the big colt auto in his hand maybe 
               before hes ready the gun making an awful racket when chili 
               pulls the trigger shooting ray bones along the top of his 
               head creasing him from hairline to crown

               chili calmly gets to his feet aims once more – probably 
               lower this time – but doesnt fire as ray bones grabs his 
               head and stumbles out of there

                                     ray bones os

               shirt tie lies on the hood of a black stretch limo his 
               back against the windshield reading daily variety a headline 
               proclaiming bonaparte stands tall at the bo we hear the 
               sound of an airplane and he checks his watch

               he casually folds the newspaper as a 747 screams past directly 
               overhead and we

               pull back to reveal

               lax – day

               as bo catlett pounds twice on the fender

                                     bo catlett
                         thats us

               bo catlett walks through the terminal we hear the arrival 
               of the miami flight announced over the pa as catlett stops 
               at one of the gates

               we see a plane pulling into the gate through the glass as bo 
               catlett checks out the other people waiting to greet the 
               flight

               like for example the young dude in jeans and a wool shirt 
               hanging out

               bo catlett studies him a moment then sits down in one of 
               the chairs he looks over at

               a big man bearded wearing a loud hawaiian shirt and 
               carrying a threeyearold girl in his arms the girl licks 
               an icecream spilling some on daddys shirt

               bo catlett looks over as disembarking passengers start coming 
               through the gate

               as a latino man gets off the plane and glances around he 
               looks uncomfortable in the loosefitting suit like a migrant 
               dressed for saturday night

               the latino man lays his ticket envelope on top of the trash 
               container near the gateway

               insert – ticket envelope

               the name y portillo printed on the outside the big man 
               with the little girl picks up the ticket and walks away

               as the latino man heads straight for bo catlett

                                     bo catlett
                         dont say nothing to me sit down

                         hanging out the other way 
                         derecho

               bo catlett hunches over to rest his arms on his thighs so 
               that the latino man is now between him and the dude in the 
               wool shirt

                                     bo catlett

               dude in the wool shirt sure enough theres a bulge down 
               near the guys ankle

               harry waves them right into the two cracked red leather chairs 
               facing the desk chili watches as catlett comes first sitting 
               down he nods to chili who ignores him

               ronnie sits down in the chair and hooks one leg over the 
               arm swings it up and down his motor running on some 
               chemical he too stares at chili

                                     harry

               it

               the limo guys nod to chili and chili nods back trying to 
               catch harrys eye

                                     harry

                         misunderstanding here despite rumors

                         in freaks is as sound as the day you 
                         signed your participation agreement

               ronnie has his face raised to the ceiling

                                     ronnie

                         heard from you lately

               harry comes around to stand at one side of the desk his 
               back to the window

                                     harry

                         interviewing actors in new york

               chilis gaze moves from ronnie the fool to bo catlett the 
               dude the man composed elbows on the chair arms his hands 
               steepled in front of him

                                     harry

                         pushed back a little a few months

               ronnie stops bouncing his leg

                                     ronnie
                         a few months

                                     harry

                                     ronnie

                         agreement with you man

               ronnie sits up straight

                                     ronnie

               ronnie turns to bo catlett the man not having moved or 
               changed his expression the last few minutes

                                     ronnie
                         cat

               at harry

                                     bo catlett

               catlett looks at chili again

                                     chili

                              beat smiles

                         it this way

               now its between them the guy studies chili thinks about 
               whether or not to make a move when harry steps in reaches 
               over the desk and picks up a script

                                     harry

               chili looks at harry wonders if theres a way to shut him 
               up without punching him in the mouth

                         mr loveboy what is it harry a 
                         porno flick

               to his chest bo catlett notices this

                                     harry

                         dead as disco

               ronnie opens his coat so that harry can see a gun tucked in 
               his belt

                                     ronnie

               bo catlett glances once more at chili then follows ronnie 
               out the door harry stares at the door a moment senses chili 
               staring at him

                         to

               chili shakes his head as harry sits down in one of the chairs

                         dont like the ending we could do

                         theres nothin to know you have an 
                         idea you write down what you wanna 
                         say then you get somebody to add in 
                         the commas and shit where they belong 
                         if you arent positive yourself 
                         maybe fix up the spelling where you 
                         have some tricky words although 
                         ive seen scripts where i know words 
                         werent spelled right and there was 
                         hardly any commas in it at all so i 
                         dont think its too important 
                         anyway you come to the last page 
                         you write in fade out and thats 
                         the end youre done

               another glance at the bear then

               the table to harry harry stares at it it has the number c
               18 printed on the flat orange part

                         cat

               and they all look

               downstairs

               as chili and karen enter the restaurant chili checks out 
               the bar sees they arent there then looks up at the 
               railing keeps his eyes up there as he says

                                     chili
                         wait here

               chili moves to the staircase now sees the bear in his 
               hawaiian shirt standing a few steps from the top

               chili gets within three steps of the guy and stops but 
               doesnt look up keeps his eyes fixed on the mans gut

                                     bo catlett

                         the bear movie stuntman and champion 
                         weightlifter as you mightve noticed 
                         picks up and throws out things i 
                         dont want

               chili doesnt move keeps his eyes on the mans crotch

                                     bear
                         we think you ought to turn around 
                         and go back to miami

               chili slowly moves his gaze up through hibiscus until hes 
               looking at the mans bearded face

                                     chili
                         so youre a stuntman are you any 
                         good

               the bear grins and turns his head to the side as if too 
               modest to answer and will let bo catlett speak for him

               this makes the next move easier the guy not even looking 
               as chili grabs a handful of his crotch steps aside and yanks 
               him off the fucking stairs

               the bear yells out of pain and fear as the beefy guy rolls 
               all the way down the stairs to land on the main floor a few 
               feet away from where karen now stands

               chili keeps watching until he sees the guy move then looks 
               up at bo catlett whos now coming down

                                     chili
                         not bad for a guy his size

               chili continues up the stairs to where bo catlett stands 
               beside the table chili unbuttons his coat

                                     chili

               karen watches now as bo catlett puts a hand in his coat 
               packet steps right up to chili

                                     bo catlett
                         you dont know me you only think 
                         you do

               bo walks past chili goes down the stairs chili watches as 
               bo catlett helps the bear get to his feet they leave the 
               restaurant the bear looking over his shoulder at chili

               even karen is looking at him differently now as they slide 
               into the booth with a now shocked rapidly sobering harry

                         for a rest

               lockers three high where c18 is just about in the middle

               he looks both ways takes his time until a group of people 
               pass behind giving him a screen giving him just time enough

                         it isnt on you its around here 
                         someplace

               chili shakes his head tired of this but still feeling a 
               little sorry for the guy he looks off in a kind of thoughtful 
               way turns to the bear again and kicks him in the left knee 
               hard

               the bear stumbles hunching over chili grabs him by the 
               hair with both hands pulls his head down and brings his own 
               knee up into the guys face this straightens him and now 
               chili hits him high in the belly as hard as he can right 
               under the rib cage

               the bear sucks air with his mouth open trying to breathe 
               helpless now and in pain chili takes him by the arm

                                     chili
                         lie down on your back come on if 
                         you want to breathe

               he gets the bear down on the concrete straddles his 
               midsection and reaches down to lift him up by the waist of 
               his pants

                                     chili

                         and let it out slow thats it 
                         like that

               the bear starts to breathe okay again he checks his teeth 
               now feeling his nose

                                     chili
                         hey bear look at me

                         of just talking about it

               before harry can answer we hear a murmur and chili and karen

                         i think the romance angle in your 
                         story is critically important that 
                         isnt simply a jump in the sack for 
                         either of them these two become
