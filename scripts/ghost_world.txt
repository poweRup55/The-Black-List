               opening title sequence  evening

               we move through the city in a series of brief shots that 
               define and establish our setting from commercial district 
               to residential neighborhood eventually we find ourselves 
               moving down a street of twostory apartment buildings many 
               of the windows are lit from within by an eerie blue light 
               as we track past at windowlevel we see

               a glum sedatedlooking couple watching tv an ignored toddler 
               runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays

               an empty room

               a large hirsute man wearing only lycra jogging shorts 
               watching the home shopping network while eating mashed 
               potatoes with his fingers

               a dazed old woman staring out the window

               the silhouette of a teenage girl dancing by herself

               we enter her room and see the tv screen the source of the 
               theme music is a video of an insane east indian production 
               number from the 1960s the room is cluttered with heaps of 
               clothes old records odd knickknacks we see her silhouetted 
               back as she dances along to the video while trying on a 
               graduation cap and gown

               ext high school graduation  afternoon next day

               a modern high school auditorium over the entrance a banner 
               with a coca cola logo reads graduation today 2 pm

               a graduation ceremony is in progress we dolly past the bland 
               faces of tearyeyed graduates until we stop on enid at first 
               we only see the top of her mortarboard as she lifts her 
               head we see that shes trying desperately not to laugh

               she makes eyecontact with rebecca another graduate who is 
               also trying to stifle her laughter the speaker is in an 
               elaborate wheelchair with severelooking traction devices

                         high school is like the training 
                         wheels for the bicycle of real life  
                         it is a time for young people to 
                         explore different fields of interest 
                         and to hopefully grow from their 
                         experiences  after all that which 
                         we learn from our mistakes can be as 
                         valuable as what we learn from our 
                         textbooks and often we can turn the 
                         negative experiences that are common 
                         to all highschoolers into positive 
                         steps toward personal growth and 
                         achievement in coming to terms with 
                         my own personal setback which im 
                         sure youve all heard about ive 
                         been able to learn a lot about myself 
                         ive learned for one thing that i 
                         dont need to rely on drugs and 
                         alcohol

                         with several others in the area to 
                         participate in a show of highschool

                         be brotherhood and community art 
                         as dialogue i think the 
                         brotherhood theme ties in nicely 
                         with the theme of selfdiscovery

               enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom  
               she rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box 
               black hair dye she wets her hair then goes into the 
               bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box the punk 
               rock song we heard earlier plays she yanks out the tape and 
               flings it away she skims through her records and cds 
               dismissing them all she notices seymours bag in the corner

               she takes out the record and puts it on the first tune is 
               an upbeat instrumental number she returns to the bathroom

               several minutes pass track two begins on the lp she and 
               we slowly begin to take notice its a strange haunting 
               old blues record we see that the tune has struck a nerve

               int enids bedroom  later that night

               the song continues enid sits in her beanbag chair her 
               hair is now dyed back to black as the song ends she picks 
               up the needle and starts it again

                              says this when he 
                              leaves his table
                         watch my stuff

               seymour exits an uncomfortable pause as enid stands at the 
               table she touches the mongooses tooth

                                     joe

                         its kind of falling apart

               seymour returns with the 78 holding it like a precious 
               object

                                     seymour
                         here it is its only about v minus 
                         and has an incipient lam crack but 
                         plays decent as i recall

               seymour passes the 78 to enid who follows suit and holds it 
               carefully by the edges

                                     enid
                         wow

               she hands the record back to seymour whos shaken and 
               embarrassed

                                     enid

               art dumb drawings of fighting chuck norristypes traced 
               centerfolds highly sexualized horses etc and on a table 
               a wire sculpture made from two coathangers

                                     roberta
                         im not going to start a discourse 
                         on the subject of good art vs 
                         bad art these judgments are for 
                         each person to make on his own i 
                         merely want to help each of you find 
                         the best way to look within yourselves 
                         the best key to your particular lock 
                         last week i asked you totry and 
                         create a piece of artwork that 
                         responds to something that you have 
                         strong feelings about

               enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table

                                     roberta
                         and it looks like we have some really 
                         interesting work up here

               roberta peruses some of the art then points to a very violent 
               drawing

                                     roberta
                         what can you tell us about your 
                         piece uh
                              struggles to read 
                              signature
                         phillip

                                     phillip
                              very stupid and 
                              nervous
                         uh its uh its about the 
                         mutilator

                                     roberta
                         my goodness

                                     phillip
                         its this really great video game 
                         about a guy who kills people with a 
                         big hammer

                                     roberta
                              trying to make a 
                              joke
                         i thought maybe this was supposed to 
                         be your father

               no response from phillip roberta nicks up enids sketchbook 
               and leafs through it

                                     roberta
                         and what can you tell us about this
                              searches for name

                                     enid
                         enid its sort of like a diary i 
                         guess

               we see several sketches including the drawing of the 
               satanists roberta shows a few pages to the class

                                     roberta
                         i think that phillip and enid can 
                         help us to see that there aremany 
                         different ways we can express 
                         ourselves  we can do things like 
                         these cartoons that are amusing as a 
                         sort of light entertainment or we 
                         can do work that is more serious in 
                         scope and feeling and that deals 
                         with issues emotional spiritual 
                         political of great importance i 
                         hope that you will each have the 
                         tools to do that type of work by the 
                         end of this class
                              pause points at

                         actually technically what he was 
                         mostly playing would more accurately 
                         be classified in the ragtime idiom 
                         although of course not in the 
                         strictest sense of the more classical 
                         ragtime piano music like that of 
                         scott joplin or joseph lamb authentic

               cute girl from her pov her gaze drifts to the other people 
               in the bar we move over the faces of all the guys and stop 
               on a skinny introvertedlooking guy with a poolcue he 
               makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue 
               twirling routine her gaze drifts on

               she sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off 
               her hat reconfiguring her hair she reaches into her purse 
               and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses this is interrupted

               logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man then 
               into an older distinguished black chef with the logo cooks 
               chicken inn then to a white version of the same chef 
               followed by a female white chef then to a streamlined 90s

                         dont you trust me seymour

               int art class  day

               we see another wall of student art dominated this time by 
               enids seymours 3 x 4 painting

                                     roberta
                         lets address some discussion to 
                         this piece

                                     snotty girl
                         i dont like it

                                     roberta
                         can you tell us why

                                     snotty girl
                         i dont know

                                     hippyish boy
                         i think its totally weak

                                     black girl
                         yeah its not right

               more kids respond at once even margaret is confused

                                     roberta
                         these are all valid comments but i 
                         think we should see if the artist 
                         has anything to bring to this

                                     enid
                         well i got the idea when i was doing 
                         some research and i discovered that 
                         cooks chicken used to be called 
                         coons chicken and so i decided to 
                         do my project based on this discovery 
                         as kind of a comment on racism 
                         and the way racism is whitewashed 
                         over in our culture

                                     roberta
                         did you actually do this painting

                                     enid
                         well no  its more like a found 
                         art object

                                     roberta
                         and how do you think this addresses 
                         the subject of racism

                                     enid
                         its complicated i guess im trying 
                         to show how racism used to  more 
                         out in the open and now its hidden 
                         or something

                                     roberta
                         and how does an image like this help 
                         us to see that

                                     enid
                         im not sure i mean
                              thinks
                         i guess because when we see something 
                         like this it seems really shocking 
                         and we have to figure out why its 
                         so shocking

               a long pause as roberta and the class stare at the painting

                                     roberta
                         i dont really know what to say 
                         enid
                              another overlong 
                              pause
                         its a remarkable achievement

               int rebeccas room  evening

               enid is lying on her back with her head on rebeccas stomach

               both stare blankly at the ceiling

                                     rebecca

                                     enid
                              trying to generate 
                              some enthusiasm

                         them i already graduated

                                     rebecca

                         your diploma

                         anyway now we can start looking for 
                         the apartment
                              waits for some 
                              response from enid 
                              but there is none
                         do you remember when we first came 
                         up with that whole idea of renting 
                         our own apartment

                                     enid
                         wasnt it like eighth grade

                                     rebecca

                         right then

                                     enid
                         that must have been when my dad was 
                         married to maxine

                                     rebecca
                         i remember our big plan was as soon 
                         as we got the apartment we were going 
                         to trick daniel dusentrieb into coming 
                         over and then fuck him

                                     enid
                         we were such desperate sluts back

                         i wonder if you really like all these 
                         old records or if you only like the

               sees first her dad wearing an apron and then a hauntingly 
               familiar middleaged woman

                         i thought we decided that josh was 
                         way too cool to be interested in 
                         sex and that hes the only decent 
                         person left in the world and we would 
                         never want to bring him down to our 
                         level and all that

               int community center  evening

               a homemade banner reads high school art show  brotherhood 
               and community art as dialogue along one wall is all the 
               work from robertas class a collection of eccentric abstract 
               bricabrac and enids large painting the painting has drawn 
               a small crowd we see a chain of events beginning with three 
               parents talking to a matronly directorcurator who in turn 
               seeks out roberta wearing makeup and fancyish clothes for 
               the first time

                                     director
                         im afraid youre simply going to 
                         have to take that painting down  
                         several of the parents have 
                         complained

                                     roberta
                         i will do no such thing

                                     director
                         then you leave me no other choice 
                         than to remove it myself

               she marches towards it roberta runs after her

                                     roberta
                         i think we should give the artist a 
                         chance to talk to the parents about 
                         her intentions with this piece  
                         we should be promoting discussion as 
                         a solution not censorship

               roberta sees margaret and grabs her

                                     roberta

               enid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of 
               the bed facing away from him

                         have been seeing a lot of each other 
                         and we decided it might be a good 
                         idea for all of us if she came back 
                         here to live at the end of the summer 
                         just so we can all get to know each

                         and going to some random place

               has a terribly sad look on her face

               int seymours bedroom  evening

               seymour sits in dim light dialing an antique candlestick 
               telephone in the background a peter paul and mary concert 
               plays on the tv we hear three rings followed by enids 
               answering machine message he hangs up before it finishes  
               joe walks by the doorway

                                     joe
                         well heres where the fun never 
                         stops

                                     joe
                         still torturing yourself over that 
                         enid huh

               seymour doesnt answer he looks away

                                     seymour
                         where else am i ever going to find

                              pause
                         she could at least have the decency 
                         to call me back

                                     joe
                         maybe she was just using you to try 
                         and get back at some guy who knows  
                         it could be a million things its 
                         wasted time trying to logically figure 
                         out the female brain thats for 
                         sure

               again no answer from seymour he stares off into space

                                     joe
                         maybe shes got another boyfriend

                                     seymour

                         no problem

               seymour looks so miserable that even joe has some compassion 
               for him

                                     joe
                         look at it this way  at least things

               chips then he tries to flip over a big display case in front 
               of the counter but is unable to budge it  he keeps trying 
               and gets more and more frustrated

               the cafe has been fully remodeled and now resembles wowsville 
               more than the old quality cafe there are no neighborhood 
               characters anymore only wellheeled twentysomethings we 
               see that rebecca is now a waitress here she tears off a 
               check and places it in front of a supermuscular polo shirted 
               european hipster who is too busy tapping away at his 
               powerbook to notice

               she walks toward the end of the counter to total up her 
               receipts she looks up and sees enid wearing tasteful 1930s 
               style clothes sitting across from her

               familiar green plastic a sign in the window reads coming 
               soon another coffee experience

               she continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm 
               stillness to the city she turns a corner and is startled by 
               her reflection in a large window made of oneway glass she 
               stops and looks at herself everything about her looks perfect 
               for once no need to change a thing she moves closer to the 
               glass and shading her eyes tries to look inside

               her living room with that eerie blue light the same thing 
               happens in another window down the street then another  
               enid looks down the street in the distance a bus rounds the 
               corner and heads toward her

               from a thirdstory window across the street we see the bus 
               as it arrives and stops blocking enid from view a moment 
               later it pulls away leaving an empty bench the camera moves 
               upward farther and farther away as the music swells and the 
               credits roll

               ext bridge  evening

               the bus disappears over the crest of the bridge

                                         the end
