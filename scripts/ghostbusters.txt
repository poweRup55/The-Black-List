											fade in

ext new york public library  day

the sun shines brightly on the classic facade of the main library at fifth
avenue and 42nd street  in the adjacent park area pretty hustlers and
drug peddlers go about their business

front steps

a few people lounge on the steps flanked by the familiar stone lions

int main reading room  day

people are dotted throughout the room sitting at the long oak tables
polished by decades of use  reading lamps with green glass shades cast a
golden glow on the tables  the patina of age is everywhere  it is very
quiet

librarian

a slightly stout studious looking girl in her late twenties circulates
quietly among the tables picking up books and putting them on her cart
everything seems completely normal and peaceful

pov

a single eerie musical note signals the presence of something strange
looking down on the librarian from a vantage point high above the room
it follows the librarian as she pushes her cart around the corner

int work area

the librarian is alone in a back room sorting books for reshelving
behind her is the card catalogue  one of the books attracts her interest
and she starts leafing through it

the card catalogue

another eerie note is heard as one of the drawers silently slides open
behind the librarian and hundreds of index cards start popping out  the
librarian continues reading completely oblivious to this strange
phenomenon

she gets up and moves past another row of cabinets  two more drawers
quietly slide open and thousands of file cards start shooting out of the
open drawers just behind her but the librarian still doesnt notice

the stacks

the librarian works her way through rows and rows of old iron shelves
containing many thousands of volumes stacked from floor to ceiling  as
she puts the books back in their proper places she slowly gets the
feeling that shes being watched  she continues her task but suddenly
hears a scratching noise and stops

						librarian
				puzzled
			hello  is anybody there

a row of books

as the librarian walks down the aisle books start shooting off the shelf
behind her  she turns suddenly and sees the fallen books

the librarian

frightened now she walks slowly to the end of the aisle and tentatively
peeks around the corner  seeing no one she starts to scratch her head
and suddenly a dozen books fly off the shelf right in front of her and
fall to the floor

						librarian
				frightened
			all right  whos there  lyle is that you

very slowly now her heart pounding the librarian tiptoes to the other
end of the aisle  she gets to the corner and starts to peek around it
afraid to look but unable to resist

int the next aisle  day

the librarian comes slowly around the end of the stacks and gets her first
look at the thing thats been watching her  her eyes go very wide and her
mouth opens in horror she screams

ext columbia university  day

students are entering and leaving a neogothic building on the
universitys upper west side campus  a sign identifies the building as
weaver hall  department of psychology

int basement  weaver hall  day

at one end of the dingy corridor is a door marked paranormal studies
laboratory  a sign dangles from the doorknob maid  please make up this
room  scrawled across the door is a line of student graffiti that reads
venkman burn in hell  it looks like its been written in blood

						venkman vo
			now im going to turn over the next card and
			i want you to concentrate and tell me what
			you think it is

int paranormal studies lab  same time  day

dr peter venkman is administering an esp test to two student volunteers
a boy and a girl who sit across the table from him separated from each
other by a screen

venkman is an associate professor but his rumpled suit and the manic gleam
in his eyes indicate an underlying instability in his nature  however
while a little short on academic credentials venkman is long on
confidence charm and salesmanship

he turns to the male volunteer an obnoxious sophomore and pulls out a
card from the standard deck of esp symbols  the card is visible to the
camera over venkmans shoulder but hidden from the sophomore by a masonite
board that rests between them on the table  the card shows a star symbol
on it

						venkman
			all right  what is it

						sophomore
				concentrates
			a square

						venkman
				shakes his head
			good guess  but no

he shows the sophomore the star card then presses a button on the table
which administers a mild electric shock to the volunteer  the sophomore
twitches involuntarily as the shock passes through the electrode attached
to his fingertips  then venkman turns to the female volunteer a very
beautiful coed

						venkman
			now just clear your mind and tell me what
			you see

he turns over a card with a circle on it

						coed
				thinks hard
			is it a star

						venkman
				feigning surprise
			it is a star  thats great  youre very
			good

the coed beams proudly as venkman turns back to the sophomore without
showing her the card

						venkman
				to the sophomore
			now think

he turns up the diamond card

the sophomore glances nervously at the electrodes then ventures a guess

						sophomore
			circle

						venkman
			close  but definitely wrong

he shocks him again and swivels around to face the coed

						venkman contd
			ready
				she nods and he turns up
				the triangle card
			what is it

						coed
				biting her lip
			ummm  figure eight

						venkman
				lies
			incredible  five for five  youre not
			cheating on me here are you

						coed
				amazed at her own ability
			no  theyre just coming to me

						venkman
			well youre doing great  keep it up

he turns back to the sophomore who winces as the next card is turned
up  two parallel wavy lines

						venkman contd
			nervous

						sophomore
			yes  i dont like this

						venkman
			well just 75 more to go  whats this one

						sophomore
				takes a deep breath
			two wavy lines

						venkman
				burying the card
			sorry  this isnt your day

he zaps him again but this time the sophomore really jumps

						sophomore
				angry
			hey  im getting a little tired of this

						venkman
			you volunteered didnt you  arent we
			paying you for this

						sophomore
			yeah but i didnt know you were going to
			give me electric shocks  what are you
			trying to prove

						venkman
			im studying the effect of negative
			reinforcement on esp ability

						sophomore
			ill tell you the effect  it pisses me off

						venkman
			then my theory was correct

the sophomore gets up pulls the electrodes off his fingertips and exits

						sophomore
				as he goes
			keep the five bucks  ive had it

venkman turns back to the coed and shrugs

						venkman
			well i guess some people have it and some
			dont

						coed
				provocatively
			do you think i have it dr venkman

						venkman
			definitely  i think you may be a very
			gifted telepath

suddenly the door opens and ray stantz enters

stantz

he is venkmans colleague and best friend  a hard scientist with a good
academic background stantz is a maverick who genuinely loves a challenge
at the moment he seems really keyed up

						stantz
			drop everything venkman  we got one

he starts rummaging through cabinets and drawers gathering up a variety
of electronic devices

venkman

he frowns at the intrusion and turns to the coed

						venkman
			excuse me for a minute
				he crosses to stantz
			ray im right in the middle of something
			here  can you come back in about an hour

						stantz
				excited but hushed and
				confidential
			peter at 140 this afternoon at the main
			branch of the new york public library on
			fifth avenue ten people witnessed a
			freeroaming vaporous fulltorso
			apparition  it blew books from shelves at
			twenty feet away  scared the socks off some
			poor librarian

						venkman
				unimpressed
			sure  thats great ray  i think you
			should get down there right away and check
			it out  let me know what happens

						stantz
				insistent
			no this ones for real peter  spengler
			went down there and took some pke readings
			right off the top of the scale  buried the
			needle  were close this time i can feel
			it

venkman looks at stantz then back at the coed torn between duty and
pleasure

						venkman
				decides
			okay  just give me a second here
				he crosses back to the
				coed
			i have to leave now but if youve got some
			time id like you to come back this evening
			and do some more work with me

						coed
			eight oclock

						venkman
				lying again
			i was just going to say eight  youre
			fantastic

he waves goodbye and exits with stantz

ext public library  day

venkman and stantz arrive in a taxi and trot up the front steps  stantz
is loaded down with equipment

						stantz
			spengler and i have charted every psychic
			occurrence in the tristate area for the
			past two years  the graph we came up with
			definitely points to something big

						venkman
			ray as your friend i have to tell you i
			think youve really gone around the bend on
			this ghost stuff  youve been running your
			ass off for two years checking out every
			schizo in the five boroughs who thinks hes
			had an experience  and what have you seen

						stantz
			what do you mean by seen

						venkman
			looked at with your eyes

						stantz
			well i was at an unexplained multiple
			highaltitude rockfall once

						venkman
			uhhuh  ive heard about the rockfall ray
			i think youve been spending too much time
			with spengler

int main reading room  day

egon spengler is looking for spirits when venkman and stantz arrive
spengler is a real egghead a new wave mr spock who singlehandedly got
venkman through graduate school  spengler is incredibly intelligent but
amazingly dense at the same time  at the moment he is listening to a
table using a stethoscope connected to stereo earphones  venkman comes up
behind him and taps on the table to get his attention

						venkman
			egon

spengler hears the tapping and thinks hes made contact with the spirit
world  then venkman slams a heavy book down on the table

						venkman contd
			egon

spengler jumps at the deafening noise in his earphones and turns to see
venkman and stantz

						spengler
			oh  youre here

						venkman
			what have you got egon

						spengler
			oh this is big peter  this is very big
			theres definitely something here

						venkman
			egon somehow this reminds me of the time
			you tried to drill a hole in your head  do
			you remember that

head librarian

a choleric middleaged civil servant mr delacorte hurries over to meet
them

						head librarian
				nervous
			hello im roger delacorte  the head
			librarian  are you the men from the
			university

						venkman
			yes  im dr venkman and this is dr stantz

						head librarian
				leads them off
			thank you for coming  id appreciate it if
			we could take care of this quickly and quietly

						venkman
			one thing at a time  we dont even know
			what it is yet

int an office  a little later

venkman is questioning the plump librarian who saw the spirit while a
paramedic continues treating her for shock

						librarian
			i dont remember seeing any legs but it
			definitely had arms because it reached for
			me

						stantz
				excited
			arms  great  i cant wait to get a look
			at this thing

venkman glowers at him still skeptical

						venkman
				to the girl
			all right miss  have you or has any member
			of your family ever been diagnosed
			schizophrenic or mentally incompetent

						librarian
			well my uncle thought he was st jerome

						venkman
				looks at stantz
			ill call that a big yes
				to the girl
			do you yourself habitually use drugs
			stimulants or alcohol

						librarian
			no

						venkman
			i thought not  and one last thing  are you
			currently menstruating

						head librarian
				shocked
			whats that got to do with it

						venkman
				snaps
			back off man  im a scientist

the door

spengler sticks his head in

						spengler
				excited
			its moving

stantz and venkman rush out

int deep in the stacks  day

they come slowly down the dark aisle with spengler leading taking
constant readings  their faces are lit mainly by the light of their own
monitoring and recording equipment

high pov

looking down on them from the spectral point of view

a spiral staircase

one by one venkman stantz and spengler come down the tightly winding
old iron staircase  they are scared  books are strewn all over the
floor

a bookshelf

the books start to slide forward then the whole shelving unit topples over
and almost crushes the team under a ton of books  they jump to safety

						venkman
			nice
				out loud
			hello

spengler looks at his meters and silently points at a dark aisle
intersecting the one theyre in  the team inches toward it

						spengler
			its here

they stop at the corner

int the dark aisle  day

the team peeks around the corner and looks toward camera

their pov  day

an ethereal presence is hovering between the stacks about four feet off
the ground  it seems to waver on the edge of being and nonbeing then a
large legless headless torso begins to emerge

venkman stantz and spengler

they stand there amazed

						stantz
				whispers
			what is it

						venkman
			it looks like a big pair of breasts and a
			pot belly

the torso  day

a head and arms begin to form  the apparition is now unmistakably a
fullbodied somewhat elderly lady

						spengler
			its a woman

he edges closer to take valence readings  stantz starts snapping
infrared photos of it

						stantz
				excited
			i told you its real

						venkman
				whispers
			what do we do now

						stantz
				whispers back
			i dont know  talk to it

						venkman
				nods in agreement then
				hesitates
			what do i say

						stantz
			anything  just make contact

						venkman
				takes a deep breath then
				addresses the specter
			hey lady
				the apparition turns and
				seems to look right past
				them
			lady  can you talk  who are you
				no answer
				to stantz
			this is not working  think of something else

						stantz
				sotto voce
			okay  okay  i got it  i know what to do
			stay close  i have a plan

he starts moving closer to the apparition  venkman and spengler edge
closer fighting their fear  they stop just a few feet from the vision

						stantz contd
				whispers
			okay now do exactly as i say everybody
			ready

						venkman  spengler
			ready

						stantz
			okay
				shouts
			get her

he leaps at the apparition  venkman and spengler jump reflexively at
almost the same moment but they all end up on the floor grabbing at thin
air

the ghost  day

she drops back a few feet looms up into a raging demonlike specter and
blasts them with a rush of hot breath as she mouths a single word

						the ghost
				roars
			quiet

venkman stantz and spengler

they scream and fall backwards

ext library  main entrance  day

they burst through the doors and onto the broad steps both terrified and
exhilarated by their first real contact with the supernatural  the head
librarian rushes out the door after them and chases them down the steps

						head librarian
				very agitated
			did you see it  what was it

						venkman
			well get back to you

ext columbia university  day

venkman stantz and spengler head for their lab in weaver hall  spengler
makes rapid calculations as venkman and stantz argue

						venkman
				steamed
			get her  that was your whole plan  you
			call that science

						stantz
				exultant
			i guess i got a little overexcited  wasnt
			it incredible  im telling you this is a
			first  you know what this could mean to the
			university

						venkman
				sarcastic
			oh yeah  this could be bigger than the
			microchip  theyll probably throw out the
			entire engineering department and turn their
			building over to us  were probably the
			first serious scientists to ever molest a
			dead old lady

						spengler
				consulting his
				minicomputer
			i wouldnt say the experience was completely
			wasted  based on these new readings i
			think we have an excellent chance of
			actually catching a ghost and holding it
			indefinitely

venkman stops dead in his tracks stunned by the news  stantz and
spengler continue walking

						stantz
				to spengler excited
			then we were right  this is great  and if
			the ionization rate is constant for all
			ectoplasmic entities i think we could
			really kick ass  in the spiritual sense

venkman catches up with them again

						venkman
			spengler are you serious about actually
			catching a ghost

						spengler
			im always serious

						venkman
				his mind reeling at the
				possibilities
			wow

ext weaver hall  a little later

they approach the entrance to the psychology department talking excitedly
venkman stops at the door and turns to spengler

						venkman
			egon i take back everything i ever said
			about you  take this
				he hands him a candy bar
			you earned it

they enter the building with spengler greedily devouring the candy bar

int weaver hall  day

they walk through the hall then down the stairs to the basement

						venkman
				his mind racing
			if you guys are right if we can actually
			trap a ghost and hold it somehow i think i
			could win the nobel prize

						stantz
				protests
			if anyone deserves it its spengler and me
			were doing all the hard research and
			designing the equipment

						venkman
			yeah but i introduced you guys  you never
			wouldve met if not for me  thats got to
			be worth something

int the basement  day

a workman in painter pants is at the door as venkman stantz and spengler
approach and enter the lab  as soon as the door closes behind them the
workman starts scraping their names off the door with a razor blade

int the lab  day

as they enter janitorial and maintenance personnel are busy dismantling
their apparatus and equipment  dean yaeger is supervising  venkman
confronts him

						venkman
				shocked
			i trust youre moving us to a better space
			somewhere on campus

						dean yaeger
			no were moving you off campus  the board
			of regents has decided to terminate your
			grant  you are to vacate these premises
			immediately

						venkman
			this is preposterous  i demand an
			explanation

						dean yaeger
			fine  this university will no longer
			continue any funding of any kind for your
			groups activities

						venkman
			but why  the students love us

						dean yaeger
			dr venkman we believe that the purpose of
			science is to serve mankind  you however
			seem to regard science as some kind of
			dodge or hustle  your theories are the
			worst kind of popular tripe your methods
			are sloppy and your conclusions are highly
			questionable  youre a poor scientist dr
			venkman and you have no place in this
			department or in this university

						venkman
			i see

						stantz
				to venkman
			you said you floored em at the regents
			meeting

						venkman
				righteous
			ray i apologize
				looking at dean yaeger
			i guess my confidence in the regents was
			misplaced  they did this to galileo too

						dean yaeger
			it could be worse dr venkman  they took
			the astronomer phileas and staked his head
			to the town gate

ext columbia university  day   a little later

stantz and venkman are sitting on a bench both looking desolate

						stantz
				shaking his head
			this is like a major disgrace  forget
			mit or stanford now  they wouldnt
			touch us with a threemeter cattle prod

						venkman
			youre always so worried about your
			reputation  we dont need the university
			einstein did his best stuff while he was
			working as a patent clerkthey cant stop
			progress

						stantz
				not cheered
			do you know what a patent clerk makes  i
			liked the university  they gave us money
			they gave us the facilities and we didnt
			have to produce anything  ive worked in
			the private sector  they expect results
			youve never been out of college  you dont
			know what its like out there

						venkman
				with visionary zeal
			let me tell you ray everything in life
			happens for a reason  call it fate call
			it luck karma whatever  i think we were
			destined to get kicked out of there

						stantz
			for what purpose

						venkman
				with real conviction
			to go into business for ourselves

stantz is immediately intrigued by the idea but voices his reservations

						stantz
			i dont know  that costs money  and the
			ectocontainment system we have in mind will
			require a load of bread to capitalize
			where would we get the money

ext wide angle view of manhattan  day

ext avenue of the americas  day

venkman stantz and spengler emerge from the irving trust headquarters
all neatly dressed in suits

						venkman
			youll never regret this ray

						stantz
				perturbed
			my parents left me that house i was born
			there

						venkman
			youre not going to lose the house
			everybody has three mortgages these days

						stantz
			but at nineteen percent interest  you didnt
			even bargain with the guy

						spengler
			calculating
			just for your information ray the interest
			payments alone for the first five years come
			to over 75000

						venkman
			will you guys relax  we are on the
			threshold of establishing the indispensable
			defense science of the next decade 
			professional paranormal investigations and
			eliminations  the franchise rights alone
			will make us wealthy beyond your wildest
			dreams

						stantz
			but most people are afraid to even report
			these things

						venkman
			maybe  but no one ever advertised before

stantz and spengler exchange doubtful looks

ext firehall  day

an abandoned brick fourstory fire station built by the city around the
turn of the century  it bears a coat of faded red paint and legend above
the garage door in chipped gilt letters  engine company 93  the garage
doors open revealing venkman standing in the whitetiled garage bay with a
middle aged real estate woman wearing a blazer

int garage bay  day

venkman is looking around

						re woman
			besides this youve got another substantial
			work area on the ground floor office space
			sleeping quarters and showers on the next
			floor and you have your full kitchen on the
			top level  its 10000 square feet total

spengler

he comes out of the office area with a pocket calculator

						spengler
			its 964255 square feet

the realtor frowns at spengler

						re woman
			what is he  your accountant

stantz

he is looking at the shiny brass fire pole

						stantz
				shouts loving it
			wow  does this pole still work

						venkman
				considering but not
				wanting to appear too
				eager
			this might do  i dont know  it just
			seems kind of pricey for a fixerupper
			dont you think  were trying to keep our
			costs down  you know how it is when youre
			starting a new company

						re woman
			yes i know  what are you calling your
			business

						stantz
			ghostbusters

						re woman
			oh well this place is perfect for it

ext upper west side  day

a high panoramic view of the city shows heavy traffic moving up and down
central park west on a beautiful sunny day

ext 78th and central park west  day

an unusual prewar gothic highrise towers over the neighborhood
buildings  the top of the building includes an elaborate decorative
temple complete with altar stairs and babylonian columns  the late
afternoon sun gives the structure an oddly menacing quality  the camera
pans slowly down to the street as dana barrett an attractive woman in her
late twenties comes walking up to the building carrying a cello case and
a shopping bag full of groceries  guys on the street check her out as she
enters but she coolly ignores them

int highrise apartment building  lobby  day

dana crosses the lobby and gets into the elevator

int thirty fifth floor  day

dana gets off the elevator and goes to the door of her apartment  as she
unlocks it the door to the next apartment opens and danas neighbor
louis tully peeks his head out the door louis is a shy nerd hopelessly
in love with dana

						louis
			oh dana its you 

						dana
				shes seen this before
			hi louis

						louis
			 i thought it was the drug store

						dana
			are you sick louis

louis has broken the ice he confidently exits his apartment and
approaches dana  his door slams behind him as he leaves

						louis
			oh no i feel great  i just ordered some
			more vitamins  i see you were exercising
			so was i  i taped 20 minute workout and
			played it back at high speed so it only took
			ten minutes and i got a really good workout

						dana

			been rehearsing all morning

						louis

			plenty of mineral water and other nutritious
			health foods but you know that  listen
			that reminds me im having a party for all
			my clients  its gonna be my fourth
			anniversary as an accountant  i know you

			you to come being that youre my next door
			neighbor and all 

						dana
			oh thats nice louis  ill stop by if
			im around

						louis
			you know you shouldnt leave your tv on so
			loud when you go out  that creep down the
			hall phoned the manager

						dana
			i thought i turned it off
				she listens and hears
				loud sound coming from
				inside
			i guess i forgot

dana begins unlocking her door

						louis
			i climbed on the window ledge to see if i
			could disconnect the cable but i couldnt
			reach so i turned up the sound on my tv real
			loud so theyd think there was something
			wrong with everybodys tv  you know you
			and i should really have keys to each
			others apartment 

her door closes leaving louis stranded  he walks back to his apartment
muttering to himself

						louis contd
			 in case of emergencies 
				he discovers he has
				locked himself out of his
				apartment
			 like this one

dana s apartment  day

a roomy twobedroom flat with a great view of the park

she leaves the cello in the entrance hall grabs the bag of groceries and
goes through the living room toward the kitchen

remembering louis she stops at the tv set to turn it off but a strange
image on the screen catches her attention

dana turns off the tv set and goes into the kitchen

int kitchen

dana switches on the radio and starts unpacking groceries  she sets a
loaf of bread and a carton of eggs on the counter and begins putting other
items away in the pantry

the eggs

the top of the carton pops open  then one by one the eggs erupt and
spill over onto the counter  as the liquid contents hit the countertop
they sizzle  the eggs begin to fry on the formica surface

dana

she hears the sizzle turns and sees the eggs frying  she gasps then
recovers and inspects the mess  she touches the counter gingerly but
its not at all hot deeply perplexed she stands there trying to think of
an explanation  then a strange new sound attracts her attention and she
turns around to see where its coming from

dana hears the sound of muffled chanting coming from the fridge  she
pulls the door open and gets the shock of her life  the inside of the
fridge has been transformed into the gateway to another realm  a fiery
path leading to a temple door  on each side of the door is a strange
snarling creature that could best be described as a terror dog  their
front claws are raised toward each other in a symbolic pose  the
incredible vision is accompanied by the unearthly chanting

dana

she stands there transfixed by horror the flames reflecting in her eyes

the fridge

the chanting gets more frenetic and ominous as the temple doors slowly
begin to open

dana

she is paralyzed

the temple doors

they continue to open  we feel a terrible presence within

						the presence
				whispers loudly and
				hoarsely
			zuul

dana

she screams and slams the refrigerator door  instantly everything is
normal again  she looks around the room

the eggs

they are back in the carton unbroken

dana

fighting her fear she turns back to the fridge and very slowly reaches
for the handle  then summoning all her courage she yanks open the door
ketchup mustard bottles of vitamins and other food items fall out of the
rack on the inside of the refrigerator door  dana sighs with relief as
she sees nothing but the cool white porcelain interior of the fridge  she
closes the door and stands there for a moment still shaken by the vision
then she shakes her head and leaves the kitchen

ext firehall  day

the garage bay door is open  two painters on scaffolding are completing a
paint job on the front of the structure in flat black paint  a carpenter
finishes hanging a sign over the door  it reads  ghostbusters

then stantz comes driving up in a very long gold 1959 cadillac ambulance
and turns into the garage bay of the firehall the car has a battered look
to it and rumbles noisily due to a broken muffler

int garage bay  day

stantz hits the siren and flashes the emergency lights as he drives in
venkman crosses to the car as stantz jumps out enthusiastically

						stantz
			everybody can relax  i found the car  how
			do you like it

						venkman
				not terribly pleased
			do you think its wide enough  how much

						stantz
			fourteen hundred

venkman steps on the front bumper and rocks it  it wallows badly

						stantz
			just needs a little suspension work  and
			a muffler  and maybe brakes

reception area  day

a boredlooking redheaded young woman janine melnitz sits in a swivel
chair behind the reception desk putting another coat of red polish on her
heavily lacquered nails  spengler is on his hands and knees wiring up the
telephone system

						janine
				with a definitive queens
				accent
			youre very handy i can tell  i bet you
			like to read a lot too

						spengler
				looks up
			print is dead

						janine
			thats very fascinating to me  i read a
			lot myself  some people think im too
			intellectual  but i think reading is a
			fabulous way to spend your spare time
				he doesnt answer
			i also play racketball  do you ever play

						spengler
			is that a game

						janine
			its a great game  you should play
			sometime  i bet youd be good  you seem
			very athletic  do you have any hobbies

						spengler
			i collect spores molds and fungus

						janine
			oh thats very  unusual

						spengler
			i think its the food of the future

						janine
			remind me not to go to lunch with you

the door

dana barrett enters ance looks around hesitantly

venkman

he springs into action

						venkman
				all charm
			hello  im peter venkman  may i help you

						dana
			yes  well  im not sure  what i have
			to say may sound a little  unusual

						venkman
			were all professionals here miss 

						dana
			barrett  dana barrett

they walk toward the inner office

						venkman
			why dont you step into the office and well
			talk about it
				to janine
			hold all my calls janine

						janine
			what calls

venkman frowns and exits with dana

insert  tv monitor  later

dana is seen in closeup on a tv screen as she finishes telling about her
experience

						dana
			 and then i opened the door again but it
			was gone  there was nothing there

						venkman
				offcamera
			so what do you think it was

int office  same time

dana is hooked up to a lie detector  spengler is monitoring the readout
and videotaping the interview  venkman and stantz are listening intently
waiting for danas assessment of her experience

						dana
				after a long pause
			i think something in my refrigerator is
			trying to get me

venkman stares at her trying to make sense of her last statement

						venkman
			generally you dont see that kind of
			behavior in a major appliance  what do you
			think egon

						spengler
				checking the polygraph
			shes telling the truth  or at least she
			thinks she is

						dana
				defensive
			why would anyone make up a thing like that

						venkman
			some people like the attention  some people
			are just crazy

						stantz
				muses
			you know peter this could be a past life
			experience intruding on the present

						spengler
			or even a race memory stored in the
			collective unconscious  and i wouldnt rule
			out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either

dana starts laughing  they all regard her curiously

						dana
				trying to be serious
			im sorry  its just that i dont believe
			in any of these things  i dont even know
			my sign

						spengler
				checks his notes
			youre a scorpio with your moon in leo and
			aquarius rising

						dana
			is that good

						venkman
			it means youre bright ambitious outgoing
			and very very sexy

dana looks at venkman flattered by the remark but more than a little
suspicious of his motives

						dana
			is that your professional opinion

						venkman
			its in the stars

						stantz
			why dont i check out the building  it may
			have a history of psychic turbulence

						venkman
			good idea
				to dana
			were any other words spoken that you
			remember

						dana
			no just that one word  zuul  but i have
			no idea what it means

						venkman
			spengler  see if you can find the word
			zuul in any of the literature  ill take
			miss barrett home and check out her apartment

int danas apartment  later that afternoon

the door opens and dana enters the darkened flat with venkman she
switches on the light and leads him to the living room

						venkman
			have you ever thought of moving out  at
			least until this disturbance blows over

						dana
			no  if i moved out now id be acknowledging
			that what happened was real  im not ready
			to do that

venkman sees the cello leaning up against the wall

						venkman
			you play the cello  its my favorite
			instrument

						dana
			really  do you have a favorite piece

						venkman
				thinks
			id have to say prokofievs third concerto

						dana
			thats a violin concerto

						venkman
			yeah but its got a great cello break

he grabs the cello and starts playing it like a standup base  dana takes
the instrument out of his hands and gently puts it back in the case

						dana
			you really dont act like a scientist

						venkman
			no  what do i act like

						dana
			like a used car salesman

						venkman
			thanks
				he gets down to business
				and starts looking around
				the apartment
			whats in there

he points to a door

						dana
			thats the bedroom but nothing ever
			happened in there

she takes off her jacket

						venkman
				noticing her body
			thats too bad

						dana
			what

						venkman
			nothing  is that the kitchen

he points to another door

						dana
				nods
			uhhuh

						venkman
			well lets check it out

						dana
			ill wait here if you dont mind

he enters the kitchen

int the kitchen  day

the room is a real mess  utensils are lying all over the floor  the
cabinets and walls are splattered with food

						venkman
				calls out
			youre quite a housekeeper

						dana
				offcamera
			i told you i 

						venkman
			i know  it happened by itself

he scans the room with his monitoring device

						venkman contd
			nothing

he looks in a couple of cabinets then confronts the refrigerator  with
mild trepidation he grasps the door handle then suddenly jerks it open
the handle comes off in his hand

						venkman contd
			damn

						dana
				offcamera
			are you all right

						venkman
			yeah yeah

he grips the side of the fridge door and pulls it open

int living room  day

dana stands there nervously watching the kitchen door  finally it opens
and venkman comes out munching an apple

						venkman
			theres nothing there now and i dont get
			any significant readings

						dana
			this is terrible  either theres a monster
			in my kitchen or im completely crazy

						venkman
			if its any comfort to you i dont think
			youre crazy

						dana
				laughs ironically
			thanks  coming from you that really means
			a lot to me

						venkman
			im a qualified psychologist  ive got a
			degree and everything  i believe that
			something happened here and i want to do
			something about it

						dana

						venkman
			on a purely scientific basis

						dana

						venkman
			i want to help you

						dana
			ill scream

						venkman

						dana
				urging him to the door

						venkman

			you have to promise youll call me

						dana
				opening the door
			all right

						venkman
			okay  then ill go

						dana
			goodbye

						venkman
				in the hall
			no kiss

she closes the door in his face and triple locks it

ext hallway  day

venkman stands there with his nose flattened against danas door  he
starts to leave just as louis tully pokes his head out the door hoping to
see dana  he jealously eyes venkman  venkman ignores louis and gets on
the elevator

louis spots his newspaper lying on the floor across the hall  holding the
door open with one foot he reaches for the paper but cant quite stretch
far enough  trying another approach he swings the door open leaps for
the paper and darts back to the door just as it slams shut in his face
locking him out again

int firehall kitchen  night

stantz and spengler are eating chinese food from several takeout
containers  venkman enters

						stantz
			how was your date

						venkman
			it wasnt a date  it was an investigation

						spengler
			did you see anything

						venkman
			didnt see anything  didnt get anything
			nice girl  no ghost  im starting to
			worry  you said your graph was pointing to
			something big  you told me things were
			going to start popping

						stantz
			they will

						venkman
			do you know when that might be  were on
			the brink of a very serious cashflow problem

he plucks a garlic shrimp from one of the chinese food cartons and walks
off disconsolately

ext hotel sedgewick  night

two uniformed doormen help people in and out of taxis and limos under the
hotels elegant awning

int hotel  night

a do not disturb  sign hangs on the doorknob of room 1210  soft music
is heard coming from the room

int room 1210  night

the room is dark but we can hear the sighs and heavy breathing of a man
and woman making love on the bed  the camera pans across the floor
following a trail of dropped clothing  a  tuxedo jacket and cummerbund
white satin high heels a lacy wedding gown striped tuxedo trousers
satin ladies underpants stockings and garters

						bride vo
			arent you glad we waited

						groom vo
			i dont know  it probably wouldve been the
			same

						bride vo
				indignant
			well thanks a lot

the bed

the groom turns his back to the bride and pulls the sheet up to his neck

						bride
			what are you doing  are you just going to
			roll over and go to sleep
				he doesnt respond
			i dont believe this

she switches on the lamp on the nightstand and picks up a magazine

the air vent

there is a throbbing shudder as if something powerful was rushing through
the air duct  a hint of yellowy vapor wafts through the grating and into
the room

the nightstand

the travel clock reads 945 pm  suddenly there is an audible hiss then
the glass clockface cracks down the middle with a snap

the bride

startled she looks at the clock and picks it up to examine it

						bride
			roy  your clock broke

						groom
			nice going honey  it was brand new

						bride
			i didnt break your precious clock roy

he gets up and heads for the bathroom

						bride contd
			now where are you going

						groom
			to the bathroom where do you think

						bride
				to herself
			have i done the right thing

the groom enters the bathroom and closes the door behind him  the sound
of water running in the sink is heard  then the bride hears a sound like
the noise a cat makes when trying to dislodge a hairball from its throat

						bride
				calls out
			roy  are you all right

the noise increases to the level of ten cats with hairballs

						bride
				disgusted
			hey sweetheart will you cut that out

						groom os
			uuuuuuugh

						bride
				getting quite nervous
			whats the matter dear

she gets out of bed just as he comes charging out stuttering in stunned
horror  she goes into the bathroom

						bride vo
			what did you do in here  it smells awful
			oh  oh no  oh my god

the bride runs out of the bathroom into the arms of her husband who is on
the telephone

						groom
			 right  its smelling up the whole
			suite  i dont know  its just hanging
			off the ceiling  ive never seen anything
			like this  1210  quick 

int firehall office  night

janine turns off the light at her desk  she packs up her purse and puts
on her coat  the phone rings  janine answers it unenthusiastically

						janine
			ghostbusters  yes it is  yes of
			course theyre serious  you do  you have
			yes sir  well theyre out on another case
			now but if youll give me the address 
			dont worry theyll be totally discreet

she hits an alarm button and a loud bell starts ringing frantically

int kitchen  night

the alarm sounds and everyone jumps up scattering takeout cartons

int dorm  night

the alarm continues  everyone enters in haste and scrambles into
jumpsuits  there is much hopping on one leg and bumping into one another

brass pole

fully suited venkman jumps on and slides down followed quickly by
spengler  then stantz jumps at it but hits it at the wrong angle  he
slowly slides down out of sight with a stunned look on his face

int garage bay  equipment racks  night

everyone pulls throwers traps packs and harnesses off the wall

ext firehall  night

the garage door slides up and in a blaze of light and screeching tires
the ambulance squeals out and makes a right turn the vehicle  has been
painted flat black and has been fitted with communication wafers and
antennae  all the original lights have been replaced with purple and
white strobes and the siren has been altered to emit a low unearthly
moaning  the purple and white strobe bars give the car a strange
ultraviolet aura  it rounds the corner and heads up the west side
highway

ext hotel  front door  night

the black ambulance screeches up to the main entrance siren blaring
emblazoned on the door is the ghostbusters new logo  its the
international symbol of prohibition a red circle with a diagonal red
stroke across a ghost  the doorman steps forward as venkman stantz and
spengler leap out of the car  they open up the rear door and remove their
equipment  people on the street stop and gawk

int hotel lobby  night

as the ghostbusters enter people turn and stare at their strange
appearance  they all wear matching blue futuristic jumpsuits with proton
packs strapped to their backs  they also wear brushedmetal flipdown
ectovisors worn on the head like a welders mask  knee and elbow pads
complete their strange outfits

venkman

he looks illatease and embarrassed by their outlandish getups as the
hotel manager descends on them accompanied by a slavic maintenance man and
a worried bell captain

						manager
				agitated
			thank you for coming so quickly  the guests
			are starting to ask questions and im running
			out of excuses

						stantz
			has this ever happened before

						manager
			well most of the original staff knows about
			the twelfth floor  the disturbances i
			mean  but its been quiet for years 
			up until two weeks ago  it was never ever
			this bad though

						stantz
			did you ever report it to anyone

						manager
			heavens no  the owners dont like us to
			even talk about it  i hoped we could take
			care of this quietly tonight

						stantz
			yes sir  dont worry  we handle this kind
			of thing all the time

they cross the lobby to the elevators attracting lots of curious interest
from the hotel guests

venkman

a guest accosts him while they wait for an elevator

						guest
			what are you supposed to be

						venkman
			me  were  uh  the exterminators
			somebody saw a cockroach on the twelfth floor

the guest looks at venkman noting the heavy proton pack on his back the
oddlooking particle thrower and flipdown ectovisor

						guest
			thats gotta be some cockroach

						venkman
			well you cant be too careful with those
			babies

the elevator arrives and he gets on with the others

int the elevator  night

the ghostbusters look nervous as they ride up the elevator

						stantz
			i just realized something  weve never had
			a completely successful test with any of the
			equipment

						spengler
			i blame myself

						venkman
			so do i

						stantz
			no sense worrying about it now

						venkman
				doubtful
			sure  each of us is wearing an unlicensed
			nuclear accelerator on our back  no problem

the elevator stops at the twelfth floor

int twelfth floor corridor  night

the elevator doors open and venkman peeks out into the hall  he steps out
cautiously followed by the others

the end of the hall

a bellboy comes around the corner behind them pushing a room service cart
loaded with dirty dishes

stantz

he hears the rattle of the dishes behind him whirls and fires a stream of
protons from his wand  spengler is so keyed up he too spins and fires
wildly

the bellboy

he ducks as the particle streams blow the dishes off the cart and scorch
holes in the wall behind him

						venkman
				shouts
			cease fire

the bellboy peeks out from behind the cart

the ghostbusters

they breathe a sigh of relief

						stantz
				to the bellboy
			sorry buddy

						spengler
			wed better adjust our streams

he leads them down the hall to room 1210

int room 1210  night

the ghostbusters enter trepidatiously and start taking readings

						spengler
				looking at his meters
			something was definitely here

						venkman
			yeah i can smell it

						stantz
			im getting high readings near the air
			vents  it must be using the duct system to
			get around  see i told you wed get
			something

						venkman
			so far all we got is a shit smell on the
			twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto
			rican bellboy

						stantz
			all right  lets cool the negative vibes
			these things can sense them

they exit the room

int a corridor  night

spengler makes his way down the hall reading valences at the door to each
room  he knocks on one of the doors then passes his sensor over the top
of the door and down the jambs  then he gets on his knees to read the
crack at the bottom of the door  suddenly the door opens and he looks up
to see a really stunning woman wrapped in a bath towel with another towel
twisted turbanstyle around her wet hair

						woman
				noting his unusual attire
			yes

						spengler
				stands up
			were you recently in the bathroom

						woman
				sarcastic
			what on earth gave you that idea

						spengler
				seriously
			the wet towels residual moisture on your
			lower limbs and hair the redness in your
			cheeks indicating 

						woman
				cutting him off
			youre a regular sherlock holmes  now what
			do you want

						spengler
			when you were in the bathroom did you
			notice anything that was yellow and
			unusually smelly

she slams the door in his face  spengler shrugs and moves on

int another corridor  same time

stantz moves down the hall checking pke valences

his pke meter

the needle jumps into the red

stantz

he alerts spengler through the walkietalkie headset he wears

						stantz
				hushed
			egon  i got something  im moving in

slowly and cautiously he turns the corner at the end of the hall
suddenly he sees the object of their search and freezes

						stantz
				frightened
			yaaaaaaaaah

stantz pov

the vapor is hunched over a room service cart loaded with dirty dishes
it hangs there translucent foul yellow feeding off table scraps and
leftover beverages knocking dishes off the cart and scattering refuse
it looks like a misshapen potato with a pushedin face and spindly arms

						spengler
				over the walkietalkie
			ray  where are you  are you all right

						stantz
				amazed
			god its ugly

the vapor

it raises a halfempty bottle of wine to its gaping maw and chugs down the
liquid  the wine is visible as it pours down his gullet and passes
through his system finally spilling through his body onto the floor

stantz

he edges closer

						stantz
				whispers into his head
				set
			im moving in  i dont think its seen me
			yet

the vapor

it crams some leftovers into its mouth and belches loudly

stantz

he is growing increasingly more disgusted as the initial fear leaves him

						stantz
			ugh  what a slob  im going to take him
				shouts at the vapor
			freeze potatoface

he fires his particle thrower at the vapor

the vapor

it dodges stantz first shot and the ion stream tears away fifty feet of
wallpaper in a searing ricochet  then the vapor flies off down the hall
pulling the room service cart along in its wake

stantz

he chases it down the hall shouting into his headset

						stantz
			hes getting away

the vapor

it reaches the end of the corridor but instead of turning it passes right
through the solid wall  the room service cart crashes into the wall
smashing dishes and sending the debris flying

int a hotel room  night

a man is just pulling the plastic bag off his recently drycleaned white
dinner jacket when the noxious vapor comes shooting through the wall  it
blows right over him with a great rush of stinking wind and exits through
the air vent

the man

he looks at the air vent then back at his dinner jacket which has turned
several shades of sickly yellow and brown

int a corridor  night

venkman is alone in a long hallway  he leans against the wall clearly
not taking any of this seriously  he hauls on a cigarette and mutters to
himself

						venkman
			this bites it  i actually work for a
			company called ghostbusters

suddenly from the end of the hallway comes the sound of rattling dishes
and silverware accompanied by footsteps  venkmans pke meter beeps and a
red light winks on

						venkman contd
				into the walkietalkie
			ray  somethings here

						stantz os
				crackling over the
				communicator
			where are you pete

						venkman
				backing away
			third floor  get down here

						stantz
			sit tight  im on my way

						venkman
			well hurry up
				checks his meter
			the needles going wild

venkmans pov

a room service cart sails past along a perpendicular hallway and rolls out
of sight  then immediately behind it comes a reeking yellow haze  it is
the vapor  it doesnt follow the cart but instead makes the turn at the
end of the hall and hovers there apparently looking at venkman

venkman

hes scared now

						venkman
				into his head set
			its here ray  its looking at me

						stantz
				on the radio
			dont move  it wont hurt you

						venkman
			how do you know

						stantz
			i dont know  im just guessing

venkman sees the vapor start down the hall toward him

						venkman
				panicking
			well i think you guessed wrong  here he
			comes

the vapor

it flies down the hall toward venkman

int stairwell  same time

stantz runs downstairs taking them three at a time as venkman is heard
screaming over the radio

						venkman
				screaming
			veeaaaaaahh

int third floor

stantz comes running around the corner and sees venkman flat on his back
flailing his arms and legs frantically  sickening yellowgreen ectofluid
covers his head and chest

						venkman
			aagghh  aaaggghh  uhh  uhh  it slimed
			me  it slimed me

suddenly spenglers voice crackles over the communicator

						spengler vo
			ray  its here  it just went into the
			banquet room on the third floor

stantz helps venkman to his feet and they rush off

int banquet room  night

the ghostbusters enter a large dark room with a high ornatelycorniced
ceiling and a crystal chandelier hanging in the center

						stantz
			visors down  full stream

they flip down their visors and scan the room

stantz

he peruses the room but sees nothing  he looks up and scans the ceiling
a form flits behind a carved beam

						stantz
			there  on the ceiling
				the others look
			come on down here you slug

stantz drops to one knee and fires at the vapor

the ceiling

the vapor dodges as the beam blasts a sizable chunk of plaster out of the
ceiling and destroys half the crystal chandelier

venkman

he fires at it too wasting the rest of the chandelier but the vapor
dodges away  they are both ready to start blazing away again when
spengler stops them

						spengler
				urgently
			wait  wait  theres something i forgot to
			tell you

						venkman
			what

						spengler
				emphatic
			dont cross the beams

						venkman
			why not

						spengler
			trust me  it will be bad

						venkman
			what do you mean bad

						spengler
			its hard to explain but try to imagine
			all life as you know it stopping
			instantaneously and finding yourself
			confined forever in another dimension

venkman considers his own safety and decides to take charge

						venkman
				with military authority
			thats it  im taking charge  you guys
			are dangerous

they yield command to him

						venkman contd
			now nobody does anything unless i order you
			to okay

stantz and spengler

they nod obediently and glance nervously at the vapor still hovering near
the ceiling

						venkman
			lets do it  this things not going to hang
			around all day waiting for us  ray give me
			one stream wide right of it ill go wide
			left  now

stantz and venkman

they trigger their throwers and two streams are emitted shooting off to
either side of the entity  the entity swirls but stays between the beams

						venkman
				talking them through it
			good  good  nice and wide  move
			with him  easy  hold steady

the vapor

it bobs and weaves trying to slip past the visible lines of light but
venkman and stantz manage to keep it boxed in

						venkman
				speaking clearly
			now very slowly ray lets tighten it up
			you hold steady  im coming down

they start closing the distance between their ion streams

						spengler
				cautious
			dont cross them  watch it

stantz

the vapor is trying to get around his streams causing him to waver as
venkmans stream gets closer and closer

						venkman
			spengler a little help  cut him off

the vapor

it slips past stantz and races for the air vent

spengler

he fires with such poor marksmanship that he comes only centimeters from
crossing venkmans stream venkman jerks away to avoid crossing spenglers
erratic bursts and maneuvers  together they do extensive damage to the
walls

int corridor  same time

the hotel manager and the maintenance man look nervously at each other as
they hear the sound of heavy property damage coming from the banquet room

int banquet room  night

stantz has the thing cornered to some extent

						stantz
				to venkman
			ill nudge it out of the corner  you cut
			off the left side

stantz moves closer to the wall and venkman counters to trap the vapor
again

						venkman
				encouragingly
			you got it  thats good  easy now

they manage to guide the vapor out into the center of the room all the
time closing the figurative box around it

						stantz
			its working

						spengler
			easy  easy  im going to throw in my
			trap now

spengler jerks his leg up triggering a release on his equipment belt  a
cord and foot pedal fall to the floor  at the end of the cord there is a
long flat black metal box two feet long four inches wide and two high
he kicks the box under the apparition and toes the foot pedal into
position the apparition blasts them with a flatulent gust  they recoil
but hold the configuration

						stantz
			easy  easy  open the trap now

spengler stomps on the foot pedal and with a loud electronic snap the long
metal box on the floor sprays up a fixed multidimensional inverted pyramid
of bright beaded white light

stantz and venkman herd the vapor to the top of the trap

						venkman
			watch it  watch it  now

spengler stomps the foot pedal again

suddenly there is a loud double electronic snap and a blinding flash of
pink light wisps of brown smoke and carbonized particles rise to the
ceiling in a large residual puff the ghostbusters stand there for a long
moment not quite sure the battle is over

spengler

he cautiously approaches the trap end looks at the valence indicator on
it

						spengler
				confirms it
			hes in here

stantz and venkman

they whoop in triumph  and considerable relief

						stantz
				pulling off his slimy
				visor
			well  that wasnt so bad was it

venkman looks askance at him

						venkman
			are you kidding  that was like trying to
			push smoke into a bottle with a baseball
			bat  now what do we do with it

he looks at stantz

stantz

he looks at spengler

spengler

he shrugs

						venkman contd
				not pleased
			well have to work on that
				to stantz
			grab that would you ray

they exit leaving stantz to deal with the trap

int lobby  night

the elevator opens and the ghostbusters emerge  stantz holds the trap by
its foot pedal  he dangles it away from his body as if it is something
putrid  the hotel manager approaches them

						hotel manager
			what happened  did you see it  what is it

stantz removes his infra visor and wipes some slime off his face  he is
beaming

						stantz
			we got it

he holds up the trap

						hotel manager
			what was it  will there be any more of them

						stantz
			sir what you had there was what we refer
			to as a focused nonterminal repeating
			phantasm or a class five full roaming vapor
			 a real nasty one too

						venkman
				starts writing a bill
			thatll be 4000 for the entrapment plus
			1000 for proton recharge and storage

						hotel manager
				shocked
			five thousand dollars  i wont pay it  i
			had no idea it would be so much

						venkman
			fine  well let it go again
				calls out
			ray  bring it back

on the street  a large crowd has gathered around the ectomobile and the
police have put up a barricade to hold them back  photographers are
taking pictures of it and several reporters are there waiting for them

press a street punk in the crowd behind the police barricades keeps
hissing at him

stantz shrugs and starts singing the ghostbusters song with embarrassed
restraint

						stantz
				singing

						stantz  venkman

or rhythm

stillframe that becomes a frontpage news photo

the new york post carries the picture with a big headline reading
ghostbusters

the ghostbusters song really starts to cook with full production now as a
montage begins

a bank of whirring clicking teleprinters spits reams of hard copy and
wire service photos depicting the team at work

						announcer vo
			hello america  this is ronald gwynne

			in new york  throughout my entire career
			as a journalist i have never reported
			anything as exciting and incredible as the
			trapping of an actual supernatural entity
			by a team of men based in this city who call
			themselves ghostbusters

int firehall

the team hears the alarm buzzer  they leap from their beds and slide down
the pole

						announcer vo contd

ext tudor city  day

the ectomobile pulls up to a gothic apartment building in the complex the
ghostbusters jump out end hurry into the lobby

a policeman

he notices that the ectomobile is illegally parked and walks over to gawk
at the odd vehicle

the ectomobile

as the policeman approaches a set of double antennae on the roof are
automatically activated  they rotate and tilt to point at the policeman
the policeman is a little unnerved by the antennae and starts to walk
around the car but the antennae follow him with unerring accuracy

the policeman

eager to get away from the vehicle he quickly writes a parking ticket and
sticks it under the windshield wiper

the windshield

as the policeman withdraws his hand the ticket heats up bursts into
flame and burns up

the policeman

he stares at the ashes for a moment then slowly backs away from the car

int firehall basement  same time

spengler is at the work bench repairing a damaged proton pack the place
is a mess with equipment work orders parts catalogs and old lunches
piled everywhere half the room has been sealed off from floor to ceiling
with concrete blocks to form a storage facility for captured spirits
winston is standing at a viewing slit staring into the storage facility

stantz

he inserts a trap into a metallined slot in the wall of the storage
facility  spengler crosses to a control console to assist him

						stantz
				pushing buttons
			set entry grid

						spengler
			neutronize  system shut

he pushes more buttons and the slot lights up  several grating electronic
snaps are heard like the sound of bugs being fried on an outdoor insect
light  then stantz withdraws the trap and tosses it into a bin marked
for recharge

						spengler contd
			ive got to sleep

						stantz
			i need two new purge valves  hows the grid
			around the storage facility holding up

						spengler
			im worried ray  its getting crowded in
			there  and all my recent data points to
			something big on the bottom

						winston
				concerned
			what do you mean big

spengler picks up a hostess twinkie from the workbench

						spengler
			well lets say this twinkie represents the
			normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the
			new york area  according to this mornings
			pke sample the current level in the city
			would be a twinkie 35 feet long weighing
			approximately six hundred pounds

						winston
			thats a big twinkie

						stantz
			we could be on the verge of a fourfold
			crossover  or worse  if what were
			seeing indicates a massive pke surge we
			could experience an actual rip

spengler nods gravely venkman enters looking very concerned

						venkman
			egon hows the grid around the storage
			facility holding up

						stantz
			its not good pete

						winston
			tell him about the twinkie

venkman lets that remark go and crosses to a tv monitor linked to a camera
inside the storage facility

						venkman
				peering
			i cant look anymore  its too depressing

the monitor

we zoom in on the monitor and get our first real look inside the storage
facility  it is a bleak repository for souls of many species  strange
lights mists and spectral shapes waft about aimlessly  humanlike
figures lean against the walls in despairing convict poses  others flit
and hang on the ceiling  it is a sad and frightening limbo and a most
unholy makeshift asylum

ext manhattan skyline  night

a mysterious cloud takes shape and hovers over danas apartment building
then a strange glow starts to radiate from the templelike structure on
the roof

ext the temple  night

the moon shines through the odd cloud configuration illuminating the
ornate temple door with its two stone terror dogs posed rampant on either
side of the portal

terror dog

its hideous stone features are bathed in moonlight  the camera pans down
its grotesque body to one of its claws  suddenly there is a hiss and an
audible crack of disintegrating mortar as one of its stone talons comes to
life

its head

the stone figure opens its eyes revealing glowing red pupils beneath the
scaly lids

int hallway  night

dana gets off the elevator and immediately hears loud music blasting from
louis apartment as his party hits full swing  she tiptoes past his door
but despite the loudness of the music louis somehow senses her presence
and comes rushing out into the hall

						louis
			oh dana its you

						dana
			hi louis

						louis
			hey its crazy in here  youre missing a
			classic party

						dana
			well actually louis i have a friend coming
			by

				entering her apartment
			fine louis  well stop in for a drink

						louis
			i got the twister game for later 

dana closes the door leaving louis alone in the hall once again locked
out of his own apartment

						louis contd
				knocking on his door
			hey  lemme in 

int danas apartment  night

she enters and takes off her coat  shes wearing dance clothes and
appears to be really tired  she sits down in an overstuffed chair and
takes off her leg warmers  then leans back and closes her eyes  it is
very quiet  something dreadful is about to happen then it happens the
phone rings so loudly it makes dana jump  she picks it up

						dana
			hello  oh hi mom  yes  yes
			everythings fine  no  nothing  just
			that one time  i am  i will  i
			wont  mother  im all right  i told
			you  everythings fine   all right

she hangs up the phone leans her head back and closes her eyes again  we
hold on her for a long beat

int the kitchen door   night

an eerie light is seen coming through the cracks around the door

dana

she sits up in surprise and looks at the kitchen door

						dana
			oh shit

she starts to get up but suddenly a pair of scaly inhuman hands rip out
of the chair cushion on either side of her and clutch her around the
waist  she screams and tries to break their grip but another pair of
claws tears through the upholstery and grabs her around the chest and
neck pinning her to the chair

the chair

as if drawn by a powerful force the chair with dana in it slides across
the living room floor toward the kitchen door

the kitchen door

the whole door is now pulsing

dana

she is horrified

the kitchen door

it swings open revealing a fiery chamber where the kitchen used to be
one of the terror dog creatures seen earlier in the fridge is standing
there waiting for dana with outstretched claws

dana

she screams as the chair propels her into the kitchen  then the door
swings shut behind her

ext danas rooftop  night

a bright flash shoots out from the center of the pyramid lighting up the
roof of danas building

roof temple

all is as before except that both stone terror dogs are ominously missing
from the structure

int louis apartment  same time

louis is playing the perfect host to his clients a general crosssection
of nerds and nerdettes  the music is much too loud and the guests are
scattered about the living room in small groups making dull conversation

louis

he is emptying ashtrays and cleaning them with windex  a tall woman
approaches him

						tall woman
			louis do you have any excedrin or extra
			strength tylenol

						louis
			i have acetacylasilic acid but generic from
			walgreens cause i can get 600 tables for 35
			less than the cost of 300 name brand  is it
			a headache

the woman moves away

the buffet table

two stiff men are helping themselves one is about to bite into some lox
when louis joins them

						louis
			thats nova scotia salmon  the real thing
			it costs 2495 a pound but really 1248 a
			pound net after tax  im writing this whole
			party off as a promotional expense  thats
			why i invited clients instead of friends
			try that brie its dynamite at room
			temperature  maybe i should turn the heat
			up a bit 

a second woman moves up to louis

						woman 2
			cmon louis maybe if we dance other people
			will start

they start to dance

the doorbell rings  louis bolts for the door hoping ifs dana its
another couple louis escorts them in and take their coats

						louis
			everybody this is ted and annette fleming
			ted has a small carpet cleaning business in
			receivership but annette is drawing a
			salary from a deferred bonus from two years
			ago and the house has 15000 left at eight
			percent

he goes to the bedroom door with their coats and opens it

int bedroom  night

on the bed standing up on all four legs is a bristling panting live
terror dog  too preoccupied to notice it louis reflexively tosses the
coats onto the bed they both land on the terror dogs head

int living room  night

louis comes out of the bedroom and closes the door  then from within
there issues forth a tremendous roar that freezes the quest

						louis
			okay  who brought the dog

bedroom door

an instant later the terror dog bursts right through the door  wood
chips and splinters shower the guests

the guests

they drop their drinks and canapes as the terror dog lands in the center
of the room snarling hellishly

it quickly scans the room looking for louis

louis

he yelps and runs for the door

terror dog

he lunges after louis but louis gets out just in time and slams the door
behind him

int hallway  night

louis tears off down the hall bellowing the terror dog bursts through
the door lands in the hall and runs after him

louis ducks into the elevator

ext danas building night

a doorman stands at his post near the revolving door  two elegantly
dressed visitors wait as he phones to announce them to one of the building
residents suddenly louis comes running out of the door

						louis
			help help  theres a bear loose in my
			apartment

he runs across the street and disappears in the park

the doorman

						doorman
				mutters
			how hes got animals up there

the doorman turns just in time to see the terror dog before it runs right
over him and bounds across the street

ext central park

two bums stroll casually along discussing current events

						first bum
			i think youre right about central america
			but i completely disagree about the other
			thing  a good heavyweight boxer could take
			a karate guy every time

louis runs by them almost knocking them over

						louis
				screaming
			run  run

they turn to watch him go

						second bum
				shaking his head
			rush rush rush

they turn back just as the terror dog streaks past them in hot pursuit
they recoil in fear and watch as the creature sprints after louis

						second bum contd
			that is one speedy mutt

						first bum
			hes a big one  you dont want to mess with
			that particular breed

						second bum
			definitely some sort of fighting spaniel i
			think

ext central park  night

louis runs for his life afraid to look back  he races through a tunnel
then sees the twinkling lights of the tavern on the green restaurant and
heads straight for it

ext tavern on the green  night

louis comes tearing into the courtyard of the restaurant  through the
large picture windows he can see welldressed people sitting in the
elegant dining room  he goes for a door into the dining room but finds it
locked then he tries another door but it too is locked  suddenly he
hears a low rumbling growl from the bushes desperate now he starts
pounding on the glass

int tavern on the green  same time

the wealthy patrons look up and see louis pounding on the glass screaming
unintelligibly

						louis
				muffled
			help  help

they ignore his pleas and return to their salmon croute

ext courtyard  night

louis heart is pounding his breath coming in compulsive gasps as he
turns to face the relentless terror dog

the terror dog

it stands there silhouetted in the dark  then it starts advancing toward
louis casting giant shadows on the walls

louis

he is paralyzed with fear

						louis
				trembling
			nice doggie  nice

the terror dog

it pounces with a tremendous roar

int tavern on the green  night

the roar echoes through the restaurant  there is the sound of a violent
struggle then all is quiet  nobody notices

columbus circle   later

louis walks out of the park walking stiffly with a glazed look in his
eyes  he sees a horse and carriage parked at the curb  he goes right up
to the horse and speaks to it obviously possessed by the terror dog

						louis
				to the horse
			i am vinz clortho  keymaster of gozer
			volguus zildrohar lord of the sebouillia
			are you the gatekeeper

the coachman sees louis talking to his horse

						coachman
			hey  he pulls the wagon  i make the deals
			you wanna ride

						louis
				to coachman
			are you the gatekeeper

						coachman
			no im the governor of new jersey  now get
			outta here

louis glares at the coachman his eyes begin to glow magically

						louis
				to coachman
			you will perish in flames subcreature
			gozer will destroy you and your kind
				he whispers to the horse
			wait for the sign  then all prisoners will
			be released

louis lopes off across the street  the cars come screeching to a halt to
avoid hitting him

the street

two mounted policemen notice his strange behavior and follow him down the
street

ext danas apartment building  night

venkman enters dressed neatly in a suit holding a bouquet of flowers for
dana he sees two cops talking to dishevelled party guests  he sidles up
to one of the cops

						venkman
			whats going on

						the cop
			some moron brought a cougar to a party and
			it went berserk

						venkman
			oh

he goes to the elevators

int hallway  night

venkman walks past louis apartment and curiously notes the splintered
door  then he rings danas bell waits rings again and knocks

						venkman
				calls out
			dana

the door opens and dana is standing there but she has changed radically
from the woman we met earlier   her hair is down flowing loosely over
her naked shoulders her eyes are wide open filled with a kind of
loveslave longing her lips are parted and wet and her clothes are
seductively tattered  she stares at venkman

						venkman contd
			hi
				he notes the change in
				her
			what happened to you the cop downstairs
			said an animal got loose up here  whats
			the story  are you all right

she stares at him as if she hasnt heard a word he said

						dana
			are you the keymaster

venkman realizes that something bizarre has happened

						venkman
			not that i know of

she starts to close the door but venkman slides past her into the
apartment

						venkman contd
				worried now
			hey dana  what is it  what happened

						dana
			i am zuul  i am the gatekeeper

he looks around the apartment and notices the holes ripped in the chair
then he sees the kitchen doorframe charred and blackened with soot

						venkman
			i think we better get out of here

dana

she crosses to the window and gazes at the sky as if waiting for
something

int danas bedroom  night

						dana
				wantonly
			do you want this body

						venkman
				taking her pulse
			well ill just use it for a while and get
			it right back to you

						dana
			take me now

he checks her pupil dilation with a penlight

						venkman
			well i make it a rule never to sleep with
			possessed people

she pulls him down on top of her and kisses him with supernatural lust

						venkman
				coming up for air
			actually its more of a policy than a rule

						dana
				stroking him
			i want you inside me

						venkman
				reluctant
			i dont know  youve got two people in
			there already  it could get a little
			crowded
				he gently pushes her back
				down on the bed
			i want you to close your eyes and relax
				she complies
			now im going to speak to dana and i want
			dana to answer

						dana
			i am zuul  i am 

						venkman

			dana  dana speak to me 

						dana
				in a low horrible
				unearthly voice
			there is no dana  i am zuul

						venkman
				recoils
			whoa nice voice

she starts to sit up but he restrains her with a light touch on the
shoulder

						venkman contd
				trying another approach
			all right  zuul  listen carefully  i
			dont know where you came from or why but
			i want you to get out of here and leave dana
			alone  im going to count to ten and when
			im finished you better be gone  okay
			here goes  one  two  three 

a shudder runs through danas body then she slowly starts to levitate
rising a full three feet off the bed

						venkman contd
				aghast
			wow

he stands up and circles around the bed looking for some sort of
explanation  he passes his hands over her then under her looking for
wires or a force field  then he makes a few theatrical moves like a cheap
magician

						stantz

						winston

int basement  later

louis is hooked up to a variety of strange contraptions including
something on his head that looks like an aluminum mixing bowl wired with
hundreds of electrodes  spengler monitors louis reactions as he
questions him janine watches

spengler stares at louis for a moment then looks over at janine

janine

she rolls her eyes at spengler and mimes the traditional sign for lunacy
by pointing to her temple and tracing a circle with her index finger
then the phone rings and spengler answers it

						spengler
			hello

int danas bedroom  same time

venkman is lying on the bed with the phone  dana is asleep next to him

spengler

he looks nervously at louis

louis

he pours some instant coffee crystals into his mouth and chews them up
then he drinks a beaker of boiling water thats been heating over a bunsen
burner

int fort detmerring  single officers quarters  night

stantz is in a painstakingly restored period room with a four poster bed
writing table and wardrobe hung with uniforms  his own jumpsuit and
backpack lie in a heap beside the bed  he fingers an officers uniform
then tries it on he steps to a fulllength mirror and models it striking
a few heroic poses he shrugs sits on the bed bouncing the mattress and
squeezing it  he then lies down full length and tests it hands behind
his head

stantz

he yawns  his eyes droop blink and finally close  his head lolls
sideways his mouth drops open slightly and he drops off to sleep
exhausted

int wardrobe  night

a uniform sleeve moves slightly a sabre in its sheath begins to tap
lightly against the open doorsash  a phosphorescent light streaks out in
between gaps in the clothing casting patterns over the room

stantz pack and wands

a panel light winks on  the needle on his pke meter jumps into the red

stantz

he rolls over  from inside the wardrobe a shimmering pink mist rises up
and begins to take form on the ceiling

mist

the vaguest remnants of a human form take shape  it hovers and shifts as
if appraising stantz

stantz

he tosses and rolls onto his back still deeply asleep

bed canopy

the mist slithers in through the curtains and takes a position above him
it begins to descend slowly

stantz

the mist widens and elongates and sprawls in suspension over his body he
wakes the apparition is inches above his face  he gasps but cant move
totally transfixed with fear

stantz pov

he is facetoface with a lost soul  it is a beautiful feminine face it
presses in closer he sucks in his breath  is he being smothered  the
gaunt figure then slides slowly away from his face and down to a spot
below his waist

stantz

he props himself up on his elbows and looks down  suddenly the apparition
vanishes  then his belt comes undone as if pulled by an invisible hand
and his zipper slowly opens

closeup  stantz face

his look changes from fear to confusion to pleasure  he closes his eyes
and submits

int barracks corridor  night

winston is smoking a cigarette ambling down the barracks corridor  he
hears voices and walks to the door of the barracks

						winston
			stantz  you okay in there

						stantz
				from inside

they all enter the firehall

int firehall  reception area

peck brushes past her and leads his cohorts toward the basement

int basement  later

spengler is arguing with peck  louis is sitting quietly in the corner
watching the argument with interest

						peck
				highhanded
			i want to see whats in there  now either
			you shut off those beams or well shut
			them off for you

						spengler
				calmly
			you can see whats inside through the
			monitor if you wish

he switches it on

						peck
				ignores it

ext firehall

venkman arrives in a taxi sees the police cars parked outside and dashes
in

int basement

the argument is still going on when venkman enters and asserts himself

						venkman
				to policemen
			at ease officers  im peter venkman  i
			think theres been some kind of
			misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate
			in every way i can

						peck
				turns on him immediately
			forget it venkman  you had your chance to
			cooperate but you thought it was more fun to
			insult me  now its my turn smartass

						spengler
				excited
			he wants to shut down the storage grid

						venkman
			if you turn that thing off we wont be
			responsible for the consequences

						peck
			on the contrary  you will be held
			completely responsible
				to the coned man
			turn it off

the coned man steps to the control panel and looks at the switches
meters and chasing lights

						venkman
				to the coned man
			dont do it  im warning you

the coned man

he looks nervously at the police captain

						coned man
			ive never seen anything like this before
			i dont know 

						peck
				enraged
			just do it fella  nobody asked for your
			opinion

the coned man reaches for a switch but venkman grabs him from behind

						venkman
				to the coned man
			dont be a jerk

the cops grab venkman and drag him off the coned man

						peck
			if he tries that again shoot him

the captain looks at peck with contempt

						captain
				to peck
			you do your job pencilneck  dont tell
			us how to do ours

						venkman
			thank you officer

						peck
				to coned man
			now turn it off

the cops slacken their hold on venkman he looks at spengler worried

spengler

he mimes an explosion with his hands

venkman

he nods and backs towards the door  spengler gets the same thought

louis

he sees spengler backing away and starts to do the same

the coned man turns all the switches to the off position  the panel
lights go out

the needle indicator drops to zero

peck

he feels the floor start to shake

venkman spengler and louis

they run like crazy for the stairs spengler grabs janine on the way out

the storage facility

a strange light starts to leak through the cracks between the concrete
blocks  suddenly one of the blocks is blown across the room

ext the firehall

everyone comes running out as the storage facility explodes  a powerful
geyser of irridescent energy shoots out the top of the building like a
phenomenal roman candle reaching a hundred feet in the air

int danas bedroom  that instant

as the explosion rumbles in the distance danas eyes pop open as if cued
by the blast

ext firehall  same time

venkman spengler and the others are dodging and ducking a shower of
debris

louis

he stands there oblivious to the danger looking up at the glowing geyser
of energy  janine is beside him

						louis
			it is time  this is the sign

						janine
			its a sign all right  going out of
			business

louis walks off down the street as if in the grip of some powerful psychic
compulsion  the others are too busy to notice his departure

ext lower manhattan

a wide shot of the island shows the glistening geyser spurting high into
the air  the irridescent cloud generated by the geyser starts moving
across manhattan toward danas building sirens are screaming all over
town as police cars fire trucks and emergency vehicles race to the scene

ext firehall  later

firetrucks police cars coned trucks and a general mob are assembled
watching the roof of the building which is spurting a translucent blue
substance it looks like a massive natural gas flame bits of ecto
material rain down on the onlookers

spengler

flanked by police he tries to answer questions from fire department
officials and a hazardous chemical expert in a bulky decontamination suit

						guy in suit
			 does it contain tce pcb or tailings
			from styrene esters or any polyfluoric
			groups

						fire captain
			what are the pink particles  what will
			happen if we use water

spengler just shakes his head

						spengler
			no  no water  theres nothing you can do

						fire captain

spengler looks at venkman  they both tear off to find louis but peck
intervenes

						peck
				to a cop
			stop them  i want them arrested captain
			these men have been acting in criminal
			violation of the environmental protection
			act and this explosion was a direct result

the police captain restrains venkman from leaving

						venkman
				shouts at peck

				to captain
			look there was another man here  you
			have to find him and bring him back  a
			short determinedlooking guy with the eyes
			of a happy zombie

						peck
				to the cop

spengler turns on peck with uncharacteristic fury

						spengler
			if you dont shut up im going to rip out

			going to have to arrest you all  you can

			carefully 

ext the bowery

louis walks briskly and purposefully uptown gazing at the symmetrical
lights in the sky

subway entrance

as louis walks by a huge crowd of people descends the stairs into the
subway  the last of them disappears around the corner  then echoing
screams are heard and the whole crowd comes charging back up the stairs
pursued by a strange apparition

int danas apartment

she is standing at the open bedroom window gazing down into the streets
below

ext sedgewick hotel  same time

a sabrett hot dog vendor is dispensing pretzels and hot dogs from his
pushcart

the vendor

he opens the top of the bin and reaches in to get a bun  he feels around
inside knowing the cart should be loaded with food  then he peers inside
and yanks his arm out with a shout  he falls back in fear

the cart

the gluttonous onionheaded vapor rises out of the pushcart stuffed with
hot dogs buns and pretzels  it belches loudly at the gaping spectators
then flits down the street with the pushcart following under its own
power

ext exxon building  same time

a welldressed businessman comes rushing out and jumps into a cab parked
at the curb

int the back seat

the businessman leans close to the safety partition and shouts his
destination

						businessman
			gulf and western building  and im in a
			hurry so lets not dawdle

the front seat

through the windshield we see that the driver is a badly decomposed corpse
in a leather jacket and snapbrim cap

the passenger

through the partition he sees a skeletal hand reach out and start the
meter

ext the street

the cab peels away from the curb at tremendous speed and turns the wrong
way up a oneway street

int an office  same time

its the accounts department of a major corporation  young men and women
are working at typewriters and computer terminals in the sterile modern
office

a programmer

she bends over at the file cabinets and something gooses her  she looks
around miffed but sees no one  she goes back to her desk  her skirt
hikes up suddenly  she yanks it back down then she feels a strange not
unpleasant tickling under her she squirms her skirt goes up again the
tickling gets unbearable forcing her to stand she walks briskly between
the rows of desks trying to get to the ladies room fighting to keep her
skirt down  her coworkers begin to notice and laugh

a typist

she stands up to look and her blouse pops open

the office

all the women begin to scream and squirm as the invisible molester runs
wild in the office

ext central park  same time

louis enters a long dark pedestrian tunnel

inside the tunnel

a gang of muggers is smoking something in a weird pipelike device one of
them sees the approaching silhouette of louis and hisses to his cohorts
the others all look and slowly begin to fan out across the width of the
tunnel

louis

he is staring straight ahead and entirely focused on his destination as
the muggers approach and confront him  he stops  they are deliberately
blocking his path

						mugger
				to louis
			okay  give me

louis blinks stupidly

						louis
			are you the gatekeeper

						mugger
			come on  you want me to stick you  come
			on

						vinz
			i am vinz clortho  i am the keymaster  do
			you bar my way

						mugger 2
			are you crazy man  you dont give jinos
			gonna rip you man  nobody gets by jino

						louis
				repeats
			do you bar my way

						mugger
			yeah  we bar your way

louis

his eyes widen he inhales deeply then opens his mouth and roars
irridescent lights pour out of his mouth

the muggers

they scream and run horrified and disgusted by louis unearthly display

ext street

the cab driven by the corpse weaves through traffic at breakneck speed
cars are forced up on the curb pedestrians run for safety

int the back seat

the businessman is reading the wall street journal oblivious to the whole
situation

ext st marks playhouse  day

a worn graffitispattered 199 triple bill movie house in the new wave
district near second avenue  the bill reads

			all night all day horror show in 3d

int theater

the house is packed with hooting jeering beerdrinking potsmoking
downtowners all wearing cardboard 3d glasses they are wildly razzing
and throwing things at the screen on which is running a bad sixties
british horror indie pic  the film breaks the sound crackles off and the
lights come on there is a storm of protest and abuse hurled at the
projectionist  then from all around them there starts a thin whistling
whine  it builds above the shouts and jeers in the theater until everyone
stops to hear what it is it is like no other sound ever heard  a
piercing allpermeating shrill whistle like the fan blades of some
massive unseen turbine beginning to rotate

the lights in the theater flicker the musty ancient curtains on either
side of the screen are picked up in an unseen wind which lifts them
spreading dust and ripped old fabric about the house  there are shouts
and sounds and noises from deep beyond the recesses of the backstage  the
curtains are now flying in a serious wind  all the lights in the theater
go out except that from the projection booth  from a point in the center
of the screen a searing bolt of phosphorescent light rips back along the
projection beam into the booth  the beam evolves into an etheric strand
of unified glistening particles  the wind dies down  people in the house
are hushed  they gaze transfixed as a procession of phantasms emerge in
single file through the illuminated screen  as if suspended on a
clothesline they weave and bounce along the length of the pulsating beam
and pass through the hole in the projection booth  the apparition is
gone all is quiet  then the audience bursts into wildly enthusiastic
applause

int nypd lockup

winston is staring out through the bars talking to himself

						winston
				depressed
			were gonna get five years for this  plus
			theyre gonna make us retrap all those
			spooks  i knew i shouldnt have taken this
			job

he bangs on the bars and crosses to venkman stantz and spengler who are
huddled together looking at blueprints of danas building

						stantz
				intense
			look at the structure of the roof cap  it
			looks exactly like the kind of telemetry
			tracker nasa uses to identify dead pulsars
			in other galaxies

						spengler
			and look at this peter
				indicates another diagram
			coldriveted girders with selenium cores

venkman leans in to look but suddenly notices that they have an audience

the cell

the ghostbusters are surrounded by a motley assortment of bums punks
hoods and a particularly meanlooking gang of bikers all listening
intently to their discussion

						venkman
				to their cellmates
			everybody with us so far

the other prisoners mutter and scratch their heads then drift off

						stantz
				back to his point
			the ironwork extends down through fifty feet
			of bedrock and touches the water table

he looks at venkman who doesnt see the significance

						venkman
				shrugs
			i guess they dont build them like they used
			to huh

						stantz
			no  nobody ever built them like this  the
			architect was either an authentic whacko or
			a certified genius  the whole building is
			like a huge antenna for pulling in and
			concentrating psychokinetic energy

						venkman
			who was the architect

						stantz
			hes listed on the blueprints as i shandor

						spengler
				exclaims
			of course
				the others turn and look
				at him
			ivo shandor  i saw his name in tobins
			spirit guide  he started a secret society
			in 1920

						venkman
				putting it all together
			let me guess  gozer worshippers

						spengler
			yes  after the first world war shandor
			decided that society was too sick to
			survive  and he wasnt alone  he had close
			to a thousand followers when he died  they
			conducted rituals bizarre rituals intended
			to bring about the end of the world

						venkman
				now very worried about
				dana
			she said he was the destructor

						spengler
			who

						venkman
			gozer

						spengler
				confused
			you talked to gozer

						venkman
			get a grip on yourself egon  i talked to
			dana barrett and she referred to gozer as
			the destructor

						stantz
				proud
			see  i told you something big was about to
			happen

winston has heard enough

						winston
			this is insane  you actually believe that
			some moldy babylonian god is going to drop
			in at 78th and central park west and start
			tearing up the city

						spengler
				corrects him
			sumarian  not babylonian

winston just shakes his head then a uniformed guard appears with a
highranking police official and unlocks the cell door

						police official
			are you the ghostbusters

						venkman
			what about it

						police official
			the  mayor wants to see you  right away
			the whole island is going crazy  lets go

they exit

ext city hall

the official cars arrive and the ghostbusters are hustled past a mob of
reporters all shouting questions at once

						reporters
				as babble
			are you under arrest  did you have a bomb
			factory in the basement  what are you going
			to do about all these ghosts

int mayors office

secretaries and aides scurry about in a chaos of telephones and waiting
city officials  as the ghostbusters are led through the outer offices
everyone stops what theyre doing to stare at them

int office of the mayor of new york city

the ghostbusters enter and see a very concerned group of leaders arguing
like crazy the police and fire commissioners state and city police
commandants the archbishop of the new york diocese the regional director
of the environmental protection agency the governor of the state of new
york and various other highranking officials

						the aide
				entering with the
				ghostbusters
			the ghostbusters are here mr mayor

at once the group turns and instantly regains perfect decorum

the mayor

he is a likeable democrat and a man of the people  particularly the
irish italian and jewish people

						mayor
				looking them over
			okay the ghostbusters  and whos peck

peck shoulders his way forward

						peck
				adrenalin pumping
			im walter peck sir  and im prepared to
			make a full report
				holds up dossier
			these men are complete snowball artists
			they use nerve and sense gases to induce
			hallucinations  the people think theyre
			seeing ghosts and call these bozos who
			conveniently show up to get rid of the
			problem with a fake electronic light show

						mayor
				to venkman
			you using nerve gas

						venkman
			the man is a psychopath your honor

						peck
			probably a mixture of gases no doubt stolen
			from the army 

						stantz
			bullshit

						peck
			 improperly stored and touched off with
			those highvoltage laser beams they use in
			their light show  they caused an explosion

the mayor looks for help from the assembled leaders

						fire commissioner
			all i know is that wasnt a light show we
			saw this morning  ive seen every form of
			combustion known to man but this beats me

						police commissioner
			and nobodys using nerve gas on all the
			people that have seen those  things 
			all over the city  the walls were bleeding
			at the 53rd precinct  how do you explain
			that

he looks to the archbishop  everybody focuses on the ornately attired
prelate

			officially the church will not take a
			position on the religious implications of
			these  phenomena  however since they
			started people have been lining up at every
			church in the city to confess and take
			communion  weve had to put on extra
			priests  personally i think its a sign
			from god but dont quote me on that

						mayor
				shaking his head
			i cant call a press conference and tell
			everyone to start praying

winston

he steps forward

						winston
			im winston zeddemore your honor  ive
			only been with the company for a couple of
			weeks but i gotta tell you  these things
			are real  since i joined these men i have
			seen shit that would turn you white

the mayor

he rubs his eyes wearily

						mayor
				to venkman
			so what do i do now

venkman

he seizes the moment

						venkman
			mr mayor its a pretty simple choice
			you can believe mr pecker here 

						peck
				snaps
			thats peck

						venkman
				ignores him
			 or you can accept the fact that this
			city is heading for a disaster of really
			biblical proportions

						mayor
			what do you mean biblical

						venkman
			old testament mr mayor  wrath of
			godtype stuff  the seas could boil fire
			and brimstone falling from the sky 

						stantz
				chimes in
			 forty years of darkness earthquakes
			mass hysteria human sacrifice 

						mayor
			enough  i get the point
				really torn
			but what if youre wrong

						venkman
			if im wrong then nothing happens and you
			toss us in the can  but if im right and
			if we can stop this thing  well lets
			just say that you could save the lives of a
			lot of registered voters

the mayor starts nodding affirmatively clearly convinced by venkmans
rational assessment

						peck
				furious
			i dont believe youre seriously considering
			listening to these men

the mayor takes a long look at peck

						mayor
			get him out of here
				peck looks stricken
			weve got work to do  what do you need
			from me

ext danas apartment building  same time

louis arrives in front of the building and looks up strange lights are
beginning to flash from the windows  he enters the building and a moment
later a huge tremor shakes the structure

int danas floor

the elevator doors open and louis gets out a crowd of tenants rushes onto
the elevator clutching their most prized possessions he gets through the
panicked tenants and walks down the hall

mrs blum a neighbor comes out of her apartment carrying an armload of
small appliances

						mrs blum
			louis  what are you doing standing there
			 get out of the building  dont you
			know its an earthquake or something

						louis
			the traveller is coming

						mrs blum
			dont be crazy  nobody is going to come and
			visit you with all this commotion going on

she rushes off leaving louis alone in the hall  he goes to danas door
and mechanically knocks three times  his knocking echoes thunderously
throughout the building

the door

it opens and louis sees dana standing there  a tremendous thunderclap
rattles the building

						louis
				his eyes light up
			are you the gatekeeper

						dana
				nods
			i am zuul

hearing that louis grabs dana with a passion thats been building in his
unconscious for 8000 years  he kisses her with savage lust and pulls her
to the floor out of frame as an explosive force blows through the
apartment

int city hall corridor

venkman stantz and the mayor walk briskly toward the vehicle dock at the
back of the building  aides scurry along behind  them awaiting
instructions

						mayor
			i dont understand it  why here   why now

						venkman
			what goes around comes around mr mayor
			the big lazy susan of karma just keeps
			turning and sometimes we get the short end
			of the stick

						stantz
			this may be natures way of telling us to
			slow down  you have to admit its kind of
			humbling isnt it

						mayor
				shouts after them
			were humble already  hasnt this city
			suffered enough

they come out onto the loading dock

ext loading dock

the ectomobile is parked there  winston and spengler are charging all the
packs off the building current  theres a lot of police activity around
them as orders are dispatched

a police captain reports to venkman

						captain
			weve cleared the whole building and
			cordonned off the street  im massing our
			own special tactics squad and the national
			guard is on standby

						aide
			i better alert the red cross too

spengler

he looks up and sees janine standing on the dock she crosses to him

						janine
				a little teary
			i want you to have this
				she hands him a coin

						spengler
			what is it

						janine
			its a souvenir from the 1964 worlds fair
			at flushing meadow  its my lucky coin

						spengler
			i dont believe in luck

						janine
			keep it anyway  i have another one at home

						spengler
			thank you

they hug

the ectomobile

stantz venkman and winston get in spengler rushes over and joins them

int ectomobile

venkman turns around and looks at his friends

						venkman
			okay  just remember whatever happens out
			there we are total professionals  not
			only are we the best ghostbusters around
			were the only ghostbusters around  its
			up to us

they all shake hands  then venkman sticks his hand out the window and
signals like a cavalry officer

						venkman contd
				shouts
			move em out

ext rear of city hall

a pair of police motorcycles comes roaring up the driveway followed by the
ectomobile and two police cruisers  the motorcade turns up the street and
heads uptown at high speed they pass a column of national guard trucks

ext danas apartment building

the street has been blocked off with police barricades but a huge crowd
has gathered nonetheless to watch the strange lights and flashes emanating
from the upper floors of the building

the crowd

the news media are out in front filming and taping everything  a
contingent of doomsday freaks is gathered with signs proclaiming repent
for the end is at hand  a few catholic priests are kneeling performing
rites of exorcism

the crowd

a gang of punks is hanging around hoping for a disaster  a handful of
hassidic jews behind them are wailing in earnest  the police work to
restrain the crowd

the street

the screaming of sirens turns the attention of the crowd as the motorcade
arrives  as the ectomobile rounds the corner a huge cheer goes up from
the crowd

the crowd

the punks cheer the hassidic jews wave their black hats and start dancing
for joy

the ectomobile

it pulls up in front of the building the doors fly open and the
ghostbusters all jump out at once  the crowd roars

the priests

they leap to their feet and give each other high fives

venkman

he raises both fists like a victorious boxer

						venkman
				shouts to the crowd
			ghostbusters

the crowd thunders its approval

the ghostbusters

they quickly finish suiting up at the rear of the ectomobile

						venkman
				keyed up
			are we all together on this now

						winston
				in earnest
			i think we should get on a plane right now
			and go to australia or indonesia until this
			blows over

						venkman
			im going to make a note of your suggestion
			and possibly bring it up later if this thing
			really gets out of hand  now lets move

they start heading for the lobby entrance to the building

						voice in crowd man
			get em

						voice in crowd girl
			all right ghostbusters

the crowd applauds as the ghostbusters approach the entrance

the ghostbusters

they stop in front of the building and look up at the roof

their pov

a blinding flash of light shoots from the rooftop temple

the building entrance

the whole building seems to groan as if under enormous pressure then
suddenly the concrete facade cracks open and the pavement in front of the
building collapses dropping the ghostbusters and a police car into the
enormous sinkhole  the crowd gasps

the sinkhole

there is a tense moment of silence then the ghostbusters pop up and climb
out of the pit

						venkman
			ive heard of underground parking but this
			is ridiculous

they flash the okay sign to the crowd and enter the building

ext the rooftop  same time

dana and louis emerge from the stairwell approach the temple and mount
the pedestals once occupied by the terror dogs

the temple

the walls begin to vibrate in response

ext the street below

blinding beams of light flash from all the windows

int stairwell

the ghostbusters trudge up thirtyfive flights of stairs

int thirtyfifth floor hallway

the stairwell door opens and the ghostbusters stagger into the hallway
completely exhausted

						venkman
				gasping and spitting
			im glad we took the stairs

int danas door

the ghostbusters arrive the door frame is charred and blackened by soot
venkman rings the doorbell  dingdong

						venkman
			dana

						winston
			maybe we should go downstairs and call first

venkman knocks on the door and the door simply falls off its hinges and
crashes to the floor  the ghostbusters gape at the damage to the
apartment

int danas apartment

the exterior building wall is completely gone providing an unobstructed
view of the hudson and new jersey  all the furniture is overturned and
the other walls are cracked  a powerful wind blows through the apartment
fluttering the shredded curtains

						winston
				ready to leave
			well shes not here  lets go

						venkman
			no  the kitchen

int the kitchen

the team enters and sees that the refrigerator has been blown away
revealing a hole in the wall and the entrance to a stone staircase behind
it

venkman

he looks at the forbidding portal and turns to stantz

						venkman
				slaps his shoulder
			go

stantz realizes that venkman expects him to go first he leads the charge
up the stairs

ext the roof

dana and louis stare at the temple then begin a miraculous and horrible
transformation into the hideous forms of the terror dogs

the temple

the solid stone walls rumble ominously and start to separate

the ghostbusters

they come running out onto the roof and gape at the scene

the temple

the walls open completely revealing the secret architecture of the temple
a stone staircase leading to a set of monumental doors and beyond them a
massive pyramid that appears to be suspended in midair with no visible
means of support

louis and dana

they complete their transformation into the terror dogs which now turn
and snarl menacingly at the ghostbusters

the ghostbusters

they cant believe their eyes

						venkman
				aghast
			shit  ive been out with some real dogs
			but this is ridiculous

the heavy rumbling of moving stone draws their attention back to the
temple

the temple

the terror dogs have now taken ritual positions on the staircase the
heavy stone gates begin to open and a bright white light starts to emerge
as the light descends the stairs a human form slowly materializes

the form

it is a thin hollowcheeked distinguished looking man in his early
sixties his eyes are burning red pinholes he looks around at the
spectacular rooftop view then acknowledges the two terror dogs and starts
stroking them like house pets

the ghostbusters

they stare at the apparition

						spengler
				recognizes him
			its shandor  the architect

						winston
			i thought he died

						venkman
			it doesnt seem to have slowed him down any

						stantz
			i dont think its shandor

he gets to his feet and speaks sharply to gozer

						stantz contd
			gozer the gozerian

gozer

he looks up and seems to notice the ghostbusters for the first time

stantz

he busts gozer

						stantz
				forceful
			as a dulyconstituted representative of the
			city of new york and on behalf of the
			county and state of new york the united
			states of america the planet earth and all
			its inhabitants i hereby order you to cease
			and desist any and all supernatural activity
			and return at once to your place of origin
			or next parallel dimension

						venkman
				to stantz
			well that ought to do it

gozer

he stands up to his full height and regards stantz curiously

						gozer
			are you a god

						stantz
				compulsively honest
			no

						gozer
			then die

he raises his arms and blows away the ghostbusters with searing bolts of
energy

the ghostbusters

momentarily stunned they tumble all the way down the stairs and almost
fall off the edge of the roof

						winston
				to stantz
			you shouldve said yes  he might have
			been willing to negotiate

venkman gets to his feet first really mad now

						venkman
				setting his wands
			okay  thats it  im gonna turn this guy
			into toast

the ghostbusters leap into action  one by one they activate their proton
packs and take up positions for an entrapment

gozer

he braces for the onslaught

venkman

he shoots a particle stream at gozer

gozer

he leaps out of the way with superhuman agility and executes a perfect
doubleflip with a halftwisting roundoff at the end

venkman

he cant believe his eyes

						venkman
			agile bastard isnt he

						stantz
			forget the trapping  just blast him

the others adjust their units and they all blaze away at gozer

gozer

he stands there calmly and absorbs the force of the streams  there is a
brilliant pink flash and gozer disappears

the ghostbusters

they stare for a long moment finding it hard to believe that they won
then winston lets out a triumphant whoop

spengler

he scans the temple with his pke meter not at all convinced the danger
has passed

stantz

he bounds up the stairs

						stantz
				jubilant
			we neutronized him  the guys a molecular
			nonentity

venkman and spengler

he wants to believe it but sees the doubt on spenglers face

						spengler
				reading the meter
			not necessarily

there is a deep seismic rumble and the entire building begins to vibrate
the ghostbusters look around nervously as the entire building starts to
sway

ext the eaves

cement carvings and moldings around the edge of the roof crack and break
off

ext the street

the crowd screams and runs as cement debris rains down the side of the
building and crashes on the sidewalk

the ghostbusters

they look up at the sky waiting for the big blow  an incredibly loud
thunderclap rocks the rooftop

the sky

a bolt of lightning crackles from the swirling dark cloud and strikes the
rooftop

the ghostbusters stand there facing their new god like moses on mount
sinai  and then gozer speaks to them in a voice that can be heard
throughout metropolitan new york and parts of new jersey

						gozer
			subcreatures  gozer the gozerian gozer
			the destructor volguus zildrohar the
			traveller has come  choose and perish

						venkman
				shouting to be heard
			is he talking to us

						winston
			whats he talking about  choose what

						stantz
				to the heavens
			what do you mean choose  we dont
			understand

						gozer
			choose

						spengler
			i think hes saying that since were about
			to be sacrificed anyway we get to choose
			the form we want him to take

						stantz
			you mean if i stand here and concentrate on
			the image of roberto clemente gozer will
			appear as roberto clemente and wipe us out

						spengler
			that appears to be the case

						venkman
				quickly
			dont think of anything yet  clear your
			minds  we only get one crack at this

						gozer
			the choice is made  the traveller has come

						venkman
				in a panic
			we didnt choose anything
				to the others
			i didnt think of an image did you

						spengler
			no

they look at winston

						winston
			my minds a total void

they all look at stantz

						stantz
				guilty
			i couldnt help it  it just popped in
			there

						venkman
				desperately
			what  what popped in there

						stantz
				pointing
			look

they all turn and look to the south

ghostbusters pov

looking south past columbus circle they see part of something big and
white moving between the buildings accompanied by thunderous footsteps of
almost seismic proportions

venkman

he doesnt know what it is yet but he knows its coming

						venkman
				desperately
			what is it  ray what did you think of

broadway and 55th

the massive white shape passes behind some buildings offering a glimpse
of what appears to be a fat white arm

stantz

hes about to go into shock

						stantz
				babbling
			it cant be  it cant be

columbus circle

the thundering footsteps continue to plod as the thing starts to emerge
from behind the buildings  now we can see part of a blue garment covering
its enormous chest

stantz

he recognizes the monster

						stantz
			its  its  its the staypuft
			marshmallow man

winston venkman and spengler gape

their pov

they look across the roof tops and see a large square white bobbing
laughing head atop a massive body of similar puffed white squares  the
being is dressed in a tiny sailors hat red bosuns whistle and lanyard
and a little blue vest with a button undone in the middle revealing a
little white belly it is the cute quintessential american brand symbol
looming as large as godzilla

						stantz vo
				desperately apologizing
			i tried to think of the most harmless thing
			 something that could never destroy us
			 something i loved from my childhood

the ghostbusters

they watch the marshmallow man plodding toward them

						venkman
			and you came up with that

						stantz
			the staypuft marshmallow man  he was on
			all the packages we used to buy when i was
			a kid  we used to roast staypuft
			marshmallows at camp waconda

						venkman
			great  the marshmallows are about to get
			their revenge

the staypuft man

he plods relentlessly uptown toward the ghostbusters rooftop vantage
point  the ground rumbles as his big soft feet come down on the
pavement

the street

people are fleeing in panic as the marshmallow feet pad along kicking over
lampposts and mail boxes

a car

the driver jumps out just before an enormous white marshmallow foot comes
down and flattens his automobile

the ghostbusters

they stand there helplessly watching the laughing bobbing head of the
staypuft man as he comes toward them

						venkman
			what now

						spengler
				adjusting his thrower
			fullstream with strogon pulse

venkman looks at stantz  stantz shrugs

						venkman
				decides
			i guess thats all weve got

they step to the edge of the roof moving like warriors now ready to face
the consequences

ext the street

peck comes running up to the front of the apartment building  people are
fleeing the oncoming monster  peck grabs a cop who is just about to flee
himself

						peck
				in a rage
			are the ghostbusters up there

						cop
				desperate to get away
			yeah

						peck
			i want you to go up on the roof and arrest
			them  this time theyve gone too far

the cop looks at peck like hes insane then sees the staypuft man
looming up at the end of the block

						cop
				knocking pecks hands
				away
			you arrest them numb nuts  im getting out
			of here

he runs off  peck turns to face the monster

the stay puft man

the ground shakes with every step as he reaches the building then using
the church next door as a stepping stone he begins climbing the wall

the ghostbusters

they look over the edge of the roof as the marshmallow man climbs higher
and higher

						venkman
				shouts
			hit him

they each fire point blank at the staypuft man

the staypuft man

he bellows with pain and rage as the beams strike him right in the chest
and set his skin on fire  he begins to burn with a blue flame that
spreads quickly across his torso and down his arms  the staypuft man
bellows even louder flailing its huge arms in response to the searing
flames that are starting to engulf him

the ghostbusters

they stare at the horrible conflagration

						winston
			good  now we made him mad

the staypuft man

carbonous flaming hunks of melting marshmallow are flying from his arms
as he waves them in wild rage

the street

peck stands there paralyzed with fear  a mass of flaming marshmallow
falls and flattens a news stand nearby  then a huge glob of sticky
toasted marshmallow comes zipping down from above and lands right on him
burying him up to his neck in melted sucrose

the staypuft man

the flaming monster keeps coming intent on their destruction  most of his
chest has melted away revealing horrid musculature and a skeletal rib
cage

the ghostbusters

they square off and face him for the last time their weapons poised

						venkman
				calmly
			were going to be killed by a hundredfoot
			marshmallow

the staypuft man

he is almost on them now fully engulfed in flames reaching for them
ready to swat them with his burning fist

						venkman
				to the others
			on the count of three  one  two 

						spengler
				he has the best idea of
				his life
			no  them  shoot them
				he points at the terror
				dogs
			cross the beams

the terror dogs

they stand beside the portal literally petrified

venkman

he hesitates

						venkman
				protesting
			no  you said crossing the beams would be
			bad  itll kill her  and us

						spengler
			life is just a state of mind

						venkman
			but its my favorite state

						stantz
			either way were history

the staypuft man

his burning fist is starting to descend on the ghostbusters

venkman

he chooses the only way out

						venkman
				shouts
			now

the ghostbusters

they turn and fire at the two petrified terror dogs and blow them to
oblivion the entire front of the temple is obliterated along with the
door

the staypuft man

with the destruction of his earthly portal the flaming monster is
suddenly engulfed in a cyclonic wind that begins to swirl around him like
a firestorm  the flames are whipped higher and higher as the tornado
begins to pick up rotational speed then the marshmallow man seems to
explode from deep inside creating a flaming air burst high above the
rooftops

the rooftop

the ghostbusters are blasted off their feet

the sky

the fireball reaches its maximum explosive force then a sudden jet of air
pressure occurs like a titanic vacuum cleaner in the sky and sucks the
flaming mass of gasses and ash up through our atmosphere and right out of
our dimension  the dark clouds disappear with it leaving a beautiful
clear blue sky over the whole area

the temple

it now looks like an ancient ruin

the ghostbusters

they are lying at the foot of the stairs everything is still  one by one
they get slowly to their feet and look around to see that the crisis has
passed

						stantz
			everybody okay

venkman looks up at the portal

the terror dogs

they are still on the pedestals but charred almost beyond recognition
venkman mounts the stairs and gazes sadly at the remains

the pedestal

venkman stands there mourning then a slight movement under the blackened
skin of the terror dog catches his eye  the movement gets stronger then
suddenly a human hand pokes through the carbonous coating

venkman

hope surges in him and he starts frantically tearing away the black
coating finally revealing dana alive and well under the burnt skin of the
terror dog

stantz and spengler

they peel the charred coating off louis and help him to his feet

louis

he looks around wondering how he ended up on the roof of a wrecked
highrise he looks at his scorched and ripped suit crusted with the
stillsmoking gobs of melted marshmallow

						louis
				amazed
			jeez  somebody must have spiked the egg
			salad

venkman

he helps dana to her feet

						venkman
			are you all right

she looks around at the incredible scene

						dana
				totally confused
			oh sure  im getting used to this

						louis
				seeing dana for the first
				time
			im innocent  honest dana  i never
			touched you  not that i remember anyway

						dana
				getting annoyed
			all right what happened to me

						venkman
			nothing  we just got rid of that thing in
			your kitchen

						dana
			really  is it gone

						venkman
			yeah along with most of your furniture and
			a lot of your personal possessions  this
			one took some work

						dana
				noting the wrecked temple
			thank you  next time i want to break a
			lease ill know who to call

she hugs him

						venkman
			this is going to cost you you know  our
			fees are ridiculously high

						dana
			talk to my accountant
				she indicates louis

						louis
			oh great  i bet we could write off all the
			damage as an act of god

the ghostbusters

they look at each other and nod

						stantz
			ill go along with that

ext street  near the apartment  night the two bums

they hear the cheering down the street as they cautiously inspect a
massive mound of cooling sucrose

						first bum
			well that definitely looks like marshmallow
			to me

						second bum
				sniffing it
			yeah its some kind of mallowtype
			substance  thats for sure

						first bum
			you have to wonder why anybody would dump a
			marshmallow that size right in the middle of
			the street

						second bum
			i wonder if there might not be a very large
			cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area

						first bum
			that would definitely explain it

ext the street   night

a happy throng of jubilant citizens is gathered outside the lobby entrance
to the apartment building

the entrance

the battered but victorious ghostbusters emerge from the lobby  venkman
and dana are holding hands  the crowd roars with unrestrained joy and
gratitude  janine runs over and hugs spengler enthusiastically  the
ghostbusters wave and head for the ectomobile parked at the curb

the ghostbusters

they get into the ectomobile and drive off with lights flashing and sirens
screaming as the crowd cheers wildly

						the end
