fade in

ext  forest  day

germania  the far reaches of the roman empire

winter 180 ad

incongruously enough the first sound we hear is a
beautiful tenor voice  singing  a boys voice

credits as we hear the haunting song float through dense
forests  we finally come to a rough muddy road slashing
through the forest  on the road a german peasant father
is herding along three sickly looking cows  his two sons
are with him  his youngest son sits on one of the cows
and sings a soft plaintive song

they become aware of another sound behind them on the road
 the creak of wood the slap of metal on leather  the
father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the
road  they standstill eyes down  the familiar posture
of subjugated peoples throughout history

a wagon train rumbles past them  three ornate wagons
followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavilyarmed
praetorian guards

the young boy dares to glance up at the passing romans
his eyes burn with hatred

int  wagon  day

mist momentarily obscures a mans face  frozen breath
the man is in his 20s imperious and handsome  he is
swathed in fur only his face exposed  he is commodus

he glances up

					commodus
		do you think hes really dying

the woman across from him returns his gaze evenly  she is
slightly older beautiful and patrician  a formidable
woman

she is lucilla

					lucilla
		hes been dying for ten years

					commodus
		i think hes really dying this time

a beat  their breath turns instantly to mist

					commodus
		he has to be bled every night now

					lucilla
		how do you know that

					commodus
		ive been so informed

she arches an eyebrow

					commodus
		if he werent really dying he
		wouldnt have sent for us

					lucilla
			a smile
		maybe he just misses us

					commodus
		and the senators  he wouldnt have
		summoned them if 

					lucilla
		peace commodus  after two weeks on
		the road your incessant scheming is
		hurting my head

a beat

					commodus
		the first thing i shall do is honor
		him with games worthy of his
		majesty

					lucilla
		the first thing i shall do is have a
		hot bath

the wagon rumbles to a halt  voices are heard outside

commodus leaps out

ext  wagon  outpost  day

three roman soldiers guard an outpost a watchtower on
the roadside

					commodus
		why have we stopped

					praetorian guard member
		were here sir

					commodus
			to soldier 1
		where is my father

					soldier 1
		hes at the front sir

					commodus
		is the battle won

					soldier 1
		dont know sir  theyve been gone
		for eight days

commodus tosses off his furs  beneath them he wears a
beautiful set of lorica segmentata  the traditional
formed armor of rome  he moves to a horse as

					commodus
			to soldier 1
		my sister wants a bath take her to
		the camp
			to soldier 2
		take me to my father

he leaps onto the horse and canters back to the praetorian
guard unit

soldier 2 climbs on his horse and leads them  commodus
rides off with most of the praetorian guard unit

lucilla peeks her head from the wagon  she glances at the
remaining soldiers  distinctly unpromising

					lucilla
			dry
		civilization at last  gods preserve
		us

ext  hill  twilight

the mighty catapults dwarf the humans  soldiers from the
elite felix regiment  a legion of the roman army  haul
the monstrous machines up a hill

the commanding general of the felix regiment maximus
walks between two of the catapults  he is a striking and
intense man in his 30s  like all the soldiers who
surround him he is caked with mud and exhausted

he trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants titus and
quintus

					titus
		you would do as well to read the
		mind of a rhinoceros

					quintus
		these barbarians would rather drown
		in blood than yield an inch  if i
		didnt hate them so much i would
		admire them

they have reached the top of the hill  stunning martial
preparations are underway  the catapults join ten others
archers are taking up position  brutal scorpions 
devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts  are being
loaded  soldiers are also loading the catapults with
enormous greek fire pots  large round terra cotta
pots

maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop
below them they can see a german encampment

					titus
		they simply will not surrender

a beat as maximus gazes down at the german position

					maximus
			quietly
		a people should know when they are
		conquered

a beat

					maximus
		at the first signal release the
		catapults  well use the cavalry to
		cut off the retreat

					quintus
		general i dont recommend that
		our cavalry might be caught in the
		flames

					maximus
		i hope not because im going to be
		leading them

a beat as he gazes down at the enemy

					maximus
		why dont they know theyre already
		dead

ext  trees  twilight

maximus and titus are on their horses the cavalry of two
hundred felix regiment warriors surrounds them  steam
flares from their horses nostrils  they wait in a thick
stand of trees  the german position can be seen across a
muddy plain

a large wolf  the wolf of rome  waits at maximus
side

maximus nods to an archer  the archer lights the tip of
an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky

ext  hilltop  twilight

quintus waits  the catapults are loaded and waiting  so
too the scorpions  so too the 200 archers of the felix
regiment

he sees the flaming arrow flying up from below

					quintus
		now

the mighty catapults are released  the greek fire pots
arc dramatically through the air  a moment later soldiers
release the scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through
the sky  the archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming
arrows

ext  trees  twilight

the screaming is almost immediate

maximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down
into the german encampment

ext  german camp  twilight

the fire pots shatter  pitch splashes everywhere 
seconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and
ignite the pitch  flame explodes  it is a hellish
napalmlike vision  the conflagration illuminating the
twilight

the deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through
the german camp 

ext  trees  twilight

maximus watches the german camp

					maximus
			to his men
		hold steady steady

he can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment
continuing  fire pots and scorpion bolts and flaming
arrows  panic in the german encampment

					maximus
		steady

he sees the germans begin fleeing across the plain  he
quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer then turns
to his men

					maximus
		brothers  i salute you  for rome

he spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the
plain

ext  plain  battleground  twilight

maximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge
 titus at his side  the felix regiment screams out
fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain
toward the germans 

fire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere
around them 

the cavalry slams into the germans at full gallop 

it is carnage

the felix regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short
swords  slicing a path of sheer destruction through the
germans  but the germans fight with equal brutality 
and the germans also fight with the desperation of a
hopeless last chance  they pull and spear roman soldiers
off horses whenever they can 

maximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert
efficiency  a spear stabs through the neck of his horse
and it immediately collapses forward 

maximus sails over the horses head and crashes to the
muddy ground  he jumps up and is in the midst of the
battle 

the flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a
ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle  the
flames silhouetting the fighting 

on the ground maximus proves his absolute worth as a
warrior  he hacks and dodges  ghastly images of true
ancient warfare  maximus eyes burn with a zealous fire
as he fights for his life 

he finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage 
germans are surrounding him from all sides  as he fights
he looks for an advantage  for his soldiers  for
anything  he is doomed 

then  an almost mystical image  maximus wolf leaps
through a wall of flame 

the wolf of rome savages several germans around maximus
 giving him the help he needed

the wolf and his master fight sidebyside

ext  hilltop  twilight

we see an old mans face staring down at the battle  the
face is weatherbeaten ailing  the roaring flames from
the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes

marcus aurelius the emperor of rome is on a horse  a
metal brace extends from the back of his saddle  he is
strapped to the brace with thick leather straps

he watches as the felix regiment below concludes the
battle  the cheering of the regiment can be heard as the
final isolated pockets of germans are cut down

behind marcus the sun is setting painting the world blood
red

ext  battlefield  sunset

maximus bloody and spent walks through the aftermath of
the carnage  the wolf of rome is at his side  dead and
dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere  roman
surgeons are attending to the wounded

marcus walks to him embraces him warmly

					maximus
		caesar

					marcus
		maximus you prove your valor again
		let us hope for the final time here

					maximus
		i dont think theres anyone left to
		fight

					marcus
		there are always people left to
		fight

marcus takes maximus arm and they walk through the masses
of bodies  maximus holds marcus arm firmly quietly
supporting him as they walk

					marcus
		but this night at least germania
		is at last defeated what will you
		do now my friend

					maximus
		should caesar permit ill go home
		ive been away too long  ive
		forgotten my wifes face and i
		barely know my son

suddenly a tethered german prisoner they are passing
calls out to them

					german prisoner
		this blood means nothing conqueror

maximus and marcus stop  a soldier moves quickly to
silence the german prisoner

					marcus
			to soldier
		stop
			to prisoner
		 you speak our language

					german prisoner
		you have been in my homeland for
		twelve years  of course i speak
		your language  so did my son who
		you murdered  so did my daughter
		who you raped

					maximus
			to marcus
		come caesar

					marcus
		no  let him speak
			to prisoner
		 i am rome what would you say to
		me

					german prisoner
			points to sunset
		you are that sun rome and your
		time is over you can slit a
		thousand throats here and you can
		put a thousand babies to the sword
		but it will always be our home

					marcus
		now it is rome

					german prisoner
		it will never be rome  not as long
		as one german breathes

the soldier moves to kill the insolent prisoner

					marcus
		no release him  give him safe
		passage  let him go to his family

the soldier leads the german prisoner away

maximus and marcus continue walking in silence for a beat
then

					marcus
		tell me again maximus why are we
		here

					maximus
		for the glory of the empire sire

					marcus
			quietly
		yes  i remember

they continue walking through the mountains of bodies

ext  road  sunset

maximus and marcus are now walking along a road through
the dense forest  slaves follow behind them leading
their horses

both sides of the road are filled with the men of the
felix regiment  as maximus and marcus pass the battered
and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet raising
their swords paying silent homage

					maximus
		they honor you caesar

					marcus
		i dont think theyre standing for
		me maximus  they honor you

just then commodus canters into view with his praetorian
guard escort  he watches the army honor maximus with rank
envy as he nears

he rides up to maximus and marcus

					commodus
		have i missed it

he leaps from his horse

					commodus
		have i missed the battle

					marcus
		youve missed the war  were done
		here

commodus embraces him awkward

					commodus
		father  congratulations  i shall
		sacrifice a thousand doves to honor
		your triumph

					marcus
		spare the doves and honor maximus
		he won the battle

commodus embraces maximus even more awkward

					commodus
		general rome salutes you and i
		embrace you as a brother

					maximus
		highness

they walk maximus still supporting marcus as

					commodus
		your spaniards seem invincible  may
		the gods favor the felix regiment
		now and always
			to his father
		here father take my arm

					marcus
			ignores this
		wheres your sister

					commodus
		shes at the camp  she had no
		desire to see the gore of the
		battlefield

					marcus
			smiles
		lucilla would eat every corpse here
		if it brought her one step closer to
		the throne

maximus laughs

					maximus
			smiles
		caesar you do the lady injustice

					marcus
		its a foolish old cobra who doesnt
		recognize his own offspring
			he suddenly stops
			not feeling well
		i think i should ride now

maximus waves for marcus horse  it is brought up
several soldiers carefully help the old man into the
saddle  he is then tethered to the brace on his saddle
it is a slow graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the
emperor of rome

when at last he is strapped in he looks to maximus

					marcus
		so much for the glory of rome

without a word to his son marcus nods and the horse is
slowly lead away

commodus and maximus watch him go

					commodus
			neutral
		hes dying

a beat

					commodus
		poor old man

					maximus
			terse
		if youll excuse me highness

he turns and stalks away

ext  tent city  night

we see the roman encampment a sea of tents  hundreds of
campfires burn before the tents

int  hospital tent  night

maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of
the dead and dying  roman surgeons are working feverishly
to save lives  limbs are amputated the bloody stumps
quickly cauterized with hot irons  leeches and bronze
cups are employed for bloodletting to balance humours

anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent  wine amphoras
are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward
the patients  mostly though they just hold down the
writhing patients

maximus moves through the tent offering a word of comfort
here and there  all the wounded are delighted to see him

he goes to an older soldier gallus who has one wooden
hand  his other hand is bandaged

					maximus
		what gallus losing your other
		hand

					gallus
		aye general theyre going to make
		a bronze one for it  long fingers
		this time

					maximus
		and the women of your village will
		crave your touch even more

					gallus
		ah then you know the women of my
		village

maximus smiles and moves on

he stops at a young soldier valerius whose head has been
shaved  a hole has been bored into his skull to relieve
the pressure on his brain  the young soldier is dying

					maximus
		whats your name son

					valerius
		valerius general

					maximus
		the name suits you

					valerius
		why am i dying

a beat  maximus sits by his cot  he takes valerius
hand

					maximus
		youre dying because you love rome
		as i do

					valerius
		ive never been to rome

					maximus
		neither have i  rome for us lives
		here
			he touches his
			heart
		 its a thing inside us that came
		from our ancestors and that we give
		to our children

					valerius
		it must be glorious rome  ive
		only seen pictures  is it a
		glorious place

a beat

					maximus
		yes its a glorious place

					valerius
		it must be

he smiles  and he is dead

maximus sits for a moment  he gently closes valerius
eyes  and maximus finds that he is weeping

he is not ashamed of the tears

int  mess tent  night

an immediate swirl of noise  the grand mess tent is
crowded with soldiers  they are still filthy with caked
on mud and blood  wounds are bandaged and tankards are
raised in celebration of the victory

marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors
currently two senators falco and gaius are bowing before
him

					falco
		hail marcus aurelius

					marcus
		stand up senators  that unfamiliar
		posture doesnt suit you

					gaius
		we live in supplication to your
		glory

					marcus
		all the while conspiring with that
		fat man in rome  how is the old
		monster

					gaius
		senator gracchus is hale sire

					marcus
		still damning me to the four winds

					gaius
		still eager for your triumphant
		return to rome caesar

					marcus
		i would have silenced him decades
		ago  but i just like him too much

meanwhile maximus stands with his lieutenants titus and
quintus  a wound on maximus arm has been bound

					maximus
			to titus
		if you want to stay on i support
		you  so do the men  ill ask the
		emperor to appoint you in my place

					titus
		it wont be the felix regiment
		without you

					maximus
		ill return after a season at home
		maybe two

					quintus
		that means after three or four more
		babies

					titus
		and youll be too fat from vibias
		cooking to get on your horse by
		then

					maximus
		should the gods so bless me  i
		would be thankful

commodus perambulates up to them

					commodus
		hail warriors  my congratulations

					titus and quintus
			bowing
		highness

					commodus
			to maximus
		my old friend my father tells me
		youre returning to spain

					maximus
		yes

					commodus
		a pity  ill need men like you in
		my army

an awkward glance between the soldiers  this sort of talk
is offensively premature

					commodus
		there are larger division that might
		appeal to you  even the praetorian
		guard  youve never been to rome
		imagine arriving as head of the
		praetorians  they have really
		splendid uniforms

					maximus
			cold
		im going home

senators gaius and falco join them

					gaius
			to maximus
		 and why not apply for entry to
		the senate

					falco
		a war hero with a handsome face and
		a strong heart could go far

					commodus
		general maximus may i present
		senators gaius and falco  beware of
		this gaius hell pour a honeyed
		potion in your ear and youll wake
		up one day and all youll say is
		republic republic republic

laughter

					falco
		have you never considered rome

					maximus
		no

					commodus
		youve had my ear since we were
		children  you could be a valuable
		ally in the senate

					gaius
		are you a believer in republicanism

					commodus
			laughs
		there  i warned you

					maximus
		im a soldier not a politician

meanwhile a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden
slit in the tent wall  the eye is particularly drawn to
maximus

					gaius
		if your heart lies with the people
		i would back you for the senate
		im sure gracchus would as well

					commodus
		not a word about that sodomite
		bastard

					gaius
			smiles to maximus
		the august senator gracchus has been
		rather a gadfly on the flesh of the
		imperial family

					falco
		hes a damned provocateur

					gaius
		he lives under the antiquated
		assumption that the senate should
		represent the people with vigor

					commodus
		i wont tolerate it  his incessant
		criticism exhausts me  the man can
		speak for five hours without taking
		a breath

					gaius
		he serves rome best when he serves
		it with honesty

					commodus
			sharply
		enough maximus i would like to
		inspect the felix regiment at dawn
		please arrange it

					maximus
		i cant do that

					commodus
		excuse me

					maximus
		my men have been fighting for five
		solid days  theyre too busy dying
		to go on dress parade

a beat  commodus eyes flash fire at this public rebuke
he very quickly gets control

					commodus
			smiles
		of course how foolish of me  some
		other time

he notes his father being helped out of the tent by
several body slaves

					commodus
		caesar retires early tonight

int  tent corridor  night

marcus is helped out of the mess tent into a tent corridor
attached

he sees his daughter lucilla in the corridor spying in
through the slit in the tent wall  he watches her
smiles

					marcus
		if only you had been born a man

she turns to him  he leaves his body slaves and goes to
her

					lucilla
		father

					marcus
		what a caesar you would have made

					lucilla
		youre right

					marcus
		i think you would have been strong
		i wonder if you would have been
		just

					lucilla
		i would have been what you taught me
		to be

a beat  they stare at each other  he finally smiles

					marcus
		well pretend to be my loving
		daughter tonight and walk with me to
		my chamber

she smiles and takes his arm  they slowly walk down the
tent corridor as

					marcus
		this is a pleasant fiction isnt
		it

they disappear into darkness

ext  tent city  dawn

maximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets
the rome camp  he stops to observe an unusual sight

commodus is stripped almost naked his chiseled body
covered in a fine sheen of sweat  he and his six
centurion body guards are going through their daily
ritual  they defy the subzero temperatures and hack at
small trees with swords

it is an eerie zenlike workout  commodus intense
concentration is unnerving

maximus watches for a moment then moves on  he approaches
a large network of tents  he enters

int  marcus tent  day

maximus enters marcus darkened tent  flickering braziers
provide the only light in the enormous imperial tent
heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the
timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind

marcus stands before a map of the roman empire

					maximus
			bows
		caesar

marcus holds out a scroll

					marcus
		read this

					maximus
		i never acquired the art sir

					marcus
		of course  no matter  in this
		letter i denote my intention to
		nominate you to stand for the
		emperorship after my death

a stunned pause  maximus stares at him

					marcus
		my son is not a moral man  you have
		known this since you were young  he
		cannot rule

					maximus
		caesar i am honored but 

					marcus
		for twenty years i have been
		spilling blood  for twenty years i
		have written philosophy and
		ruminated and conquered  since i
		became caesar i have only had four
		years without war  four years of
		peace in twenty  so perhaps i can
		be forgiven

a long beat

					marcus
		while i have been fighting rome has
		grown mad and corpulent and
		diseased  i did this  and now i
		shall make it right

					maximus
		sire you brought the light of the
		gods to barbarian darkness  you
		brought civilization and justice to
		the farthest 

					marcus
			fierce
		i have brought the sword  nothing
		more  rome is far away and we
		shouldnt be here  what matter is
		it to the gods if we subdue one more
		tribe of parthians or gauls  what
		matter is it to rome if a thousand
		more barbarians bend to our lash

a beat

marcus sits  he doesnt look at maximus

a pause

					marcus
		winter maximus  its winter now

a beat

					marcus
		there was a dream that was rome  i
		can only whisper of it now
		anything more than a whisper and the
		dream vanishes  its so fragile
		the true glory of rome is in a very
		fragile idea  imagine a place
		devoted to the rights of the
		citizen  where every free man has a
		voice  that was the dream and i
		fear it will not survive the winter

he holds out a hand to maximus  maximus takes his hand
deeply moved kneeling

					marcus
		lets just whisper here you and i

					maximus
		yes caesar

					marcus
		if the dream is ever to live again
		the people must have a true voice
		the voice i took from them  that
		all the caesars took from them bit
		by bit conquest by conquest  and
		now that i am dying i am going to
		give them that voice again

					maximus
		youre not dying

					marcus
		i am maximus  its strange i
		find as i near the end i think
		little of the waning moments around
		me instead i think much of the
		past and of the future  how will
		the world speak my name in years to
		come  will i be known as the
		philosopher  the warrior  the
		tyrant  or will there be a more
		golden sounding to my name  will i
		be the emperor who gave rome back
		her freedom

a beat

					marcus
		before i die i will give the people
		this final gift  i will give them
		the senate reborn  the voice of the
		people empowered again as it was
		always meant to be  it is my design
		that they will elect the next
		emperor  and i would put forward
		your name with my backing

					maximus
		caesar you do me honor  but your
		son has pride of place for
		succession

					marcus
		you are the son i should have had
		although i fear in my deepest heart
		that if you had truly been my son my
		blood would have polluted you as it
		did commodus  were a cursed
		bloodline  we have lived so long in
		power and depravity that we no
		longer remember a life without it
		we can no longer even imagine a life
		without it

a beat

					marcus
		look at me son

maximus looks at him

					marcus
		son i know that one grove of your
		vineyard is worth more to you than
		all the treasures of rome  i know
		one loving word from your wife is
		worth more than the accolades of an
		empire  but a fond old man who
		loves you more than he can say begs
		you to at least think about what he
		has said tonight

					maximus
		i shall caesar

a beat

					marcus
		ill keep this letter to myself  i
		hope that with the sunrise you will
		agree  and embrace me as a father

maximus nods and rises  he begins to go  stops

					maximus
		you have always been my father

he goes

int  tent corridor  day

maximus emerges from marcus tent into a long tent
corridor deep in thought

					lucillas voice
		he always favored you

he turns  lucilla is waiting  she glides to him

					lucilla
		even over his son

					maximus
			turning away
		thats not true

					lucilla
		maximus stop
			he stops
		let me see your face

he turns to her

					lucilla
		youve been crying

					maximus
		i lost too many men

					lucilla
		what does my father intend

he turns and walks  she walks with him

					maximus
		i dont know

					lucilla
		youre lying  i could tell when you
		were lying even when we were
		children  you hate it

					maximus
		i never acquired your comfort with
		it

					lucilla
		true  but then you never had to
		maximus stop
			he stops again
		 is it really so terrible seeing
		me again

					maximus
		no  im sorry  im tired from the
		battle

					lucilla
		and you are hurt to see my father
		dying

a beat

					lucilla
		he will announce commodus
		succession  thats why he summoned
		us  will you serve my brother as
		you served his father

					maximus
		i will always serve the ideals of
		rome

a beat

					lucilla
		do you know i still remember you in
		my prayers  oh yes i pray
		ever since that day you saved me
		from drowning off capri  do you
		remember

					maximus
		yes

					lucilla
		commodus was so angry that a mere
		peasant  a spaniard no less 
		touched the royal person do you
		remember his anger

					maximus
		yes

					lucilla
		mark this maximus  that is the man
		who will be emperor

a beat

					maximus
		may i be permitted to go highness

she smiles sadly

					lucilla
		there was a time when you didnt
		call me highness

					maximus
		and there was a time when you were
		just a little girl drowning in the
		sea  all that was a different life

					lucilla
			quietly
		very different i wonder if it was
		better

					maximus
		it was more honest

a moment between them  we sense there is much to be said
much that could be said

finally

					maximus
		i thank you for your prayers

he goes  she watches him walk away

int  maximus tent  night

maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent  he faces
six small figures that represent his dead ancestors

					maximus
		ancestors true bloodline i ask you
		for your guidance  bring me your
		solace and your wisdom  blessed
		mother come to me in my dreams with
		the gods desire for my future
		blessed father watch over my wife
		and my son with a ready sword  keep
		them safe until my return  whisper
		to them in their sleep that i live
		only to hold them again and all else
		is dust and air  ancestors true
		bloodline i honor you and will try
		to live with the dignity you have
		taught me

he looks at his ancestors for a moment and then blows
out the candles around them

int  marcus tent  night

commodus eyes are red with weeping  he sits head down
at the foot of marcus bed and speaks to his father

					commodus
			quietly
		i search the faces of the gods for
		ways to please you to make you
		proud and i can never do it  one
		kind word  one full hug where you
		pressed me to your chest and held me
		tight  would have been like the
		sun on my heart for a thousand
		years what is it in me you hate
		so much  my eyes are your eyes  my
		hands are your hands  all i have
		ever wanted was to live up to you
		caesar  father

he stands  we see that he is holding the scroll denoting
marcus intention to nominate maximus as emperor to the
senate  commodus cannot control his tears

					commodus
		why does maximus deserve what i
		could never have  why do you love
		his eyes over mine  i would
		butcher the whole world  if you
		would only love me

commodus weeps

int  maximus tent  night

quintus is waking maximus 

					quintus
		general  maximus 

					maximus
		quintus  

					quintus
		the emperor needs you  its urgent

maximus leaps up and throws on a cloak strides out with
quintus

ext  tent city  night

dead of night  maximus and quintus stride quickly through
the sleeping camp toward marcus tent

					maximus
		what is it  is he ill

					quintus
		i dont know

they continue on toward marcus tent

int  marcus tent  night

maximus and quintus stride into the tent  maximus slams
to a halt  stunned

commodus stands before him  lucilla stands in a corner of
the tent head down

and marcus aurelius dead lying on his bed

maximus stares at marcus

					commodus
		lament with me brother our great
		father is dead  i want 

maximus not even hearing steps past him to marcus

he stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before
marcus and gently kisses the old mans forehead  a ritual
farewell

a moment of silent mourning and then maximus stands  he
turns very very slowly to commodus

					commodus
		general the gods have taken the
		great man and left me alone  my
		first desire as emperor is that you
		take my hand in friendship  i need
		you at my side maximus at this
		moment above all others  stand with
		me

maximus glares at him

					maximus
		how did he die

commodus does not respond

					maximus
		how did he die

					commodus
		the surgeons say it was his breath
		that gave out

maximus glances to lucilla she avoids his eyes

					commodus
		take my hand maximus  i only offer
		it once

a beat

maximus turns back to marcus

					maximus
		how will the world speak your name
		now old man

without a glance to commodus he stalks out

a silent beat  then commodus nods to quintus  quintus
goes

lucilla looks at commodus for a long moment her face an
enigmatic tornado of complex emotions

then

					lucilla
		hail caesar

int  maximus tent  night

maximus is kneeling before his ancestors head down his
fists clenched praying

quintus and four praetorian assassins suddenly burst in 
the assassins move immediately to bind maximus  swords
at his throat 

					maximus
		what  

					quintus
			ashamed
		please dont fight maximus 

					maximus
		quintus 

quintus goes to maximus armor which hangs nearby and
slowly removes his seal of office

					quintus
		im sorry general caesar has
		spoken

they pull maximus out 

ext  maximus tent  tent city  night

five horses are waiting

					maximus
		quintus what  

					quintus
			anguish
		i have no choice 

they are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty
praetorians who gallop past  maximus knows immediately
what this means

					maximus
			suddenly
		my family

a beat

					maximus
		what about my family quintus

					quintus
			quietly
		they will greet you in the
		afterlife

maximus lunges at him  the praetorians subdue him 
slamming him with a sword hilt  knocking him
unconscious

					quintus
			quietly to
			assassins
		take him as far as the sunrise and
		then kill him

ext  forest road  dawn

the four praetorian assassins lead maximus along a road
he sits slumped in his saddle drained

					assassin 1
		all right this is far enough

the three other assassins climb from their horses
assassin 2 pushes maximus from his horse  he falls to
the ground hard

					assassin 1
		you two take him down there where no
		one will find him

					assassin 3
		come on general

assassin 3 and assassin 4 drag maximus down a densely
forested hill along the road  maximus hands are still
bound in front of him  he seems totally lacking in any
resistance

ext  forest  below the road  dawn

maximus eyes the two assassins as they troop down the
hill away from the road he notes their sparkling armor
the armor of men who have never seen real battle

					maximus
		have you ever done this before

					assassin 3
		what

					maximus
		killed a man with a sword

					assassin 3
		not like this exactly this is
		good you can stop

they stop  they are far down the hill out of sight of
the road

					maximus
		it can be very messy  you could
		get blood all over your armor  you
		dont want to hack me up now  you
		want one clean stroke

					assassin 3
		would you kneel general

maximus kneels his whole body secretly coiling  assassin
3 stands over him as

					maximus
		one good stroke  you do know
		where dont you

					assassin 4
		be quiet

					maximus
		if you miss the spot therell be
		blood everywhere  quite a spray

					assassins 3
		all right where

					maximus
		here  you dont want to hit the
		vein on the neck 

maximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of
his neck

					maximus
		put the point of your sword here
		you want one good blow right at
		this spot 

assassin 3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the
spot on maximus neck

a grave mistake

maximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his
hands and yanks it from assassin 3  exploding up  his
hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air
and catches it  swings the sword with brutal efficiency
 decapitating both assassins 

ext  forest road  dawn

on the road above the other two assassins are on their
horses waiting

they hear a quick yelp from below  and then nothing

assassin 1 nods for assassin 2 to check on the
execution  assassin 2 canters off the road and down the
hill

ext  forest  below the road  dawn

assassin 2 canters down the hillside

he senses movement behind him  spins around drawing his
sword  too late 

maximus throws a sword  it flashes through the air 
and into assassin 2

ext  forest road  dawn

assassin 1 waits on his horse  he hears the commotion
below  spins his horse around just as maximus bursts to
the road  he stands with a sword

assassin 1 spurs his horse and gallops toward maximus at
full speed  maximus crouches and prepares 

assassin 1 and maximus swirl together for an instant 
both slashing brutally 

assassin 1 continues to gallop past maximus  he stops
he looks down  a wound in his stomach  he falls off his
horse  dead

maximus has also been wounded  a deep gash on his side
he fights the pain as he moves toward the horses

ext  forest road  day

maximus is galloping through the forest at lightning
speed leading four horses behind him  the gash in his
side bleeding

ext  tent city  day

a gloomy day  emperor commodus stands before the
assembled felix regiment

the soldiers are already uneasy  they note quintus
standing by commodus wearing maximus seal of office
where is maximus

					commodus
		even as the gods curse this dark day
		with clouds so too does the sun
		begin to shine forth on a promised
		tomorrow  even as we mourn the
		passing of our father so too do we
		celebrate the coming of a bright
		new age for rome  at my side
		brothers you shall pull fresh
		glories from the heavens  at my
		side brothers you shall know the
		adoration of the gods  doublydark
		is this day because my friend your
		noble commander maximus meridas has
		been called to rome to deal with
		urgent matters of state

titus glances quickly to gallus whose hand is bandaged
from surgery  they know this cannot be true

					commodus
		until his promised return i
		appointed quintus domitian to serve
		in his stead  i salute you
		legionnaires

					quintus
			raising his sword
		hail caesar

the felix regiment responds many unsure

					felix regiment
		hail caesar

commodus strides off and the felix regiment slowly
disbands muttering to one another in confusion

titus and gallus go to quintus

					titus
		quintus what is  

					quintus
			firmly
		dont speak of it  never speak of
		it

he stalks off  titus and gallus concerned watch him
follow after commodus

int  maximus tent  day

lucilla stands in maximus tent  she looks around  she
gently touches his lorica segmentata  her fingertips move
along the contours of his armor  she tries to retain her
neutral demeanor

she notes his ancestors on the small alter

ext  hillside  night

maximus continues to gallop he is on a different horse
he leads only two horses now

ext  vineyard  day

maximus home in spain is beautiful beyond measure

we see verdant farmlands and vineyards and a spacious
house nestled amid gently rolling hills

maximus eightyearold son is in a paddock playing with
his pony  he stops sees something  over a hill he can
just glimpse a battle flag approaching

he screams with joy and runs toward the flag as he calls

					maximus son
		mother  mother  fathers home

maximus wife emerges from the house drying her hands on
a cloth and smiles

maximus son races toward the flag  he can just see the
soldiers beginning to appear over the hill  not a roman
legion at all  twenty praetorians canter over the hill

maximus son stops confused

ext  olive grove  day

maximus is galloping up a hill leading only one horse
now  the horse he is on is exhausted spent foam coats
its neck  it cant make it

the horse collapses and maximus falls  he immediately
leaps onto the remaining horse and continues riding up the
hill

ext  hills around vineyard  sunset

maximus is racing over the countryside galloping in a
frenzy  his wound is bleeding profusely coating the side
of his horse

he rears the horse to a stop for a moment  over a hill he
can see thick black smoke rising  he spurs the horse and
gallops over the hill

ext  vineyard  sunset

and his worst nightmares are realized

his home and his vineyards have been destroyed  the earth
has been scorched and his house is still smoldering  he
rides up to the house and practically falls off the horse

he pulls himself up and walks past the smoldering debris
of his house fearing what he knows he will find

he sees the bodies of servants scattered about in the
ruins  he sees a praetorian battle flag

he continues on his wound bleeding more with every
tortured step  he finally stops  he stares up

his wife and his son have been crucified and burnt  they
are nothing more than grotesquely twisted charred shapes

maximus instantly collapses to his knees  he howls out
his torment in a heartrending keen of despair as he coats
his face in the ashes of his dead world  he sinks into
unconsciousness praying for death

ext  vineyard  day

an unusual jingling sound is heard  maximus appears to be
dead his gaping wound beginning to fester

the source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the
feet of bedouin brigands with delicate anklets shuffling
around him  a hand touches his sandals  rich sandals
another touches his tunic  good cloth

suddenly maximus groans  the hands stop  hes alive  a
bit of quick language in an unknown tongue

then the hands grab maximus and drag him away

ext  slave wagon train  day

maximus eyes slowly open 

inches away from his face  a lion roars 

maximus lurches back

he looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon
three other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape
exotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the
wagons  lions panthers zebras a giraffe  a dozen
slaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and
other cargo  bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal
babel of foreign tongues

and someone is looking at him  juba a striking african
is gazing at him impassively as he chews something  juba
is also chained

					maximus
			weakly
		am i in hades

					juba
		yes

juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and
moves to maximus

					juba
		for your wound

maximus stares at him

					juba
			nods
		for your wound

maximus looks down  the bloody wound at his side

juba carefully places his poultice over the wound 
maximus hisses in pain  juba massages the poultice into
the wound gently as

					juba
		if you die in the wagons they feed
		you to the lions the lions are
		worth more than we are  i think we
		are worth more than the zebras
		though  so they dont feed us to
		them

maximus stares at him  juba looks down at him with the
barest hint of a smile

					juba
		im not sure about the giraffe

ext  slave market  day

the heat of morocco is unlike anything maximus has ever
known  shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand

the provincial market is bustling like the proverbial
anthill  slave traders and dealers and merchants move
around all talking very quickly and very emphatically

maximus juba and a number of other slaves are on display
poked and prodded and fondled  their bedouin slave trader
sings out their praises to any passers

the crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival
of proximo  proximo is a large man of immense appetites
he has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate  two
slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with
switches

					slave trader
		proximo my old friend see what i
		have for you today  

proximo slams a fist into the slave traders face  the
slave trader sails back

					proximo
		those giraffes you sold me wont
		mate  all they do is run around not
		mating  you sold me eunuch
		giraffes

the slave trader pulls himself up hugely obsequious

					slave trader
		i will make it up to you master
		its bargain day for you  look
		look look  i have two lions and a
		panther  hear how they roar for
		you  bring me home proximo

proximo examines the animals

					proximo
		how much for the lot

					slave trader
		for you  8000 sesterces

					proximo
		for me  6000 sesterces and i want
		to see their balls first  and you
		throw in those two slaves

					slave trader
			moves to maximus
		what about this one  look at the
		arms

proximo moves to maximus  the slave trader forces open
maximus mouth

					proximo
		good teeth 

proximo notes the many old battle scars on maximus body

					proximo
		where did you get those scars   

maximus doesnt respond

					proximo
		are you a soldier

maximus doesnt respond

					proximo
		do you speak 
			he roars back to a
			slave
		keep those damn flies off me
			back to maximus
		hes dying

					slave trader
		1000 sesterces

					proximo
		my ass
			moves to juba
		you throw in this one and well make
		it 7000 sesterces for the whole
		lot

					slave trader
		i have to eat master  hes my
		finest i couldnt let him go as
		part of the lot for less than 9000
		total
			back to maximus
		i tell you this one is prime  hes
		a spaniard and killed fourteen of my
		men before he could be subdued

proximo looks at maximus notes the many battle scars
again  the scars and something he senses in maximus
eyes is enough for proximo to consider it

					proximo
			to trader
		all right lets see

the slave trader and his colleagues grab maximus and
bustle him across the market unlocking his chains
maximus has no idea whats going on

in the center of the market place a veritable giant of a
man sits on a small stool a wooden sword in his hand  he
is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot
chain shackled to his ankle  a think metal helmet is
riveted around his entire head only long turfs of hair
emerging  his dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in
the helmet

the slave trader puts a wooden sword in maximus hand and
shoves him toward the giant  the giant stands  he towers
over maximus

the giant suddenly swings his sword  he moves with
remarkable quickness  maximus makes no attempt to block
the blow  it sends him flying to the ground

maximus pulls himself up

the giant moves in and hits him again  maximus recoils
 the giant hits him again  maximus falls

maximus pulls himself up

the giant moves in again  he slams him a few more times
 maximus makes no attempt to protect himself  he
falls

maximus pulls himself up

the giant is about to attack again 

					proximo
			to slave trader
		thats enough

					slave trader
		stop  stop

his colleagues race into the ring and haul the giant away
from maximus  the giant quietly sits back on his stool

proximo studies maximus for a moment and then glances to
the slave trader

					proximo
		ill give you 500 sesterces

					slave trader
		no  no  1000

					proximo
			laughs
		come dont quibble with your old
		friend  ill take the lions the
		panther the numidian and this one
		for 7000  and ill buy you the
		best whore in the town for two
		nights  shes an enormous mountain
		of flesh who craves a stern hand

					slave trader
		how could i say no to my old friend
		proximo

ext  proximos school  day

maximus and juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten
other slaves including a very scared and reedy scribe
other wagons are filled with exotic animals including
several lions

the wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken
through an imposing set of gates to

ext  proximos school  compound  day

an open compound in proximos school  on one side of the
compound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of
every description  including proximos two hapless
giraffes

proximos house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased
exotic animals into cages as maximus and the new slaves
are unloaded  heavily armed guards supervise everything

but proximos slaves are having a bit of a problem with
one of the new lions  it growls and resists them

without the slightest hesitation proximo thunders to the
lion and grabs it by the mane  manhandling it into a
cage

					proximo
		come on you filthy beast

he kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the
cage

proximos provincial school resembles nothing so much as a
seedy prison  the fading grandeur of the decaying
battlements and the sweeping north african architecture
only slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place

and if maximus had any doubts as to proximos profession
 all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound

twenty gladiators are working out in the compound 
hacking at practice dummies and sparring  the many
heavily armed guards oversee everything  the gladiators
stop working out as they see the new slaves enter  they
eye their potential new opponents warily

one huge glowering gladiator  vibius  watches with
particular interest  his eye is quickly drawn to the most
obvious athlete  juba

the new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound
and house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of
water on them cleaning them

meanwhile proximo shrugs off his cloak  a slave brings
him wine as he give his welcoming speech to the new
slaves

					proximo
		slaves  i am proximo trainer of
		gladiators  you live and die at my
		pleasure  fight well and you will
		live  fight poorly and you will
		die  it is better to live

slaves now toss thick handfuls of powdered lime on the new
slaves  they cough and clench their eyes shut the lime
coats and stings their wet bodies

					proximo
		here you will be trained in the art
		of combat  here you will be given
		the tools to survive  please my
		patrons in the arena and all the
		gifts of the world will be showered
		upon you  imagine riches beyond
		your paltry dreams of riches
		imagine fame beyond your rude
		understanding of the word  all this
		can belong to the select few who
		prove their worth in the arena

slaves throw more water on the new slaves  washing off
the lime

					proximo
		if on the other hand you
		disappoint me you will be
		dismembered and fed to my jackals
		limb by limb

he gazes evenly at his new acquisitions

					proximo
		and my jackals are always hungry

he strides off and the guards shove the new gladiators
toward their cells

int  proximos school  maximus cell  night

maximus and juba share a small filthy cell  the cell
door faces the open compound  across the compound they
can see the much more comfortable cells of the star
gladiators such as vibius

they both sit on the floor leaning against the wall
juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon
maximus bowl and spoon are at his side he has not
touched them

					juba
		have you killed a man before

maximus does not respond

					juba
		you should eat  youll need your
		strength tomorrow

maximus does not respond

					juba
		ive never killed a man  but i
		think you have

maximus does not respond

					juba
		i almost killed once  the romans
		destroyed my village  i was with a
		hunting party and when we
		returned i would have killed
		every roman in the world

a long beat

					juba
		if you dont eat you will die

maximus does not respond

a beat

					juba
		in the village i come from there was
		a man once  he went fishing one day
		and his boat was attacked by
		crocodiles  one of them ate his
		leg  he pulled himself to the shore
		and a lion attacked him  it ate one
		of his arms  he dragged himself
		through the desert on the way home
		and a scorpion stung his eye  so he
		only had one eye  when he reached
		the village i sat with him  i said
		you have lost a leg an arm and one
		eye  you must have a mighty will to
		live  he said no lord its
		just better than the alternative

maximus finally looks at him

					juba
		life is a gift from our fathers to
		us  who are you to give it up for
		lack of lifting a spoon

maximus does not respond

ext  proximos school  compound  night

maximus and juba are being observed  proximo stands in
the shadows of the compound and watches intently

ext  slave wagon  provincial streets  day

blood appears to be flowing across an oxens back  but
the blood is too rich too red

the oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the
crowded streets of the town  hanging above the street is
dyed wool drying in the sun  vermilion and crimson dyes
drip down and splash across the oxen  and splash across
the gladiators

maximus juba the formidable vibius are chained in the
back of the wagon  also the frightened scribe

proximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon  proximo
has an umbrella over him colored with years of dripping
dyes

they pass a banner honoring vibius the star of proximos
stable

meanwhile the terrified scribe is almost weeping
chattering nervously to vibius chained next to him

					scribe
		i know nothing of armaments and
		warfare  im a scribe  i write
		down words  i can write down seven
		languages 

					vibius
		be still

					scribe
		i dont  how do you hold the
		sword  ive never held a sword

					vibius
		you point the sharp end at your
		opponent and you shove it in his
		guts

					scribe
		i cant  i 

he suddenly vomits

					vibius
			calling to proximo
		proximo  you insult me with this
		carrion  chain him to someone else

					proximo
			calling back
		dont worry noble vibius he wont
		be bothering you for long

the scribe begins to weep

the crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators
occasionally throwing trash at them  a pack of children
run alongside the wagon chanting

					children
		dead guts  dead guts  dead guts

maximus watches the children for a moment and then another
sight draws his attention  over some buildings he can see
vultures circling in the distance

ext  provincial arena  dugout  day

in the cramped holding area of the arena a dugout beneath
the stands maximus and the other gladiators are waiting

proximo walks before them giving a final pep talk  he
gazes at them evenly his eyes going from face to face

					proximo
		some of you say you cant fight you
		wont fight they all say that
		but one day you will pick up a sword
		and thrust it into another man  and
		the crowd will cheer you and love
		you  and you will love them for it
		on that day you will be a
		gladiator

he stops at maximus

					proximo
		in this life we all die  all we
		can choose is how we die  and how
		we are remembered  be remembered
		proudly

drums are heard from the arena  proximo nods to a waiting
blacksmith

the blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiators
wrists  chaining them together in teams of two by a
chain about four feet long

the blacksmith is about to chain maximus to the scribe

					proximo
		no
			he points to juba
		 give the spaniard to him  give
		the scribe to vibius

proximo nods to vibius who for reasons we shall soon
see makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering
scribe

proximo watches the blacksmith shackle maximus and juba
together and then strides off

					juba
			to maximus
		are we going to fight each other

ext  provincial arena  day

proximo sits in a box with several other gladiator
trainers  they drink wine and eat constantly  a
perpetual chatter of wagers and odds and side bets

the arena is only sparsely attended this day

					proximo
		make it 600 sesterces for each
		decapitation

					trainer 1
		how many strokes

					proximo
		two

					trainer 1
		for the great vibius one stroke

					proximo
		done  400 sesterces for two
		strokes

in the arena

proximos chained teams enter the arena five teams
maximus and juba are chained together  some of the small
crowd cheers for vibius  he acknowledges the cheers  he
is chained to the weeping scribe

in the box

trainer 1 laughs

					trainer 1
			re vibius
		whos he with

					proximo
		a greek scribe

					trainer 1
		ill raise the wager

					proximo
			smiles
		give me odds friend

in the arena

from the opposite end of the arena a dozen armored very
scary andabatae thunder into the arena  some of the crowd
cheers

the andabatae immediately race for the chained teams and
the battle is on

vibius spins into action  dragging the weeping scribe
after him as he circles opponents and fights  the scribe
is almost instantly killed  vibius immediately hacks
through the scribes wrist and frees himself as proximo
surely intended  vibius is now free to fight alone
swinging the chain as an additional weapon

jubas eyes dart everywhere as he tries to move with
maximus  maximus neither helps nor hinders  allowing
juba to pull him along 

proximo now that his star vibius is safe watched maximus
and juba closely

juba fights well with a strange elegance his body
flowing like liquid  but he is inexperienced  he
strikes a few blows and then tries to move away  finally
he is in trouble  cornered  a huge andabata is slicing
at him  it is a desperate battle  juba is losing 
his sword is slammed away  the andabata raises his sword
for the kill 

and maximus strikes

with a sudden roar he explodes into action  he swings
past juba and blocks the blow meant for juba  then he
slashes the andabata  killing him  he pulls juba after
him as he fights 

it is a dazzling display of maximus skill  he moves
through the andabatae at amazing speed  spinning around
juba and protecting him  slashing ruthlessly  pulling
juba after him and commanding the battle  juba recovers
a sword and they fight together

in the box

proximo watches smiles  a gladiator is born

ext  rome  wagon  day

senator gracchus an imposing moral and corpulent man in
his 60s is riding in a luxurious wagon with senator
gaius

and captain marcellus the handsome head of the roman city
guard

their wagon slowly maneuvers through the crowded streets
of rome  the cosmopolitan bustle of the great urban
center is everywhere around them

					gracchus
		we have plague in the hebrew quarter
		and it is spreading we have
		looting at the granaries we have
		so much filth in the tiber that the
		water is undrinkable we have
		praetorian guard units that are
		demanding protection payments from
		the merchants at the exchange 

					marcellus
		my city guard units have tried to
		curtail these excesses but no
		constabulary can police the entire
		city  and the praetorians outnumber
		us two to one

					gracchus
		rome dies as the emperor plays at
		beneficence  at least nero gave us
		music

					gaius
		do you think hell listen to us

					gracchus
		it is his duty to hear the will of
		the senate

their wagon stops  hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic
jam of chariots wagons and sedan chairs

					gracchus
		not to mention the damn traffic

int  palace  throne room  day

emperor commodus is standing before a group of male
children and their tutors in his throne room

the throne room is still very much the province of his
father  manuscripts and astronomical charts and papyrus
scrolls and wax tablets litter the heavy desk  a large
bust of marcus aurelius is in one corner

lucilla and senator falco are present  so too senators
gracchus and gaius and captain marcellus

a wellrehearsed child presents commodus with a laurel
wreath

					child
		we honor caesar with the laurel to
		show our love and appreciation for
		his benevolence

					commodus
		caesar is honored to accept your
		tribute citizen scholar

the child smiles and moves back to his fellows

					commodus
			to all
		it is the most sacred duty of the
		emperor to oversee the education of
		the young  if i could leave no
		other legacy than the scholarship of
		all children my life would be
		blessed  tutors you hold the
		future of rome in your hands  teach
		them well so that they will bring
		honor to the empire  i salute you

commodus actually bows before them an unimaginable honor

the tutors bow in response and herd the children out

					commodus
		look at them senators my truest
		gift to rome

					gracchus
		darling children to be sure now if
		i may proceed

					commodus
			sighs
		very well

commodus moves to the desk standing over it and gazing at
marcus scrolls as

					gracchus
		caesar your presence in rome is an
		invaluable opportunity to begin
		correcting some of the ills that
		have beset the city since your
		father went to the wars  we would
		like to 

					commodus
		peace good gracchus peace

commodus slowly begins pushing marcus papyrus scrolls off
the desk to the floor one by one as

					commodus
		my beloved father was a careless
		shepherd to his flock  i shall be a
		good father to my children  i shall
		remain in rome and show them how
		they are loved

					gracchus
		with respect sire the people dont
		need love  they need law  the
		senate has prepared a series of
		protocols to begin addressing the
		corruption in the city 
			gaius hands him a
			scroll
		 starting with basic sanitation in
		the hebrew quarter  if caesar could
		study this and 

					commodus
		you see thats the very problem
		isnt it my old old friend  my
		father spent all his time at study
		at books and learning and
		philosophy

as commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk
tries it doesnt like it nods to a slave  the chair is
whisked away

					commodus
		he spent his twilight hours reading
		scrolls from the senate  all the
		while the people were forgotten

					gracchus
		the senate is the people

					commodus
		i doubt many of the people eat so
		well as you do senator gracchus

as commodus speaks he moves to the bust of marcus studies
it doesnt like it nods to a slave and the bust is
whisked away  lucilla watches this closely

					commodus
		i doubt many of the people have such
		splendid armor captain marcellus
		or such fine mistresses senator
		gaius  no only their true father
		knows what the people need  i shall
		show them they are loved  i shall
		hold them to my bosom and embrace
		them tightly 

					gracchus
		have you ever embraced someone dying
		of plague sire

commodus stops  looks at him  a lethal moment

					commodus
		no  but if you interrupt me one
		more time i assure you that you
		shall  i will emulate the immortal
		caesars of the past  i will give
		the people what they truly want
		starting this day i will draw all of
		rome to the colosseum  i will give
		them bread  and they will want
		nothing more

startled looks between gracchus gaius and marcellus

					gracchus
		you want to hold games

					commodus
		not just any games senator  a
		series of games that will make the
		gods envious and leave my children
		happy  i will subsidize the arena
		from this day forth  and i will
		culminate this celebration in a
		great spectacle the likes of which
		the world has never seen  a great
		spectacle to honor my father
		magnificent unending weeks of
		festivity all in the name of marcus
		aurelius

a beat

					gracchus
		if i may caesar how are you
		going to pay for this

					commodus
		that is not your concern

gracchus ignores a warning look from gaius

					gracchus
		respectfully sire taxation and
		import duties are the exclusive
		province of the senate 

commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral
violence that everyone is shocked 

					commodus
		my father deserves to be honored and
		i will honor him  and the people
		will love me  and the senate will
		obey me or every one of you will
		burn  burn  burn  i will have
		order

he snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away
senator falco quickly follows

a dreadful silence

then

					lucilla
		gentlemen in the future do not
		concern my brother with these
		matters  come to me

she sweeps out

a beat

					marcellus
		games  he wants to hold games

					gaius
		its madness

					gracchus
		no its not

a beat

					gracchus
		he knows who rome is  rome is the
		mob  he will conjure magic for them
		and they will be distracted  and he
		will takes their lives  and he will
		take their freedom  and still they
		will roar  the beating heart of
		rome isnt the marble of the senate
		its the sand of the colosseum  he
		will give them death  and they will
		love him for it

int  provincial arena  dugout  tunnels  day

maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and
cramped serpentine trenchlike tunnels that lead to the
arena

we dont really see maximus well in the dark tunnels

proximo scurries to keep up with him  they brush past
gladiators who line the walls  some are wounded some are
being attended to by surgeons some are shellshocked
some are nervously waiting to go on whispering prayers

we twist and turn in the tunnels with proximo and maximus
as

					proximo
			quickly
		ive wagered on you against the
		celts  ignore the others and go
		for them  there are two axeand
		net and two long spear  now the
		celts arent used to the sun so you
		have the advantage there

the roar of the crowd is growing they are nearing the
arena

					proximo
		and keep them moving their lungs
		arent strong ground the spears as
		soon as you can and then go for the
		axmen  if you get all four theres
		an extra bonus so dont be
		distracted by the spartans

without a word to proximo or a moments hesitation
maximus strides into the arena

ext  provincial arena  day

we continue with maximus as he strides into the roaring
arena

we finally see him in the blazing sunlight  he wears
traditional gladiator armor and now has longer hair and a
beard 

a battle is already in progress fighting and dead and
dying gladiators crowd the arena 

we stay with maximus as he wades through his opponents
fighting them heroically slashing through them without
stopping 

the large crowd cheers mightily  chants of spaniard
spaniard  spaniard

we stay with maximus as he cuts through the four celts
like a scythe through wheat and then we dramatically pull
up and away 

taking in the roaring arena and the hero

ext  proximos school  compound  night

a large mess area has been set up  the tables around the
compound are crowded with gladiators  guards everywhere

maximus and juba enter  move to get food  all
conversation gradually drains away as the other gladiators
watch them  silence

maximus and juba note the strange silence as they move to
a large table

vibius is at the table with a number of other gladiators
there are no places for maximus and juba

vibius stands and kicks two other gladiators off their
bench

					vibius
		move aside  this is a table for
		men

maximus and juba sit

vibius remains standing  he begins to pound on the table
with his fist  soon all the gladiators are pounding on
their tables  it is a cacophonous din honoring maximus

int  proximos school  proximos chamber  night

proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound
sipping wine  various gladiators can be seen working out
below

a guard brings maximus  proximo nods for the guard to
leave

					proximo
			holding up a plate
		butterfly

the plate is filled with honeyed butterflies their wings
still moving slightly

maximus shakes his head  proximo pops one into his mouth
he chews as he looks at maximus

					proximo
		perhaps youd like a woman

maximus shakes his head

					proximo
		boy

maximus shakes his head

a beat

					proximo
		gold

maximus shakes his head

					proximo
		well i have nothing left to offer
		you  a man who turns down a
		butterfly a woman a boy and gold
		confuses me  personally id grab
		them all and then grab some more
		because the gods are fanciful and
		take us at their whim  does the
		spaniard have any needs

maximus shakes his head

a beat  proximo studies him

					proximo
		you fight like a soldier  you have
		wounds like a soldier who has been
		on long campaigns  you eye the
		world around you like an enemy
		what is your name roman soldier

					maximus
		gladiator

a beat

					proximo
		and nothing more

					maximus
		nothing more

a beat

proximo watches maximus very closely for the following

					proximo
		in two days we leave for rome

maximus eyes suddenly flash to proximo  he is
transfixed his eyes burning

					proximo
		ah so its rome you want  well
		you shall have her gladiator  the
		new emperor has ordered a series of
		matches to culminate in a grand
		spectacle  if you do well i shall
		become very very rich  if you do
		well enough i shall set you free
		is it freedom you want

a beat

maximus shakes his head

					proximo
			quietly
		not even that

					maximus
			barely controlled
		the emperor  will he be there

					proximo
		oh yes  hes apparently quite mad
		about the games  spending a
		fortune which is needless to say
		good for me again  but what is good
		for you gladiator

					maximus
		have you  how does one meet the
		emperor

					proximo
		as a gladiator

					maximus
		yes

					proximo
		one doesnt

a beat  proximo sees that maximus mind is racing

					proximo
		except if one has proven oneself
		in battle  if at the end of the
		games you are the final man standing
		 the emperor will present you with
		a small wooden sword  the sword is
		your freedom

					maximus
		he give it personally

					proximo
		he did to me
			maximus is surprised
			at this
		our great father marcus aurelius
		looked into my eyes and touched me
		on the shoulder

					maximus
		you knew marcus

					proximo
		i didnt know him  he touched me on
		the shoulder  just once  but that
		was enough

a beat

					proximo
		all right gladiator  we shall go
		to rome together and have bloody
		adventures  the great whore will
		suckle us until we are fat and happy
		and cant suck another drop  that
		is rome

int ext  slave wagon  outside rome  evening

maximus is crouched in the back of an enclosed slave wagon
with vibius juba and a few other gladiators

in the distance rome

int  palace  commodus bedroom  night

commodus sits on his bed rubbing his aching head
lucilla is preparing a drink for him a medicinal tonic

					commodus
		all my desires are splitting my head
		to pieces  theres so much i want
		to do  but all my efforts to show
		my children they are loved go
		unappreciated by those dragons in
		the senate 

					lucilla
			mixing tonic
		quiet brother

unseen by him she adds a little special powder to the
drink from a vial secreted in her robe

					lucilla
		leave the senate to me  dont
		trouble yourself

					commodus
		all i want is to be a good father to
		my people  why dont they
		understand that

she goes to him

					lucilla
		shhh  the tonic will help

she takes a sip and then hands it to him

					lucilla
		yes just drink this down

she sits on the edge of the bed  he drinks as

					commodus
		i must take a firmer hand with them
		they must know their father can be
		firm  as our father was firm with
		us

					lucilla
		our father lost his way  his
		mistake was believing the old songs
		of the republic  we know better
		so let the senate talk  they have
		no real power

					commodus
		yes yes you always know the
		way  you were always so wise in
		these matters
			he takes her hand
		you know if i didnt have my duty to
		rome i think i should be an artist
		i should go away and paint pictures
		of the sea and leave all the
		politics to you

a beat  he is sleepy he lies back on his bed

					commodus
		will you stay with me

					lucilla
			smiles gently
		still afraid of the dark brother

					commodus
		still  always

a beat

					commodus
		my dreams would terrify the world

a beat

					lucilla
		ill stay with you until you are
		asleep

					commodus
			falling asleep
		and after just sit with me  keep
		me safe

he is asleep

she watches him for a moment and then rises

she goes

int  palace  hallway  night

lucilla moves down a long corridor in the palace and blows
out candles as she goes

she finally arrives at her own chamber and enters

int  palace  lucillas chambers  night

senators gracchus and gaius and captain marcellus are
waiting

					lucilla
		hes asleep  be quick

					gracchus
		weve taking a sounding the senate
		is with us

					lucilla
		good

					gracchus
		but we are only words  we are air
		we need steel

					marcellus
		the city guard is faithful to the
		republic  but we dont stand a
		chance against the praetorians

					lucilla
		can they be bought

					marcellus
		they are zealots  totally
		committed to your brother

					gracchus
		well can they at least be rented
		for a day

					marcellus
		i doubt it  he pays them exorbitant
		salaries and lets them loot and
		extort as they see fit  the city
		belongs to them

					lucilla
		and theyve started arresting
		scholars now  anyone who dares
		speak out  even satirists and
		chroniclers

					marcellus
		and mathematicians and christians
		all to fill the arena

					gaius
		and what pays for it  these games
		are costing a fortune and yet we
		have no new taxes

					lucilla
		the future  the future pays for
		it

a beat  she looks at them

					lucilla
		hes started selling the grain
		reserves   

					gaius
		no

					marcellus
		that cant be true

					lucilla
		hes selling romes reserves of
		grain  the people will be starving
		in two years  i hope they are
		enjoying the spectacles because soon
		enough they will be dead because of
		them

					marcellus
		rome must know this

					lucilla
		and who will tell them  you
		marcellus  you senator gaius
		will you make a speech on the senate
		floor denouncing my brother  and
		then see your family in the
		colosseum  what towncrier would
		dare

a long beat

					lucilla
		he must die

a beat as her words sink in

					gaius
		the praetorians would only seize
		control themselves

					lucilla
		no  cut off the head and the snake
		cannot strike

					gracchus
		lucilla gaius is right  until the
		city guard can neutralize the
		praetorians we can accomplish
		nothing

					marcellus
		and i havent enough men

					lucilla
		what about the army

					gaius
		no roman army has entered the
		capital in a hundred years

					lucilla
		so we do nothing

a door opens a voice

					lucius voice
		mother

an eightyearold boy stands in a doorway sleepy  he is
lucius lucillas son

					lucius
		i heard voices

					lucilla
			going to him
		its all right darling you 

lucius suddenly notices senator gracchus

					lucius
			running to gracchus
		senator  what did you bring me

he leaps onto gracchus  gracchus laughs and pulls
something from his robe

					gracchus
		for you prince lucius a sea
		monster

gracchus gives lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea
serpent

					gracchus
		off the coast of achaea they grow
		twenty times this size with
		snapping teeth to devour any nasty
		praetorians they come across now
		where is achaea

					lucius
		below macedonia

					gracchus
		show me on the map

lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at achaea  we
sense this is an old game between them

					lucilla
		lucius you go in now ill be in
		shortly

					lucius
			to gracchus
		thank you senator mountain

					gracchus
		youre welcome prince anthill

lucius goes  lucilla shuts the door after him  a moment
she turns to the others a deep anguish in her eyes

					lucilla
		what are you going to do

gracchus goes to her holds her

					gracchus
		peace child one dark night the
		gods will light our path  they will
		give us the voice we need  have
		faith in that  have faith

int ext  roman streets  slave wagon  night

maximus cranes for a sight of the eternal city through a
hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart

he can see only glimpses of rome as they pass  but the
images are not what he expected  alongside the undeniable
glory of the city the madness and disease marcus aurelius
spoke of are readily apparent

maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on
carts heaped with bodies  he sees getting and spending
and commerce everywhere  he sees fascist praetorian
guard units trooping past  he sees the magnificent
architecture of the city  he sees starving children
begging from filthy gutters  he sees rich citizens out
for a stroll  he sees a swirling combination of
sophistication and depravity of civilization and
corruption

he sits back in the cart deep in thought  vibius looks
at him

					vibius
		not what you expected

					maximus
		no

					vibius
		rome is nothing but a slaughter
		house  and we are the meat

ext  proximos compound  night

the slave wagon pulls up to proximos rather grand roman
compound  guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon
drives in

ext  proximos compound  courtyard  night

inside the gates is a large courtyard much like proximos
moroccan school but much more impressive  a fountain with
an enormous statue of the war god mars is central in the
courtyard

the gladiators climb from the wagon stretching after the
long journey  vibius leads maximus and juba to the
statue  he wades through the fountain and kisses the toe
of mars

					vibius
		tradition  he watches over us

juba steps up and kisses the toe

					vibius
			to maximus
		oh go on it wont kill you

maximus kisses the toe as well

					proximo
			calling to them
		stop that  youll get some
		monstrous disease and then youll be
		worth nothing to me

guards come and lead them to their cells which line one
side of the courtyard

int  proximos compound  cell  night

later  maximus and juba again share a cell  it is more
comfortable than their cell in morocco befitting maximus
new status as one of the stars  a high barred window
on one wall opens to the city  another barred window is
directly over them twenty feet above

maximus pulls himself up to the side window he looks out

and sees at last the colosseum

it is a breathtaking sight  monolithic albert speerlike
columns of light shine up from the colosseum  it seems to
illuminate the whole city and the heavens above

maximus drops back to the floor

					juba
		do you think it will be much
		different  here in rome

					maximus
		bigger arena  same killing

a beat

					juba
		are you scared for tomorrow

					maximus
		no

a beat

					juba
		me too

a beat

					juba
		i never though it would be so easy
		to kill

a beat

					juba
		so youre finally home

					maximus
		this isnt my home

					juba
		for all romans this is home

a beat

					juba
			quietly
		among my people we honor the soil of
		our home  our ancestors are in that
		soil  all their dreams live there
		i will never see my home again  the
		soil is dead and no one honors them
		so the dreams die

a beat

					maximus
		perhaps one day youll return

juba looks at him

					juba
		how can i go back  i am not what i
		was  when a man kills for no
		reason he has lost himself

a long beat

juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing  a
haunting lament in his native tongue

ext  colosseum  day

a flurry of images from around the colosseum the energy
mounting  at this point we see practically nothing of the
inside of the colosseum

slaves are balancing high above the empty arena  they are
on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin sun tarps that
provide shade below

merchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside
of the colosseum  they sell everything from food to magic
elixirs from toys to aphrodisiacs  they immediately
start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their
products

gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets  they
have bizarrelycolored hair and elaborate makeup

citizens begin arriving pushing past the vendors and the
pickpockets  we see whole families with picnic lunches

ferocious animals are brought into the colosseum in barred
cages

in the busy arcade barbers and bloodletters practice
their craft alongside exotic alchemists fire eaters and
contortionists

richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots they
feign indifference to the hooting mob

mounted city guard police units try to retain some
order

gamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly

finally we see maximus and the other gladiators in a
slave cart  maximus watches everything as the slave cart
disappears into the colosseum

int  colosseum  route to holding cells  day

the interior of the colosseum is a busy world unto itself

maximus and the others are lead by proximos guards down a
long ramp and past countless animal cages  gamblers
circulate everywhere and observe the warriors angling for
the best odds and the best matches

maximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels
of the colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm
numerous cells line the walls  racks and racks of
weaponry and armor

and most striking everywhere around them is the heavy
machinery of the spectacles above  huge elevator
platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are
manned by teams of sweating slaves

int  colosseum  holding cells  day

finally proximos guards lead the gladiators to their
holding cells  these cells are right at the edge of the
arena  barred windows offer a sandlevel view of the
action

maximus immediately goes to a window and looks out

he cannot see much of the entire arena but what he does
see transfixes him

a band of christians are huddled together  an eerie
silence from the colosseum but for the prayers of the
christians

maximus watches them  one little girl peels past her
mothers arm  she sees maximus  she smiles

suddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by maximus
 they roar into the arena 

we do not see the carnage  we watch maximus face as we
hear the sounds of the slaughter

and the sound of the roaring crowd

maximus finally cannot watch  he drops his head

int  colosseum  trainers lair  day

proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the
colosseums orator and majordomo cassius  they are
haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena
itself  huge chalkboards chart the days matches and
wagers and odds

colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on
the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing
bouts

the roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the
christians can clearly be heard

					cassius
		 and the emperor will have no
		more animal battles today 

upset roars from some of the trainers

					trainer 1
		you promised me a bear match
		cassius

					trainer 2
		i have ten damned gorillas  you
		said gorillas yesterday

					cassius
		talk to the man in the imperial box
		who has the next slot
			he checks the
			boards
		 lentulus gideon trebonius and
		proximo 
			to proximo
		 nice to have you back you
		piratical bastard  now listen the
		emperor wants the carthage
		spectacle

the four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance 

					proximo
		no  have pity cassius  

					trainer 3
		my men are too good for  

					cassius
		you give us the carthage match or
		lose your spot on the rotation 
		but dont worry  gold is flowing
		from the emperors fingers

					trainer 3
		itll cost you 

					proximo
		i wont do it for less than 100000
		sesterces  

					trainer 4
		120000  all i have is my best
		thracians

					cassius
			to proximo
		and i want to see this famous
		spaniard of yours  his reputation
		soars from the provinces  the
		people are eager for him 

					proximo
		i wont throw my spaniard into a
		spectacle  damn you and damn the
		rotation

					cassius
		you will and the price will be
		90000 sesterces each 
			to all
		 which you all know is exorbitant
		 and if you extorting bloodwhores
		try to pawn off lesser fighters on
		me i will see you dead in the arena
		tomorrow

					trainer 4
		my thracians are worth  

					cassius
		give me your best brothers  they
		die before caesar

he strides back to the arena  the touts instantly begin
making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious
carthage spectacle as some of the trainers hurry out

proximo walks with trainer 4

					proximo
		i give you 30000 my spaniard will
		kill at least one of your thracians

					trainer 4
		30000  on a spaniard  that
		provincial sun has curdled your
		brain

					proximo
		then make the wager you smug
		bastard

they disappear down a dark corridor negotiating all the
while

int  colosseum  holding cells  day

maximus juba vibius and another of proximos gladiators
are being armed  they all wear masklike helmets

proximo hurries to them

					proximo
		all right  there are three other
		teams four men each 
			to maximus
		you know what a thracian looks like

					maximus
		yes but 

					proximo
		ignore the others  go for the
		thracians  the sun is to the east
		 over the gate  keep your back
		to the gate and you wont have the
		sun

					maximus
		what  

trumpets begin sounding from the arena

					proximo
		hurry  

the guards quickly bustle the four toward a gate leading
to a dark tunnel to the arena

					proximo
		die well and well sing songs about
		you for a generation

short swords are shoved into their hands and the gate
rises  they are pushed into the dark tunnel leading to
the arena  the gate closes behind them

the four gladiators stand for a moment and then slowly
walk down the tunnel to

ext  colosseum  arena  day

at last we see it

the mighty colosseum arena

nothing we could have possibly imagined could have
prepared us for the sight of the thousands and thousands
of screaming spectators the row after row of cheering
faces

it is staggering

but for maximus none of this exists  his full attention
is focused on one spot alone  the imperial box

he can see commodus and lucilla sitting in the box  the
box is elevated fifteen feet above the arena floor at the
top of a sheer black marble wall  a cohort of fifty
imposing praetorian guard archers surround the box
commodus personal body guard of six centurions actually
stand in the box itself eyes constantly watching like
modern secret service agents

commodus is untouchable

meanwhile three teams move from different entrances to
the arena

as cassius orates to the crowd

					cassius
		this day we reach back to hallowed
		antiquity to bring you the fall
		of mighty carthage
			the crowd cheers
		 on the barren armies of the
		barbarian hannibal  ferocious
		mercenaries and warriors of all
		brute nations bent on merciless
		conquest  your emperor is pleased
		to give you the barbarian horde

he gestures to the gladiators in the arena  the crowd
laughs jeering the barbarians

the drummers begin pounding out a more insistent heroic
beat

					cassius
		but on that illustrious day the gods
		sent against them romes greatest
		warriors  the very lifeimage of
		nobility and glorious valor who
		would on this day and on these same
		arid numidian deserts decide the
		fate of the empire your emperor
		is pleased to give you the
		legionnaires of scipio africanus

the crowd explodes in cheers as the huge doors at one end
of the arena suddenly burst open and ten chariots thunder
in 

each chariot has a driver and an archer both dressed in
theatrical versions of the familiar roman lorica
segmentata

a chaos of dust  and the battle is on 

the chariots zoom around the arena  the archers keeping
up a deadly hail of arrows

maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kills
the charioteer and archer  he dramatically leaps from
the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free

and maximus takes control we see the general of the felix
regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders and
leads his gladiators in battle  they follow him
faithfully his stern commands unquestioned

his strategies are quick and smart he makes the
gladiators work together

this kind of slaughter could last for hours

we see flashes of the endless battle maximus races on
his horse past another chariot kills the driver the
chariot smashes into a wall the sun sinks lower the
shadows on the sand lengthen areas of the sand are
swamps of blood juba slips pulls himself up fighting
maximus uses vibius to create a diversion two chariots
collide the crowd roars a gladiator is dragged
between a chariot and the side wall of the arena the
drummers pound out their relentless tattoo

finally

maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot

we can see that juba and vibius and a few other gladiators
are still alive  the rest of the arena is polluted with
the dead and injured

maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final
chariot  the charioteer whips his horses and zooms
toward maximus 

the crowd is breathless  watching the final battle 

maximus and the chariot speed toward each other  like
medieval jousters 

and collide in a flashing explosion of steel 

maximus sails from his horse  as the charioteer sails
from his chariot 

maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up he races
to the final charioteer  the charioteer is defeated but
not dead

maximus glances around all his opponents are defeated

he stands over the final charioteer  then he simply
tosses down his sword

the crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy  but
then an enormous roar grows from the crowd  wave after
wave of adulation for the hero of the day

maximus looks around taking it all in

then he turns to the imperial box

maximus slowly walks to before the the imperial box  the
praetorian archers immediately raise their bows pointing
down at him

maximus glares up at commodus through his helmet mask
commodus returns his gaze curious

the crowd is intrigued growing quiet  what is going on

then maximus simply turns and begins walking away

					commodus
		slave  who are you

the colosseum is suddenly silent  the emperor is speaking
to a gladiator

maximus keeps walking

					commodus
		slave  who are you

maximus keeps walking his fists clenched now

commodus suddenly grabs a spear from a nearby praetorian
and hurls it with perfect aim  the crowd gasps  the
spear sails past maximus  actually nicking his shoulder
 it slices into the sand ahead of maximus

maximus stops

					commodus
		slave  who are you

maximus can hold it no longer  he spins to commodus 
ripping off his helmet mask  and thundering

					maximus
		i am maximus meridas general of the
		felix regiment of the roman army and
		servant to the emperor marcus
		aurelius

commodus eyes shoot wide  lucilla bolts up  gracchus
leans forward  proximo is stunned  the crowd is
mystified 

					maximus
		i am father to a murdered son and
		husband to a murdered wife and
		landlord to a murdered world  and
		i will have vengeance

the praetorian archers tense their bows  ready to kill
the defiant slave 

but something extraordinary stops them  almost as one
being the crowd roars  they leaps to their feet and
thrust their thumbs up  they cheer and stomp their
approval of maximus

commodus looks around at the people of rome amazed

he finally plasters on a benevolent smile and thrusts his
thumb up  the praetorians lower their bows

and the crowd cheers  never in the long long history of
the colosseum have they ever seen such a thing

maximus leads his gladiators out of the arena

int  palace  throne room  night

to our great surprise commodus is not raging  he sits
quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model
of the colosseum  he moves model pieces around in the
colosseum planning his festival

lucilla stands tense

					commodus
		why is he still alive

					lucilla
		i dont know

					commodus
		he shouldnt be alive  that vexes
		me  i am terribly vexed

lucilla watches her brother cautiously expecting the
explosion  he carefully moves some model pieces in the
arena

					commodus
		there thats better  do you like
		the platform here

					lucilla
		mmm

					commodus
		i do too  simple elegant

lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at commodus
unusual serenity

					commodus
		father would have wanted something
		more ornate but hes dead now

a beat  commodus laughs  a beat

					commodus
		maximus meridas haunts me  i see
		father turning away from me and
		gazing at him  how many times did i
		suffer that indignity i wonder

					lucilla
		what are you going to do

					commodus
		im going to kill him

					lucilla
		good

					commodus
			glances at her
		oh youre too clever sister
		dont tell me part of you wont weep
		for him

					lucilla
		when he defies my brother the
		emperor he defies me  but you
		shouldnt send assassins

					commodus
		no

					lucilla
		the people embraced him today  they
		will be expecting his next match
			she kneels next to
			him
		 let him die in the arena like
		the slave he is  let the people see
		what comes of defying caesar

a beat as he looks at her

					commodus
		he wounded you deeply didnt he
		long ago

she does not answer

					commodus
		nonetheless your political acumen
		is as always unerring

he picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena  he
looks at the model tiger and smiles

int  proximos compound  cell  night

maximus silently awaits commodus assassins with juba
they hear footsteps outside the cell  maximus stands
preparing for death

					juba
			also standing
		i will fight with you

					maximus
		this isnt your battle

					juba
		better to die for a friend than to
		die for gold

the door swings open and they are surprised to see proximo
sweeping in with a cloaked woman  the woman gives proximo
a bag of money

					proximo
		enjoy yourself madame
			he glances to
			maximus
		general perform well and there will
		be riches for you

he beckons to juba they go shutting the door behind
them  the woman pulls off her cloak it is lucilla

maximus glares at her his muscles tensing

					lucilla
		rich matrons pay well to be
		pleasured by the bravest champions

maximus backs up fighting the urge to strangle her on the
spot  he finally bumps into a wall of the cell

					maximus
		i knew your brother would send
		assassins  i didnt think he would
		send his best

					lucilla
		maximus listen to me 

					maximus
		my family were crucified and burnt
		while they were still alive

					lucilla
		i knew nothing of that

					maximus
			low
		dont lie to me

					lucilla
		i wept for them

					maximus
		dont

a long tense moment

she does not look at him

					lucilla
		do you know what it is to be the
		daughter of the emperor  i learned
		on the night my father had my
		husband killed  i loved my husband
		very much  very simply  he was
		a man who believed in the republic
		he was a man who thought marcus
		should be tending to rome and not
		conquering the world  one night my
		father had him strangled for
		conspiring with the senate  my
		father never spoke of it  i never
		spoke of it  that is what it is to
		be the daughter of rome

she finally looks up at maximus

					lucilla
		my son will live  he will survive
		this cursed bloodline  rome will
		die and the jackals will pick her
		clean  but my son will survive
		empires come and go  cities crumble
		to dust  only family matters

a beat  despite himself maximus is moved

					maximus
		my son was innocent

					lucilla
		so is mine

a beat

					maximus
		i want your brother dead

					lucilla
		so do i

a beat  maximus is surprised at her direct answer

					lucilla
		my son will never be safe while he
		lives

a beat

					maximus
		how do you plan it

					lucilla
		the senate is with us and the city
		guard  we have growing power in the
		streets  but we need a leader
		someone the people can 

					maximus
		so the crown passes to your son

					lucilla
		no  so that my son will be safe
		so that we may leave this charnel
		house forever and never look back
		look into my eyes maximus and
		believe what i say to you

she rivets him intensely with her eyes

					lucilla
		by all the gods and in the name of
		my father who loved you and in the
		name of the husband i loved i
		swear to stand by your side in this
		now and always

a beat

					maximus
		what is your sons name

					lucilla
		lucius verus  like his father

					maximus
		i weep for him

a long beat  maximus cold eyes give away nothing

lucilla turns and starts to go  she stops not looking
back

					lucilla
		commodus plans to kill you in your
		next match in the arena  hes
		planning something  i will pray for
		you  as i have always done

she then pulls something from her robes and sets it down
a little bundle wrapped in cloth  she sweeps out  the
sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side

maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has
left  he opens the cloth  inside are his six ancestor
figures

he picks up one of the figures  he looks at it deeply
gently feeling along the contours with a finger

ext  colosseum  arena  day

the colosseum is again packed  commodus lucilla and her
son lucius are in the imperial box

it is late in the day and teams of slaves are cleaning the
arena after a bout  they haul off carcasses and toss down
fresh sand

meanwhile cassius is orating to the crowd

					cassius
		 in his majestic charity the
		emperor has deigned to this day
		favor the people of rome with an
		historical final match  returning
		to the colosseum today after five
		years in retirement caesar is
		pleased to bring you the only
		undefeated champion in roman
		history
			the crowd is going
			mad
		 the legendary tiger of gaul

the crowd erupts in paroxysms of joy as tiger explodes
into the arena in an ornate chariot  tiger is a fierce
man in his 40s his brutal scarred face and hugely
muscled body a testament to his many years in the arena

tiger speeds around the rim of the arena in his chariot
raising an arm in triumph  the crowd roars

int  colosseum  holding cells  day

proximo stands with maximus who is busy strapping on
armor

					proximo
		gods  that old homicide  the
		emperor must truly hate you

					maximus
		what can you tell me

					proximo
		he cheats

int  colosseum  arena  day

tiger waits  he stands in the center of the arena  he
has only a traditional short sword  the crowd is
breathless with anticipation  as

					cassius
			orating
		and from the rocky promontories and
		martial bloodlines of spain
		representing the training lyceum of
		proximo antoninus i give you
		the warrior maximus

the crowd cheers  maximus appears from his gate  his
fans have increased in number considerably  they eagerly
crane forward and celebrate him

meanwhile maximus looks at tiger  only one man with a
sword  maximus approaches cautious but confident

he stops a few feet from tiger  they lock eyes salute
each other and then turn to the imperial box raising
their swords

the crowd waits eagerly for the immortal words

					maximus and tiger
		we who are about to die salute you

the crowd cheers and maximus immediately turns and starts
slashing  tiger easily blocks and strikes back 

the sword play is very fast  they block and parry and
hack like lightning  constantly attacking  they are
perfectly matched 

as he fights maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over
the roar of the crowd  a low rumbling  then he feels
something  a vibration in the ground 

suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous
platforms rise into view  on each platform is a snarling
bengal tiger restrained by a chain  tigers teams of
cornermen hold the chains through a pulley system  the
cornermen are safely inside cages  the platforms stop at
ground level

the four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the
battleground

tiger takes advantage of maximus momentary confusion and
assaults brutally  forcing him back toward one of the
tigers  the tiger claws for maximus  maximus just
evades it claws  rolls for a new position  another
tiger snaps at him 

tiger attacks  maximus is on the defensive  fighting
off tiger and evading the four snarling beasts 

and then all four tigers are suddenly closer  the teams
of cornermen are letting the chains play out bit by bit
gradually reducing the size of the battle ground  the
crowd roars

but the fight is hardly fair

whenever tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen
pull back the tiger slightly  when maximus is near a
tiger they let it out a bit

maximus and tiger fight  swirling action  finally
maximus has the edge  he circles so that the sun stabs
into tigers eyes  then maximus lunges forward under
tigers swinging sword and slams into him  they fall 
a tiger swats at maximus face  he jerks his head back
 he shoots out a leg and kicks tigers sword toward one
of the tigers  it is out of reach  maximus leaps up
and stands over the winded tiger sword to his throat

tiger is gasping for breath crushed

then one of tigers corners suddenly cheats  they
completely release a tiger  it leaps for maximus 

maximus barely has time to turn  the tiger crashes into
him  its claws slashing into his back cutting through
his leather armor  maximus shoves an armored forearm
into the tigers jaws and stabs with his sword 

tiger takes this chance to pull himself up  one of his
corners throws him another sword  the crowd boos 

maximus wrestles with the tiger  spinning it around with
superhuman effort so it is always between himself and
tiger  so that tiger cant get at him 

maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for tiger  he
quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground 

maximus stands over him  ready to administer the coup de
grace

all eyes turn to the emperor

commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the
imperial box  he raises his arm and gives the fatal
thumbs down

maximus looks up at him

and then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground
refusing to kill tiger

commodus is stunned

the crowd gasps  a collective intake of breath  and
then an enormous roar building  it cascades around the
colosseum  it is a roaring celebration of the unexpected
act of mercy  and the delicious act of defiance of the
emperor

commodus slowly sits

maximus walks across the arena  the people stand and
cheer for him  cries of maximus the merciful can be
heard

it is the birth of a hero

int  colosseum  holding cells  day

maximus is resting in his cell after the battle head
down deep in thought

					lucius voice
		is it true youre a general

maximus looks up lucius is standing at his cell  maximus
has no idea who the boy is  just another young fan 
but maximus is immediately struck by lucius resemblance
to his own son

					maximus
		i was a general

					lucius
		i saw you fight  the carthage
		battle too  ive never seen so much
		courage

					maximus
		it doesnt take courage to kill

					lucius
		my father was killed

a beat

					maximus
		im sorry

					lucius
		he still comes to me in my dreams
		do you have a father

					maximus
		i had a father  he wasnt really my
		father but i cared for him very much

					lucius
		i hope he comes to you in your
		dreams  my father and i ride horses
		in mine

these simple words strike something deep in maximus

lucilla appears from the shadows and puts her hands on
lucius shoulders

					lucilla
		lucius run along now  i need to
		talk to the general

lucius runs off to his male attendant who leads him away

a long beat as maximus and lucilla look at each other

finally

					maximus
		where is my army

a drum beat is heard  it increases throughout the
following scenes building momentum like a roman gallery
accelerating to ramming speed

the conspiracy scenes are enclosed in a montage of scenes
in and around the arena showing maximus growing
popularity with the people of rome

ext  colosseum  arena  day

maximus is fighting an opponent

the drums continue

int  the senate  day

lucilla conspires with senators gracchus and gaius and
captain marcellus in a dark corner of the senate
whispers

					lucilla
		 maximus will summon his army
		from ostia and he will strike from
		the inside as his army strikes from
		the outside  but he insists that
		the senate be present

					gaius
		weve been ordered to attend

alarm  he glances around as the crowd exalts maximus  he
is becoming a hero to the people

		brothers on rome  many will die
		why

					maximus
		i want commodus dead

					gracchus
		thats not the reason  tell me the
		truth

a beat

					maximus
		because one night an old man
		whispered to me about a dream  i
		will die for that dream

a long beat

					gracchus
		i knew the old man well  and i
		loved him very much  in our youth
		we would spend hours building that
		dream together  after he went to
		the wars and lost his way i was
		very cruel  i tormented him to

					maximus
		he did

					gracchus
		you can have no idea how much that

		you general

the drums continue

ext  colosseum  arena  day

vibius defeats an opponent  he stands over him  he
looks around at the crowd  then he tosses down his sword
and walks off

the crowd goes mad with pleasure  vibius eats it up
raising his arms and soaking up the applause

maximus watches from the holding cells  he smiles

the drums continue

triumphant

the crowd waits for the delicious act of defiance  we
note many placard and banners honoring maximus the
merciful

their weapons and walk off leaving their opponents alive

the crowd roars  they have completely embraced maximus
and his fellow gladiators

gracchus in the stands laughs

the drums finally conclude

int  palace  lucillas chamber  day

lucilla is with her handmaiden  they sit before a large
mirror the handmaiden perfecting lucillas makeup for the
day

one of commodus centurion body guards enters bows

					centurion
		madame the emperor would like to
		see you

lucilla quickly glances to her handmaiden in the mirror
and then braces herself stands and quickly leaves with
the centurion

int  palace  hallway  day

lucilla strides quickly nervously down the long corridor
to commodus chambers  she enters

int  palace  commodus bedroom  day

commodus is wrapped in a sheet gazing out a window

					lucilla
		caesar

he turns  she stops

he looks as if he has not slept for days  if a word could
now sum up his clouded face it is this  tormented

she goes to him embraces him  he holds her tightly

					commodus
		i am sorry to have kept you away
		i needed this time to think

					lucilla
		of course

he moves away from her slowly moving around the room

					commodus
		i limited my world to these four
		walls so as to let my mind free
		again and again my mind settles on
		but one question what kind of
		world are we making when the people
		of rome prefer a slave in the arena
		to their father

a beat  commodus strange philosophical bent is unnerving
lucilla

					commodus
		it is my responsibility to make the
		world as it should be  how is it i
		have made this world

					lucilla
		brother do not be influenced by the
		mob  they are a great faceless
		beast 

					commodus
		they are not the mob lucilla
		they are the people  they are my
		children and all i want to do is
		love them

a beat  he stands before a bust of marcus aurelius  he
touches it

					commodus
		our father loved maximus and i
		love him still yet he defies me
		he tasks me in front of my children
		and they love him for it  just as
		marcus loved him for it  tell me
		why lucilla

					lucilla
		they see themselves in him  they
		throw in their own sad dreams
		alongside his  they think he fights
		for them

					commodus
		and what do i do but fight for
		them  i give them games to please
		them  i strangle dissent to give
		them peace  i empower the
		praetorians to give them order
		what more can i do

a beat

					commodus
		say i should fight him in the
		arena  let my children see who the
		gods truly favor

					lucilla
		and what if he should win

a beat

commodus continues to slowly move around the room

					commodus
		a god is more powerful than a man

this odd statement hangs in the air for a moment  then

					lucilla
		caesar you let this unduly worry
		you  at best he is a passing fancy
		 he is a name an image on a
		banner ephemeral  he will be
		forgotten as the next fancy
		appears 

					commodus
		but i need to know  why do they
		love him

					lucilla
		mercy

he stops  looks at her

					lucilla
		he will not kill in the arena  he
		is merciful  as they all wish they
		were in their own hearts

something in her words has struck a chord in him

					commodus
		and for that moment in the arena
		they are merciful too  for a
		moment they are gods  offering
		life

he looks at her

					commodus
		but who can be more merciful than
		the emperor of rome

ext  colosseum  arena  day

maximus is fighting a thick giant of a man  a few quick
blows and the giant falls  like a mighty tree he crashes
to the sand

the arena cheers their hero

maximus stands over the beaten giant  the crowd waits for
the famous act

maximus salutes the giant and tosses down his sword
refusing to kill  he walks away

the arena explodes in cheers  a chant of maximus the
merciful grows to deafening proportions

suddenly the arena is filled with praetorians  they
block maximus exit from the arena  the crowd boos 
horrified 

the praetorians surround maximus  he is unarmed but
coils for the inevitable battle

then the praetorians part

and commodus walks through them  he carries something
wrapped in a rich cloth  maximus glares at him

the praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly
the emperor and the gladiator at last

maximus and commodus stare at each other  the crowd
cannot hear what is said but strain to observe this
incredible confrontation

					commodus
		brother weve taken a sad path
		since we were children at capri
		have we not

maximus doesnt answer

					commodus
		for my own part i am sorry it
		came to this  and to you alone of
		all men i acknowledge my errors
		and my regret  i shall live with my
		sin for all my days

					maximus
		as will i commodus  as will i

commodus unwraps the cloth bundle  inside is a small
wooden sword  he holds it up so the crowd can see

a collective gasp  the wooden sword prized by all
gladiators above all else  freedom

					commodus
		as the first act of my contrition i
		offer you the wooden sword of
		freedom

he holds out the wooden sword  a beat

					commodus
		take it brother  stand at my side
		as a free man worthy of your
		ancestors

					maximus
		i only have ancestors because of
		you brother  you killed everything
		that ever lived alongside me

a beat

					commodus
		take it maximus  let us heal that
		fatal wound together

					maximus
		this is the new home you cursed me
		to  and i am safer here from your
		treachery than i could ever be
		outside

					commodus
		will you always mistrust me

					maximus
		why dont you ask your father that

commodus visibly flinches at that but still holds the
wooden sword out  the crowd is breathless

					maximus
		i have more power as a slave in the
		arena than i could ever have as a
		free man  as the colosseum goes
		the people go  as the people go
		the empire goes

					commodus
			tense
		you think this is power  i could
		show you power slave 

					maximus
		no caesar i will show you

with that maximus does the unimaginable  he simply turns
his back on the emperor and walks away

and the crowd goes mad  they cheer the defiant gladiator
their champion

and equally they deride the emperor  they mock him by
holding out food and trash like commodus is holding out
the wooden sword  they laugh and jeer

commodus glances around at his children lost

then he turns to the imperial box  he sees lucilla
slipping out the back of the box  he watches her go

and the crowd continues to jeer

ext  street theater  night

the crowd laughs riotously as roman actors perform a
typically ribald comedy in a secluded street

an outrageously dressed version of maximus is parading
around on an outrageously dressed version of commodus
riding him like a donkey and slapping his rear with a
wooden sword  the commodus actor mews and brays and
wails like an infant

captain marcellus of the city guard gallops past them on
his way out of rome

ext  proximos compound  courtyard  day

maximus stands with juba and vibius  he draws a circle in
the sand with a stick  he draws a line to the circle

					maximus
		the felix regiment will come from
		here  well face the body of the
		praetorians outside  here  once
		inside my archers will take up
		position to counter opposition
		inside the colosseum  ill enter
		and join you  well attack here 

maximus draws a line to the imperial box

					maximus
		 a covert assault from within

					vibius
		well be killed

					maximus
		probably

a beat

					maximus
		but if we arent think of the
		glory  do you remember glory
		gladiator

					juba
		and if we die that day  we die
		free men worthy of our ancestors

					vibius
		you didnt know my ancestors  a
		rotten bunch

maximus points to the huge statue of mars

					maximus
		then be worthy of him  the old
		titan who would rather die bravely
		in a just battle than slink off to
		grow old and fat

					juba
		and impotent

a beat  vibius thinks about it

					vibius
		if i die i want a hundred whores at
		my funeral

int  palace  lucillas chambers  evening

commodus sweeps in  thinks lucilla is standing there
the woman turns it is lucillas handmaiden

					commodus
		where is my sister

					handmaiden

commodus looks at her for a moment

and then he slowly walks right to her  his face an inch
away from hers

		the armor of rome  but now

something flashes across proximos eyes something like
tragedy

					proximo
		now i am just an entertainer

a pause

					maximus
		you said something to me once  you
		said in this life we all die  all
		we can choose is how we die  and
		how we are remembered  do you
		recall those words

					proximo
		yes

					maximus
		then be remembered proudly  this is
		your time proximo  stand at my
		side and be what you were  what you
		truly are  one last time

a beat

proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically 
maximus is a bit taken aback  proximo dramatically
flicks tears from his eyes  and then cant keep the show
up  he bursts into laughter

maximus stares at him

					proximo
			laughing
		you might have spared yourself the
		speech general  the lady lucilla
		bought all my gladiators two hours
		ago

					maximus
		you poxridden bastard     

					proximo
		i am the richest trainer in the
		empire  and i will let my
		gladiators do anything you like
		conspire away general

maximus can only laugh as well

					proximo
		but i tell you  if you survive
		this madness i want you to go into
		business with me  ill give you a
		quarter of my holdings

					maximus
			standing
		a quarter

					proximo
		a third  and not a hair more  and
		youll have to start in the
		provinces  cleaning up the lion
		shit

					maximus
		you know if you were half so awful
		as you pretend youd be a
		terrifying man

maximus shakes his head smiling and goes

proximo sits for a moment

then he rises and goes to a heavy chest  he looks at the
chest for a moment and then opens it

inside is his old lorica segmentata  he gazes at his
armor considering what he once was  and what he now is

int  proximos compound  cell  night

maximus enters  lucilla is waiting extremely tense

					maximus
		lucilla 

					lucilla
		dont even say it  i know its
		dangerous  but i had to see you
		captain marcellus has gone to the
		army with your message as you
		instructed

					maximus
		good

					lucilla
		he says the city guard will be ready
		at the south road at noon  they can
		only wait for an hour so 

					maximus
		youve told me this already

					lucilla
		did i  all right then  so
		everything is prepared  the senate
		will be in attendance and you have

		of praetorians will be inside the
		arena 

					maximus
		lucilla why are you here

a pause

					lucilla
		tell me honestly please do you
		think it will work

a beat

					maximus
		no

					lucilla
		do you think well all die

					maximus
		yes

she leans against a wall

a pause

					lucilla
		will you swear something to me

					maximus
		yes

					lucilla
		will you swear it on the memory of
		your son

a long beat

					maximus
		yes

					lucilla

		swear that if you survive you will
		take my son out of rome  swear that
		you will go far away and never
		return

he steps to her

					maximus
			deeply
		i will

a beat

					maximus
		and if i should not survive swear
		to me that you will honor my family
		in your prayers always

					lucilla
		i will

a long difficult beat  she fights back tears

					lucilla
		had i not been the daughter of
		rome

he puts a gentle finger to her lips

					maximus
		shhh my heart breaks enough

he holds her closely tenderly

int  palace  lucillas chambers  night

lucilla enters deep in thought still drained from her
meeting with maximus

she suddenly stops  frozen

commodus is sitting across the chamber lucius at his
knee  an open scroll on commodus lap

					commodus
		sister join us  ive been
		reading to dear lucius

					lucius
		ive been reading too

					commodus
		yes hes a very smart little boy
		hell make a grand emperor one day

lucilla has not moved

					commodus
		join us sister

lucilla goes to them sits

					commodus
		weve been reading about the great
		julius and his adventures in egypt

					lucius
		she killed herself with a snake

					commodus
			to lucius
		and just wait until you hear what
		happened to some of our other
		ancestors  if youre very good
		tomorrow night ill tell you the
		story of emperor claudius  he was
		betrayed  by those closest to
		him
			he glances up to
			lucilla
		 by his own blood they
		whispered in dark corners and went
		out late at night and conspired and
		conspired

lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill

lucius is busy scanning the scroll  commodus gently
strokes his hair his cold eyes never leaving lucillas

					commodus
		but the emperor claudius knew that
		they were up to something dire  he
		knew they were busy little bees
		and one night he sat down with one
		of them and he looked at her and he
		said  tell me what you have been
		doing busy little bee or i shall
		strike down those dearest to you
		you shall watch as i bathe in their
		blood  and the bee knew he spoke
		the truth for the emperor always
		speaks the truth  and what do you
		think happened then lucius

					lucius
			still pouring over
			the scrolls
		i dont know uncle

					commodus
			glaring at lucilla
		the bee told him everything

lucillas face is tortured

int  proximos compound  proximos chamber  night

proximo is asleep  a sound outside wakes him  the
steady clipclop of horses on stone  a lot of horses

he rises and goes to a window overlooking the street
outside

a stern praetorian guard cavalry unit is cantering into
position at his gates  proximo grabs his clothes 

ext  proximos compound  night

with cool military precision the praetorians take up
position at the gates before proximos compound an
unassailable line  they quickly prepare their bows

meanwhile another praetorian unit has taken up position
at the other end of proximos compound  sealing that
entrance as well

ext  proximos compound  courtyard  night

proximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the
first flaming arrow arches into the compound  it is
followed by hundreds more 

the praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a
ceaseless hail of flaming arrows  everything begins to
burn  the caged gladiators are stirring now 
shouting 

proximo races to his panicked guards 

					proximo
		release them  release them all
		arm them

the guards sprint to the cells  unlocking the gladiators
as quickly as they can 

not quick enough for many  praetorians are now pouring
pitch through the gutter that runs along the bottom of the
cells  igniting it and incinerating all those trapped
inside 

the compound is soon a raging inferno 

proximo releases maximus and juba 

					proximo
		come 

					maximus
		but 

					proximo
		if you want to live  follow me 

					vibius
			calling to them
		go spaniard  well show these
		roman dogs how gladiators fight   

proximo hauls maximus and juba off as vibius and the other
gladiators arm themselves 

int  tunnels  night

proximo is leading maximus and juba quickly through a
decaying cramped tunnel

					proximo
		all the old gladiator schools have
		tunnels to the colosseum  most
		have long since collapsed 

					juba
		how did they know

					maximus
		we were betrayed

					juba
			stops
		ill stay here  in case they
		follow

maximus stops as well

					juba
		go  bring us the army

maximus nods

					proximo
		quickly 

he leads maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of
tunnels 

ext  proximos compound  night

vibius hoped to die fighting  he never got the chance

it is not a battle it is a slaughter

the praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching
the gates  all the walls are covered  most of the
gladiators die in the hellish inferno  the relentless
rain of flaming arrows continues 

vibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to
fight  praetorian snipers cut him down  he dies
reaching for the statue of mars

int  colosseum  subterranean  night

proximo and maximus emerge deep in the bowels of the
colosseum

					proximo
			points
		down that corridor is the butchery
		 the blood sloughs lead to the
		tiber  gods watch over you

					maximus
		youre not coming

					proximo
		they are killing my men

he races back into the tunnel

maximus moves quickly down the corridor  he can finally
see

int  colosseum  butchery  night

grisly carcasses of every description hang from hooks
two bored butchers hack them up  the good bits are tossed
into a wagon to fed to the colosseum animals  the waste
and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening  a
butcher occasionally lifts a sluicegate and a gush of
water flows into the sewer from above washing down the
blood and carcasses

maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of
hanging carcasses and flies

when the butchers are looking elsewhere maximus creeps to
the sewer opening and climbs in  he immediately slides
down for a few yards in the slanting slippery blood
sluice  out of sight 

then he thuds to a stop  he can go no further because the
remains of an animal carcass blocks his way  he tries to
slither past the carcass 

finally one of the butchers above lifts the sluicegate
and a torrent of water flows down

maximus is washed down the hideous sewer

int  tunnels  night

proximo and juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel
toward the compound  they are very close now  the roar
of flame is heard  the creak of falling timber  and
the screams of burning men  they run

they round a corner and see there is no way past the world
of flame ahead of them  the tunnel to the compound has
collapsed

					proximo
		gods theyre killing them all

proximo leads them up a cramped stairway to

ext  street outside proximos compound  night

they emerge through a sewer entrance  right into the
arms of the praetorian guard  proximo and juba are bound
proximo sees his compound burning  sees the praetorian
archers taking out any last survivors  hears the screams

int ext  various locations  arrest montage  night

a quick sequence of brutal arrests as praetorian guard
units round up many associated with the plot  and many
that are not

gaius bedroom  gaius and his wife are yanked awake and
hauled out

christian home  a congregation of christians is chained
together their secret altar smashed

cafe  greek scholars are hauled away from their scrolls

street theater  actors are dragged off in the midst of a
performance

gracchus steam room  gracchus is enjoying grapes with
his handsome catamite  a unit of praetorian bursts in
gracchus looks at them  sighs

int  palace  throne room  night

commodus stands with lucius on a balcony overlooking the
city

the roaring flames of the fire at proximos compound can
easily be seen

					lucius
		what is that fire

					commodus
		why thats a bonfire lucius  i
		arranged it just for you

he puts his hand on the boys shoulder

behind them lucilla sits slumped in a chair  her face is
a mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do

two praetorians enter with a bucket

					praetorian
		caesar

commodus goes to them  he talks quietly with them for a
moment and glances at what they are carrying

					commodus
		oh thats for my sister

they bring the bucket to lucilla and set it before her

commodus ignores her and goes back to lucius on the
balcony

lucilla glances inside the bucket

captain marcellus head is floating in brine  lucilla
moans  all is lost

ext  tiber river  night

maximus splashes to the surface of the filthy tiber
gasping for air

animal carcasses float up next to him  he grabs onto one
and floats down the gently flowing river

ext  italian front  camp  dawn

the wolf of rome sleeps  then its ears rise  then its
head  it sniffs the air  the wolf slowly rises and
begins loping through the camp

it passes slumbering soldiers and tents smoke lazily
drifting up from campfires

the wolf finally stops and looks up

maximus is on a horse  he climbs down  the wolf goes to
him and licks his hand

maximus begins marching through the camp the wolf at his
side  soldiers stir amazed to see their general is
alive

gallus leaps up stunned and goes to maximus  they
continue to march through the camp more and more
astonished soldiers joining them

they march toward the large tents at the center of the
encampment

titus emerges from his tent  slams to a stop 

					titus
		by all the gods

he goes to maximus and embraces him

					maximus
		old friend

					titus
		youre returned from hades  by all
		the gods

					maximus
		where is he

just then quintus emerges from the largest tent  he
stares at maximus unbelieving

a long beat as they look at each other

quintus knows his destiny  with quiet dignity he begins
whispering a prayer  maximus moves to him embracing him

					maximus
		i forgive you

he stabs quintus with a dagger as he embraces him
quintus falls

a beat

titus goes to the dead quintus and pulls the seal of
office from his uniform  he hands it to maximus

an enormous roar of celebration from the felix regiment

int  palace  commodus bedroom  morning

a castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration
their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate
around commodus bedroom

the emperor himself is in a chair wrapped in a robe  his
body slaves work over him closely

he is staring into a mirror lost in another world as the
slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him

the castrati hymn continues

ext  outside the colosseum  day

the hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the
colosseum

it seems that all of rome is here for this great day
huge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward
the colosseum entrances  vendors are doing brisk
business  praetorian units in full dress uniform canter
past

we elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the
colosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena
stands

ext  colosseum  day

the hymn is all we hear as we see   

the stands are filling  we see the rich and poor alike
we see the orator cassius  we see senator falco and most
of the senate  we see the cohort of fifty praetorian
taking up position around the imperial box

a golden platform with stairs down to the arena sand now
extends about twenty feet from the imperial box to a spot
over the arena

we float down the stairs and then we see the arena
itself

it is stunning in its simplicity

the days victims are tied to posts in the center of the
arena  suspended above them is an enormous cloud  a
thick tumescent bladder painted to look like a
threatening rain cloud

we see proximo and juba  we see senators gracchus and
gaius  we see gaius wife and gracchus catamite and
christian families and scholars and actors

seven stylized hills surround them

the hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the
damned

time cut

later  by now the colosseum is packed  all fiftyfive
thousand seats are taken  another ten thousand stand
wherever they can  a feral anticipation buzzes through
the crowd

outside the colosseum the streets are crowded with
thousands more who couldnt get in

trumpets blare

commodus six centurion body guards stride into the
imperial box

then commodus enters  he is shrouded in a full lions
skin the head of the lion concealing his own  his head
is down he does not look up

lucilla and lucius enter after him and sit  lucillas
face is drained her eyes defeated  lucius is wearing a
miniature set of lorica segmentata complete with
ceremonial dagger

ext  roman street  day

a mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the
outskirts of rome  the street is deserted  it seems that
almost everyone is at the colosseum

the dog stops  looks up

then a sound is heard  the steady cadence of horses
hooves

the felix regiment rounds a corner  maximus leads the
cavalry  he wears lorica segmentata  his corps of
archers and soldiers follow  they troop down the dusty
street

maximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog

quick cuts

the felix regiment moves through the streets  the few
pedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around
corners  the roar of the colosseum can be heard far in
the distance

arrows slice into isolated praetorian sentries  the felix
regiment continues its stealth invasion

finally maximus reins his horse and his troops stop

the mounted city guard are waiting

without a word the city guard joins maximus and the two
combined forces continue their inexorable march to the
colosseum

ext  colosseum  day

commodus still swathed in the lion skin his head down
slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the
imperial box

the crowd grows hushed

commodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a
moment  then he dramatically flings off the lion skin

the crowd gasps

he is almost naked his entire chiseled body is painted in
gold  his eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks
around at his people

he finally speaks

					commodus
			serene
		rome this is the day that was
		foretold  this is the day when your
		father takes away all fear
			he holds up his
			hands
		with these hands i shall destroy
		your enemies so that you may sleep
		always and forever in peace  from
		this day forth let it be known that
		i lucius aelius aurelius commodus
		have surmounted mortality  that i
		lucius aelius aurelius commodus
		assume my destined place at the
		side of the gods

the crowd is stunned  a few scattered laughs

lucilla stares at him disbelieving

					commodus
		and as a righteous god i shall ever
		protect you  i shall cradle the
		world on my benevolent hands and
		clasp it to my heart  so i have
		spoken  and let the heavens tremble
		at my might

ext  roman streets  day

maximus continues to lead the combined felix regiment and
city guard cavalry through the streets  the roaring is
closer now  they are nearing the colosseum they can just
glimpse the edge of the top tier over some building

ext  colosseum  day

commodus continues

					commodus
		this day i reclaim rome for her
		people  i shall give you the
		rebirth of your empire  reborn and
		cleansed of her enemies

he raises his arms  at his cue the praetorian archers
raise their bows ready aiming at the victims

					commodus
		i will make a new rome  founded as
		it was at the beginning  archers 
		give us blood

the praetorians suddenly point their bows higher and
fire 

they shoot the cloud  the bladder explodes and thick
blood rains down on the victims  the blood splashes over
them coating them

ext  outside colosseum  day

the roar from the colosseum is now deafening as maximus
and the city guard round the final corner  the colosseum
is before them  the massive praetorian guard force is
caught of guard  with crisp military efficiency the
felix regiment and the city guard quickly canter into
place an unbroken line of seasoned warriors facing the
praetorians

the huge mob outside the colosseum is confused intrigued
watching the faceoff  the mounted archers of the felix
regiment have drawn their bows

maximus looks down from his horse at a praetorian officer

					maximus
		throw down your weapons or we will
		kill you

a beat

the praetorian officer glances at the formidable force
against him  he drops his sword  his men follow suit

					maximus
			he turns to his men
		felix regiment  do honor to your
		ancestors  i salute you

he spurs his horse and the felix regiment roars springing
into action  they gallop through the crowd and to the
colosseum  meanwhile the city guard disarm and guard the
praetorian 

ext  colosseum  day

commodus continues

					commodus
		as it was at the beginning so is it
		now  the great shewolf of rome
		will again suckle us again ravage
		our enemies  and bring us a world
		reborn

at his cue two elevator platforms rumble into view
rising from the bowels of the colosseum to the arena sand

on each platform is a cage full of ferocious wolves they
snap and growl straining to be released

					commodus
		so it was for romulus and remus
		sons of mars so shall it be for us
		the great shewolf will 

suddenly  the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open
and maximus leads the felix regiment cavalry thundering
into the arena

the crowd is stunned  commodus is stunned  lucilla
bolts up 

commodus immediately spins to lucilla his eyes burning 

his praetorian are momentarily confused 

at gallus command the felix regiment archers let fly 
multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the
praetorians  some confusing skirmishes as the remaining
praetorians fire back 

maximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the
prisoners free 

meanwhile commodus strides back down the platform toward
lucilla in the imperial box murder in his eyes 

she suddenly hugs lucius quickly and kisses him 

					lucilla
		remember your mother

she pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform
and pushes him to his attendant  his attendant pulls him
away as 

lucilla spins to commodus  he grabs her into an embrace
 he turns the knife on her  thrusting deeply as he
kisses her 

a long kiss as he holds her tightly to him  then he
gently sits her down on her throne  her eyes wide dying

one of commodus body guards grabs him

					centurion body guard
		caesar  we must go  

commodus six centurion body guards begin hustling him out
of the imperial box 

					commodus
		get the boy

he grabs lucius from his attendant and drags him off 

they try to escape out the back of the imperial box  but
felix regiment troops are blocking their way  racing up
toward them 

					centurion body guard
		this way caesar

below through the confusion maximus sees commodus
escaping with lucius down through a side tunnel

maximus cuts juba and proximo free  juba immediately
snatches up a sword  maximus quickly offers a sword to
proximo

					maximus
		captain

proximo takes the sword

					maximus
			re commodus and
			the others
		where are they going

					proximo
		this way

they race across the arena and into a tunnel

int  colosseum  bowels  day

proximo leads them through a series of catacombs  damp
tunnels shoot off in every direction  everywhere around
them the heavy machinery of the games rise like mammoth
creatures to the arena above  a baroque network of ropes
and pulleys and counterweights and elevator platforms and
air shafts and blood sewers  and they suddenly run
directly into commodus dragging lucius and his six
centurions coming the other direction

the final battle begins with no preamble 

maximus launches himself forward  instantly separating
commodus and lucius  he slams at commodus with his sword
 commodus slams back 

proximo and juba race into the six centurions  a wild
freeforall as they prove their worth as warriors  juba
fights with his usual elegant precision  proximo fights
as a man reborn alive again 

proximo takes cagey advantage of his knowledge of this
subterranean world  spinning around machinery and
leaping over blood sewers and swinging heavy
counterweights 

maximus and commodus hack at each other with all the fiery
passion in them  commodus is a perfect match for maximus
and equally ruthless  their swords thrust and parry and
slice at amazing speed  one false move one mistake
means death 

meanwhile the battle is turning into a victory for juba
and proximo  they are defeating the centurions 
commodus sees this  and sees lucius crying in a
corner 

he screams to one of his remaining centurions

					commodus
		kill the boy

maximus whirls to lucius  commodus attacks  slashing
maximus shoulders  maximus sees proximo racing to try
and save lucius as he spins back to battle commodus 

a centurion raises his sword to kill lucius  juba kills
his final opponent turns  proximo just manages to push
lucius out of the way  the centurions sword slices into
him 

juba flings his sword across the room  the final
centurion falls 

maximus sees proximo collapse to a wall  dying 
proximo locks eyes with maximus as he slides down the
wall  the old pirate shrugs  and is dead

juba races to lucius and holds the boy turning his face
away from the slaughter 

maximus his furious passion redoubled at proximos death
attacks commodus with every ounce of strength in him 

commodus eyes begin to flash with something we have never
seen before fear

maximus strikes mercilessly  forcing commodus steadily
back until they are fighting atop one of the elevator
platforms to the arena above

					maximus
		for my wife

maximus strike hard  commodus barely blocks the blow 

					maximus
		for my son

he strikes harder  commodus is losing 

					maximus
		for my father

he strikes with everything hes got  slashing commodus
 commodus sails back  his sword falling 

maximus stands over him  glaring  commodus is panting
defeated glaring up at him

a beat

					maximus
		we who are about to die salute you

maximus raises his sword high  commodus raises an arm 
maximus smashes the sword down  and commodus is dead

a moment as maximus stands over commodus  then he looks
at the series of counterweight ropes around the elevator
platform

he slices through one of the ropes and the platform begins
to rise

ext  colosseum  arena  day

a trap door springs open and the elevator platform rises
to the sand of the arena  maximus stands above the dead
emperor

the crowd stares in amazement  and then begins to cheer
in joy at the return of their hero  a chant begins
maximus the merciful maximus the merciful maximus
the merciful which then grows to a refrain of
caesar caesar caesar

maximus ignores them his eyes drawn to one sight
lucilla

he goes to the steps of the platform leading to the
imperial box  he slowly climbs the steps

in the imperial box senator gracchus is standing  so too
juba and others

lucius is kneeling by his mother holding her hand his
head down  lucilla is dead  lucius mourns with quiet
dignity

maximus looks at lucilla and kneels  he takes her other
hand  a long moment  he looks at lucius

then he slowly bends forward and kisses lucilla deeply
the ritual farewell

he stands

senator gracchus steps to him

					gracchus
		general the purple is yours if you
		so desire  the senate will support
		you

maximus looks at him  and then at the people  the chant
of caesar caesar caesar is like a powerful
beating heart

maximus moves to the edge of the imperial box to address
the people  the crowd grows silent

maximus looks around at the blood of the arena

					maximus
		rome you are better than this
		look inside yourselves  i challenge
		you to find your true voice  help
		the senate speak for you  make them
		your champion and dare to think
		what could be

a beat

					maximus
		i give you back the dream

with that he slowly turns and walks down the steps to the
arena sand  the crowd is absolutely silent

he goes to titus

					maximus
		when everything has calmed down
		lead an orderly withdrawal  take
		them home

titus salutes

maximus return the salute and then leaps onto his horse
as he canters toward the exit he turns for one final look
at lucilla

he sees that lucius is now at the foot of the stairs on
the arena sand gazing at him

maximus stops his horse

he canters back to lucius  the boy looks up at him  a
moment between them

lucius thrusts up his hand  maximus grabs his hand and
swings him onto the horse behind him

a look to juba  juba bows his head with respect
farewell

maximus spins the horse around and begins cantering out of
the colosseum

juba disappears into the crowd

maximus and lucius canter across the arena and through the
huge doors

ext  colosseum  day

from high above we see maximus and lucius riding out of
the colosseum and disappearing into the streets of rome

								fade to

ext  vineyard  dawn

maximus stands with lucius at his old vineyard

it is still scorched and dead weeds overgrowing the
vineyards the house ruined

maximus puts a hand on the boys shoulder this boy so
like his own son

					maximus
		it doesnt look it now but soon
		well have it growing again next
		year there will be vines and then
		there will be grapes it will be
		alive

we leave them dreaming of the future

								fade out
