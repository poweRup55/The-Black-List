  1  ext moruroa atoll islands french polynesia  pacific	1

	grainy kodak color nineteen sixties documentary
	footage of a beautiful polynesian island we see quick
	shots of kimono dragons gila monsters and chameleons
	all in their natural tropical environment

	super moruro atoll islands french polynesia  june
	1968

	incongruously over this jungle environment we hear a
	static ridden radio filtered voice slowly counting down
	in french it is almost as through the reptiles of the
	island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously
	move about

	suddenly with a brilliant flash of white light a
	nuclear explosion mushrooms into the sky

	we see a series of real shots of footage of some of the
	over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
	french government held in this tropical region

	explosion after explosion devastates the locale one
	building after the next accelerating in momentum
	culminating in one final explosion

	the cloudfilled sky begins to drizzle the ashlike
	fallout drifts downward onto whats left of the islands
	below

	we follow this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile
	unrecognizable now and down onto whats left of the
	lizards eggs

	suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
	clean modern high resolution we zoom in on one of the
	eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash we
	continue to push in getting closercloser

	we see the cori akido a japanese oil supertanker

	super pacific ocean present day


  3  int cori akido  bridge  night					3

	we track across the complicated computerized
	navigational console that is actually steering the
	immense ship in the bg we hear a japanese tv
	program playing

	at the end of the console is the ships skipper an
	overweight japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy
	satellite broadcast of a sumo wrestling match

	suddenly the sonar blares out a warning alarm startled
	the skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to
	the console

	the sonar displays an enormous mass heading quickly
	toward the ship the skippers eyes go wide he hits a
	klaxon alarm awaking the entire ship he presses the
	radiointercom

	the ships elderly cook pokes his head out of the
	kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by

	before anyone can answer the ship is rocked by an
	enormous thud as something hits the side of the immense
	ship the crew tumbles as the ship sways violently

	the old cook is thrown to the floor he looks up
	nervously


  6  int bridge  same  night							6

	the captain enters quickly joining the skipper at the
	console

					skipper
				in japanese
			i cant tell

	again the ship is hit an enormous crashing sound is
	heard as the ship rocks to one side tossing the captain
	and skipper to the floor

	suddenly we hear the telltale famous screaming wail of
	our creature from somewhere outside terror shines in
	the captains eyes at the sound


  7  int hallways  continuous  night					7

	the crew getting back on their feet reacts to the
	horrible wailing sound

	suddenly the ship is hit again this time something
	enormous rips through the hull crushing one of the crew
	members as it tears through the walls

	water rushes through the large gaping hole quickly
	filling the hallway the cook and whats left of the
	crew scurry for the stairs as the water level chases
	them


  8  int bridge  same  night							8

	the ships computers are whirling with warning lights
	and alarms as the skipper tries to adjust the controls
	in vain the captain grabs the ships pa system

	but before he can say anything more something whips
	across the bridges enormous windshield shattering the
	glass was it a tail no way far too big


  9  ext ships deck  same  night						9

	the doors burst open as the crew and the cook rush out
	onto the deck again the ship is hit rocking it
	violently


	a tarp

	is ripped away revealing a life boat two more life
	boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately
	tries to hoist them up and over the side


	angle  water beside the tanker

	something enormous jolts out of the water towards the
	ship through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what
	it is but it slams into the side of the ship ripping
	into it pulling down the starboard side as it does
	could that have been a claw


	the crew

	are thrown backwards the lifeboats swing wildly
	several of them smashing into bits as they slam against
	the ship


	the claw

	or whatever it is rips into the side again this time
	the entire ship begins to flip over


	a lifeboat

	bounces off the deck and slides off the side following
	it is the cook

	desperately the cook grabs onto the ships side railing
	to keep from falling off he looks back and sees
	something so horrible that he screams in terror and lets
	go of the railing

	the old cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
	flips over

	the utility van races through this small russian town
	right past a roadblock marked with the international
	signs for no trespass and nuclear radiation

					nick
			what a glorious feeling im happy

	as the van disappears down the road we crane up
	revealing a city sign reading chernobyl russia


 11  ext chernobyl dirt park  rain  day				11

	with the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the
	distance the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this
	field of dirt

	nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van
	he opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic
	cases

	walking a few yards away from the van he dumps the
	cases on the ground opening them to reveal an
	assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment

	taped to the inside are several photos of a girl well
	meet later some of the photos are of her looking young
	and beautiful others are of the two of them happily
	together

	with a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to
	life inside one of the cases are several cables
	attached to long spikes he grabs them and dashes away

					nick

	nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to

	earthworms excitedly tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass
	jar and begins filling the jar with worms happily in
	his element

	unable to hear over his walkman he is oblivious as an
	enormous russian military helicopter lands right behind

	officers coming toward him nick scrambles to his feet

	begin to crack under the building pressure

	the boats begin to move incredibly fast backwards
	things on the boat begin to break and crash down onto

	desperately they try and free themselves as their boats
	are dragged helplessly backwards

	jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either
	cut or snapped from the pressure their boat stops


	another cable snaps

	leonard and his crew tumble to the deck as their boat is
	freed


	the harpo

	is not so fortunate the lone boat dragged backwards
	faster now without the weight of the other boats then
	suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get pulled down
	dipping into the water

	with an unstoppable force the harpo gets pulled under
	water deck hands leap off the boat as the top cabin is
	crushed as the entire ship slowly disappears beneath the

	for a moment all is quiet no one can believe what just

	bleeding from his injuries godzilla leans down and
	nuzzles the burned out remains of his young for the
	first time in the film we can see a partial expression
	of godzillas face pain

	but quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he
	focuses his hatred downwards staring directly and
	accusingly at our heroes

	raymond leads them through this slim alley between to
	large brick buildings they run for their lives as
	godzilla appears behind them

	his claws are too big to reach into the alley so he
	bulldozes his way into it the building ripping apart as
	he marches forward

	bricks go flying as debris showers down on our team just
	they make their way to the other side

	slowed down by the position of the alley godzilla
	swings his arms violently to clear a path

	turns the corner

	godzilla leaps over the entire block landing directly
	in front of the cab

	the cab spins pulling a full 180 degree turn and peels
	out just before godzilla can snap down again just
	missing the cab

	the cab peels around the creature and up the onramp

	just then godzilla leaps after them his jaw open he
	bites down on the cab


263  int cab  continuous							263

	everyone ducks as the enormous jaws of the creature
	clamp down over the cab


264  ext exit ramp  same							264

	taking a gigantic bite out of the highway some high

	godzilla chomps down on the cab

	the large cement sign slams into the roof of the
	creatures mouth preventing him from crushing the cab
	with his teeth


265  int godzillas mouth							265

	the sign supports will not hold much longer as it
	crumbles just above the cab the torn electric cables
	dangling dangerous close to the cab

	godzilla pushes his tongue towards the back of the car
	trying to draw it into his throat

	sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign
	nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab he
	takes off his jacket wraps it around his hand and opens
	the cab door

	grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand he jams the
	cable down into godzillas tongue sparks fly nick
	leans back inside slamming the door shut

	he temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just
	before he is about to slam his jaws shut again


	cu tires  suddenly catching

	as the tongue momentarily retreats from the shock the
	wheels catch and the cab lurches forward


270  ext godzilla  continuous						270

	as the sign crumbles and the jaws crush down the cab
	sails out of his mouth as the beast swallows the piece
	of highway

	landing hard onto the pavement the cab peels out
	burning rubber as it enters the george washington
	bridge

	godzilla swallows only to realize he didnt get them
	seeing the cab on the bridge godzilla gives chase


271  ext george washington bridge						271

	the cab races towards us when godzilla steps onto the
	bridge his enormous weight makes the entire bridge
	wobble

	the cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to
	the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them its
	as though they were driving during an earthquake

	with each stride godzilla takes the bridge becomes more
	unstable

	wail a painful death cry

	his foot stomps down as he tries to retain balance the
	impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that knocks
	the cab into a spin
