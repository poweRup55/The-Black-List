	i wonder toad said to himself presently i wonder
	if this sort of car starts easily
		next moment hardly knowing how it came about he
	found that he had hold of the handle and was turning
	it as the familiar sound broke forth the old
	passion seized on toad and completely mastered him
	body and soul  he increased his pace and as the
	car devoured the street he was only conscious
	that he was toad once more toad at his best and
	highest and he sped he knew not whither fulfilling
	his instincts living his hour reckless of what
	might come to him 

	 kenneth grahame the wind in the willows







	all the redemption i can offer girl is beneath this dirty
	hood 

	 bruce springsteen thunder road









	fade in

	ext long beach street  lower grand  night

	the streets are empty low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew
	of a sky its slightly fuzzy slightly surreal  the vast port of los
	angeles is visible in the bg no cars parked here  no cars
	except 

	a 67 shelby mustang gt500

	silver with deep grill its sculptured side panels ending in air
	scoops  all cock and balls it stands alone in the lonely cool
	before dawn  an oldschool totem to speed and style and then
	someone approaches

	through the mists of morning  in leather coat and jack boots 
	hes early 30s with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer
	that refuses to fade 

	this is randall raines whom they call memphis  though know ones
	quite sure why  but they do know hes the autoboost in southern
	california 

	memphis approaches the mustang with a gathering awe  like a desert
	crash survivor coming upon an oasis  he walks around it 
	admiring it  adoring it 

	but then a firebird pulls up alongside him its driver 
	atley jackson early 30s handsome jocular leans out for

				atley jackson
		you gonna steal her or kneel down to
		her and pray  

	memphis looks at him still enthralled

				atley jackson contd
		i know i know  its eleanor 
		just take her slick  

	and atley drives off slowly memphis looks this way and that 
	no one about  he removes a slim jim from a deep pocket in his
	coat he slims the door panel  pops the button  opens the
	door 

	watch him work quick as shit a screwdriver appears another
	pocket  he pops the butterfly to the ignition

	a ratchet appears he strips the mechanism now a gizmo  asmall
	socketlike device  is pressed into the
	ignition  a twist of the wrist  and the 320bhp 289 v8 rumbles
	like a jackhammer the whole thing took 20 seconds

	he takes a cassette tape from another pocket  slaps it into the
	deck bruce springsteens ramrod wails from the coaxials
	and memphis floors it and off they tear

	the look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction  a grand
	reawakening of longdormant pleasure centers  a speed jones
	fixed and fumy 

	he slots in behind atley jacksons firebird  and slotting in
	behind memphis in a z28 is donny astricky mid30s 

	on they go  the fore and aft car providing escort

	except that from seemingly out of nowhere 

	a police car

	appears behind them

	and donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic  he races
	through a stop sign  and the cruisers bubbles flash on  and
	donny is pulledover  atley and memphis drive on in their
	respective vehicles

	the uniform cop gets out of his car goes to donny

				donny
		problem officer

				policeman
		yes youre under arrest  

				donny
		for running a stop sign

				policeman
		for grand theft auto 

	and off of donnys look 

	we go to memphis in the shelby as four cruisers comes speeding
	toward him sirens wailing

	quick shots of memphis racing the shelby through the early morning
	harbor town streets  sirens peel  memphis turns up the music
	 pins the gas  the chase is on 

	memphis maneuvers the mustang with a dazzling aplomb memphis
	gutterballing the car skating the shoulder the cops in heavy
	pursuit 

	and now hes picked up another cruiser he passes atley jackson
	heading in the opposite direction atley has pickedup a pair of
	cruisers himself 

	memphis on a straightaway now speeds up feels the boost but up
	ahead a roadblock has formed howd they get that deployed so
	fast and behind him the unmarks blaze 

	guns his bitch straight at the roadblock  three cruisers and
	a portable wooden barricade memphis pins her  zooooom deadon
	to the roadblock 

	and at the last moment as the cops dive out of the way memphis
	bangs the gear shift into neutral  yanks the parking brake 
	and the mustang spins on the straight  screeching spin  and
	memphis takes the hard left 

	and hes managed to outrun them finding himself above lower
	grand looking down 

	he can see the secondary pursuit down below  atley being
	chased in the distance  atley is launched from the shoulder
	the firebird rolling down a drainage culvert 

	landing with a sickening thud on its back memphis is horrified

	ext lower grand  later

	rescue team presence atley being hauled out of the wreck his
	leg is a torn mess  hes barely conscious a cuffed donny
	astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser 

	a police car pulls up  and out steps

	castlebeck looks out over the mess  and then looks up
	because further down lower grand a car is parked it is the
	shelby with memphis leaning against its hood

	toward it hand on hip

	the bedroom hes changed clothes  he wears clunky furlined
	moon boots leopardskin speedos and a tshirt  he looks
