           hey bobby champa i went to
           kindergarten with you right sister
           margarets class

bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure of
wills intentions just when it looks as though bobby might
remember him will drills him with a suckerpunch which begins
the

fight sequence 40 frames over m gayes lets get it on

wills momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the
hapless champa out cold

as soon as will hits bobby his friends converge on will
billy jumps in and wrestles one guy to the ground the two
exchange messy punches on the sidewalk

will is in trouble back pedaling dodging punches trying to
avoid being overrun

when will goes for one guy another has an open shot and he
hammers will with a right hand to the head

will is staggered and bleary as a second guy winds up for a
shot he is blind sided by chuckie who hits the kid like he was
a tackling sled lifting him off the ground

chuckie turns to see will still outnumbered its all will
can do to stay standing as morgan drop kicks one of champas
boys from the hood of a car

contrary to what we might think morgan is actually quite a
fighter he peppers the kid with a flurry of blows

the fight is messy ugly and chaotic most punches are thrown
wildly and miss heads are banged against concrete someone
throws a bottle

in the end its our guys who are left standing while bobbys
friends stagger off chuckie and morgan turn to see will
standing over the unconscious bobby champa still pounding
him

angle on will savage ugly vicious and violent

whatever demons must be raging inside will he is taking them
out on bobby champa he pummels the helpless unconscious
champa fury in his eyes chuckie and billy pull will away

the police finally arrive on the scene and having only witnessed
wills vicious attack on champa they grab him

                        clark

           was i remember the class it was

           all right are we gonna have a problem

                        clark
           theres no problem i was just hoping
           you could give me some insight into
           the evolution of the market economy in
           the early colonies my contention is
           that prior to the revolutionary war
           the economic modalities especially of
           the southern colonies could most aptly
           be characterized as agrarian pre
           capitalist and

will who at this point has migrated to chuckies side and is
completely fedup includes himself in the conversation

                        will
           of course thats your contention
           youre a first year grad student
           you just finished some marxian
           historian pete garrison probly and
           so naturally thats what you believe
           until next month when you get to james
           lemon and get convinced that virginia
           and pennsylvania were strongly
           entrepreneurial and capitalist back in
           1740 thatll last until sometime in
           your second year then youll be in
           here regurgitating gordon wood about
           the prerevolutionary utopia and the
           capitalforming effects of military
           mobilization

                        clark
                 taken aback
           well as a matter of fact i wont
           because wood drastically underestimates
           the impact of

                        will
           wood drastically underestimates the
           impact of social distinctions predicated
           upon wealth especially inheriated
           wealth you got that from work in
           essex county page 421 right do
           you have any thoughts of your own on
           the subject or were you just gonna
           plagerize the whole book for me

           that one edge of the larger rectangle
           is an integer

                        will

           time wouldnt it will

                        will
           i think so

                        lambeau
           i happen to know so

lambeau rises and goes to the board

                        lambeau contd
           youre thinking too hard what if i
           did this

he draws a vertical line through the diagram

                        lambeau contd
           now what if i do this

he draws a horizontal line through the diagram he hands will
the chalk

                        lambeau contd
           have you ever played checkers

will realizes what lambeau is getting at in a flash he starts
drawing lines through the diagram energized

                        will
           you colorcode it halfred half
           black if thats an integer

lambeau steps in writing with him will

           that edge

                        will
           an integer

the two stop they are silent for a moment like two
gunfighters after a duel they put down the chalk

                        lambeau
                 checks his watch
           it would appear we got that proof in
           under the wire after all its not
           how hard you look at things young
           man its the way you look at them
           if you take aim before you fire you
           will find the most difficult problems
           become quite literally childs play

will gets his coat

emblazoned on the door is room 101 while the lecture hall
could hold sixty students there are less than fifteen here 
today

sean maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone tired
of teaching tired of life he finds himself resigned to the
tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student body

                        sean
           establishing trust is the most important
           component in making breakthroughs with

           your brother give you the notes okay
           if a patient doesnt trust you then
           they wont feel safe enough to be
           honest with youthen theres no point to
           them being in therapy its like saying 
           fine come here and dont tell me a
           thing but go home feeling like youre
           doing something about your problems
           and give me my fifty bucks before you
           leave will ya

           if you dont help them trust you

           them to sleep with you and that should
           be the goal of any good therapist

                        sean
           yeah

                        lambeau
           he was alive over a hundred years ago
           he was indian dots not feathers

sean finishes the joke lambeau chuckles

                        lambeau contd
           so this ramanujan lived in a tiny hut
           in india no formal education no
           access to other works but he came
           across an old math book and from this
           basic text he was able to extrapolate
           theories that had baffled mathematicians
           for years

                        sean
           and he mailed it to hardy

                        lambeau
           thats right sean he mailed it to
           a professor at cambridge who immediately
           recognized the brilliance in his work
           and brought ramanujan to england

                        sean
           where he contracted pneumonia and died
           at a young age

                        lambeau
           they worked together for the remainder
           of their lives producing some of the
           most exciting math theory ever done
           ramanujans genius was unparalleled
           sean this boy is like that but
           hes very defensive and i need someone
           who can get through to him

                        will
           so whats with this place you have a
           swan fetish is this something youd
           like to talk about

                        sean
           i was thinking about what you said to
           me the other day about my painting
           i stayed up half the night thinking
           about it and then something occured
           to me and i fell into a deep peaceful
           sleep and havent thought about you
           since you know what occurred to me

                        will
           no

                        sean
           youre just a boy you dont have the
           faintest idea what youre talking about

                        will
           why thank you

                        sean
           youve never been out of boston

                        will
           no

                        sean
           so if i asked you about art you could
           give me the skinny on every art book
           ever writtenmichelangelo
           you know a lot about him i bet lifes
           work criticisms political aspirations
           but you couldnt tell me what it smells
           like in the sistine chapel youve
           never stood there and looked up at
           that beautiful ceiling and if i asked
           you about women im sure you could
           give me a syllabus of your personal
           favorites and maybe youve been laid
           a few times too but you couldnt
           tell me how it feels to wake up next
           to a woman and be truly happy if i
           asked you about war you could refer me
           to a bevy of fictional and nonfictional
           material but youve never been in 
           one youve never held your best
           friends head in your lap and watched
           him draw his last breath looking to
           you for help and if i asked you about
           love id get a sonnet but youve never
           looked at a woman and been truly
           vulnerable known that someone could
           kill you with a look that someone
           could rescue you from grief
           that god had put an angel on earth
           just for you and you wouldnt know
           how it felt to be her angel to have
           the love be there for her forever
           through anything through cancer you
           wouldnt know about sleeping sitting
           up in a hospital room for two months
           holding her hand and not leaving because
           the doctors could see in your eyes
           that the term visiting hours didnt
           apply to you and you wouldnt know
           about real loss because that only
           occurs when you lose something you
           love more than yourself and youve
           never dared to love anything that much
           i look at you and i dont see an
           intelligent confident man i dont see
           a peer and i dont see my equal i
           see a boy nobody could possibly
           understand you right will yet you
           presume to know so much about me because
           of a painting you saw you must know
           everything about me youre an orphan
           right

will nods quietly

                        sean contd
           do you think i would presume to know
           the first thing about who you are
           because i read oliver twist and i
           dont buy the argument that you dont
           want to be here because i think you
           like all the attention youre getting
           personally i dont care theres
           nothing you can tell me that i cant
           read somewhere else unless we talk
           about your life but you wont do
           that maybe youre afraid of what
           you might say

           now that he could head up for us

                        lambeau
           at ease gentlemen were looking 
           carefully at all our options

a beat timmy leaves

                        lambeau
           this isnt about me im nothing
           compared to this young man
                 beat
           sean in 1905 there were hundreds of
           professors who were renowned for their
           study of the universe but it was a
           26yearold swiss patent clerk
           doing physics in his spare time who
           changed the world sean can you 
           imagine if einstein had given that up
           or gotten drunk with his buddies in
           vienna every night all of us would
           have lost something and im quite
           sure timmy never would have heard of
           him
                        sean
           isnt that a little dramatic gerry
                        lambeau
           no sean this boy has that gift he
           just hasnt got the direction we can

                        sean
           einstein had two marriages both
           trainwrecks the guy never saw his
           kids one of whom i think ended up
           in an asylum

possible unabomber addition

                        lambeau
           you see sean thats exactly not the
           point no one remembers that they

           say im not sitting at home every
           night twisting my mustache and hatching
           a plan to ruin the boys life but
           its important to start early i was
           doing advanced mathematics at eighteen
           and it still took me twentythree years
           to do something worthy of a fields
           medal

                        sean
           maybe he doesnt care about that

                        will
            

lambeau enters going over a thick proof will has completed

                        lambeau
           this is correct i see you used

           this cant be right
                 examining proof
           this is going to be very embarrassing
           have you ever considered

           im pretty sure its right

will gets up to leave

                 turning back
           can i ask you a favor can we do this
           at seans from now on cause i leave
           work to come here and the fuckin
           commute is killin me

                        lambeau
           thats fine but did you ever think

                        will
           its right
                 a beat heading out
           take it home with you

                        lambeau
           will what happened at the tritech
           meeting

                        will
           i couldnt go cause i had a date so
           i sent my cheif negotiator

                        lambeau
           will on your own time you can do
           what you like when i set up a meeting
           with my associates and you dont show
           up it reflects poorly on me

                        will
           then dont set up any more meetings

                        lambeau
           ill cancel every meeting right now
           ill give you a job myself i just
           wanted you to see what was out there

                        will
           maybe i dont want to spend my life
           sittin around and explaining shit to
           people

                        lambeau
           the least you can do is show me a little
           appreciation

                        will
                 indicates proof
           you know how fuckin easy this is to
           me this is a joke
                 crumples proof
           and im sorry you cant do this i
           really am cause if you could i
           wouldnt be forced to watch you fumble
           around and fuck it up

                        lambeau
           sure then youd have more time to sit
           around and get drunk think of how
           many fights you could have been in by
           now

will turns around reveling that hes lit the proof on fire
will drops it on the floor lambeau drops to his knees and
puts it out he looks up at will

                        lambeau contd
           youre right will i cant do that
           proof and you can and when it comes
           to this there are only twenty people
           in the world that can tell the
           difference between you and me but
           im one of them

                        will
           well im sorry

                        lambeau
           so am i
                 beat
           yes thats right will most days i
           wish i never met you because then i
           could sleep at night i wouldnt have
           to walk around with the knowledge that
           someone like you was out there and i
           wouldnt have to watch you throw it
           all away

lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the
wrinkled proof he picks it up smooths it out my guess is
this is a mistake since lambeau is already at the burned proof
at this time

           happy with myself cause i did my job
           well but maybe that code was the
           location of some rebel army in north
           africa or the middle east once they
           have that location they bomb the
           village where the rebels were hiding
           and fifteen hundred people i never had
           a problem with get killed
                 rapid fire
           now the politicians are sayin send

           wont be their kid over there gettin

           his ass got his old job cause hell
           work for fifteen cents a day and no
           bathroom breaks
           meanwhile my buddy from southie realizes
           the only reason he was over there was
           so we could install a government that
           would sell us oil at a good price
           and of course the oil companies used
           the skirmish to scare up oil prices so
           they could turn a quick buck a cute
           little ancillary benefit for them but
           it aint helping my buddy at twofifty
           a gallon and naturally theyre takin
           their sweet time bringin the oil back
           and maybe even took the liberty of
           hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes
           to drink seven and sevens and play
           slalom with the icebergs and it aint

           hes got to walk to the job interviews
           which sucks cause the shrapnel in his
           ass is givin him chronic hemorrhoids
           and meanwhile hes starvin cause every

           here to help me with this boy not to
           run him out

                        sean
           now wait a minute

                        lambeau
           and confuse him

                        sean
           gerry

                        lambeau
           and here i am for the second week
           in a row with my professional
           reputation at stake

                        sean
           hold on

                        lambeau
           ready to falsify documents because
           youve given him license to walk away
           from this

                        sean
           i know what im doing and i know why
           im here

                        lambeau
           look sean i dont care if you have a
           rapport with the boy i dont care
           if you have a few laughs even at my
           expense but dont you dare undermine
           what im trying to do here
           
                        sean
           undermine

                        lambeau
           he has a gift and with that gift comes
           responsibility and you dont
           understand that hes at a fragile point

                        sean
           he is at a fragile point hes got
           problems

                        lambeau
           what problems does he have sean
           that he is better off as a janitor or
           in jail or hanging around with

                        sean
           why do you think he does that gerry

                        lambeau
           he can handle the work he can handle
           the pressure and hes obviously handled
           you

                        sean
           why is he hiding why is he a janitor
           why doesnt he trust anybody because
           the first thing that happened to him
           was that he was abandoned by the people
           who were supposed to love him the most

                        lambeau
           oh come on sean

                        sean
           and why does he hang out with his
           friends because any one of those
           kids would come in here and take a bat
           to your head if he asked them to
           its called loyalty

                        lambeau
           oh thats nice

                        sean
           and who do you think hes handling
           he pushes people away before they have
           a chance to leave him and for 20
           years hes been alone because of that
           and if you try to push him into this
           its going to be the same thing all
           over again and im not going to let
           that happen to him

                        lambeau
           now dont do that dont you do that
           dont infect him with the idea that
           its okay to quit that its okay to
           be a failure because its not okay
           if youre angry at me for being
           successful for being what you could
           have been

                        sean
           im not angry at you

                        lambeau
           yes you are sean you resent me
           and im not going to apologize for any
           success that ive had

                        sean
           i dont have any anger at you

                        lambeau
           yes you do youre angry at me for
           doing what you could have done ask
           yourself if you want will to feel that
           way for the rest of his life to feel
           like a failure

                        sean
           thats it thats why i dont come to
           the goddamn reunions becaue i cant
           stand the look in your eye when you
           see me you think im a failure i
           know who i am im proud of who i am
           and all of you you think im some
           kind of pity case
           you with your sycophant students
           following you around and you goddamn
           medal

                        lambeau
           is that what this is about sean
           the fields medal do you want me to
           go home and get it for you then will
           you let the boy

                        sean
           i dont want your trophy and i dont
           give a shit about it cause i knew
           you when you and jack and tom
           sanders i knew you when you were
           homesick and pimplyfaced and didnt
           know what side of the bed to piss on

                        lambeau
           thats right you were smarter than
           us then and youre smarter than us
           now so dont blame me for how your
           life turned out its not my fault

                        sean
           i dont blame you its not about
           that its about the boy cause
           hes a good kid and i wont see this
           happen to him i wont see you make
           him feel like a failure too

                        lambeau
           he wont be a failure

                        sean
           if you push him into something if you
           ride him

                        lambeau
           youre wrong sean im where i am
           today because i was pushed and because
