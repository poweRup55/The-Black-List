                                     billy
                              smiling broadly at

                              cheek a little 
                              too hard

                                     billy
                              laughing to the 
                              crowd at the bar
                         busting his balls
                              to tommy

                         send you home for your shine box

               tommys smile turns to a glare as he realizes billy is 
               making fun of him the men at the bar are roaring with 
               laughter  his girl is looking glumly at her shoes

                                     billy
                              to the hoods at 
                              the bar

                         kid was great  he made mirrors

                                     tommy
                              almost a threat
                         no more shines billy

               we see that tommy is still angry but begins to relax with 
               billys apparent apology but as soon as billy sees that 
               tommy is beginning to relax he contemptuously turns his 
               back on tommy

                                     billy
                              facing the bar
                         now get the hell home and get your 
                         shine box

               henry quickly steps in front of tommy who is about to 
               explode batts is facing the bar and does not see just how 
               furious tommy has become

               bar and starts to total the register receipts

                         paulie might have moved slow but 
                         it was only because he didnt have 
                         to move for anybody

               the contents of their bags and packages

                         to kill you  it doesnt happen 
                         that way  there arent any 
                         arguments or curses like in the 
                         movies your murderers come with

                         saw that jimmy was already there  
                         he took the booth near the window 
                         so he could see everyone who drove 
                         up to the restaurant  he wanted 
                         to see if i had been tailed

                         thing in the old days jimmy would
