        aboard a jetliner dade murphy is staring blankly out the
        window wearing headphones exterior view from the
        aircraft of approaching new york city the view becomes a
        direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city
        which then metamorphoses through animation into chips
        and digital signals on a stylised computer board the

        dade goes to work on otv he closes his eyes and a flurry
        of halfsecond video clips from old tv shows flashes by
        he opens his eyes his screen says entering arps 331 and
        then wipes to another screen automated record playback
        system there is a graphic representation of the

                    yak yak yak get a job

        dade presses a key on his keyboard the video changer
        diagram lights up in red at the station a robotic arm
        selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of
        tapes  the america first tape slides out of the vtr and
        is replaced by an episode of the outer limits as dade
        watches drinks coke and smiles full of himself

                                tv
                    you are about to experience the awe and
                    mystery which reaches from the inner mind

                                dade
                    yesssss

        suddenly the arps screen is replaced by an ominous
        message

                                dade
                    yeah okay acid burn thats enough

        dade starts hacking apparently so does acid burn the
        tape changer machines at otv are swamped sometimes
        fighting over the same tape the program on tv keeps
        changing

        the message comes up on dades computer screen

                        i will
                        swat u like

                        like a toothpick

        as the duel continues dade types back a taunt of his own

                        die like the rest

                        you are
                        terminated

        then his own computer confirms for him that the connection
        is terminated

                                dade
                    shit on me

                    its a relatively straightforward question

        dade notices her lips and in his imagination launches
        into a flurry of halfsecond video clips and art bites
        all involving lips and kissing

                                girl

        belongs to dade murphy

        kate wakes up gasping  it was only a dream she pants
        and regains her breath then she smiles she enjoyed
        that dream
