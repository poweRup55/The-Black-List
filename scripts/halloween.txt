               we get closer and closer until we see that the shape is a 
               halloween mask it is a large fullhead platex rubber mask 
               not a monster or ghoul but the pale neutral features of a 
               man weirdly distorted by the rubber

               finally camera moves in close on the eyes of the mask it is 
               blank empty a dark staring socket

               someones pov camera moves up to a jackolantern glowing 
               brightly on a windowsill it is a windy night and the curtains 
               around the jackolantern ruffle back and forth suddenly we 
               hear voices from inside the house

                                     sister vo

               then laughter

               the pov moves from the jackolantern down to another window 
               and peers inside we see the sisters bedroom through the 
               blowing curtains

               into the bedroom comes the sister 18 very pretty she 
               giggles as the boyfriend jumps into the room alan 18 he 
               wears a halloween mask and a costume

               the boyfriend rips off his mask he is a handsome young man 
               underneath they kiss again this time with more passion 
               the boyfriend begins to unbutton the sisters blouse she 
               responds to him

               the pov swing away from the window and begins to restlessly 
               pace back and forth agitated disturbed we hear the sounds 
               of the sister and boyfriend inside the bedroom growing more 
               and more passionate

               finally the pov moves back up to the window inside through 
               the moving curtains we see the sister and the boyfriend on 
               the bed naked making love

               the pov springs back from the window and stalks quickly down 
               the side of the house past the jackolantern around to a 
               door quickly the door is opened and the pov moves inside

               the pov glides silently through the house into the kitchen 
               up to a drawer the drawer is opened a large butcher knife 
               is withdrawn

               then the pov swings around and moves to the kitchen door we 
               look down a hallway to the front door the boyfriend steps 
               out of the bedroom door buttoning his shirt the sister 
               stands in the doorway a sheet wrapped around her

                                     boyfriend
                         i gotta go

                                     sister
                         will you call me tomorrow

                                     boyfriend
                         yeah sure

                                     sister
                         promise

                                     boyfriend
                         yeah

               they kiss again and the boyfriend walks to the front door 
               the sister watches as he leaves and shuts the door behind 
               him then she turns and steps back into the bedroom

               the pov moves slowly down the hall to the bedroom door and 
               peers around inside the sister sits at her nighttable 
               brushing her hair

               she is still completely nude

               slowly the pov moves into the room suddenly we move down to 
               the discarded halloween mask on the floor the pov bends 
               down and picks it up then suddenly the pov is covered by 
               the mask and we see through the eyeholes

               the pov moves up behind the sister sensing a presence she 
               spins around and stares at the pov covering her breasts 
               quickly

                                     sister
                         michael

               suddenly the pov lunges forward the sister continues to 
               stare incredulously there is a rapid blur as the pov drives 
               the butcher knife into the sisters chest and out again almost 
               before weve seen it

               the sister looks down at the blood forming at her hands 
               then back up at the pov with an astonished disbelief

               then in a wild paroxysm the butcher knife blurs continuously 
               in and out of frame slashing the sister mercilessly she 
               begins to scream trying to fend off the blows with her hands 
               then suddenly falls out of frame to the floor

               the pov moves back away from the sisters lifeless body 
               spins around and careens out of the bedroom

               at top speed the pov races through the darkened house to 
               the front door out the door down the steps and rapidly up 
               the street the camera careens along in frenzied flight up 
               the sidewalk up a small side alley down someones back 
               yard then to a sudden abrupt halt in front of mother and 
               father just coming out of a neighbors house

               mother and father stare at the pov at first in puzzlement 
               then slow growing horror

                                     mother
                         michael

               close shot  michael  crane

               the fathers hand reaches up and rips off the halloween mask 
               revealing michael 6 underneath a brighteyed boy with a 
               calm quiet smile on his face

               camera pulls back revealing the bloodstained butcher knife 
               in his hand then further back craning up past his parents 
               standing there up from the neighbors house to a high shot 
               of the neighborhood as the sounds of police sirens rise in 
               the distance

                                                                  fade out

               two headlights appear in the darkness backlighting the rain 
               that pours down on a lonely strip of highway a station wagon 
               hisses along the wet road surface

               int station wagon  night

               the back seat is separated from the front by a wiremesh 
               screen much like a police car marion 30 drives she is 
               dressed in a crisp white nurses uniform next to her in 
               the passenger seat is sam loomis a clinical psychiatrist

               pages in a manila folder

                         then he gets another physical by 
                         the state and he makes his appearance 
                         before the judge that should take

                         years

               both of them suddenly stare out the windshield in front of 
               them

               pov  through windshield  field

               through the rain we see a field off to the side of the road 
               dimly lit by the car headlights are five patients dressed 
               in windblown white gowns drenched by the rain wandering 
               aimlessly around the field

               at the station wagon

               int station wagon

               marion slows the station wagon and pulls off to the side of 
               the road

               loomis jumps out

               pov  through windshield  loomis and patient

               through the windshield we see loomis rush over to the patient 
               stand and talk for a moment then hurry back

               int station wagon

               loomis climbs back in dripping from the rain

                                     loomis
                         pull up to the entrance

                         his purple lawnmower

               ahead of them is the entrance to the sanitarium

               int station wagon

               marion slows down to turn

               through the rear window we see a shape spring up out of the 
               darkness streak through the rain and leap up on the rear of 
               the station wagon

               the station wagon bounces up and down the roof sags in and 
               out with the weight of someone on top

                                     marion
                         something fell on the roof

               the roof continues to buckle in and out wildly

                         something jumped on the roof

               marion stops and rolls down her window to look outside loomis 
               opens his door and steps out suddenly he is hit in the face 
               by a powerful fist from the roof loomis staggers backwards 
               and falls by the side of the road

               marion starts the react suddenly a hand reaches in through 
               the window and lunges at her

               the fingers grab her hair she screams the fingers tighten 
               around her hair and the hand pulls marion roughly to the 
               window

               twisted around in the seat marions foot jams down all the 
               way on the gas pedal the station wagon roars forward

               marion continues to scream clawing at the hand

               through the rain the road spins crazily ahead the wipers 
               erasing sheets of rain

               suddenly the other hand reaches down from the roof and grabs 
               the wiper holding it tightly rain splashes on the windshield 
               obscuring the road

               int station wagon

               the hand rips at marions hair screaming clawing

               pov through windshield

               the windshield is completely obliterated by rain

               int station wagon

               the station wagon skids and whams into the shoulder on the 
               side of the road marion is hurled across the seat against 
               the passenger door

               suddenly the hand springs down from above and slams against 
               the passenger window shattering it

               shrieking marion scurries across the front seat opens the 
               drivers door and scrambles out

               marion frantically crawls her way across the raindrenched 
               road away from the station wagon camera tracks with her as 
               she slides down into the muddy shoulder she looks back

               from the shoulder we see the station wagon in the rain and 
               the shape jump in the drivers seat and slam the door

               then the station wagon takes off and disappears down the 
               road into the darkness

               angle on shoulder

               loomis runs up out of the rain and helps marion to her feet 
               she cries hysterically loomis stares off down the road at 
               the disappearing taillights

                                     loomis

                         costaine wrote that fate was somehow 
                         related only to religion where 
                         samuels felt that fate was like a

               we are in the front seat of the station wagon through the 
               windshield we see laurie get out of annies car say goodbye 
               and walk up to the doyle house

               then annies car makes a wide uturn in the street and starts 
               down the other direction the station wagon pulls forward 
               and follows her

               annie stops three houses down the street and pulls into a 
               garage the station wagon stops several feet away

               the shape gets out of the station wagon close to camera so 
               we cant see him he glances down the street gusts of wind 
               blow the costumes of children going from house to house

               the shape moves camera tracks behind him as he walks toward 
               the wallace house

               the shape stops in front through the front room windows we 
               can see annie talking to the wallaces as they put on their 
               coats

               the front door opens camera and shape quickly move behind a 
               tree to hide from sight

               stands in the doorway framed by the hall light out of the 
               garage comes the wallaces car

               annie closes the door the shape steps out from behind the 
               tree and stares at the house

               angle on window

               the shape moves to see inside a window of the wallaces house

               inside we see annie turn on the tv she goes to the mirror 
               on the wall and begins to brush her hair

                                                                    cut to

               walk up to the front porch a broken rusted rain gutter 
               clangs back and fourth against the house in the wind

               the front door slowly opens brackett and loomis stand in

               suddenly brackett stops he trains his flashlight on a small 
               object in the corner of the room

                                     loomis
                         what is it

               for a moment bracket doesnt speak then he steps closer to 
               the object

                         he got hungry

               brackett gets a disgusted expression and steps away

               int myers bedroom

               loomis and brackett cautiously step into the bedroom the 
               same room where the murder took place fifteen years ago the 
               glow from a distant street light casts the shadows of blowing 
               trees on the walls

                                     loomis
                         it happened in here

               loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting

                         she was sitting here when he came 
                         through the door

               loomis turns and glances at the window he slowly walks toward 
               it

                                     loomis
                         he must have watched them through

               loomis stops by the window

                                     loomis
                         standing just outside he could peer 
                         over the sill

               blown loose by the wind the rain gutter suddenly swings 
               down and smashes through the window with a thundering crash 
               of broken glass

               loomis jumps back reaches into his coat pocket and draws a 
               357 magnum revolver

               brackett stares at him loomis sees bracketts reaction and 
               slowly reholsters the revolver

                                     loomis
                              looks at brackett

                         conscience no reason no 
                         understanding in even the most 
                         rudimentary sense of life or death 
                         or right or wrong i met this six
                         yearold boy with a blank cold 
                         emotionless face and the blackest of 
                         eyes the devils eyes i spent eight 
                         years trying to reach him and another 
                         seven trying to keep him locked away 
                         when i realized what was living behind 
                         that boys eyes was purely and 
                         simply evil

               lipstick and stands in front of the mirror primping

               it was locked she stares at it puzzled

               an instant later a man sits up in the back seat

               he wears a halloween mask made of rubber with the grotesque 
               features of a man he reaches forward and grabs her

               annie screams she lurches for the door the man puts one 
               hand over her mouth and brings the huge butcher knife up to 
               her throat

               anguished face presses against the steamed window her screams 
               are muffled by the closed car

               suddenly the struggle stops

               annies face slides down the car window leaving a track in 
               the wet surface then slowly the track in the glass steams 
               over again

                                                                    cut to

               neck bob coughs and gags from the pressure

               against the wall holding him several feet off the floor

               slamming thud the other end of the knife stuck through the 
               wall

               then the shape steps away bob hangs there impaled on the 
               wall eyes still open in horror dead

                                                                    cut to

                         it was the bogyman

               loomis looks down at her then up at the shattered window at 
               the end of the hall

                                     loomis

               he looks down at the spot where michael should be but there 
               is nothing there just a trampled patch in the grass

               angle on loomis

               he stares down with growing fear then looks out from the 
               house

               the back yard the neighboring yards the street all are 
               empty quiet dark there is only the sound of the wind 
               swelling in the trees

               michael is gone

                                                             fade to black
