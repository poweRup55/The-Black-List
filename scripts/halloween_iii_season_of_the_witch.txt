a darkened diffused image of a man lying on the ground  a
tree is above him  the image is more diffused on the edges
it is black and white and appears to be coming from a
television  the body of the man is practically totally in
shadow

            ladies and gentlemen on the new

int bedroom  night

up to look at his face in the mirror  his room is lit by

he returns to bed and as his head hits the pillow we hear
the ronettes singing be my baby

                                            cut to

an 8mm projector whirring away

int party  home movies  day

opening titles appear over 8mm  home movies in which
charlie is shown along with his friends and family in a
celebrationa sense of one big unending party

during this opening segment we see some of the characters
that will later appear in the story johnny boy michael
tony teresa charlies uncle giovanni and others  they
are all sicilian and are members of the same italian
american neighborhood in new york city  we sense from
these home movies that the neighborhood forces its people
to be strongly tied together in a way of life  family
church friendship  these home movies were taken during
some formal and casual gatherings in which charlie
participated

                                            cut to

ext west side docks  late afternoon

the area is totally deserted except for two trucks parked

another and looking around furtively  michael stands nearby

charlie and the others  he runs an illegitimate bar and
dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles
in from maryland  he also deals in contraband cigarettes
and runs a smalltime loan shark business  he has a knack
for business but he is otherwise unintelligent

michael gets in the car  another man is sitting in the back

ext street  day

a deserted warehouse area in lower manhattan  prominent in
the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox
contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood

johnny boy walks down the street toward camera  john
civello johnny boy is 23 years old  he is an only child
and lives with his mother a divorcee  he is clean cut
looking yet slightly radical in dress  he was expelled
from high school for vandalism and consequently spent
several months in reform school  he is reckless
unambitious nihilistic and was classified a psychiatric 4
f  he is first cousin of teresa ronchali who lives next
door to charlie  he has adopted teresas family as his own
and spends more time with them than he does with his mother

johnny is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper
under his arm and he is smiling  he drops the package into
the mailbox and keeps walking  but he is moving a little
faster now and smiling a little more

suddenly the mailbox explodes  dozens of red white and
blue fragments shower down on the street  the impact of the
blast knocks johnny down  title appears on bottom of frame

                                                            5


he is up in a moment  the camera tracks with him as he
starts running  we see that he is grinning  quite
literally  like crazy

int church

we see charlie full face  behind him is a confessional
booth  the church is very old quiet and dark  the camera
zooms out to reveal rows of holy candles lit in the
foreground  charlie suddenly begins to speak softly and
confidentially to an unseen entity that is off screen

                         charlie
                   confession
            aas you know ive just come out
            of confession  and as a penance
            they gave me ten hail marys and
            ten our fathers

the camera begins to truck out  it moves around charlie and
away from the holy candles revealing charlies profile

                         charlie
                   continued
            now between you and me you
            know how i feel about such things
            hail marysour fathersno
            imagination

the camera has now trucked behind charlie and we see over
his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the
crucified body of christ eyes closed reclining in his
sepluchure

                         charlie
                   continuing
            if im going to do penance at
            all ill do it the way i think it
            would be doneby me that
            isaccording to my own trespasses
            you know what i mean

this conversation of confession will occur from time to time
in other parts of the story as charlie will periodically try
very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his
god the images accompanying these monologues are to be of
free association almost documentary in nature

int tonys place  night

the club is dark and noisy and smokey when charlie enters
he greets tony who is sitting on a barstool  tony directs
charlie to a corner of the club where the rest of the group
is now getting boisterously drunk

                                                            6


charlie joins in immediately taking on the mood of the group

the rest of the club is filled with many different types of
customers teenagers adults pretending to be teenagers
sailors male and female gays and the boys from the
neighborhood the music is loud and the lights are flashing
but the strippers have not yet appeared

                                            dissolve to

tony is at the bar  he is approached by george one of the
bouncers  he seems upset about the noise that charlie and
his friends are creating  tony doesnt take george very
seriously

                         george
            its ten oclock and theyre like
            this  and theyre just starting

tony smiles

                         george
                   continuing
            smilewhat are you smiling at
            this is a business night

                         tony
                   interrupting
            georgedid i ever tell you the
            story about the three chickens

                         george
                   genuinely
            no

                         tony
            too bad

                                            dissolve to

charlies zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs  there
is no particular logical sequence except that events are
suited to the rythmic pattern of the music

1 charlie and his friends dance and sing along with the
   music

2 charlie picks up a billiard stick  he attempts to hit a
   filled shot glass towards tony at the other end of the
   bar  he fails

3 charlie tries to pull a tablecloth off of a strangers
   table without moving the glasses or bottles  this also
   fails

                                                            7


4 a punch is thrown at someone  a lit cigarette in the
   punchers fist creates a swift arc of light in the
   darkness

5 the strippers finally appear on stage  charlie becomes
   obsessed with the negro stripper diane  he shouts to
   her tosses things and calls her names  she tries half
   amusedly to ignore him but she cant

6 tony drinks from a bottle of southern comfort and as a
   chaser swigs down aqua velva

                                            dissolve to

charlie sitting at an empty table watching diane the
stripper perform again  he stares glassyeyed and then
begins to speak softly continuing his confession

                         charlie
            yknowshes really goodlooking
            really goodlooking  ive gotta
            say that again  shes really good
            lookingbut shes black you
            can see that real plain
                   as an afterthought
            when you get down to it though
            theres not much of a difference
            is there
                   he waits for an answer
            wellis there
                   he smiles and begins
                   chewing on an ice
                   cube from his half
                   empty glass


suddenly michael appears and sits down at charlies table
he hands charlie two cartons of cigarettes

                         charlie
            oh greathey  winstons

                         michael

johnny boy enters the night club with two friends  he has
been drinking  johnny boys face shows fresh cuts and
bruises  his friends approach the hat check girl and give
her their coats  johnny boy approaches her giving her his
pants instead  his friends laugh hysterically

charlie is now alone at the end of the bar  johnny boy now
completely dressed enters the bar area  charlie watches
johnny boy approaching and continues his confession  johnny
boy greets people as he passes them and as charlie speaks
he appears to be moving in slow motion

                         charlie
            what do you think  if a man have
            a hundred sheep and one of them
            stray will he not leave the
            ninetynine in the mountains and
            go in search of the one that has
            strayed  and if he happen to find
            it amen i say to you he rejoices
            over it more than over the ninety
            nine that did not go astray  even
            so it is not the will of your
            father in heaven that a single one

animal to wander onto his lap where upon he strokes the
panther gently murmuring to him

the boys watch in silence

leaning over the urinal half asleep  he takes out his
pistol and calmly shoots the drunk three times in the back
to the boys surprise the drunk does not immediately fall
dead  instead he turns and grabs the boy by the throat
they struggle in the open doorway

int bar area  night

the italian music is still playing  everyone in the bar has
frozen in position as they watch the scene

in his astonishment charlie allows the cards to fall from
his hands

the young boy breaks away from the drunk and runs towards
the exit

the drunk running only on sheet determination stumbles
along after the boy

and jump behind the bar for cover

furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on
the wall and various knickknacks around the rooms it is
evident that this is a family apartment rather than a
bachelors pad

charlie is helping his mother pack a suitcase  through out
the scene he is addressing her but she is never seen on
camera  the camera pans following his movements and charlie
directs his conversation always towards but above and beyond
it

supports her family  she has epilepsy which has prevented
her in her own mind from entering into any serious
relationships with men  she has however been having an
affair with charlie for the past year  it is a well kept
secret from both families because the families regard each
other as blood relations

charlie is startled by johnny boy who is now awake and has
begun to dial the telephone

            reputation  he thinks hes in good
            standing

remain the same  as a result the place is dying  charlie

apologizes cleans it with her apron and places it back on
the table  he takes a menu

is half owner of the decaying restaurant  he is in his
shirt sleeves which along with the side of his face are

ext street  day

charlie is walking down the street on the lower east side
a noisy religious street festival is being held on the block

int small italian cafe  day

charlie enters a small italian cafe and nods greetings to
some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the
room  this cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house candy
store luncheonette and meeting place for charlies uncle
giovanni and his associates

giovanni de stefano is sixty  he is well respected and
powerful both in and out of the neighborhood  he became a
head figure not by being introduced formally as was the
custom but rather by fighting and killing his way into the
organization  giovanni is well dressed but not a stereotype
of an old mafioso rather a kindly and intelligent old man

giovanni converses intermittently in italian

                                                           34


a man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in
the corner of the room in the luncheonette area

                         charlie
                   to repair man
            is my uncle back there

charlie points in the direction of a doorway

                         repair man

                         charlie
            thanks

charlie walks through the luncheonette area past the dining
room where his uncle is in conference to the bathroom at
the very back of the cafe  mario is seated with his uncle

mario is forty five years old  he is giovannis closest
associate brought into the organization in the traditional
manner making his early reputation through hits murders
he is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to
giovanni and is very fond of charlie

mario and giovanni are seated with a very old man  they are
deep in their private conversation  charlie passes by
unnoticed and walks into the bathroom

charlie begins to wash his hands but changes his mind  he
shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the
conversation

int dining room  day

giovanni and mario are calmly sipping their coffee as they
listen to the old mans nervous talk

                         old man
                   in italian with
                   english titles
            what im telling you is that he did
            it for marios honor

                         mario
            but you dont understand  i knew
            the kid  he was drunk  he made of

                   in italian with
                   english titles
            giovanni  an insult to mario is an
            insult to you

                         mario
            there was no insult

int luncheonette area  day

charlie is seated at a table  the waitress marie
approaches and gives him his cup of coffee the following
scene is reminiscent of a television commercial

                         charlie
            marie are there columbian coffee
            beans in this coffee

                         marie
            i dunno

                         charlie
            just a second  let me taste it

he pauses to sip the coffee then shakes his head

                         charlie
            yes id say there are some
            columbian coffee beans in this
            coffee but only about 39

marie is disinterested  charlie continues

                                                           36


                         charlie
            you see  you probably dont notice
            this marie but colombian coffee
            beans are rich coffee beans
            bursting with that good deep
            coffee flavor  picked when they
            are ripe to the point of perfection
            the beans of course are protected
            by the tall south american guama
            trees

marie chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table
charlies monologue continues and gradually he falls back
into his confession  as he talks the camera picks up
details of the cafe and the people in it

                         charlie
            then the bean pickers come down and
            pick each bean by hand  bean by
            bean all heavy with flavor  and
            they load them into boxes one box
            at a time box by box

from time to time charlie is casually glancing at marie who
is busy with her work

black  white  color

the images now move out of the cafe and the camera reveals
aspects of the neighborhood  live action and stills
stores people streets buildings in short a concise
vision of the neighborhood  all this is intercut with
charlie mentally stripping maries clothes off with his eyes

                         charlie
                   continued
            like looking at my uncle back
            there  one way is the obvious
            man outside the law  on the
            other hand instead of a breakdown
            of order there is a creation of
            order and instead of the breakdown
            of law there is the creation of
            lawin this society which needs
            new law because whats a crowbar
            compared to a share of stock
            whats the robbing of a bank
            compared to the founding of one and
            whats the murder of a man to the
            gainful employment of that man
            do not think that i have come to
            destroy the law or the prophets  i
            have not come to destroy but to
            fulfill amen

incomprehensibly

ext roadway in front of cottage  day

charlie walks directly to the front door of the cottage and
rings the bell confidently  the door is opened immediately
which startles him  from inside the house we see groppis
back as he holds the door open  he is in a satin robe  we
can see charlies startled face through the partially opened
door

                         groppi
            what do you want kid

at that moment a nude girl her back to the camera appears
in the foreground  this startles charlie even more

boy  finally charlie finds himself alone in the middle of a
dense forest with the boy nowhere in sight  he calls out
but there is no answer  he realizes hes been had

in the cafe which is now singing along with the band

of the song and the band tries clumsily to make its way
through the crowd and out of the cafe

the cafe  he waves to charlie in a friendly manner  charlie
waves back and giovanni looks up squinting to see who it is
michael does not approach the table  in respect to giovanni
he signals to charlie that he would like to see him outside

proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest  tony
comes out of the bathroom and passes by  he takes the photo
from michael  group attention focuses on tony now  he
stares at the picture holds it away from him then closer
to his face then sideways and finally upsidedown

                         teresa

the guest of honor the young soldier is very drunk  he is
attempting to open his going away presents one of which

suddenly the doorbell rings and everyone looks up  the
door opens and charlie appears arms outstretched dressed
as the ressurected christ  with white robes fake beard and
hair and artificial wounds  his arms stretch out wider
the initial shock wears off and tony greets him

                         tony
                   smiling
            hallelujah

charlie enters in mock holiness

                         charlie
            i have come to create order
            scotch and water please

they all laugh  the rock music blares as charlie walks to
and fro blessing all in the room  tony is delighted with
the scene  charlie sits at the kitchen table tony opposite
him and the others gather around  the party is getting
noisier  tony gives charlie a glass of ice cubes  charlie
plays the part of a priest during the mass when the chalice
is filled with wine and water tony pours the scotch over
his fingers first

charlie lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest
would  he signifies that there is enough in the glass
tony then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of sodawater

                         charlie
            may god be with you

                         tony
            and with your spirit

                         charlie
                   gesturing with his drink
            salute

everyone drinks after repeating the toast  the crowd around
them begins to break up as charlie and tony begin to have
fun with each other  tony pulls down his mask revealing a
skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his
mouth  it completes the doughboy uniform quite well

                         tony
                   taking on the guise
                   of an interviewer
            art thou the king of the jews

                         charlie
            dost thou say this of thyself or
            have others told thee of me

                                                           54


                         tony
            am i a jew  thy own people and
            the chief priests have delivered
            thee to me  what hast thou done

michael and a few of the others gather around again as they
continue

                         charlie
            my kingdom is not of this world
            if my kingdom were of this world my
            followers would have fought that i
            might not be delivered to the jews
            but as it is my kingdom is not
            from here

                         tony
            thou art then a king

                         charlie
            thou sayest it i am a king  this
            is why i was born and why i have
            come into this world to bear
            witness to the truth  everyone who
            is of the truth hears my voice

tony leans over towards charlie

                         tony
            what is the truth

the others around them give mock applause  tony smiles and
nods his head to them  charlie laughs  they drink  someone
hits charlie on the back of the head  charlie startled
looks up

                         tony
            prophesy to us oh christ  who is
            it that struck thee

                         charlie

            he does it again

                   putting the bill
                   back into his pocket
            how much was the original loan again

                         michael
            500  he borrowed that because he
            wanted to pay off his other loans
            now counting the interestits
            almost 3000

                         michael
                   exasperated
            he could at least show some respect
            and show his face even if he
            doesnt have the money

                         charlie

filled with congealed red jello  the boys are laughing and
shoving each other about roughly  charlie comes out of the
next room and walks along in a christ like manner through
the madness his arms outstretched  one boy kneels and
kisses the hem of his robe and charlie blesses him  there
is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the
bathroom and near the doorway  charlie promises to save the
sinner as he pushes his way through  he helps the girl
remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the
bathtub  it is obvious that she is quite stoned  she
caresses him and they find themselves kissing  the others
storm into the bathroom and grab charlie

they drag charlie into the next room where amidst all the
shouting and laughing the other members of the party are
placing firecrackers on model airplanes simulating their
own dog fight  they are flying the planes out the open
window

charlie takes everything in stride trying to shout a few
lines over their laughter

johnny boy closes his eyes  charlie looks at johnny boy and
then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight  it seems
totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in
the distance

charlie stands and unravels his robes preparing to take
them off  he projects the image of christ delivering a
sermon  music and laughter in the distance catches his
attention  the lights and the music are coming from the top
floor of a tenement building where a puerto rican family is
having a party  the sound echoes through the streets
decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open
windows  as charlie watches a fight break out over one of
the girls  screams are heard  people run up and down the
fire escape

charlie has pulled off the robe  he now removes the beard
and wig and has become himself again  he leans over to find
johnny boy fast asleep on a tomb

                         charlie
            could you not then watch one
            hour with me

            enough to get you student deferred
            i mean if they wanted to draft you
            you wouldve been drafted by now

charlie feels that it would be better not to pursue the point

                         giovanni
            what marios trying to tell you
            charlie is that youre wasting
            your time with those couple of
            courses you dont need them
            there are a lot of things that can
            be taken care ofyou know what i

is sweating and mopping his brow

fascinated with the flames on the grill  they remind him of
an old device from his catholic school days  charlie brings
his hand forward and closer to the fire testing the pain of
the fires of hell

            than having two hands to go into

int terminal  day

the place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement
charlie is noticeable because he is the only member of the
crowd who walks slowly without any apparent mission or
destination  he makes his way toward the large flight board
that looms over the whole room  loudspeakers announce
planes to and from every part of the world  on the flight
board the origins and destinations of the days flight spin
and change every moment  he passes the insurance machines
and almost stops  more upset than before  a businessman
calmly pays for insurance  muzak is heard  charlie
continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses
and st christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy
dogs and flight bags  he looks at the cross

                         charlie
            i dont know what to say to you

the ticket desk is under the flight board charlie eventually
works his way over to the desk drops his bag on the floor
and stands staring at the board  he sees the names of
dozens of cities flashing before him  as he watches a
pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk

he apparently does not hear her

                         clerk
            sir may i help you

charlie hears her this time  he reaches into his jacket
pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to
her  the clerk starts to open it to check the destination

                         charlie
                   questioning challenging
            where can i go
