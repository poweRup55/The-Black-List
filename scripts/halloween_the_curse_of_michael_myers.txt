halloween 6 the curse of michael myers  by daniel farrandshalloween 6the curse of michael myersdarkness fills the screen  superimpose

october 30 1995

dead silence for what seems like an eternity followed by a 
startling bonechilling scream as we

fade in

int dungeon  tunnels  night distorted

the agonizing screams continue as we move rapidly through a 
labyrinth of winding underground tunnels  glowing torches light 
the way  blurry indistinct silhouettes of grim figures wearing 
blackcowled robes flash along the dank craggy walls

as we blast around dark corners we realize we are looking from 
the pov of a screaming young woman being pushed forward on a 
gurney  plunging deeper into this hellish maze

a door is slammed  wooden  heavy  muffling the screams

spurs clank on a pair of silvertipped cowboy boots as a 
mysterious stranger steps into view  long black duster  
widebrimmed fedora  lit cigarette dangling between gloved 
fingers

int birthing chamber  night continuous

a rat scampers from a hole foraging in the muck of a rotted 
rack  a white sheet saturated with blood covers the parted legs 
of jamie lloyd now 16 cheeks flushed with perspiration
		
		jamie
	oh god its coming  its coming

mary a young midwife rushes in with a bowl of hot water  jamie 
lurches knocking the bowl out of the girls hands it shatters on 
the floor
		
		jamie
	   continuing
	mary mother of god please make it stop

marys face is frozen in horror  jamies screams build to an 
unnerving crescendo  the paiin too much for her to bear

lurid shock cuts from the previous halloween entries  a 
surrealistic blend of images and voices  as jamie relives her 
terrifying childhood ordeal
		
		loomis vo
	 ten years ago he tried to kill laurie 
	strode 

a   laurie strode jamie lee curtis twists and squirms as she is 
     strangled mercilessly in the hands of the murderous shape
		
		loomis vo
	 now he wants her daughter

b   trapped in her bedroom 10yearold jamie danielle harris 
     struggles to open the door  she flings it open  the shape is 
     standing there knife poised to kill
		
		loomis vo
	michael myers is here to kill that little girl 
	and anyone else who gets in his way

c   rachel ellie cornell dies in anguish as the shape plunges a 
     pair of scissors through her chest  tina wendy kaplan dives 
     right into the path of the shapes knife  jamie run

d   jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen shape taking its 
     hand in her own  close on the shapes hand  fingers flexing to 
     life  a grotesque brand on its wrist  an inverted isocsceles 
     triangle that will come to be known as the mark of thorn

e   blinding explosion rips through cinderblock  a jail cell blown 
     to oblivion  firestorm rages  the mysterious stranger appears 
     opening fire with a semiautomatic rifle

pitiful wails of death  officers writhing in pools of blood  in 
the aftermath of this carnage stands young jamie

jamie struggles against her bonds  pushing  screaming  lapsing 
in and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of 
labor  haunted by low moaning voices  chanting

ext police station  back alley  night new footage

resume jamie filled with repidation as she staggers through the 
smokefilled cell into a darkened drizzly alleyway

jamies pov

beyond the clearing wisps of smoke three figures wearing black 
ski masks usher the shape  arms and legs shackled in heavy 
chains  into the back of a white van

back to scene

mutely terrified jamie backs away  into the arms of another 
figure obscured by smokescreen  the mysterious stranger

jamies scream is cut off as the stranger descends upon her like 
the angel of death

a cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare  crushed 
under the boot of the stranger

a moment later jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van  
doors slam  tires screech over wet pavement

the entire precinct explodes in a huge conflagration

int chamber  night

a slap and the first cry of the newborn baby  jamie sobs 
uncontrollably the straps preventing her from reaching him
		
		jamie
	please  give him to me 

the infant is wrapped in black swaddling  the wooden door creaks 
open  jamies eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the stranger 
fills the room  standing at the threshold  waiting to receive 
the child
		
		jamie
	   continuing
	no please  my baby

the dark sentinels march out in somber procession ignoring her 
desperate pleas  torches lighting the way
		
		jamie
	   continuing
	damn you  damn you all to hell

jamies heartrending shrieks are cut off by the cold sound of the 
slamming door
			
			     fade to black

main title sequence

a diaphanous column rises a ghostly slowmotion cylinder of 
flame that burns through the screen to form the main title
			
			halloween 6

the opening credits are branded against the black screen by an 
invisible kenetic force interspersed with a series of cuts

jamies baby is lain upon a primitive altar  ringed by eleven 
stones engraved with cryptic markings

hooded faceless figures  torches held aloft  disembodied 
voices  whispering  invoking a dark spell

mary the young midwife peers around a corner  eyes glazed with 
horror  watching  spying

the newborn screams  the flattened blade of a dagger smears a 
triangular symbol in blood over the babys torso

we move in on this symbol capturing it in freeze frame  it burns 
off into fiery cinders disintegrating into darkness

silence  then a startling clap of thunder as we

a sign post

standing askew in a matted patch of lawn  wind and rain  intense 
flash of lightning illuminates

extint myers house  subjective pov

move along a trail of drowning toys  baseball power rangers a 
deck of pogs  toward a weatherbeaten porch  leftover gallons 
of sears best  brushes soaking in turpentine  a dozen or so 2 x 
2s lined up to replace a row of broken railing slats

pov looks up to the tall brooding edifice  address reads  45 
lampkin lane  fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard  new 
shutters on the narrow windows  a jackolantern grins behind 
filmy curtains  the myers house

despite its recent facelift it looks just as foreboding as it 
did in halloween i

pov stalks down the side of the house around to the back 
door  opens it and quietly moves inside

pov moves across the darkened kitchen  a drawer is opened  
lightning reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn

pov glides past the living room  a few boxes furniture to be 
arranged  and moves swiftly up a long flight of stairs

down the long dark hallway  through a door  a bedroom  
pov finds 6yearold danny strode  tossing and turning in 
the throes of a nightmare

an earsplitting thunder crash causes the boy to bolt upright in 
bed looking right into the pov  sweating  shaking  
petrified

dannys pov

the thunder seems to roar from the ferocious jaws of trex  a 
24 scale model posing on a shelf among an army of jurassic 
monsters  seemingly brought to life by the electrical storm

follow danny

as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into 
the hallway  lightning flashes  with the next thunder crash 
comes a startling barely intelligible voice
		
		whispering voice os
	danny 

danny freezes  slowly turns

dannys pov

an ominous shadow at the end of the hall illuminated by 
lightning  long duster and brimmed hat  the stranger  in his 
outstretched hand the gleaming butcher knife
		
		whispering voice os
	kill for him

back to scene

danny screams  thunder crashes hellishly  lights flash on  
doors fly open  suddenly danny is swept up in the protective arms 
of his mother kara 22
		
		kara
	danny

the little boy holds onto her for dear life  crying 
hysterically  eyes clenched tightly
		
		kara
	   continuing
	shh  mommys here  what is it
		
		danny
	the voice man  hes here

kara looks in the direction hes pointing  in the light theres 
just an antique coat rack  dressed in a hat rain jacket and 
old silvertipped umbrella
		
		kara
	danny no ones there

danny dares to look  but now only cries harder

kara carries danny back to his room averting the steelyeyed gaze 
of her father john strode staunch late 40s wearing boxer 
shorts and a wellworn undershirt
		
		john
	some of us have to get some sleep around 
	here  whats with that kid

kara ignores him as her mother debra careworn face with 
compassionate eyes tries to lend a hand
		
		debra
	let me take him for you kara
		
		kara
	its all right mom  go back to bed

debra sighs resignedly  tim 18 stocky and streetwise wearing 
torn red sweat pants and icet tshirt casually replaces his 
walkman headphones and returns to his room

int dannys bedroom  night a few minutes later

kara opens the closet and switches on the light  satisfying danny 
that its empty she breaks into her perfunctory routine
		
		kara
	stay away monters stay away ghouls stay away 
	from danny  you jerks know the rules 
	   crossing to dannys bed
	better

danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in
		
		danny
	mommy when can we go home

kara sighs  theyve been through this one before
		
		kara
	home is here in grandma and grandpas new 
	house  at least while im in college  
	remember our deal
		
		danny
	the kids at school said this is a haunted 
	house  that a bad man used to live here
		
		kara
	they did did they  since when did we start 
	listening to the kids at school
		
		danny
	but ive seen him
		
		kara
	youve been watching too much tv
		
		danny
	he says things  bad things
		
		kara
	like what

danny is afraid to tell her
		
		kara
	   continuing
	if you mean the things grandpa says sometimes 
	ignore him  once he gets to know you hell 
	come around  let the bad things you hear 
	slide right off your back

kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead  then she 
goes to the closet just about to turn out the light 
		
		danny
	   sitting up panicked
	no mom  keep it on
		
		kara
	okay  but just for tonight

kara adjusts the closet door causing one of dannys school 
drawings to fly off the wall  she picks it up on her way out
		
		kara
	   continuing
	goodnight danny

kara softly closes the door  danny lies awake blankets drawn up 
to his chin eyes wide  still very much afraid

int karas room continuous

kara yawns removes her glasses and rubs her eyes setting dannys 
drawing on a pile of open books  cliffs notes and diet coke 
cans  telltale signs of a latenight cram session

adjusting the dial on her fmalarm clock kara begins to move 
about the little room slipping out of her clothes as the 
subtlyseductive voice of a woman comes over the radio
		
		woman vo
	i know this sounds crazy harry but i love 
	him  i write to him every week i think i 
	even want to have his child 

the woman is cut off by the nasally steeltrap voice of harry 
simms talk radios most popular man of controversy
		
		harry simms vo
	let me get this straight debi  now youre 
	saying that not only does this guy get you 
	sexually aroused but now you want to bear his 
	offspring

wearing only her bra and panties kara moves to a fulllength 
mirror and lets down her long flaxen hair  beneath her studious 
exterior she is quite attractive  delicate features with an 
enviable naturallytoned figure
		
		woman vo
	deep down hes just like you and me he just 
	needs someone to understand him  someone to 
	love him
		
		harry simms vo
	youre talking about one of this nations most 
	notorious serial killers like he belongs in 
	some kind of est seminar  what planet have 
	you been on lady  michael myers has been 
	dead for six years

a click as the woman is abruptly disconnected

kara suddenly whirls around startled by a flash of something  a 
face  in the mirror

drawn to the window behind her she rubs off rainy mist and peers 
outside

karas pov

of the large victorian frame house directly across the street  
another flash of lightning reveals the shadow of a man standing in 
the uppermost window  looking right at her

angle on kara

frightened her eyes lock on dannys drawing  a childs 
scribbling in red crayon  the triangular symbol of thorn

ext myers house  blankenship house

kara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we pull back 
through the pouring rain  toward the house across the street  
an ornate sign on the front door reads

blankenship house  rooms available

crane up toward the window where the shadowy figure stands  an 
insidious crash of thunder as we push through the window

int tommys apartment  night continuous

a macabre display of old newspaper headlines arranged 
helterskelter on a wall  halloween kills escapes from asylum  
horror in haddonfield  michael myers claims 16 lives  reign 
of terror ends as myers perishes in vigilante explosion

harry simms booms over a stateoftheart hifi system  a cassette 
tape records the continuing broadcast

	now weve got someone who claims hes actually 
	seen michael myers  does this whacko caller 
	have a name

staring out the window at the myers house tommy doyle a 
strapping 25yearold with reddish brown hair and intense eyes 
cradles a cordless phone
		
		tommy
	my names tommy  i was only eight yearsold 
	when i saw him  but i was lucky  i survived

tommy paces nervously around his sparselyfurnished attic 
apartment  classic horror movie onesheets and mint first edition 
comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns 
knives and survivalist weapons
		
		harry simms vo
	sounds like youre a candidate for 
	electroshock therapy tommy  dont tell me 
	after all this time you still believe myers is 
	alive

tommy pauses mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings
		
		tommy
	michaels work isnt finished in haddonfield  
	now its just a matter of time before he comes 
	home to kill again  but this time ill be 
	ready

move in tight on the headline frail and yellowed by age

directly beneath this  november 3 1989  jamie lloyd feared 
dead in police station massacre

close on a photograph of young jamie and
			
			     slow dissolve to

int dungeon  chamber  night

jamie remains strapped to the table wrapped in bloody sheets  
eyes closed  deathly still  suddenly an urgent whispering voice 
pierces the darkness
		
		whispering voice os
	jamie  jamie

jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her 
straps
		
		mary
	come with me if you want to save your baby

jamie cant believe her eyes  mary opens a threadbare knapsack  
revealing the baby inside

a soulshuddering rumble echoes throughout the cavern  jamie 
leaps up eyes wide with fear sensing the evil presence
		
		jamie
	oh god  hes coming
		
		mary
	weve got to move  now

pulsing with adrenaline jamie harnesses the knapsack over her 
shoulders and follows mary out into the tunnels

tunnel gate

chains grind over rusted pulleys  a massive iron gate rises 
revealing a pair of filthy work boots  legs planted in bold 
stance as a tall ominous shape begins to emerge

another tunnel

the terrified midwife leads jamie with her baby on a breathless 
flight through the winding network of tunnels  haunted by the 
echoing sounds of the rising gate

stalking pov  through tunnels

gliding forward into the hollow catacombs  slow by determined  
sensing the way

another part of the tunnels

reaching a corner mary stops and sends jamie off in the opposite 
direction
		
		mary
	there  its that way
		
		jamie
	no 
		
		mary
	save your baby  go now

jamie runs disappearing down the dark tunnel  mary quickly 
removes her shoes and tears off now silent

stalking pov

surges around a corner  finds mary  moves in on her

another angle

mary turns in small circles  fear mounting as she falters into 
darkness  heavy labored breathing fills the tunnel

a mask  the pale neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by 
the rubber  materialized out of the void right behind her  the 
shape

mary turns about to scream when the shape lunges out lifts her 
up by the nape of the neck and slams her forehead into a large 
metal spike jutting out from the cavern wall

leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook the shape resumes its 
relentless pursuit  eerie under the lighted torches

end of tunnel

jamie runs frantically  methodical heavy footsteps behind her  
she chances a look behind  the shape is coming

jamie vaults up a dark stairwell  a trap door above  it wont 
budge  jamie frantically pounds against the hatch

the shape mounts the stairs

strength fueled by sheer desperation jamie forces the door open  
tumbles onto muddy ground

ext woods  night

jamie drags herself out of the hole and halfruns halfstumbles 
with her baby through an ugly charred forest  sharp branches 
whip at her face  rain falls  lightning streaks across the sky

as if hellspawned the shape emerges from the underground chamber 
and trudges forward bold and unstoppable

jamie tumbles into a gully nearly dropping the knapsack  she 
picks herself up hands groping at rainsopped earth  the shape 
is right behind her

int pickup truck  night same

a slaphappy overweight motorist sips coffee from a 711 cup 
straining to see the road through falling rain and foggedup

the motorist looks up  eyes go wide with panic  startled gasp

pov through windshield

jamie stands in the middle of the road screaming bloodymurder

ext wooded road  int pickup truck same

tires screech  the pickup stops on a dime  the motorist just 
sits there mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door 
and clambers into the passenger seat
		
		jamie
	drive  goddamnit drive

through his sideview mirror the unsuspecting motorist sees the 
outline of a quicklyapproaching man  unrolling his window he 
rubbernecks a look outside
		
		motorist
	hey what do you think youre 

crunching bone and tearing flesh as the shapes hands shoot 
through the window twisting the mans head off his shoulders

jamie screams  lunges for the steering wheel  slams her foot 
down hard on the gas

another angle

the pickup bullets forward fishtailing up the road never slowing 
down as the drivers door flies open dumping the motoristss 
headless bulk into a muddy ditch

int pickup same

jamie drives  checks to see that her baby is safe  then lets out 
a primal scream  a hysterical release of fear and rage drowned 
out by the squabble of voices over the radio

int loomiss cabin  night same

lightning flashes and rain pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin  
this is a mans retreat and has been for years  dark wood worn 
leather a few tastefullychosen antiques  floortofloor ceiling 
shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of 
awards and degrees all bearing the name  samuel j loomis phd

after a station identification the harry simms show resumes 
tinnyvoiced callers blaring over a handsomelyrestored 1928 
bremertully
		
		male caller 3 vo
	all these fanatics aside harry id 
	personally like to thank whoever did the 
	masked one in  saved us taxpayers a lot of 
	money in the long run
		
		female caller 3 vo
	yeah that suckers been dead for six years  
	its about time they had a halloween revival 
	in this town  now my kids can stop driving me

move in behind a bald sharpfeatured man hunched over a can as 
he reminisces over a collection of framed photographs  memories 
of his wife and children
		
		male caller 4 vo
	what happened to that psychiatrist of his  
	loomis i think was his name  i heard the old 
	quack was dead

turning at the mention of his name is dr loomis himself wearing 
spectacles a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee  for 
the first time ever we actually see him smile  the burn scars on 
his face have all but faded away  last traces of the horrid past
		
		loomis
	not dead  just very much retired

loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper 
article  as he arranges the strips of paper in a leatherbound 
scrapbook a sudden knock at the door gives him a startle

ext loomiss cabin  night same

an ominous figure clad in hat and trench coat stands beneath the 
glowing porch light silhouetted in the pouring rain

loomis opens the door eyes straining in the semidarkness trying 
to identify his unexpected visitor
		
		loomis
	   sudden recognition
	what the devil  come in  come in

int loomiss cabin  night continuous

shuffling inside dripping with rain dr terence wynn a 
welldressed gentleman in his 50s removes his hat and coat 
quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire
		
		wynn
	christ what a night  not even so much as a 
	sign for five miles on that road
		
		loomis
	thats the whole idea of living in the 
	country  i thrive on the seclusion

wynn heads for the kitchen rummaging through cabinets and drawers 
as loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail
		
		wynn os
	dont tell me that the reviled rasputin of 
	smiths grove has grown complacent in his 
	golden years  i dont buy it for a single 
	second dr loomis

loomis immediately senses that wynn has an angle
		
		loomis
	and in all these years ive never known you 
	to make house calls dr wynn  especially at 
	this hour 

wynn returns with a bottle of irish whiskey and two shot glasses  
thrusts one in loomiss hand and begins to pour
		
		wynn
	unlike you sam i learned many years ago not 
	to secondguess the motives of my fellow man  
	remember what freud said  sometimes a cigar 
	is just a cigar  or in this case a drink 
	is just a drink
		
		loomis
	i hope you didnt come all the way out here in 
	this storm just to quote freud
		
		wynn
	as always your keen powers of perception 
	astound me  and youre right  ive come to 
	celebrate 
	   raising his glass
	after thirtytwo years as psychiatric 
	administrator guess who has been named 
	smiths groves new chief of staff
		
		loomis
	but surely rogers isnt 
		
		wynn
	retiring

loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news
		
		loomis
	why  congratulations  i can think of no one 
	better suited for the position

the two old sparring partners drink to the occasion  but wynns 
angle soon comes to the helm
		
		wynn
	of course i need a new administrator someone 
	who can bring new life  and some old blood 
	if youll pardon the expression  back to our 
	program 

loomis prepares himself for the bomb
		
		wynn
	   continuing
	we need you dr loomis
		
		loomis
	you should know that its not wise to play 
	halloween pranks on me
		
		wynn
	youre the only man for the job sam things 
	havent been the same since you left  im 
	recruiting the best psychiatric team in the 
	country  old colleagues  this is your change 
	to finally make a difference

loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable 
easy chair amused at the irony of wynns speech
		
		loomis
	even after my stroke six years ago they 
	practically had to hold a gun to my head to 
	get me to retire  now things have changed  
	ive changed  the ghosts have been buried  
	why on earth would i want to dig them up 
	again

loomis finally looks over at wynn surprised to find him standing 
at the desk looking through his scrap book
		
		wynn
	seems to me theres at least one ghost thats 
	still lurking in your closet

we follow wynns gaze down toward the open page  a blazing 
tabloid headline  michael myers  dead or alive

securing her baby in the knapsack jamie throws open the door  
suddenly the tall man steps in her path
		
		tall man
	are you all right young lady

shaking uncontrollably jamie shrinks away  backing down a narrow 
hall through the door marked ladies room

int ladies room  night same

water runs into a grimy basin  unable to contain her tears she 
washes the newborn  takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub 
the triangular blood mark off his chest

suddenly the lights go out  jamie gasps  clutching her baby she 
turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness

the door creaks open  footsteps echo inside

jamie

has locked herself inside one of the stalls  heart pounding  the 
footsteps grow louder  jamies eyes dart frantically

stalking pov

moving methodically past the row of stalls pushing open each door 
revealing that they are all empty  a crash from the last stall  
pov moves toward it  rustling and movement inside

a hand pushes on the door  an open window above the toilet  jamie 
is gone

ext bus depot  night continuous

jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and 
dashes around the side of the depot

suddenly the bus roars by sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out 
disappearing down the highway

jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot clutching the knapsack  
she throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the drivers 
seat

int pickup  night continuous

slapping down the locks jamie thrusts the key into the ignition  
the engine revs to life  she guns it peeling out of the parking 
lot  back toward the highway

she drives on suppressing her tears stealing glances at the 
knapsack bunched up on the passengers seat  then she turns and 
looks forward with concentrated attention

jamies pov

a sign looms ahead  haddonfield memorial hospital  10 mi

back to scene

jamie sighs with relief steadying the wheel just as 

highbeams flash on right behind her a juggernaut roaring out of 
blackness  jamies eyes flood with terror

jamies pov  through windshield

the grill of a familiar white van shoots forward slamming violently 
against the pickups rear bumper

jamie

is jolted forward in her seat  holding on the wheel with a 
whiteknuckle grip as shes repeatedly hit from behind

ext highway  night

the unseen madman noses forward veering sharply over the double 
yellow line scraping sides with the truck

headlights sear a path through the night locked in neckandneck 
profile  sparks flashing at 70milesperhour

the van forces jamie onto the shoulder  it leaves the road tearing 
branches from trees  jamie screaming

ext pumpkin patch  the chase

a quickcut montage events ticking out in fractions of a second 
like a nightmare

the pickup springboards over a gulch and slams down hard tires 
spinning in waves of mud careening through a vast field  a 
pumpking patch

the van reappears in a glare of headlights  its engine screaming 
with firebreathing rage

the pickup puts on a furious burst of speed  eating up pumpkins and 
spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp

the van bears down hard slingshotting across the field whizzing 
past the pickup cutting right in front of it

int pickup

something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the 
windshield

glass explodes  jamie screams hands going up instinctively to 
protect her face  swerving wildly out of control

she looks to see a sprawling mutilated corpse on top of her  wide 
cold lifeless eyes  mary
		
		jamie
	no

ext pumpkin patch continuous

the pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field  
suddenly 

jamies pov

the shape stands in the field tall and unmoving white mask glowing 
hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights

back to scene

the truck plows into the shape dragging it under slamming headlong 
into the trunk of a huge oak tree

everything is abruptly and shockingly silent  like a phantom in the 
night the van is gone  the shape nowhere to be seen

steam billows from the pickup engine ticking a heap of shattered 
glass and mangled steel  pinned against the base of the tree is a 
shape in human form  a scarecrow

move in on jamie facedown against the steering wheel  coughing on 
the noxious fumes she stirs back to life  slowly painfully she 
shoulders the door  falls onto the ground

a spark ignites  blinding flash as the gas tank explodes setting 
the truck ablaze  jamie turns her face a frozen rictus of horror  
debris rains down on her

suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field  the shape  wielding 
an enormous butcher knife

jamie rolls onto her back screaming
		
		jamie
	no  no

suddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible thud

int pickup

the knapsack catches fire  but inside there is no baby  only a 
roll of paper towels from the bus depot

the scarecrow

burns mocking jamie with its grinning handpainted face
			
			     slow dissolve to

the shape

looks at us white mask scintillating against blinding rays of 
sunlight  rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife

ext myers house  morning continuous

john strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument 
thats been left on his front lawn during the night  puffing on a 
cigarette wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe john raises a 
large axe

a group of neighborhood kids  some dressed in halloween 
costumes  stand a safe distance away  gathered on the sidewalk  
gawking whispering tittering

john angrily swings the axe into the signpost  the kids jump with a 
collective start

thats all it takes  the kids scatter tripping over one another as 
they tear off down the black

sign and its nowheadless rider to the trash

then he trudges up the porch steps dropping the axe as he enters 
the house  uttering oaths under his breath

over cobwebs boxes  the puddle of water at his feet  now 
flooding the entire floor

john sloshes through the water toward the washing machine  which 
is running at full tact

he opens the washer lid and lifts out a waterlogged sheet  it 
drips red onto the white appliance  blood

john backs away loses his footing and slips in the water  
landing right at the shapes feet  john screams as the shape grabs 
him by the neck lifts him off the floor with one hand then carries 
him across the basement and slams him brutally against the open fuse

the shape springs up twisting karas ankle  she falls splaying forward  
the shape claws at her leg  kara fights back kicking herself free of the 
vicelike grip

scrambling to her feet kara rockets danny through the foyer to the front 
door  desperately trying to escape from this reallife house of horrors 
 only to find that it is locked

the shape rises gleaming butcher knife in hand

kara twists the deadbolt but someones secured the chain lock  too late 
to remove it  the shape is right behind them

only one way to go  the cellar  kara shoves danny through

int cellar continuous

kara and danny clatter down the rickety stairs and splash across the flooded 
basement floor

a soulshuddering pounding on the door above

kara ushers danny toward the elevated window

the cellar door explodes the shapes hand breaking through splintering 
the wood as if it were paper

kara hears the shape moving rapidly down the stairs  lifts danny up the 
wall toward the window  but its not a wall  its johns electrocuted 
body propped inside a storage cabinet

danny shrieks staring into johns lifeless eyes  kara pushes him up  
danny reaches for the lock  just an inch away

kara cant lift him any higher  the shape is coming

danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock  he pushes the 
window open and clambers outside

kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves  they break under her weight 
she topples back to the floor

the shape wades toward her  reaching up for the window

ext myers house  basement window

danny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt
		
		kara
	danny help me

karas hand reaches toward him  danny makes no movement
		
		whispering voice vo

int myers house  cellar

karas foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her fathers 
chest  uses it to springboard herself halfway through the window  
clawing at wet grass

the shapes hand shoots out of the darkness below grabbing at her legs  
kara writhes kicking and screaming

ext myers house  cellar window

kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window  the 
shape yanks hard  kara catches herself on the window frame  quickly 
losing her grip

int myers house  cellar

the knife swipes downward swiping her ankle

ext myers house  cellar window

kara reacts to the searing pain releasing her grip on the window frame  
suddenly danny appears locking onto her collar pulling her clear in one 
massive heave

kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up  grabs dannys hand 
and runs fulltilt around the side of the house

ext street  blankenship house

camera follows their frenzied flight across the street  past tommys 
explorer  kara limping  danny surging toward the blankenship house  kara 
screams pounding frantically on the door
		
		kara

int blankenship house  tommys apartment

tommy and loomis have turned the apartment upsidedown

suddenly they hear karas frantic pleas outside  tommy bolts out the door
loomis right behind him

ext blankenship house continuous

kara pounds furiously
		
		kara
	please  somebody help us

danny huddles beside her peering out across the street

dannys pov  myers house

the shape trudges boldly down the porch steps  knife in hand

back to scene

kara sees the shape  walking slowly and deliberately toward them  her 
screams become even more intense
		
		kara
	help us please

the shape closes in  at the last second tommy throws open the door  kara 
and danny tumble inside  into his arms

int blankenship house  lobby  parlor continuous

loomis slams and deadbolts the door
		
		loomis
	get them upstairs  now

kara pounds against tommys chest  hysterical
		
		kara
	wheres the baby
		
		tommy
	hes gone

kara holds danny close to her side backing away in horror as tommy and 
loomis go around the parlor securing the doors and windows  thunder rips 
through the darkened room
		
		tommy
	   continuing
	who else knew i had the baby
		
		loomis
	no one
		
		tommy
	no  there had to be someone else who knew
		
		loomis
	only me  
	   dark realization
	 and dr wynn

suddenly the window behind kara explodes  she screams recoiling  then 
the window in front of her  hands reach through  tommy shoves her out of 
the way

another hand shoots through the stained glass window in the front door 
twists open the lock

danny races across the lobby and up the stairs

robed figures fill the doorways  climbing through windows  moving inside 
the house  surrounding loomis
		
		loomis
	   continuing

the robed figures descend on loomis  drops his 357  tommy lurches for it 
to no avail  loomiss scream fills the darkness like a fever dream

tommy backpedals up the stairs  kara pulling him along as the cloaked 
figures glow toward them  daggers raised

upstairs hallway

kara reacts to the sound of dannys voice
		
		danny
	mommy  please help me

kara rushes through darkness to find him
		
		kara
	danny  danny where are you
		
		tommy
	kara no

kara trips and falls  a pair of silvertipped black boots planted in 
bold stance  slowly she looks up the long duster the cigarette in the 
gloved hand of the nefarious stranger  dr wynn  danny stands by his 
side staring dispassionately
		
		kara
	danny no  please 

kara picks herself up shaking her head in unmitigated fear staggering 
back down the hallway

she turns to see the black figures overtaking tommy  his screams 
swallowed by hollow darkness

alone kara careens through another doorway into

tommys apartment

kara slams the door turns in desperate circles

stepping out from behind the door is mrs blankenship  the baby bundled 
in her arms
		
		kara
	mrs blankenship  oh god  hurry we have to 

as kara reaches for the baby the old woman raises a dagger  her eyes 
burning  her wrist branded with the mark of thorn

kara screams  the old woman opens the door allowing the figures to 
enter the room  daggers drawn  chanting a dark invocation

the coven forces kara backwards  nowhere to run  nowhere to hide

suddenly kara makes a decision  and takes a running leap toward the 
window

ext blankenship house continuous

defenestrating herself kara screams tumbling through the air bouncing 
off the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below  a 
thousand grass fragments raining down on her

kara

lies on her back eyes close hands folded over her chest in silent 
repose  she doesnt move

the house

is still  unearthly silence fills the cold october night
			
			     slow dissolve to

karas pov  distorted  int tunnels

a ring of faceless figures move in completely surrounding her

suddenly the feeling of rapid movement  glowing torchlight flickers 
across dank walls

kara

is being pushed forward on a gurney  strapped down  screaming for gods 
mercy

tommy

is wheeled through another tunnel  his face a mass of bloody cuts and 
bruises  his eyes glazed over trying to find focus  slamming into 
darkness

ext sanitarium  night

lightning illuminates the cold forbidding asylum  the white van pulls up 
to the security gate  headlights illuminate the sign  smiths grove  
warren county sanitarium

the main gate cranks open  the van pulls through

the van

pulls to a stop near the main building  the door slides open and danny 
steps out surrounded by smiths grove staff wearing white jackets  
leading him toward the entrance

landing field

the helicopter touches down  wynn ducks out moving in long even strides 
toward the building

int sanitarium corridor  night

follow wynn through the series of security cages using his key card to 
buzz through  white coats bringing up the rear

through tall mahogany doors they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing

executive reception area

dawn wynns efficient secretary rises with a congenial smile
		
		dawn
	good evening dr wynn  your  appointment is waiting 
	inside

wynn picks up his messages then heads straight into the office  dawn 
resumes her typing  something eerie in her grin

int wynns office  night continuous

wynn and his staff file inside  removing his hat and duster he walks over 
to where loomis is seated  shackled to a chair a bloody slash across 
his forehead

seeing this wynn snaps angrily at two burly guards
		
		wynn
	what is this all about  remove those

the guards comply  loomis rubs his aching wrists glowering
		
		loomis
	wheres the child
		
		wynn
	sam you know you never fail to amaze me  yesterday 
	happily retired today right back in the thick of things 
	somehow i knew you still had it in you

loomis sees his 357 resting atop wynns desk  only inches away  wynns 
hand covers it slips it inside the top drawer
		
		wynn
	   continuing
	come now sam  this is a gathering of old friends  i know 
	how difficult this must be for you  a man of your 
	upbringing and integrity  but now that im in charge i 
	felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth 
	   gestures to his staff
	after all youre the only one around here whos still in 
	the dark as it were  this isnt the way i wanted to tell 
	you but youve really given me no other choice
		
		loomis
	this is madness wynn
		
		wynn
	your madness is another mans greatness  this is the way 
	things have always been  youve just been too blinded by 
	your own reality to see 
	   beat
	but having you on the outside has been convenient for us in 
	many ways 
	   smiles
	you always did come through  our loyal watch dog  
	finding him bringing him back to us once hed finished his 
	work  although after you had that nasty stroke the last 
	time i had to go after him myself  and what a terrible 
	time we had getting him out of that jail cell
		
		loomis
	it was you
		
		wynn
	   lights a cigarette
	sometimes a cigar is just a cigar
		
		loomis
	why did you take jamie
		
		wynn
	she has the gift  the blood of thorn running through her 
	veins  michaels mother had it too  so for six years i 
	incubated her prepared her for this night  michael has 
	served his purpose  and soon we will have a new progeny
		
		loomis
	jamies baby 
		
		wynn
	there you go trying to make sense again 
	   grimly entranced
	its a curse  handed down through countless generations  
	as ageless as this celebration which you call halloween
		
		loomis
	samhain
		
		wynn
	and im its deliverer 
	   slams his key card on the desk
	its calling card if you will  i follow it  protect it  
	act as its guardian  in a sense sam so do you

loomis shudders rocked by these revelations
		
		wynn
	   continuing
	i know you have more questions my friend and theres so 
	much more for you to try to make sense of

loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office  wynn and 
his white coats flow out behind him

int cell  night

a tight damp claustrophobic space  tommy is strapped upright to a crude 
metal rack not unlike the one jamie was bound to the night before

feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge cutting through 
skin wearing away his bonds  breaking through

int tunnels  night continuous

a group of white coats led by wynn usher loomis off an old service 
elevator leading him through the dark passageway  wynn turns around 
surveying the tunnel  as he walks on we see something fall from his back 
pocket

as they disappear down another tunnel a wooden door slowly creaks open  
tommy appears cautiously stepping out into the catacombs  edging along 
the dank torchlit walls  wind moans  rats scamper past his feet

wynn has dropped his security key card  tommy swipes it

int catwalk same

loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell  
the shape lies inside  dormant

wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession  michael myers
		
		wynn
	look at him  so silent yet so deadly he moves when i 
	tell him to  act on my impulses  feels what i feel

wynn demonstrates  loomis looks on spellbound
		
		wynn
	   continuing
	michael  rise

below the shape slowly rises  wynn takes out his trusted switchblade
		
		wynn
	   continuing
	michael  pain

wynn cuts his hand  the shape grabs his own hand in agony  wynn smiles 
sucking the bleeding gash
		
		wynn
	   continuing
	michael  kill

suddenly wynn whirls around throwing dawn  his faithful secretary  
inside the shapes pit  wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified 
screams trail away into bloodgurgling silence

loomis closes his eyes in anguish
		
		loomis
	youve created a monster
		
		wynn
	amazing isnt it  i even taught him to drive

wynn carries on without remorse  loomis is brutally shoved forward
		
		wynn
	   continuing
	were not the only ones you know there are many 
	believers  generous contributors to our church  youd be 
	amazed to know how far it reaches

int catacombs  storage bunker

a metal door buzzes open  tommy makes his way furtively inside 
pocketing the key card

a storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates  tommy pries one of 
them open  eyes widening in startled disbelief

a small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside
		
		tommy
	holy shit 

tommy lifts a rifle awed by its devastating lines then slams in a 
cartridge and bolts out the door  back into the tunnels

int ceremonial room  night

a large amberhued chamber  the chanting coven forms a circle around a 
primitive stone altar where kara is tied down wearing a white gown her 
head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe

a wooden symbol of thorn like an inverted crucifix hangs in a place of 
reverence

behind the altar the shape stands in its cell  waiting

loomis is led inside  wynn glides through this macabre gathering up to 
the altar  looming over the terrified kara

the chanting continues as wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe  at 
wynns gesture there is silence  the worshippers offer an obedient 
response removing their hoods baring the mark of thorn on their wrists

we recognize many of the faces in the congregation  wynns staff  dr 
bonham  mrs blankenship  the crosseyed attendant from the bus depot  
people from all walks of life

faces glazed with sadistic rapture
		
		wynn
	   prophetically
	behind disciples of thorn  the final sign  the birth of 
	the heretic child delivered unto us on the eve of our 
	great feast of the sun  as i have foreseen it

jamies baby is carried forth crying as it is lain inside a baptismal urn 
beside kara  ringed by candles and a circle of stones  eleven in all  
etched with symbolic runes

int tunnels

letting the rifle guide him tommy makes his way through the tunnels  
toward the sound of muffled chanting up ahead

ceremonial room

the coven chants its invocation  wynn draws a magic circle around the 
infant with blood from a silver chalice  then he inscribes a pentagram in 
the air with an ornate dagger
		
		wynn
	spirits and powers of the flame attend and witness this 
	ritual  bear our gifts to thorn  open us to the path of 
	darkness  by these runes transform us open our eyes and 
	show us the chosen one to whom we offer this sacrifice of 
	innocent blood

suddenly danny is issued forth up to the altar  his eyes dark lifeless 
pools  kara struggles against her bonds
		
		kara
	danny

loomis lurches forward  halted by massive restraining hands

catwalk

tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip looking down upon the 
evil ritual  startled by the sound of rusted chains  pulleys cranking  
the shapes cell being opened

ceremonial room

the shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward  strangely calm  
hypnotized  looming above kara  she lets out a scream of unbridled terror 
as he raises a gleaming dagger

wynn stands behind danny  places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft
above the baby
		
		wynn
	strong and fierce thorn thundered by thy hammer we summon 
	thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood  let thy 
	darkness descend on your son danny  lord of the dead

danny drifts into the dark spell holding the dagger above the screaming 
infant  wynn speaks in the ominous whispering voice
		
		wynn
	   continuing
	kill for him danny  kill for him

kara cries appealing to the boy inside of michael
		
		kara
	michael please  you can make him stop  you remember 
	dont you

the shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask  listening  
reminded of his mother
		
		kara
	   continuing
	remember what he did to you that night what his voice told 
	you to do  you can stop it michael  stop the voice 
	forever

dannys eyes flash like fire  the chanting is insidious
		
		wynn
	kill him danny  kill him
		
		kara
	danny dont listen  the voice isnt real

danny turns sharply seeing his mother  suddenly terrified
		
		wynn
	kill him danny  you feel the rage inside  you are thorn

suddenly danny drops the dagger  wynn flies at him screaming like an 
enraged beast  the shape raises its dagger and plunges it  into wynn

wynns eyes go wide with shock  the shape lurches empathetically  wynn 
staggers yanks the blade from his stomach

rapidfire gunshots rip through the chamber as tommy lets loose a barrage 
of bullets from above  taking out several coven members the rest scattering
retreating into the tunnels

loomis dives danny a split second before he through karas bonds with the 
dagger

kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by gunfire  the 
altar decimated  candles falling  setting the room ablaze

wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk  wooden girders crash 
down from the ceiling  tommy pitches to the floor dropping the rifle

the shape staggers trying to get to its feet  slowly  painfully  flames 
lapping at its back

loomis crawls toward the rifle  grabs it  rises just as wynn seizes danny 
a dagger at his throat  pulling him away
		
		loomis
	no
		
		wynn
	stay away sam
		
		loomis
	leave the boy  take me

loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of wynn  surrendering himself

tommy drags himself toward kara and the baby  paralyzed with horror as they try to 
anticipate wynns move
		
		wynn
	   smiles trenchantly
	goodbye dr loomis

loomis turns  gasps in startled reflex  the shape rises up behind him 
swiping the dagger across his chest

wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with danny
		
		danny
	mommy
		
		kara
	danny

tommy and kara race across the flameengulfed room reaching the door just 
as it slams shut  cutting them off

the shape the trail of flames growing on its back hurls loomis over the 
crushed altar

tommy sees loomis writhing on the floor about to go for him when 

the shape turns on them  tommy stands in front of kara and the baby 
backing away propelling them out into the tunnels

the shape walks forward in fevered pursuit all but consumed by fire

tunnels

tommy kara and danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze

loomis

painfully crawls away
		
		loomis
	die michael  in the name of god die

end of tunnel

tommy kara and danny reach the tunnel end  kara pounds frantically on the 
elevator panel  a deafening roar  the sound of fire as the shape sweeps 
toward them

the shape

glides steadily through the tunnels  a walking pillar of flame  undaunted  
unstoppable  hellspawned

end of tunnel

finally the doors open  kara and tommy barrel inside  mashing buttons until 
the doors close  a millisecond before the shape reaches them

int elevator

kara cradles the baby  tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator moans and 
grinds toward ground level  the doors open

int sanitarium corridor

they barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor
		
		tommy
	this way

tommy leads her toward an exit sign  behind them the elevator doors close 
the indicator light shows it moving down

they reach a dead end  the row of coded security cages
		
		kara
	what now
		
		tommy
	   realization
	wait a minute 

he reaches into his pocket  withdrawing wynns key card

suddenly the elevator doors open  fire gusts  the shape emerges totally 
engulfed in flame  the emergency sprinklers are activated  dousing the 
flames as it walks after them

tommy panics runs the key card  the gate buzzes open  they run through  
the shapes hands lurch through the bars missing kara by inches

they race toward the next gate  the gate behind them opens and the shape 
walks through

tommy runs the card again  the gate buzzes  they slam it  one step 
ahead of the shape

the third and final gate  tommy tries the card  nothing
		
		kara
	come on
		
		tommy
	   tries it again
	its not working

the shape moves through the last gate  inside the cage with them
		
		tommy
	   continuing
	someones controlling it

int wynns office same

standing behind his computer observing them on the security monitors dr 
wynn jams the cards access code  then he grabs his satchel and strides 
quickly out of the office  pulling danny with him

on the screens we can see the shape approaching  karas scream can almost 
be heard on the silent monitor

int security cage same

kara screams as the shape rakes tommy against the cage  kara cowers in the 
corner protecting the baby

ext sanitarium  field  night same

wynn races with danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter  
getting ready for takeoff as they duck inside

int security cage

the shape slams tommys head against the bars he slumps to the floor  then 
turns its murderous attention on kara and the baby

int wynns office

a hand reaches into the top desk drawer removes the 357 and fires an entire 
round into the security console  destroying it

the man holding the gun is loomis

int security cage

the door buzzes open  kara drags tommy and the baby out  slamming the door 
shut on the shape  trapping it inside

the shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms

ext sanitarium  landing field

tommy comes to as he races with kara and the baby across the windswept field  
suddenly they stop dead watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off

kara stands paralyzed with shock looking skyward  the helicopter disappears 
into the gloomfilled night

tommy drags kara in another direction  a vehicle parked nearby  the white 
van

int van same

kara lifts the baby inside  tommy flops down in the drivers seat  face 
bruised and bloody  a key in the ignition

kara holds jamies baby  tears falling
		
		kara
	how will we ever find him

tommys gaze terrifies her  he starts the engine and tears off toward the 
sanitarium gate

kara looks down at the baby then stares numbly forward

in the back of the van we can see the the shapes white mask  glowing in 
the darkness  emerging

kara and tommy drive on unaware  and that for now is how we leave them
			
			     fade out

roll final credits
