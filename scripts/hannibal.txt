               sides  pulls to a stop  the back doors open from the inside 
               and starling is the first one out  wellrested and alert

               kevlar vest drop a colt 45 into a shoulder holster and a 
               38 into an ankle holster  she straightens up approaches

               the swat vans pull into position one to the side of the 
               building across from the fish market the other around back  
               as the battered van pulls to the curb in front a mint low 
               rider impala convertible stereo thumping cruises past

               int panel van  day

               the thumping fades leaving the macarena filtering in

               starling pulls the cover off the eyepiece of a periscope 
               bolted to the ceiling of the van and makes a full rotation 
               of the objective lens concealed in the roof ventilator 
               catching glimpses of

               a man with big forearms cutting up a mako shark with a curved 
               knife hosing the big fish down with a powerful handheld 
               spray

               young men idling on a corner in front of a bar  others 
               lounging in parked cars talking  some children playing by 
               a burning mattress on the sidewalk others in the rainbow 
               spray from the fishmongers hose

               above concrete steps  it opens

                         heads up

               a large white man in a luau shirt and sandals comes out with 
               a satchel across his chest other hand behind the case

               a wiry black man comes out the door behind him carrying a 
               raincoat and behind him evelda drumgo

                                     starling

               the slide of his riot gun  the back doors open and starling 
               is the first one out barking 

                                     starling
                         down on the ground  down on the 
                         ground

               no one gets down on the ground  not evelda drumgo not her 
               men none of the merchants or bystanders  the macarena keeps 
               blaring

               drumgo turns and starling sees the baby in the blanketed 
               sling around her neck  she can also hear the roar of a big 
               v8 and hopes its her backup

               drumgo turns slightly and the baby blanket flutters as the 
               mac 10 under it fires shattering brighams face shield  as 
               he goes down hawaiian shirt drops his satchel and fires a 
               shotgun blowing out the car window next to burke

               toward starling  two shooters cheyennestyle in the rolled 
               down window frames spraying automatic fire over the top

               starling dives behind two parked cars  hare and bolton fire 
               from behind another  auto glass shatters and clangs on the 
               ground

               everyone in the market scrambling for cover finally hitting 
               the fishbloodied cement  the macarena still blasting

               pinned down starling watches the wiry black man drop back 
               against the building drumgo picks up the satchel the gunship 
               slowing enough for someone to pull her in

               starling stands and fires several shots taking out hawaiian 
               shirt the other man by the building the driver of the 
               accelerating cadillac one of the men perched on the window 
               frames  drops the magazine out of her 45 slams another in 
               before the empty hits the ground

               the cadillac goes out of control sideswiping a line of cars 
               grinds to a stop against them  starling moving toward it 
               now following the sight of her gun  a shooter still sitting 
               in a window frame alive but trapped chest compressed between 
               the cadillac and a parked car  gunfire from somewhere behind 
               starling hits him and shatters the rear window

                                     starling
                         hold it  hold your fire  watch the 
                         door behind me  evelda

               the firing stops but the pounding of the macarena doesnt

                                     starling
                         evelda  put your hands out the 
                         window

               nothing for a moment  then drumgo emerges from the car 
               head down hands buried in the blanketsling cradling the 
               crying baby

                                     starling
                         show me your hands

                         please  show me your hands

               evelda looks up at her finally fondly it seems doesnt 
               show her hands

                                     drumgo

               she smiles sweetly  the blanket flutters  starling falls

               fires high enough to miss the baby  hits drumgo in the neck

               she goes down

               starling crawling in the street the wind knocked out of her 
               from the hits to her chest to her vest  reaches drumgo 
               blood gushing out of her onto the baby  she pulls out a 
               knife  cuts the harness straps  runs with the baby to the 
               merchant stalls as enterprising tourists click shots from 
               the ground with disposable cameras

               starling sweeps away knives and fish guts from a cutting 
               table  lays the baby down  strips it  grabs the handheld 
               sprayer and washes at the slick coating of hiv positive blood 
               covering the baby a sharks head staring macarena pounding 
               disposable cameras clicking the river of bloody water running 
               along a gutter to where brigham lies dead

               rain spilling off the rims of their umbrellas

               a casket is being lowered in  starling watches as it 
               descends watches the gears of the hoist working and the box 
               disappearing beneath the edge of the muddy hole not allowing 
               herself to cry or to meet the eyes of certain other mourners

                                     crawford
                         i told mason i wanted you off the 
                         street  i told him what i told you 
                         when i left the bureau you go out 
                         with a gun enough times you will be 
                         killed by one i told him i want 
                         you where you belong in behavioral 
                         science  know what he said

                                     starling
                         he can speak

                                     crawford
                         its about the only thing he can do  
                         he said after a very long pause 
                         oh what a good idea jack
                              crawford tries to 
                              smile
                         who he called i dont know  someone 
                         higher up than anyone in that room 
                         with you  maybe representative 
                         vollmer who mason may not own but 
                         does rent from time to time

               silence as starling tries to take it all in  she looks up 
               with a question forming in her mind and crawford nods before 
               she can say it  very matter of fact 

                                     crawford
                         yeah thats right it means going 
                         back on the lecter case

               he busies himself with the phone messages again arranging 
               them in little prioritized piles on his desk as if perhaps 
               this conversation is about nothing more important than a 
               simple missing person case

                                     starling
                         what if i said to you id rather not 
                         do that  what if i said to you i 
                         prefer the street

                                     crawford
                         you think this is a cheap deal  
                         what you were getting was a cheap 
                         deal  what they say about federal 
                         examiners is true they arrive after 
                         the battle and bayonet the wounded  
                         youre not safe on the street anymore

               starling takes another look at the photographs of verger

                                     starling
                         has something happened on the case

                                     crawford
                         has lecter killed anybody lately  i 
                         wouldnt know im retired from all 
                         that  mason doesnt know either 
                         but he does apparently have some new 
                         information  which hell only share 
                         with you

               they consider one another for a long moment  finally 

                                     crawford
                         hes not pretty starling  and i 
                         dont just mean his face

               ext maryland  day

               bare trees  overcast sky  starlings mustang growling along 
               the rainslicked expressway

               int mustang  moving  day

               a maryland state map spread out across the passenger seat

               starlings eyes darting back and forth between the black and 
               red routeveins and the shrouded countryside out beyond the 
               slapping wiper blades

               an exit sign  and the exit itself  looms suddenly and rushes 
               across the right side of her windshield  she curses to 
               herself  its the exit she wanted but now its gone 
               shrinking in her rearview mirror into the mist

               ext the verger estate  day

               coming back the other way along a service road starling 
               slows to consider a chainlink gate stretched across a muddy 
               road then continues on

               at the gate house of the main entrance a security guard 
               checks her name against a list  he seems reluctant to get 
               himself or his clipboard wet but not her identification 
               handing it out past the edge of his umbrella to her

               the mustang negotiates a long circuitous drive taking her 
               deeper and deeper into vast forest land  eventually though 
               a good mile from the gate house behind her the trees give 
               way to a clearing and she sees the big stanford white 
               designed mansion emerging from the mist up ahead

               a man waits under an umbrella out front indicates to her 
               where to park  anywhere one should think  theres enough 
               space for fifty cars  then comes around to the drivers 
               side and opens the door

                                     cordell
                         ms starling  hi  im cordell  
                         mr vergers private physician

                                     starling
                         how do you do

               she gathers her things out from under the map  file folder 
               microcassette recorder extra tapes and batteries  he helps 
               her out then presses up against her to help maximize the 
               umbrellas effectiveness

                                     cordell
                         shall we make a run for it

               as they hurry toward the porch  if it can be called a porch 
               as grand an entrance as a kings or english rock stars 
               manor  starling notices the buildings one modern wing 
               sticking out like an extra limb attached in some grotesque 
               medical experiment

               int vergers mansion  day

               they cross through a living room larger than most houses 
               then down a hall their shoes moving along a moroccan runner 
               sleeves past portraits of importantlooking dead people

               as they cross a threshold theres an abrupt shear in style 
               the rich carpet giving way to polished institutional floors 
               the portraitlined walls to shiny white enamel

               cordell reaches for the handle of a closed door in the new 
               wing and starling notices line of lights appear around the 
               jamb where there were none

               as the door opens she squints  two small photographers 
               spots on stands pitch narrow beams of light into her face 
               and seem to follow her progress into the room

                                     cordell
                              a whisper
                         ones eyes adjust to the darkness  
                         this way is better

               he leads her to a sitting area where a print of william 
               blakes the ancient of days hangs above a large aquarium 
               divided in two by a wall of glass  an ell gliding around on 
               one side a fish on the other  a bank of security monitors 
               completes the decor  to the spotlight 

                                     cordell
                         mr verger ms starling is here

               the light stands flank a hospital bed the beams effectively 
               camouflaging the figure on it in their glare

                                     starling
                         good morning mr verger

                         mr

               the voice is steady and resonant  an educated voice not 
               unlike lecters  before cordell can answer him 

                                     mason

               starling sits with her things  snaps open the little door 
               of her cassette recorder to verify theres a tape inside

                         cordell i think you can leave us 
                         now

                                     cordell
                         thought i might stay  perhaps i 
                         could be useful if 

                                     mason
                         you could be useful seeing about my 
                         lunch

               starling gets up but not to see him out  once hes gone 

                                     starling
                         id like to attach this microphone 
                         to your  clothing or pillow  if 
                         youre comfortable with that

                                     mason
                         by all means

               she walks slowly toward the bed or rather to the lights 
               uncertain exactly what position verger may be in  on his 
               back his side she has no way of knowing

                                     mason
                         here this should make it easier

               a finger like a pale spider crab moves along the sheet and 
               depresses a button  the lights suddenly extinguish and 
               starlings pupils dilate  as her eyes adjust to the darkness 
               vergers face materializes in it like something dead rising 
               up through dark water

               face is the wrong word  he has no face to speak of  no 
               skin at least  teeth he has  he looks like some kind of 
               creature that resides in the lowest depths of the sea

               she doesnt flinch  maybe the hand with the microphone 
               recoils an inch or two but thats it  she clips it to the 
               flannel lapel of his pajamas drapes the skinny cord over 
               the side of the pillow and sets the recorder on the medical 
               table next to the bed

                                     mason

               of wine in hand

                                     mason

                         up among other things  where you 
                         sort of hang yourself but not really  
                         it feels good while you  you know

               flashcut to some dogs watching verger with the noose around 
               his neck and lecter offering him some amyl nitrite

                                     mason

                         highball  lovely  i was flying 

               flashback to masons image in a fulllength mirror shattering 
               as lecter kicks it

                                     masons voice
                         the good doctor came over with a 
                         piece of broken mirror  mason he 
                         said 

                                     lecter
                         show me how you smile to get the 
                         confidence of a child

               lecter holds a shard of mirror glass in front of him

                                     lecter
                         uhhuh  do you ever smile  oh i 
                         see how you do it  now mason lets 
                         say you had to hide that kindly 
                         fictitious mask  how would you do 
                         it

               verger tries to look serious or mean but his features are 
               just too sweet even with a noose around his neck

                                     lecter
                         no i still see it  try again
                              verger tries again
                         no  no im afraid not  try this
                              hands him the glass
                         try peeling off your face with this 
                         and feeding it to the dogs

               as verger lifts the broken glass to his face 

               back to the faceless verger in the bed his claw of a hand 
               gripping invisible glass 

                                     mason
                         well you know the rest
                              shrugs
                         seemed like a good idea at the time

               starling looks like someone who has just received much more 
               information than she ever needed or wanted  cordell comes 
               in quietly with vergers lunch on a rolling cart and trying 
               not to interrupt arranges the silverware and pours some 
               water

                                     starling
                         mr verger you

                                     starling

                              her eyes dart to the 
                              tape and his follow 
                              them
                         to my office  that youve received 
                         some kind of new information

                                     mason
                         look in the drawer of the end table

               starling takes out a pair of thin cotton gloves and puts 
               them on  in the drawer she finds a large manila envelope 
               and in it an xray of an arm

                                     starling
                         where did this come from

                                     mason
                         buenos aires  i received it two

                         question  i dont know  there was 
                         nothing written on it of interest  
                         did i throw it out

               starling smells a rat but keeps it to herself  takes a 
               closer look at the xray while cordell busies himself climbing 
               a step ladder next to the aquarium

                                     mason
                         think it will help  i hope so  i 
                         hope itll help you catch him if 
                         for no other reason than to heal the 
                         stigma of your recent dishonor

               she switches off the tape recorder

                                     starling

                         to each other through the glass  
                         theyre even company for one another

               cordells gloved hand grips the snapper and transfers it to 
               the other side of the aquarium where the eel at once rips a 
               piece out of it  starling tries to ignore it and reaches to 
               unclip the microphone from vergers pajamas lapel

                                     mason

                              removes the mask
                         if youll let me keep it  i can a 
                         lot of money for this and get out of 
                         here for good  i want to travel 
                         and see every vermeer in the world 
                         before i die

               she thinks about it doesnt immediately answer him  he 
               walks out onto the fire escape again and addresses the bird 

                                     barney
                         go on  youve grieved long enough

               he shoos the dove away picks up the dead one comes back in 
               and drops it in the wastebasket by his desk

                                     starling
                         what did he say  about me  late at 
                         night

                                     barney
                         we were talking about inherited 
                         hardwired behavior  he was using 
                         genetics in roller pigeons as an 
                         example  they go way up in the air 
                         and roll over backwards in a display 
                         falling toward the ground  there 
                         are shallow rollers and deep rollers  
                         you cant breed two deep rollers or 
                         the offspring will roll all the way 
                         down crash and die  he said 
                         officer starling is a deep roller 
                         barney  lets hope one of her parents 
                         was not

               as starling gets up and gathers everything except the mask 
               she hears the surviving dove call out once from somewhere in 
               the trees

               int fbi lab  day

               the two xrays one overlaid on the other clipped to a light 
               box  a technician adjusts them so the bone structures 
               correspond in position as closely as possible and points out 
               to starling 

                                     technician
                         theyre the same arm  the discrepancy 
                         is the dates  this one 

               he slides the xrays apart touches a thin gray line on one 
               of them 

                                     technician
                         shows the hairline fracture he 
                         sustained in the fight with the 
                         orderly  this one 
                              the other xray
                         the more recent one supposedly 
                         doesnt  this is the newer of the 
                         two 
                              the other one
                         the one from the asylum

               int behavioral science  later

               starling puts the earliestdated cassette into a player 
               presses play walks up to the blackboard and under vergers 
               heading  below meatpacking heir and some other notes  
               writes he lies  from the tape player 

                                     lecters voice
                         surely the odd confluence of events 
                         hasnt escaped you clarice  jack 
                         crawford dangles you in front of me 
                         then i give you a bit of help  do 
                         you think its because i like to 
                         look at you and imagine how good you 
                         would taste

               theres a pause  starling remembering the moment clearly 
               even now mouths along with her recorded voice 

                                     starlings voice
                         i dont know  is it

               int cell  baltimore state hospital for the criminally 
               insane  day  flashback  1994

               its lecters cell  and its almost pitch black  then as 
               he turns a rheostat the lights slowly rise revealing the 
               cell to be almost empty stripped of its books  hes lying 
               on his cot

                                     lecter
                         ive been in this room for eight 
                         years clarice  i know they will 
                         never  ever  let me out while im 
                         alive  what i want is a view

               ext florence  day

               one of the most magnificent views in the world

               drifting across it then down reveals a piazza below

               outside a cafe a figure in a dark overcoat his back to us 
               drops crumbs to a hundred pigeons surrounding him

               closer the pigeons swirl around his shoes  and slowly the 
               figure turns to face us  its not hannibal lecter  its 
               someone we dont recognize

               he lets go the last of the crumbs brushes his gloves 
               together and crosses toward the ancient palazzo vecchio 
               glancing once at its high stone walls and arched windows 
               its medieval bell tower soaring into the sky

               int palazzo vecchio  day

               checking his watch but in no hurry he climbs a flight of 
               marble steps  unlike here one more often smokes indoors 
               than out and the man lights an ms cigarette his reward for 
               reaching the landing

                                     echoing voice
                         the capponi correspondence goes back 
                         to the 13th century  dr fell might 
                         hold in his hand in his nonitalian 
                         hand a note from dante alighieri 
                         himself but would he recognize it  
                         i think not 

               he follows the echoing voice to the open doorway of a large 
               frescoed room the salon of lilies where another gentleman 
               loitering outside it pats at his pockets  the man weve 
               been following offers along with an outstretched hand holding 
               his pack of cigarettes 

                                     pazzi
                         theyre still arguing

                                     ricci
                              nodding
                         the curatorship  sogliato wants the 
                         job for his nephew  the scholars 
                         seem satisfied with the temporary 
                         guy they appointed

               pazzi lights ricci glances down the hall to the far end 
               where a janitor slowly guides a floor polisher back and forth 
               like a big weak motorcycle then crosses to and peers into 
               the salon

               its under longterm restoration scaffolding everywhere

               a large assembly of men ranging in age from middleaged to 
               the middle ages it seems are gathered around a long 12th 
               century table  the echoing voice belongs to 

                                     sogliato
                         you have examined him in medieval 
                         italian and ill not deny his 
                         language is admirable  for a 
                         straniero  but what if he came upon 
                         a note in the capponi library say 
                         from guido decavalcanti to dante  
                         would he recognize it  i think not

               pazzi isnt sure which one is fell  scanning the room from 
               the doorway he tries to locate the source of the voice but 
               its difficult the high ceillings playing hell with the 
               acoustics 

                                     dr fell
                         professor sogliato if i might  
                         cavalcanti as we all know replied 
                         publicly to dantes first sonnet in 
                         la vita nuova  if he commented 
                         privately as well if he wrote to a 
                         cappono to which would it be  in 
                         your opinion
                              sogliato clearly 
                              cant even name the 
                              capponi
                         no  not even a guess  andrea dont 
                         you think  since he was more literary 
                         than his brothers

               several of the other scholars nod their heads in agreement 
               which only embarrasses sogliato more  pazzi knows which man 
               at the table fell is now however he  and we  still cant 
               see his face seated as he is with his back to the door

                                     sogliato
                         if he is such an expert on dante let 
                         him lecture on dante  to the 
                         studiolo  let him face them if he 
                         can

                                     dr fell
                         id look forward to it  shall we 
                         set the date now

               sogliato has had enough and gets up noisily gathering his 
               things  as the meeting breaks up some of the other committee 
               members shake fells hand  pazzi comes in and approaches 
               fell  from behind  as the others straggle out

                                     pazzi
                         dr fell

                         of your predecessor signore de 
                         bonaventura  i was wondering if 

                                     dr fell

                         me look after the library  for a 
                         stipend

               fell begins gathering his books and papers placing them 
               neatly in his satchel

                                     pazzi
                         yes  well

                                     pazzi
                         to your  to the signore  who can 
                         say  perhaps he ran off  bad debts  
                         bad love affair  i was wondering if 
                         you might 

                                     dr fell

                                     pazzi

                         il mostros victims  he makes sure

                                     dr fell

                                     pazzi
                         or she

                                     dr fell
                         i never actually met signore de 
                         bonaventura  i have read several of 
                         his monographs in the nuova antologia

                                     pazzi
                         the officers who first checked didnt 
                         find any sort of  farewell or  
                         suicide note  i was wondering if 

                                     dr fell
                         if i happen to come across anything 
                         in the capponi library stuffed in a 
                         book or a drawer  yes ill call 
                         you at once

               he accepts pazzis card and slips it under a paperclip holding 
               some of his notes together

                                     pazzi
                         thank 

                                     dr fell
                         youve been reassigned

               pazzi was just turning to leave  turns back

                                     pazzi
                         pardon

                                     dr fell
                         you were on the il mostro case im 
                         sure i read

                                     pazzi
                         thats right

               and it was a humiliation being taken off of it which he 
               would no doubt rather not discuss here

                                     dr fell
                         now youre on this  this is much 
                         less  grand  a case i would think

                                     pazzi
                         if i thought of my work in those 
                         terms yes i guess id agree

                                     dr fell
                         a missing person

               fell says it like its not worth saying  pazzis had enough 
               and turns to leave again

                                     dr fell
                         were you unfairly dismissed from the 
                         grander case  or did you deserve 
                         it

                         have you thought about botticelli

               frankly it never occurred to him  fell points to a place 
               just behind pazzi and he turns to see a beautiful botticelli 
               in a carved gold frame the woman lying in flowers her left

                         maybe a clue

               ext fells residence  night

               a row of family palaces in an ancient street  a figure 
               walking on the cobblestones  only vaguely familiar his 
               path leads us to the front of an old residence its windows 
               behind iron grates all but one on an upper floor dark  the 
               figure continues on down the street but we go inside 

               int fells residence  night

               even though the foyer is dark we can tell its large and 
               highceilinged  we become aware of music  bachs goldberg 
               variations  but cant be sure where its coming from

               we notice a staircase and decide to climb it  its longer 
               than we thought at first  its steps made of thick slabs of 
               ancient stone its rail of cold hammered iron

               we reach the landing  notice a small darkened room to one 
               side  but the music seems to be coming from elsewhere so 
               we continue on down the hall to a pair of tall double doors 
               open allowing us into the main salon  the music seems to 
               be coming from somewhere in here

               we move through the room illuminated only faintly by the 
               occasional candle look up to see that the height of the 
               room disappears into darkness then down again as we are 
               almost upon the figure sitting at a piano

               lecters fingers move among the yellowed ivory keys  he 
               plays the bach piece well every so often glancing to a lyre 
               shaped music stand  but coming slowing around the stand we 
               discover there is no sheet music on it but instead a copy 
               of the national tattler with a picture of a black woman dead 
               in the street and another picture of clarice starling  the 
               fbis angel of death  washing down a baby next to the 
               head of a shark

                         dear clarice i have followed with 
                         enthusiasm the course of your disgrace 
                         and public shaming  my own never 
                         bothered me except for the 
                         inconvenience of being incarcerated 
                         but you may lack perspective

                         figures large in your value system

               he adds a brief postscript folds the linenfiber paper 
               over once careful to line up the edges gives it a sharp

                         pleased

               ext florence  day

               vespas fiats and innocenti speed around a traffic circle  
               pedestrians move along the boulevard  we follow one man who 
               seems vaguely familiar  we glimpsed him briefly several 
               days ago walking past fells residence just before we went 
               in and once before that if we recall polishing the floor 
               in the palazzo vecchio

               right now though were more interested in pazzi who joins 
               the frame coming toward us and we follow him instead to 
               and up the steps of the questura building

               int questura  day

               a black and white stepframed image of dr fell entering a 
               small perfume shop  it plays on a monitor sitting atop two 
               vcr decks one on play the other record the operator a 
               young agent smoking as he writes out a label

               pazzi hangs his coat on a rack crosses through the large 
               room and sits at his desk which happens to be right next to 
               the vcr which he pays no attention to  at the next desk 
               ricci sits working on a crossword puzzle

                         tickets

               pazzi glances over at them not sure he heard right  one 
               sneaks a glance at the other  its all they can do to keep 
               from laughing  the tape of the customers coming and going 
               at the perfume store continues but pazzi doesnt notice

                         botticelli painting  you hadnt 
                         noticed

               as pazzi glances away from them he catches a glimpse of the 
               monitor of fell coming into the perfume shop again  he 
               gets up and the il mostro detectives thinking hes coming 
               for them decide to go out for coffee

                                     pazzi

                         a copy  im recording

               the black and white images of customers most of them women 
               continue until pazzi hits the stop button and spins the 
               jog

               the young agent groans but not too loud pazzi far outranks 
               him  the image reverses  pazzi freezes it on one of the 
               step frames that shows dr fell

                                     pazzi

                         it was actually kind of weird  like 
                         they were making a point of not 
                         saying

               pazzi unpauses it  watches fell approach the counter and 
               then wait it seems for a long time as the perfumer mixes 
               up some kind of concoction  money exchanges hands and fell 
               with his purchase leaves

               int pazzis apartment  study  night

               as a search engine works pazzi glances down at copies of

               next to the computer  the video cassette is there too

               and the overnight mailer

               the fbis consumer home page appears on the screen  pazzi 
               selects the 10 most wanted button and in a moment the list 
               with pictures  is displayed

               him nine other lesser bombers and murderers none of whom 
               look anything like fell

               most wanted list appears  bank robbers and killers and 
               arsonists all with photos or police sketches all but one

               unconvinced the promise will hold she leaves the room

               pazzi opens his filofax to the f tab finds a number written 
               under no heading a code enters it into his computer and in 
               a moment is taken to the fbis private vicap site  violent 
               criminal apprehension program

               he types in lecter and scans the internal 302 reports that 
               are displayed many of them prepared by special agent clarice 
               starling

               he returns to the server screen  begins a new search

               the place is looking more and more like a museum the bulletin 
               and blackboards covered now with notes and newsprint photos 
               including some of il mostros young victims

               paul krendler makes his way through the rightangled 
               passageway leading into the darkened room  the only light 
               is coming from a monitor showing lecters escape from memphis 
               as caught by highangle security cameras

               he considers a display starling has erected to lecters nine 
               known victims  one is mason verger  another a man attached 
               to a tool shop peg board with metal rods piercing his body 
               as in an illustration next to it of the medieval wound man

               he becomes intrigued by a sketch on a standing easel of 
               starling signed by hannibal lecter  a piece of cloth has 
               been tacked at the neck and drapes down like a sari  is she 
               naked underneath it  krendler has to find out  as he 
               carefully lifts the cloth 

                                     lecters voice
                         what is your worst memory of 
                         childhood

               he jumps startled sees starling sitting in a corner in 
               the shadows next to the cassette deck

                                     starling

                         thinking

               she gets up  lets the tape of lecters voice continue

               krendler works at slowing the pace of his heart at regaining 
               most of his unpleasant hauteur

                                     krendler
                         some people in justice are thinking 
                         too  theyre thinking what exactly 
                         is she doing about lecter

                                     starling
                         thinking  about cannibalism

                         to show his contempt for those who 
                         exasperate him i think

               which she wouldnt mind showing krendler in similar fashion

               there wasnt a lot of spin on his words but they carried an 
               inkling of implication which she doesnt misinterpret  she 
               ignores it though and him looks through her receipts

               knell  a tinny recorded voice tells him to deposit 9000 
               lira for the first three minutes

               he drops nine coins in the slot with a shaky hand  the call 
               connects and another recorded voice tells him the number he 
               has dialed is no longer in service

               hears a voice  not recorded  american accent  a man

               as fell leads pazzi across the main salon upstairs past 
               furniture draped with sheets the inspectors glance darts 
               from object to object hed like to steal for prints  a glass 
               a book a vase a pen

                                     dr fell

                         just down the stairs i mean

               they reach two big suitcases closed  two typewritten sheets 
               of paper rest on a small table next to them

                                     pazzi
                         is that the inventory

                         of course

               pazzi waits for fell to hand it to him  unfortunately its 
               just as close to him  once its clear fell has no intention 
               of picking it up pazzi does  carefully but not too 
               carefully  and pretends to read it

                                     dr fell
                         you are a pazzi of the pazzi i think
                              pazzi doesnt answer
                         wasnt it at the palazzo vecchio 
                         your ancestor was hanged  francesco 
                         depazzi  thrown naked with a noose 
                         around his neck from the window  
                         writhing alongside the archbishop 
                         against the cold stone wall

               pazzi stares at fell who only pleasantly smiles back

                                     dr fell
                         i found a nice rendering of it here 
                         in the library the other day  if 
                         youd like perhaps i could sneak it 
                         out for you

                                     pazzi
                         id think that might jeopardize your 
                         chances for permanent appointment to 
                         the curatorship

                                     dr fell
                         only if you told
                              fell smiles again
                         remind me  what was his crime

                                     pazzi
                         he was accused of killing giuliano 
                         demedici

                                     dr fell
                         unjustly

                                     pazzi
                         no i dont think so

                                     dr fell
                         then he wasnt just accused  he did 
                         it  he was guilty

               a knowing look from fell makes pazzi wonder if he somehow 
               knows he knows hes lecter

                                     dr fell
                         id think that would make living in 
                         florence with the name pazzi 
                         uncomfortable even 500 years later

                                     pazzi
                         not really  in fact i cant remember 
                         the last time  before today  someone 
                         brought it up

                                     dr fell

               shes standing on the tomb of michelangelo  steps off and 
               whispers to the slab

               fell is coming toward her in the dark oblivious to what is 
               about to happen  someone reaches into a purse and fishes 
               out a 200lira coin

               romula begins to move toward the dark shape moving toward

               goes on illuminating a fresco of a bloodied christ and fells 
               eyes looking straight into hers and chilling her heart  
               the ticking of the coin box accompanies an awkward moment 
               before romula manages

               dully on her wrist  fell looks back over his shoulder at 
               the woman  she looks back over hers for a second and the 
               light goes out leaving him in silhouette

               fell walks away out past the doors and into the blinding 
               sunlight  pazzi wanders around in the dark and finally finds 
               romula at a font scrubbing her hands in the holy water

               she takes the bracelet off and hands it to pazzi  he watches 
               water drip from it and his hands to the floor

               and glances away watches absently as a sexton empties one

               wrist with the bracelet seized in a terrific grip twists it 
               free hardly breaking stride and emerges from the tail of 
               the throng

                         missed

               he holds out the arm with the braclet for pazzi to take it 
               off  as the inspector works carefully at the clasp gnocco 
               sucks in another deep breath of air

               from pazzis hands  blood begins to gush out of a neat tear 
               in his pants

               more confuses than in pain gnocco looks down at the blood 
               only to have it spray up into his face  trying to ignore 
               the blood  even as it sprays on him  pazzi works to get 
               the bracelet off and finally frees it

               gnocco stares dumbly at himself in his praying position 
               then tries to stop the flow of blood with his hand  as he 
               collapses against the iron gate  pazzi sets the bracelet in 
               the box it came in pockets it then reaches into gnoccos

               moved away from the wound and held feels nothing pressed in 
               its place feels his blood drainging out of his body then 
               feels nothing  hes dead

               pazzi gets up  takes out a handkerchief  wrapped inside is 
               a used syringe  he tosses it on the ground and walks away

               watches as his wife lifts the wrist to her beautiful face 
               smells the scent on it and smiles to herself

               pazzi smiles too to himself as he watches her place another 
               drop on the other wrist and two more just under her diamond
               studded ear lobes

               new evening gown  the scalped tickets for these seats must 
               have cost him a fortune but then he can afford it now

               a whiteness down below caught by the bounce of a stage light 
               draws pazzis attention from the diva  the bright glow 
               belongs to the starched french cuffs of a white dress shirt 
               poking out of dark sleeves the hands intertwined the chin 
               resting on them

               box  pazzi had a second of opportunity to look away but 
               missed it and now their eyes meet

               pazzi involuntarily squeezes his wifes hand  the pressure 
               draws a loving look from her but pazzis is still locked on 
               fells enigmatic little smile much as he wishes it wasnt 
               until a crescendo in the music  finally  draws fells head

                              much as she does
                         do you believe a man could become so

                         encounter

                         could he daily feel a stab of hunger 
                         for her  find nourishment in the 
                         very sight of her  i think so  but 
                         would she see through the bars of 
                         his plight and ache for him

               allegra waits for the answer but fell doesnt have it he 
               just looks away wistfully as his fingers slide away from the 
               plastic like snakes

                                     dr fell
                              to himself
                         yes quite

               the hand that held allegras when he kissed it comes up to 
               his face  he takes in the residue of the scent

               int starlings house  late night

               empty coffee cup and dinner debris on starlings desk  
               sitting at her computer she types in a code summoning the 
               fbis private vicap site  navigating deep into it with other 
               codes she reaches a page with a query panel and types in  
               cookies

               the screen fills with long lines of text  words and numbers 
               and slashes and hyphens  the fingerprints left by everyone 
               who has accessed the site over the last year

               most have addresses within the fbi itself and justice 
               department the majority of the rest from interpol and other 
               international police organizations  the scrolling list goes 
               on forever

               she narrows her search to show only those who have visited 
               the vicap lecter files then narrows it further to those who 
               have knocked more than twenty times in the last month

               her own screen name  cstarling  appears on the new list 
               more than any other  there are also several flagged hits by 
               pkrendler  she smiles at one name  jcrawford  he isnt 
               supposed to be accessing the vicap files anymore now that 
               hes retired but just cant help himself

               the next heaviest user is a name she doesnt recognize  
               someone who calls him or herself pfrancesco  she stares 
               long at the screen name and finally whispers to it 

                                     starling
                         could that be you doctor

               ext cemetery  florence  night

               we slowly approach  from someones moving point of view  a 
               pair of young lovers walking toward us under the trees  as 
               they draw closer  oblivious to us and our breath and our 
               footsteps on the cobblestone path 

               pazzi enters his own pov  once past the lovers he takes 
               out a pencilthin maglite and rakes its narrow beam across 
               names on the chippedmarble tombstones he passes the light 
               settling eventually on someone called lorenzo mametti

               he tosses a cheap bunch of wilting flowers onto the grave 
               and looks around for whoever it is hes supposed to be meeting 
               here  a shadowy figure emerges almost soundlessly from behind 
               a crypt and pazzi finds the face with his pen light

                                     carlo
                         please

               pazzi snaps it off  carlo comes out into the open looking 
               like a grave digger in his work clothes perches on a squat 
               headstone and first offering one to pazzi who declines 
               lights himself a cigarette

                                     carlo
                         i want him in the open street with

                                     carlo

                                     pazzi

                         afraid of him

                                     pazzi

                         will you only ill be better paid 
                         for it

               carlo removes his hat and bows his head as if to pray

               someone is walking on a path intersecting theirs down by the 
               mausoleums  the figure disappears behind the stone walls

                                     pazzi
                         i want him out of tuscany fast

                         face of the earth fast  feet first

               int starlings lectereum  day

               starling glances from an international number jotted down on 
               her blotter to the phone on which shes dialing it  a paused 
               timecoded frame of lecter at the florence perfumery taking 
               in a scent on his hand glows on her television as she listens 
               to a european ring

               the detective puts her on hold and shouts pazzi across 
               the room to where pazzi was just grabbing his coat off the 
               rack to leave  he holds the receiver up then cradles it

               pazzi groans  keeps his coat on  lifts the receiver of

                         policemen down in memphis while he 
                         was in custody tearing the face off 
                         one of them  and he will kill you 
                         too if you 

               he hangs up on her

               intext palazzo vecchio  later  evening

               as the sky darkens floodlights across the piazza blink on 
               and wash across the rough stone walls of the palazzo vecchio

               as bats fly out from the jackolantern teeth of the parapets 
               the image suddenly goes to 

               black and white  a security monitor in the foyer on which 
               a guard watches the creatures circling the building looking 
               for darker quarters

               a clunking sound draws our attention but not his to the 
               stairs where we briefly glimpse the bottom half of a hand 
               truck  with something big strapped to it  as its pulled 
               with some effort up the top steps

               upper hall

               the hand truck is wheeling toward us now along the long 
               hall and we see that it is a lectern  as big as a pulpit 
               strapped to it  we watch it coming and the worker pushing 
               it  that same man again the palazzos custodian  into 

               the salon of lilies

                where the restorers are climbing down from their 
               scaffolding closing up their cans of spirits and paints 
               packing up to leave for the day

               metal folding chairs have been arranged on the drop cloths 
               covering the floor in split rows of six  fell is at a small 
               table in back of them setting up a slide projector  he 
               turns it on and angle its bright white light onto a home 
               movie screen draping off the arm of its metal stand

               he sees the custodian coming in with the hand truck and points 
               out to him that hed like the lectern up front to one side 
               of the screen

               the screen  its too small  the projector light spilling 
               way wide of its edges  the drop cloth hanging from the 
               scaffolding behind it would work much better

               as the custodian unstraps and sets up the lectern fell takes 
               down the little screen sets it aside and stands before the 
               cloth smoothing at its flickering folds

               the last of the restorers straggles out  the custodian 
               unplugs and coils the long orange cord of the floor polisher 
               handoverelbow  fell adds a brown extension cord to the 
               projector remote and snakes it along the ersatz aisle between 
               the chairs to the lectern

               he sets some books on the podium places his hands on its 
               sides to test the comfort of its height  its satisfactory  
               and looks out over his invisible audience

               the custodian is finished straightening up  fell watches 
               him cross behind the back row of folding chairs approach 
               the open doorway and pauses for a few moments  too many 
               moments  to gaze up at the botticelli before leaving

               ext palazzo vecchio  night

               a great shadow rears up against the floodlit wall  it belongs 
               to pazzi as he crossed the piazza glancing once to carlo 
               and his brother matteo smoking next to a van before 
               disappearing into the palazzos front entrance

                                     fells voice
                         avarice and hanging are linked in 
                         the medieval mind 

               int salon of lilies  night

               the dragons of the studiolo  and sogliato  face us in 
               the folding chairs listening to the lecture 

                                     fells voice
                         st jerome writes that judas very 
                         surname  iscariot  means money 
                         or price

               a ringing phone interrupts  the heads all turn  pazzi 
               standing just inside the doors gropes for his cell phone 
               extracts it from his jacket pocket

                                     fell
                         ah commendatore pazzi

                                     starlings voice
                         it wasnt easy but i got this number 
                         without telling them why inspector 
                         paz

               he hangs up on her  switches off the phones power

                                     pazzi
                         sorry

                                     fell
                         not al all  welcome  since you are 
                         closest to the lights would you be 
                         so kind as to dim the lights

               pazzi twists a dimmer on the wall and the lights come down

                                     fell
                         thank you  youll be interested in 
                         this commendatore since there is a 
                         pazzi already in dantes inferno

               an art slide appears on the drop cloth  fell improves the 
               focus with the remote

                                     fell
                         here is the earliest known depiction 
                         of the crucifixion carved on an 
                         ivory box in gaul about ad  four 
                         hundred  it includes the death by 
                         hanging of judas his face upturned 
                         to the branch that suspends him
                              the slide changes
                         and here he is on the doors of the 
                         benevento cathedral hanging with 
                         his bowels falling out as st luke 
                         the physician described him in the 
                         acts of the apostles  still looking 
                         up

               the shadow of a bat flies across the image but everyone so 
               accustomed to the occurence ignores it

                                     fell
                         in this plate from a fifteenth 
                         century edition of the inferno pier 
                         della vignas body hangs from a 
                         bleeding tree  i will not belabor 
                         the obvious parallel with judas 
                         iscariot

               pazzi still in the back of the room tries desperately to 
               separate the legs of a folding chair without having them 
               squeak

                                     fell
                         but dante alighieri needed no drawn 
                         illustration  it is his genius to 
                         make pier della vigna now in hell 
                         speak in strained hisses and coughing 
                         sibilants as though he is hanging 
                         still  listen as he drags with the 
                         other damned his own dead body to 
                         hang upon the thorn tree

               fells normally composed face pains as he recites from memory 
               dantes words of the agonal pier della vigna 

                                     fell
                         come laltre verrem per nostre 
                         spoglie ma no pero chalcuna sen 
                         rivesta che non e giusto aver cio 
                         chom si toglie  qui le 
                         strascineremo e per la mesta selva 
                         saranno i nostri corpi appesi 
                         ciascuno al prun de lombra sua 
                         molesta

               a single metallic squeak from the back of the room punctuates 
               the last word

                                     fell
                         avarice hanging selfdestruction 
                         with avarice counting as self 
                         destruction as much as hanging  and 
                         what does the anonymous florentine 
                         suicide say in his torment at the 
                         end of the canto
                              pained
                         io fei gibetto a me de le mie case  
                         i  i make my own house be my gallows
                              pause
                         thank you for your kind attention

               now there are gratefully a lot of chair squeaks as the 
               scholars stand to applaud fell and come around him to shake 
               his hand  pazzi has to step aside to keep from being knocked 
               over by sogliato leaving

               the lights stay dimmed  pazzi makes his way to fell and 
               waits as an autographseeker waits for the last of the 
               fans to shake the doctors hand and step away

                                     pazzi
                         im not a scholar but i think youve 
                         got the job  can i buy you a 
                         celebratory drink

                                     fell
                         how kind of you  yes id like that  
                         ill just be a minute gathering my 
                         things

               as fell takes his tomes from the lectern and carries them 
               back to the projector table pazzi switches the power back 
               on his cell phone  nothing happens  he realizes he has 
               pressed the ringvibrate not the power button powers it up 
               now and makes a call

                                     pazzi
                         allegra cara ill be home just a 
                         little later than i said  im taking 
                         dr fell out for a drink

               intercut carlo outside watching the entry of the palazzo

                                     carlo
                         i can see the people coming out now

               back in the salon pazzi hangs up  fell gathers his slides

                                     fell
                         oh i shouldve shown them this one  
                         i cant imagine how i missed it  
                         this one will interest you

               he drops the slide in front of the projector bulb and the 
               image appears on the drop cloth  a drawing of a man hanging 
               naked beneath the battlements of this palace the palazzo 
               vecchio from the exact same angle we saw on the security 
               monitor

                                     fell
                         can you make it out all right

               its a little blurry but fell works with the remote and the 
               illustration passes back and forth across the plane of focus

               keeping the remote in one hand he takes a rag from his 
               satchel with the other and approaches pazzi his silhouette 
               against on the drop cloth looming large as he comes

                                     fell
                         theres a name down here can you 
                         see it

               pazzi comes close to look  the projectors focusing motor 
               purrs as fell works it with the remote  the lettering 
               sharpens  francesco pazzi  cheerfully 

                                     fell
                         its your ancestor commendatore  
                         hanging beneath these very windows  
                         on a related subject i must confess 
                         to you im giving serious thought to 
                         eating your wife

               he pulls at the heavy drop cloth  it comes down enveloping 
               pazzi  fell seizes him around the chest and presses the 
               ethersoaked rag over the canvas where pazzis face must be  
               the image of his hanging ancestor splashed across the wall 
               under the scaffolding

               ext palazzo vecchio  night

               at the back of the van its doors open carlo unzips a black 
               vinyl guitar gigbag  inside is his beanbag stun rifle  he 
               sets it next to the case and leans past the side of the door 
               to check on his brother matteo stationed across the piazza 
               at the far end of the palazzo

               from matteos position  if he were looking  he could see 
               that his brother carlo would like him to pay attention

               matteo is paying attention only its to a young couple in a 
               car parked in the shadows across the street necking

               a rock hits matteos pant leg and he finally looks up to his 
               brother by the van who is saying with the arm that threw 
               the rock whats the matter with you

               neither one of them pays any attention to the worker sitting 
               on the ledge of the fountain  the custodian from the palazzo 
               vecchio  who glances up from time to time from the tip of 
               his burning cigarette to the young lovers in the car

               int salon of lilies  night

               pazzis gun his plastic handcuffs strips and his wallet sit 
               next to fells work permit and permesso di soggiorno on the 
               podium

               fell himself is standing next to it working the plugend of 
               the long orange floor polisher cord into a hangmans noose 
               with the traditional thirteen wraps  finishing he crosses 
               the room with it the tail of the orange snake uncurling and 
               slithering after him

                                     fell
                         if you tell me what i need to know 
                         commendatore it would be convenient 
                         for me to leave without my meal  
                         ill ask you questions and then well 
                         see

               pazzi is cinched to the hand truck with the same canvas straps 
               used to secure the lecturn on its journey up to the salon  
               with his mouth taped its difficult for him to express his 
               gratitude

                                     fell
                         was it mason verger you sold me to  
                         blink twice for yes  yes  thank 
                         you  are his men waiting outside  
                         umm hmmm  and one of them smells 
                         like tainted boar sausage  was that 
                         a single blink  oh now youre 
                         confused  try not to be confused or 
                         i may have to fillet signora pazzi 
                         after all  have you told anyone in 
                         the questura about me  no i thought 
                         not  have you told allegra  no  
                         youre sure  i believe you

               fell comes around behind pazzi to the back of the hand truck 
               hooks the cordnoose around one of its handles and gently 
               tips it back

                                     fell
                         here we go  hold on

               pazzi struggles against the straps  he struggles to speak 
               to beg but all that comes past the tape over his mouth is a 
               purr  fell wheels him close to a balcony fully uprights 
               the hand truck again takes the noose from the handle drapes 
               it delicately around pazzis neck and tightens the slack

                                     fell
                         your heart is palpitating  i can 
                         see it

               pazzis heart is beating so hard the fabric of his jacket is 
               fluttering

                                     fell
                         no  thats not your heart

               fell slips a hand under the taut lapel as if to extract 
               pazzis heart  instead he finds in there the cell phone

               it vibrates silently in fells hand

                                     fell
                         who could that be  should i answer 
                         it

               why not  fell flips it open

                                     fell
                              brightly

               he glances off with the faintest hint of wistfulness  the

               orange cord trailing the ground coming up in a rush the 
               floor polisher yanked down and sliding across the floor 
               gathering up the drop cloth and slamming against the railing

               the lovers in the car break their embrace at the sound of

               breathing hard he reaches slowly for the handle careful to 
               position himself in a way that will allow the door to act as 
               his shield if it opens  he grasps the handle and pulls  
               its locked  as the hand is letting go and coming away the

               carlo hears the cry coming from the rear of the building

               he runs from the salon and down the back stairs stumbling 
               down them catching himself reaching the back door thats 
               standing open

               a crowd is gathering peering up at the spectacle that is 
               rinaldo pazzi swaying slowly back and forth against the stone 
               walls lit up as if in a stadium under the floodlights

               a motorcycle comes toward the square on a narrow side street

               a figure steps out into the glare of its headlight  the 
               cyclist slows to a stop

               he hands the cyclist the bill and climbs on back careful 
               not to touch the young man with his hands lest he get the 
               wrong idea  the motoguzzi turns around and speeds off the 
               way it came away from the piazza

               fade to black

               and out of the black materializes 

               a black and white image of pazzi small and stark in the 
               floodlights swinging against the wall of the palazzo vecchio

               the event captured on tape by the security camera across

               a copy of a copy of the tape  at the same point in the action  
               plays for verger  noticing something  some movement in an 
               upper corner of the frame  he reversesearches the tape 
               with his remote to look at it again

               the movement belongs to a silhouette of a figure appearing 
               briefly on the balcony above the hanged pazzi  an arm of 
               the figure rises up and the hand waves  not down to pazzi  
               but across to the viewer  verger freezes the image and 
               studies it for a long moment in silence  eventually

                         when the fox hears a rabbit scream 
                         he comes running but not to help

               ext virginia state park  day

               a rabbit on a path staring listening hears the footsteps 
               before we do and bounds away back into the woods  starling 
               appears a moment later running on the same dirt path through 
               the trees two or three miles into her fivemile run working 
               up a sweat

               she hears footsteps before we do too and like a rabbit 
               bounds off the path  stopping just off it she bends to 
               catch her breath then picks up a dead branch

               the footsteps and the panting close in  she lets the first 
               running man go past but grabs the second one throws him to 
               the ground straddles him and pushes the branch against his 
               throat  at once calm but firm 

                                     starling
                         dont say a word

               she neednt warn him the young man seems too terrified to 
               speak  starling reaches behind his track suit pulls out 
               his 38 and keeping the branch tight against his neck lets 
               the other runner whos running back now know that she has 
               his friends gun  to him again very calmly as he nears 

                                     starling
                         stop  catch your breath  take your 
                         gun out very slowly with your left 
                         hand set it on the ground and take 
                         five steps away from it

               the second young man does exactly as hes told  then 

                                     starling
                         all right  who are you

                                     2nd runner
                         we work for jack crawford  were 
                         supposed to keep an eye on you  to 
                         keep you safe from  you know  
                         hannibal the cannibal

                                     starling
                         show me

               he knows what that means and shows her identification from 
               crawfords private security firm

               she gets up off the other one then tosses the branch away 
               and walks over to the gun resting on the fallen leaves  she 
               picks it up

                                     starling
                         okay here it is  i dont need you 
                         looking after me  im not in any 
                         danger  if you talk to him before i 
                         do tell him that

                                     2nd runner
                         yes maam

               she returns the guns to each of them first giving the one 
               on the ground a hand up

                                     starling
                         sorry if i hurt you

               she leaves them continues on her run  as the one she threw 
               to the ground dusts himself off the perspective changes to 

               view through binoculars

                of the two private security men off in the distance

               they blur then as the binoculars are shifted  trees too 
               blur across the lenses  the view overtakes starling returns 
               and follows her focusing as she runs through the trees 
               staying on her until she disappears down a sloping path

               lecter lowers the small expensive field glasses  returns 
               them to their case slung over his shoulder  crosses the 
               dirt parking area to her mustang  peers inside and sees no 
               blinking red light on the dash

               he takes out a slim jim  slips it down and across the 
               drivers side jamb tripping the lock  he opens the door 
               and sits in the bucket seat a long moment before delicately 
               touching the ten and two oclock points on the leatherclad 
               steering wheel where her hands rest most often  he leans 
               closer to smell her on the leather  then licks it

               int krendlers dc townhouse  night

               krendler just back from a jog himself sweaty tshirt and 
               headband sits with cordell and reads a postcard from london 
               sheathed in plastic written in lecters distinctive copper 
               plate  finishing he looks up at a speaker phone 

                                     krendler
                         im not sure i understand

                         you dont have to understand paul  
                         all you have to understand is what 
                         its worth to you

                                     krendler
                         no i dont understand why she didnt 
                         turn this over shes such a  
                         straight arrow

               int vergers chamber  same time

               looking at his speakerphone verger sighs  maybe hes making 
               a terrible mistake  maybe krendler is just too stupid to be 
               of any real use to him  as if to a child 

                                     mason
                         she didnt turn it over because she 
                         didnt receive it  she didnt receive 
                         it because it was never delivered to 
                         her  it was delivered to me for a 
                         nice gratuity to a notsonice mail 
                         room boy

                         oh  ohhh

               the realization and krendlers look of admiration that 
               follows it only make verger worry more about his stupidity

                                     mason

                         i think youd have been better off 
                         if you hadnt gotten her out of 
                         trouble in the first place

                         how do you account for it being found 
                         in your  office  your  basement

                                     starling

                                     krendler
                         perhaps because of the nature of its 
                         content  it reads like a  like a 
                         love letter to me

               as krendler comes over and hovers over her shoulder its 
               all she can do to keep herself from slugging him

                                     starling

                         miss starling from the building

               the marshal comes toward her

                                     starling
                         i want to say something  i think 
                         im entitled

                                     noonan

                                     starling
                         i think mr mason verger is trying 
                         to capture dr lecter himself for 
                         the purpose of personal revenge  i 
                         think mr krendler is in collusion 
                         with him and wants the fbis effort 
                         against dr lecter to work for mr 
                         verger  i think mr krendler is 
                         being paid to do this

                                     krendler
                         its a good thing youre not sworn 
                         here today

                                     starling
                         swear me  you swear too

                                     noonan
                         starling  if the evidence is lacking 
                         youll be entitled to full 
                         reinstatement without prejudice  if 
                         you dont do  or say  something in 
                         the meantime that would make that 
                         impossible

               starling just keeps staring at krendler as she gathers her 
               nagra and purse  finally she glances over to her boss and

               friend pearsall who mouths 

                                     pearsall
                         sorry starling

               she lets the marshal lead her from the room

               the clerk walks away  lecter glances back to the tvs to see 
               that a black and white inset photograph of himself has been 
               added to the one of starling

                                     talking head

                         its much too soon to condemn her

               lecter smiles at krendlers image  he always smiles upon

               tight on starlings cassette deck  the spindles turning the

               next to it

                                     lecters voice

                         barney

               starling is asleep on the sofa now  still in her clothes

                                     lecters voice
                         they climb high and fast then roll 
                         over and fall just as fast toward

               the tape reaches its leader an stops  the green power light 
               stays on  then it goes off then comes back on again an 
               electrical interruption that is quickly reestablished

               int basement  starlings house  same time

               a basement window slightly open  a piece of insulated wire 
               clipped to the alarm contacts  a shadow of a figure floating 
               away from it

               the figure moves toward the stairs passing a rusty bicycle 
               hanging on the wall and some shooting trophies gathering 
               dust on a shelf and begins up the stairs

               int starlings house  moments later

               the microwave ovens glowing reset numbers 8888 are obsured 
               a moment as the figure soundlessly passes  ice tumbles from 
               the refrigerators icemaker into the bin

               in the living room starling is still asleep her empty glass 
               resting on a wood coffee table

               a digital desk clock blinks 0000  tiny sounds echo in 
               the dark house  the hum of the furnace the whistle of a 
               pant leg touching fabric on a chair slick pages being 
               turned a sigh

               ext starlings house  dawn

               the basement window closed now reflecting the glow of 
               sunrise  power lines against the red sky  a pigeon sitting 
               on the wire calling out once

               int starlings house  dawn

               starling wakes in the same position she fell asleep  in 
               front of her is her empty glass  set down not on top of the 
               wood as she left it but on a thick magazine

               she knows thats not right  sits up enough to see the cover 
               of the magazine  italian vogue  edge of a postit peeking 
               out from the pages  she uses the postit to turn to the

                         i didnt want to wake you  youre 
                         going to have to use the other one  
                         in the charger  hopefully the light 
                         on it is green by now

               the charger is right in front of her on the dresser  and

                         should be enough  you can change 
                         the clip on a 45 quicker than that  
                         so when i tell you to disengage the

               falling away from the body of the phone into her hand the 
               charged one slapped in its place in just over two seconds

               in the far distance below his back to her his arm moving 
               up and down but cant tell if it synchronizes with the sound

               the blade of carlos knife is against lecters throat in an 
               instant  from an intercom 

                                     masons voice
                         no no no  dont hurt him

               lecter smiles at the sardinian  the knife slowly comes away 
               from his neck leaving only a little blood

               piero meanwhile is adjusting the angle of a giltframed mirror 
               hanging above the slatted gate lecters feet will soon be 
               stuck through

                                     masons voice
                         and turn off that radio i cant 
                         hear anything

               a shortwave radio on a wooden table thats broadcasting a 
               soccer game in italian  as piero crosses to it 

               ext woods  night

               starling still listens as the alreadyfaint sound of the 
               italian announcers voice fades to nothing  she continues 
               on again toward the floodlit area beyond the trees until 
               another sound stops her  another recorded voice  begging 
               and screaming in italian

               suddenly through the trees all around her dark shapes are 
               moving fast  she wants to but dares not point the flashlight 
               at them if theyre armed the beam may as well be a painted 
               target on her chest

               she crouches  catches a glimpse of something big running 
               close to the ground past the trucks of the trees near her  
               then its gone

               intext barn  night

               the wild boars appear in the reflection of the largegold 
               framed mirror jostling into a semicircle like berserk 
               linemen posing for a team photo

               piero dials down the screaming tape  carlo rights the hand 
               truck hooks a saline bag to it and wheels it toward the 
               slatted gate  tipped back rolling slowly closer to his 
               death lecter begins humming pomp and circumstance

               int vergers chamber  night

               verger glancing between three monitors displaying the 
               upcoming live event glimpses something in one of them as it 
               darts along the fence line of the pen then disappears

                                     mason
                         what was that  cordell  did you 
                         see that

               intext barn  night

               a boom of a 45 echoes in the barn  tommaso still up in 
               the loft throws himself down against the planks

                                     starling
                         hold it  hands where i can see 

               carlos hand swings around with a 357 in it  starling fires 
               once knocking him back against the gate  piero makes a 
               move toward the fallen gun but stops when he sees a slat 
               splinter right next to it the boars surging at the gate to 
               get to carlo on the ground just inside it

                                     starling
                         down

               piero kneels with his empty hands aloft  starling crosses 
               quickly with a set of handcuffs  in the loft tommaso crawls 
               along the planks as she disappears from his view  down below 
               lecter cranes his head to watch starling pick up the gun

                                     lecter
                         good evening clar 

                                     starling
                         shut up

               she kneels  lecter tries to bend his head to watch her snap 
               a cuff around one of carlos wrists

                                     starling
                         can you walk

                                     lecter
                         well i dont know  may i try

               the boars pound against the gate trying to get at carlo

               starling drags him a couple of feet away and pulls a knife 
               from an ankle strap

                                     starling
                         im going to cut you loose  if you 
                         touch me ill shoot you

                                     lecter
                         understood perfectly

                                     starling
                         do right and youll live through 
                         this

                                     lecter
                         spoken like a protestant

               she cuts one of his arms free keeping her gun trained on 
               piero still on the ground by carlo  the boars shatter 
               another slat

                                     lecter
                         this might go a little quicker if 
                         you give me the knife

               she hesitates  then gives it to him  as he cuts at the 
               ropes she works to lock the other end of carlos cuffs onto 
               pieros wrist  as he removes the mask 

                                     lecter
                         clarice

                                     lecter
                         my back was turned when you came in  
                         was that a warning shot or did you 
                         kill the one in the loft

               she spins around aiming up just as the bullet from the 
               rifle slams into her unvested abdomen  going down she pulls 
               off three quick shots hitting tommaso in the chest

               as he falls from the loft the boars come crashing through 
               the gate  piero desperately tries to get away dragging the 
               dead weight of carlo behind him  lecter lifts starling from 
               the ground blood running onto his fingers

               piero is pulled down  lecter holding starling surrounded 
               by the animals too stands perfectly still as the boars 
               ravage the three sardinians

               int vergers chamber  same time

               verger stares in disbelief at the monitor that shows nothing 
               but the moving mass of the boars thrashing around but leaving 
               alone lecters legs

                                     mason

               cordell opens the drawer revealing a semiautomatic pistol

                         take it  go down there  shoot him

               christs sake not a hunter of madmen  he stares at verger

                                     cordell
                         what did you say

                         it

               cordell seems to understand nods in resignation and turns 
               as if to take the gun

                                     mason
                         good  now 

               cordell plunges his hand into the aquarium and turns back 
               holding the writhing eel  watching him approach the bed 
               with it verger for once is speechless staring at the 
               serpents clicking teeth

                                     cordell
                         good night mason

               as cordell thrusts the head of the eel toward vergers gaping 
               mouth 

               intext barn  same time

               lecter carrying starling stares a couple of the boars in 
               the eye wades through them with impunity steps out past 
               the splintered gate and disappears into the woods

               ext chesapeake bay  evening

               a pair of distant headlights floating along the shoreline

               int krendlers car  evening

               krendler trying to keep the agitation out of his voice 
               speaks with an assistant on his car phone as he negotiates 
               the dark ribbon of road

                                     krendler

                         calls forwarded  no not even him  
                         nobody

               he hangs up  wipes at beads of sweat just below the sweatband 
               of his jogging ensemble as his destination his weekend 
               cottage comes into view through the windshield

               ext krendlers cottage  night

               the car pulls into the driveway  krendler gathers up the 
               grocery bag from the passenger seat and carries it toward 
               the front door of his cottage which also happens to be 
               lecters

               int krendlerslecters cottage  night

               krendler comes into the darkened kitchen  tries a light 
               switch that doesnt work  sets the grocery bag on a counter 
               pulls open a drawer and takes out a corkscrew  as he takes 
               a bottle of cheap chianti from the bag he notices a simple 
               strand of christmas lights around a window  doesnt remember 
               hanging them  stares cocking his head the way he does

                                     lecters voice
                         oh good you brought wine

               before krendler can turn his mouth is covered with an ether 
               soaked dish towel

               int krendlers bedroom  night

               starlings eyes open and slowly take in her surroundings 
               the small unfamiliar room the bed shes in the night stand 
               and the empty morphine vials on it the silver tray with the 
               crumpled bullet on it

               she eases the blanket down enough to see her tshirt eases 
               the tshirt up enough to see the bandage ease the bandage 
               away enough to see the stitched gunshot wound

               she hears quiet christmas music and muffled voices from 
               elsewhere in the house  two men speaking in conversational 
               tones  she drags herself from the bed steadies herself 
               slowly crosses the room to and down a hallway

               at the end of it she see  a decorated christmas tree  an 
               archway to a dining room candles on the dining table  
               krendler in his running clothes and sweatband sitting at 
               the head of it  lecter standing beside a portable grill on 
               a service cart stirring at a saute pan with a wooden spoon

                                     krendler
                         are those shallots

                                     lecter
                         ummm  and caper berries

                                     krendler
                         the butter smells wonderful

               starling glances from krendlers face to his hands  he 
               doesnt seem to notice or care that theyre ducttaped to 
               the arms of a wheelchair

               int bedroom  moments later

               back in the bedroom starling uses her teeth to strip the 4
               pin telephone wire thats been yanked from the wall jack

               int dining room  same time

               as lecter executes a modest flambe with a little brandy 

                                     lecter
                         i hope youre hungry paul

                                     krendler
                         very  whats the main course

                                     lecter
                         oh you never ask  it spoils the 
                         surprise

               lecter notices but seems unconcerned as the linelight 
               blinks on a telephone

               int bedroom  continued

               starling searches drawers for some kind of weapon as she 
               whispers into the phone 

                                     starling
                         dont have the address but i think 
                         the house belongs to the hostage 
                         whose name is paul krendler 

                                     911 operator
                         i have it from the phone number  
                         now if you can safely do it get out 
                         of the house  otherwise stay on 
                         the line where you are  the response 
                         time should be ten minutes  im 
                         putting you on hold for just a moment

               starling hears an unusual sound from the other room but not 
               so unusual that she doesnt recognize it  its the whir of 
               an autopsy saw  she sets the receiver on the bed and 

                                     911 operator
                         im back  maam  

               the phone goes dead as starling yanks the 25foot cord from 
               the wall and wraps it quickly around her hand taking it 
               with her perhaps to use as a garrote as she leaves the 
               room

               int hall  dining room  moments later

               shes moving along the hall again  hears the whir of the 
               saw grinding through  something  then stop  she picks up 
               a heavy glass paperweight from a bookcase shelf and conceals 
               it in her hand

               she reaches the doorway to the living room and adjacent dining 
               area  sees lecter straightening krendlers sweatband

               the doctor glances up and regards her calmly

                                     lecter
                         clarice  what are you doing up  
                         you should be resting  get back to 
                         bed

                                     starling
                         im hungry

               krendlers head slowly turns to follow her as she crosses 
               into the dining room unsteadily

                                     starling
                         hello paul

               he doesnt respond  he seems in some kind of trance

                                     lecter
                         paul  dont be rude  say hello to 
                         agent starling

                                     krendler
                         hello starling  i always wanted to 
                         watch you eat

               as lecter lays out another place setting of fine china but 
               not silverware for starling she sees the spent syringe and 
               the autopsy saw on a trivet next to the butane grill

                                     lecter
                         would you like to say grace

                                     krendler
                         me  grace  okay

               he bows his head  starling and lecter dont  she glances 
               to the twisting pendulum of a hurricane clock  the doctor 
               just smiles faintly well aware of the response time

                                     krendler
                         father we thank thee for the 
                         blessings we are about to receive 
                         and dedicate them to thy mercy  
                         forgive us all even white trash 
                         like starling here and bring her 
                         into my service  amen

               as his head comes back up a single rivulet of blood drips 
               out from under the sweatband  lecter stirs at his beurre 
               noisette

                                     lecter
                         paul i have to tell you the apostle 
                         paul couldnt have done better  he 
                         hated women too

               krendler smiles rather stupidly at starling  as much as she 
               hates him she doesnt want to see what she thinks lecter 
               has in store for him and tries to forestall it with 
               conversation and requests 

                                     starling
                         may i have some wine

                         better you should have some broth

               lecter sets about ladling her and krendler tureens of it

                                     krendler
                         by the way starling that was a job

                                     lecter
                         paul  please  now you are being 
                         rude  drink your broth

               as lecter puts a straw in the tureen to krendlers lips and 
               whispers something in his ear starling eyes the sharper 
               utensils on the other side of the table next to the grill

                                     krendler
                         this soups not very good

                                     lecter
                         i admit i added a little something 
                         extra to yours  perhaps its clashing 
                         with the cumin  i assure you though 
                         youll love the second course that 
                         is if i can serve it before clarice 
                         bashes my head in

               he commands her to show him whats in the hand in her lap 
               with a smile and a slight tip of his head  she obeys setting 
               the paperweight weapon on the table

                                     krendler
                         hey thats mine

               lecter rakes it across to him with a folk like a croupier

               as krendler shakes it and watches snow fall on the capital 
               building hes oblivious to lecter taking off his sweatband 
               revealing the neat incision carved all the way around

               starling can do little more than we can as lecter lifts the 
               top of krendlers head off  staring in disbelief at the 
               pinkygray dome of krendlers exposed brain  lecter reaches 
               for a set of tonsil spoons as the butter in the saute pan 
               sizzles to a golden brown

                                     starling
                         i really would like some wine

               lecter poised over krendlers brain with the tongs looks 
               at her disapprovingly  shes holding out her empty glass 
               like oliver as the pendulum twists back and forth

                                     lecter
                         all right  but just a little

               he sets the spoons down  pours some chateau dy quem into 
               her glass as he glances to the twisting pendulum

                                     lecter
                         unlike paul i unfortunately cant 
                         offer you a job in government  but 
                         i am curious  what will you do now

               right now her hand is slowly inching across the tablecloth 
               toward a serrated knife  lecter picks it up and one of the 
               tongs and deftly severs the thalamus of krendlers brain 

                                     starling
                         doctor lec 

                                     lecter
                         you certainly cant return to the 
                         bureau  not that youd want to  
                         even if you could convince them to 
                         take you back after all this the 
                         stain of reinstatement would never 
                         go away

               krendlers eyes look up as if to see whats going on then 
               follow lecters hands as he sets his prefrontal lobe in the 
               saute pan

                                     krendler
                         what did you say

                                     starling
                         i didnt say anything

                                     krendler
                         i had plans for that smart mouth 
                         but id never hire you now  who 
                         gave you an appointment anyway

               lecter picks up the tongs again to scoop out another lobe

                                     lecter
                         the brain itself feels no pain 
                         clarice if that concerns you  and 
                         paul certainly wont miss this  the 
                         prefrontal lobe is the seat of 
                         manners

                                     starling
                         dr lecter your profile at the border

                         you clarice  cheap and metallic 
                         like sucking on a greasy coin to me  
                         your soup is getting cold

               he spoons out a second lobe and stirs it into the pan 

                                     krendler
                         that smells great

                                     lecter
                         have a taste paul

               he slides a taste of the second course onto a small plate 
               forks a piece and slips it into krendlers open mouth

                                     krendler
                         ummm it is good

               from him to her and back again

                                     lecter

                         my phones whoever you are  that 
                         accent is just too  appalachian  
                         the honorable paul krendlers 
                         office

                                     lecter
                         paul

                                     krendler
                         what

                                     lecter
                         remember what i said before  if you 
                         cant be polite to the other guests 
                         you have to sit at the kids table

               he sets the plates and sauce pan and all the utensils 
               including the knife  in krendlers lap and unlocks the 
               wheels of the chair

                                     lecter
                         ill just be a minute cleaning up 
                         clarice  dont get up paul will 
                         help me clear

               as lecter pushes krendler toward the kitchen he glimpses on 
               the way the headlights of a line of cars coming silently 
               along the shoreline

                                     lecter
                         think about what i said but dont 
                         drink any more wine while you do  
                         doctors orders

               as soon as the door to the kitchen swings shut she gets up 
               too fast almost faints sits back down  listening for a 
               moment to the scraping of plates she tries again to stand 
               slower this time  she blows out a candle grasps the stem 
               of the heavy brass holder and with it and the phone cord 
               slowly crosses toward the closed kitchen door

               she slowly eases it open revealing  lecter his back to 
               her scraping the leftovers into krendlers head and setting 
               the plates neatly in the dishwasher  he closes its door 
               then and switches it on and keeping his back to her begins 
               wiping down the counters with a dish towel

               she eases past the door gripping the heavy candlestick and 
               slowly approaches lecter from behind grateful for the hum 
               of the dishwasher that covers the creaking of the floorboards

               krendler is staring right at her as he shakes his capital 
               paperweight  she places a finger to her lips to tell him 
               not to speak and he glances away to the tiny falling snow

                                     krendler
                         would you like to swing on a star  
                         carry moonbeams home in a jar 

               the candlestick comes up and hangs there  as if starling 
               isnt entirely sure she wants to crack lecters skull open  
               but then it does come down hard right at his head and 

               turning he catches her wrist in his hand and pushes her 
               roughly against the refrigerator toppling the wheelchair 
               and krendler the rest of his brain and some leftovers 
               spilling onto the floor  lecter holds starling firmly in 
               his grip staring at her intending it appears to kill 
               her  but then quietly 

                                     lecter
                         thats my girl  if you hadnt tried 
                         i would have killed you but dont 
                         try again i mean it

               he lets her hands go and she immediately lunges for him again  
               he grabs her wrists again pushes her back up against the 
               fridge opens it enough to catch her ponytail in the door 
               and shoves the candlestick through the sidebyside handles

                                     lecter
                         oh clarice you are the honey in 
                         the lion  in times to come whenever 
                         you see yourself naked whenever you 
                         see the scar  the quality of the 
                         stitching  youll remember this 
                         moment 

               his face his sharp teeth come threateningly close to her

               he kisses her hard on the mouth

                                     lecter
                          and your lips will burn

               he steps away past krendler and the wheelchair picks up a 
               small tupperware container from the counter and walks out 
               leaving her to try to free herself

               ext the cottage  moments later

               starling comes slowly out onto the porch  looks for movement 
               in the dark shapes of the trees across the road and sees 
               none  looks out across the chesapeake and sees nothing in 
               its dark water  except that the little rowboat once tied 
               to the dock is now gone

               feeling faint again  or just tired of it all  she sits on 
               the porch swing slows her breathing and the pounding of her 
               heart listens to the creak of the chains and the growl of 
               the approaching police cars and watches the glare of the 
               approaching headlights play across the dark trees of the 
               forest

                                                               dissolve to

               a vermeer

               hanging in a gallery  foreign museum visitors strolling 
               past giving it a glance before moving on  one man though 
               seems unable to get enough of it standing before it as if 
               before a shrine as the others keep moving past  its barney  
               the painting woman holding the balance 

                                                              dissolves to

               a reclining woman

               asleep on a blanket on a beach  starling  a beach ball and 
               a walkman resting beside her  the cord runs up across the 
               scar on her exposed midriff to a light pair of headphones  
               instead of music she hears static before

                         run  onepointfivemil ricky 
                         flat fee

               the conversation is overtaken by static again  keeping her 
               eyes closed starling nudges the beach ball and the voices 
               of the man and woman just two tiny figures waist deep in 
               the miami beach surf reemerge from the static 

                                     woman vo

               beachcomber passes walking along the wet sand between 
               starling on the beach and the couple in the water  crawford  
               in the headphones starling hears

                         was put on sun screen

               she smiles without opening her eyes  reaches down out of 
               habit to adjust her top to cover the scar

                                     crawford vo

                         see it 

               the roar of a jet covers his last word 

                                                               dissolve to
