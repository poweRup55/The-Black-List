               next to boring sucks is the
               most painfully overused word in the
               current english language i thought
               if i could reverse the meaning of
               sucks so it means something
               positive i dont knowit would
               be vaguely revolutionary its kind
               of my social experiment for the

     into the already toofrightening fire donald rips open a             
     bag of marshmallows and pokes them on to his campers twigs

     turning from the youngsters wendy incongruously loses her
     smile staring down to her hands insane shorthand one can
     almost feel the buzzing in her brain suddenly a marshmallow
     she is lazily roasting bursts into flame she quickly blows
     it outthen slowly spookily squeezes the burnt marshmallow
     into her scribbled hand taking the pain 

     wichita scans to this strange image he quickly snatches
     up a blanket and a canteen he bounds to wendy and swathes
     her paw as they speak

     realizing its the seriously troubled dont touch me todd 

                        dont touch me todd
               you touched me  you touched me

     wendy sighs with amused compassion as donald tries to turn
     the boy off she pivots back to the block of sunbathers
     a water balloon whips past her right into the radio causing
     it to static the sunbathers shriek 

     wendy swerves to the sight of wichita and the boys cackling
     away wendy doesnt know whether to shout in anger or
     amusement a frog gribbits at her feet she smiles 

     wichita and the boys continue to whoop it up with intentional
     goldmedalwin exaggeration wendy with the sunbathing girls
     as giggling chorus rushes up and puts a frog down wichitas
     trunks 

     wendy races off the boys whoa the girls yes wichita
     wrenches the beast out with an impressed chuckle he narrows
     his eyes to wendy bounding like a doe into the woods then
     slowly looks down to the frog he breaks into a dash

     wichita pants into the woods the crackling bramble at his
     feet and the croaking frog in his hand are the forests only
     sounds  wichita weaves his vision tree to tree trying to
     lock on to his targethe scans a blur of bikini darting
     behind a cedar he heaves forward

     an envious donald and a coed cluster of campers have entered
     into the brush berating each other with shushing sounds
     like one multilegged beast they rustle toward wichita 

     wichita swings around a tree with an ancient heart and
     initials carved upon it to see wendy lying in wait against
     the next tree over seemingly unaware of wichitas presence
     behind her 

     as wichita panthers forward wendy bites her lip and closes
     her eyes wichita carefully reaches out to the bikini bottom 
     clenching his teeth dangling the frog 

     catching discreet sight of this strange image the boys and
     girls slam to a gasping halt 

     talia and her hikers from a ridge above catch another angle

     it is the wailing child from the opening who now has a               
     glowing expression that matches the one on his tshirt

               talia hows it going 

     a camper boy next to wendy 

     screeches down to the palm of his hand

     wendy rackfocuses to the view of a bee pollenbingeing upon
     a nearby flower she ferally crawls over and squeezes the
     flower and the bee launching into a therapeutic scream 

     the boy wipes away his tears giggling at wendy as she
     shuffles to the edge of the minimountain raising her stung
     palm in the air 

                        wendy 
               all this time talking down to the
               kids talking around the kids no

     continues to threateningly sizzle across a fuse                      

     over by talia and donald 

     a tensing up donald waits for an opening with talia 

                        talia

               all in all id rather be in india
               i find their culture to be so

     talias eyes widen donald and the nearby campers cower 

                        talia 
               oh my youre making your big move

     talia tears down the hill a concerned hayley calls out 

                        hayley
               talia dont go 

                        talia

                        hayley 
               everything 

     blood starts to cascade from hayleys shorts as the nearby
     campers freak away talia jolts toward her

     wendy 

     continues to rave stung hand in air back to the viewer 

                        wendy 
               it took something as simple as a 
               bee sting to remind me that a part
               of myself will always be a camper
               you have to be hurt in order to heal
               today is the first day i can truly
               call myself counselor 

     wendy pivots around her face has spookily swelled up the
     surrounding children immediately explode into watchinga
     monstermovie fingerpointing wails of fear and amusement 

     donald 

     wobbles to the ground in mortification hearing a sizzling
     noise he turns to see billys lit fuse blazing toward a
     frog covered with taped firecrackers 

     the disgusting sounds of the thankfully unseen explosion
     are thrown into the mountaintop mix donald staggers pvt
     ryanstyle sprinkled with frogs blood 

     some counselors are huddled in a nearby trench they watch
     troublemaker billy fall to the ground laughing

     wichita 

     stands staring out the other edge of the mountain his back
     turned to all the ferocious activity the soundtrack goes 
     silent for oberons narration

                        oberon narration vo
               much like a little boy who throws
               sand at the girl in the sandbox
               because he likes her wichita had
               helped turn the mountain into a
               rumbling volcano that had almost
               given wendy a nervous breakdown 
               a good time was had but it was now
               time to move on to start to take
               responsibility to deal with the
               implications of the photograph on
               wendys wall

     sounds of chaos come back wichita finally turns and tanks
     forward making sharp scans to the pockets of anarchy around
     him darkening clouds traumatized campers the bloodstained
     statue of donald the wailing wake around a froglike crater
     talia helping hemorrhaging hayley down the hill laughing
     billy  zombie mutant wendy 

     wichita exchanges nods with a rather familiar girl the
     rather familiar girl goes into the throes of a very familiar
     epileptic fit immediately sobering everyone 

     however the creature that will not die the monstrously
     swollen wendy continues to hobble forward 

                        wendy 
               you know i think i forgot to remember
               that im allergic to bee stings

     degree wendy moans away on a cot wichita is by her side
     surrounded by some of the other counselors 

     on the other side of the curtain 

     trying to rip open a tampon talia is crouched before a
     standing shivering hayley both are crying 

                        talia 
               whew that wasnt a period that
               was an exclamation mark you know

               go do something leave her view

     ext   on top of the hillnight 

     this moment of passion turns into the sight of a full moon 
     complemented by the howl of an animal the viewers viewpoint
     drifts down to see that the howl comes from a wildhaired
     oberon seen from the back in a mountain man frock

     as wendy sheepishly departs donald removes his hand from             
     a contemplative position on his face revealing a comically           
     concentrated patch of acne a frisbee swooshes into donalds

     oberon bangs into the disarray of his office trembling              
     oberon heaves up the crashed bookshelf from the ground and            
     carefully places in it a lone discarded camp workbooklet

     beard  oberon then opens the mirror revealing a shiny pair          
     of scissors

     the mirror closes on the scissors oberon smoothes his now            
     completely shaven face with a familiarly severe expression          
     the director sweeps across his now completely clean and
     sterile office and tugs on his headset
