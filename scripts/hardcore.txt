               int van dorn house  kitchen  day

               four generations of the van dorn family have gathered at the 
               family home

               a long kitchen leads to the dining area then to the spacious 
               living room

               the house is perhaps one hundred years old deeply varnished 
               woodwork and patterned yellow wallpaper section off the walls

               apart from several recent tasteless acquisitions an ez boy 
               lounge chair to replace the old queen anne which broke two 
               easters ago the house remains furnished in the style of 
               the previous century the old dining room table which 
               grandfather van dorn built because he was too cheap to buy 
               one has now become a priceless antique

               the rooms are littered with religious calendars bibles and 
               plasterofparis plaques bearing such sentiments as as for 
               me and my house we will serve the lord the oak buffet is 
               laden with similar religious knickknacks and chintz framed 
               tinted photographs of the family patriarchs are 
               indiscriminately mixed with newer snapshots of proud fathers 
               and high school graduates

               the house radiates a sense of continuity generations come 
               and go the family remains all of lifes old home scenes 
               have been played out here births deaths romances 
               blasphemies betrayals and now the air is again alive with 
               the sounds of playing children busy housewives and bickering 
               uncles

               the kitchen is crowded with mothers daughters and aunts 
               each has brought a special dish anne de jong nee van dorn 
               thirtyfive supervises the final preparations one aunt 
               shows another snapshots of her new grandchild

               jake van dorn forty and his brother joe fifty sit at the 
               table watching the kitchen activity

               the house echoes with small talk

                                     aunt
                         he got accepted at grand valley 
                         but hed rather go to michigan

                         cutting celery again this summer 
                         rather work in the car wash

               as the camera tracks through the dining room it passes a 
               cluster of men standing near the buffet wes de jong and 
               john van dorn both about forty casually discuss a 
               theological point with grandfather van dorn across the table 
               a young boy about eleven listens with rapt awe

               these are men of the soil their faces are sunblotched and 
               weatherbeaten wes has rolled up the sleeves of his white 
               shirt john has switched to a more comfortable plaid

                                     john
                         i still say that if a man has 
                         committed the unpardonable sin he 
                         knows he has

               grandfather nods head approvingly

                                     wes

                         designer if i didnt trust her taste 
                         maybe we should bring in more of 
                         that shade perhaps a stripe across 
                         the back wall

               he gestures

               gently relentlessly jake manipulates mary he does not 
               wish to impose his taste on her but through calculated 
               argument will get her to accept his views its only a matter 
               of time before he wears her down

                                     mary

                         like this

               marsha traces another circle inside the first one she draws 
               a narrowing spiral around kristens breast

                         chicken then he stops

               the girls giggle

                                     kristen
                         you and jerry do that

               the girls pull their name tags out of their jeans and clip 
               them on as they walk back toward the church

               only by a large wooden cross

               the christian reformed church is not one which believes in 
               emotional appeals or confessions it is a religion of 
               scripture creed and doctrine reverend vantil dressed in 
               black addresses the congregation as if he were a businessman 
               and his business is sin guilt and redemption

               he speaks calmly and powerfully the church echoes with the 
               weight of his words

               western cities is a ghost town the major businesses have

               leaving the core of the city to cutrate stores parking 
               lots and federallysubsidized government buildings

                         here
                              gestures
                         its closed now but im borrowing 
                         it for an hour i think theres 
                         something youd better see

               int theatre  day

               jake is uncomfortably seated in the dingy thirtyseat theatre 
               mast walks back from the projection booth as the film starts

               he sits next to van dorn we slowly track into jakes face 
               as the color drains from it os we hear groans and the 
               sounds of flesh on flesh

               we track slowly into the film itself

               a 16mm hardcore short on a simple but classic theme  rape 
               two young men force a young unwilling girl to submit to 
               their desires the girl  kristen  nude tries to get out 
               of a wrinkled bed but is restrained by the long arm of a 
               languid longhaired nude youth another young man wearing 
               only pink elastic shorts steps into the frame and takes 
               kristen into his arms

               the quality of the action is quite low the young men posture 
               and overact in the manner of high school dramatics 
               occasionally the action stops while the actors receive cues 
               from an offscreen director grunts and groans are dubbed 
               into the screen action

               only kristens performance lends a note of credibility to 
               the proceedings she is genuinely disoriented or frightened  
               or both shes not play acting

               for one frightening moment kristen regaining full 
               consciousness fights back but the youth in pink shorts 
               slaps her into submission her eyes turn pleadingly toward 
               the camera

               the first youth laughs and takes kristen into his arms the 
               youth in the pink shorts kneels on the edge of the bed and 
               instructs kristen to remove his shorts as she begins to do 
               this the first youth fucks her from the rear

               as the film ends jake sinks his head into his hands speaking 
               to himself its almost as if were hearing his thoughts

                                     jake
                         it cant be why me what have i 
                         done

               looking up he says softly then louder

                                     jake
                              continuing
                         turn it off
                              a beat
                         turn it off
                              a beat
                         turn it off
                              a beat
                         turn it off

               only then does jake realize that the film has already been 
               shut off and hes sitting alone in the quiet theatre

               mast stands by the exit jake gets up and walks toward him

                                                                    cut to

               the room the projectionist a boy about 15 stands next to 
               a battered old 16mm silent projector

               two other men sit in the darkened room one looks middle
               aged and decadent the other about 26 wears jeans a western 
               shirt and a beat up flight jacket hes saved up several 
               years for this

               jake sits in an empty office chair next to the other men

               tod nods to the boy and he starts up the projector a grainy 
               black and white image appears on the screen

               the projectionist punches a cheap cassette player which echoes 
               scratchy mexican fiesta music through the room

               its clear why the projectionist has chosen a latin sound 
               track the film is set up in a tijuana flophouse

               on screen a girl with long blonde hair and kristens build 
               sits on the edge of a barren double bed she wears jeans and 
               a shirt her face is covered by a black leather mask the 
               eye slits are taped shut

               a cerveza poster of a halfnaked mexican girl hangs on the 
               wall behind her

               a young mexican stripped to the waist walks over to the 
               girl taking instructions from someone off camera he starts 
               to undress her

               the girl unable to see her seducer nevertheless submits to 
               his desires

               flicker across a metal filing cabinet behind him tod slips 
               out of the room

               on screen the young mexican has finished the girl he turns 
               to the director for further instructions

               a man wearing a white suit walks into the frame he flashes 
               a stiletto from his sleeve and stabs the young mexican the 
               girl not able to see what is happening turns her head 
               quizzically

               jake watches in unbelieving horror the young man in the 
               flight jacket is calm and dispassionate

               the young mexican falls to the floor bleeding the man in 
               the white suit bends down and wipes the stiletto on the 
               mexicans pant leg

               the man in the white suit steps over to the girl and puts 
               one hand under her mask he lifts his stiletto again he 
               rips off the mask from the girls face it is not kristen

               jake is relieved the faces of the others are full of 
               anticipation

               jakes relief turns to horror at what he now sees blurred 
               images reflect against the metal cabinet behind him
