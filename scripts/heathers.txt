     fade in

     ext sawyers backyarddawn

     elegiac music murmurs as three female and barefoot pairs of
     legs in skirts break from tableau to gently engage in croquet
     a blue mallet hits a blue ball through a wicket a green
     mallet knocks a green ball and a yellow mallet pushes forward
     a yellow ball all in enticing syncopation

     suddenly a red ball rockets through the dew covered grass and
     hits the green ball the legs all stop moving as a fourth pair
     of legs this one in stylish shoes and stockings marches to
     the red ball and steps on it a red mallet is brought down
     hard on the red ball causing the adjacent green ball to
     thunder out of view the pair of legs manuevering the green
     ball departs this process of elimination is grimly
     repeated with the yellow ball and yet again with the blue
     ball

     however when the blue malleted player makes her sad exit
     the viewers viewpoint glides along with this particular pair
     of legs a red ball whizzes by the legs stop another red
     ball malevolently sails past the legs then yet another red
     ball a fourth red ball makes brutal contact with the legs
     causing the player to fall to her knees and into the frame the
     player is veronica sawyer

     int veronicas bedroomday

     veronica sawyer a sullen seventeen year old beauty lies atop
     her bed dressed in a chic but understated ensemble her eyes
     glazed open in a morning reverie she blows up at her bangs
     then slides off her bed launching into voiceover narration
     over the empty bed

                             veronica vo
               heather told me she teaches people
               real life

     int high school hallwayday

     continuing her narration veronica glides through a bustling
     high school hallway with a frozen smile

                             veronica vo
               she said real life sucks losers dry
               if you want to fuck with the eagles
               you have to learn to fly

     int hallway outside cafeteriaday

     with her back turned to the viewer veronica stands at the
     outskirts of the cafeteria entrance the viewers viewpoint
     approaches and finally curls around veronica to reveal that
     she is writing in a diary wearing a monocle

                             veronica vo
               i said so you teach people how to
               spread their wings and fly she
               said yes

     the diary page

     veronicas pen sways across the diary page forming the words
     echoed by her voiceover

                             veronica vo
               i said youre beautiful

     a sudden offscreen bark from heather mcnamara causes the pen
     to recklessly rocket across the written words

                             heather mcnamara os
               god comeonveronica

     veronica coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily
     addressing the amusingly robust conventionally beautiful
     trendily coiffed heather mcnamara

                             veronica
               whats your damage heather you
               ruined my

                             heather mcnamara

               blame heather she told me to haul
               your ass into the caf pronto back
               me up heather

     from behind heather mcnamara emerges a similarly trendily
     accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif heather duke
     she is clutching a tattered copy of the catcher in the rye

                             heather duke
               yeah she really wants to talk to you

                             veronica
               okay im going im going jesus

     int inside the cafeteriaday

     veronica flanked by heather mcnamara and heather duke
     strides into the lunchroom pandemonium

     the stunning heather chandler turns from the tray before her
     toward her incoming comrades she is dressed stylishly and
     expensively but not trendily her hair dramatically tied
     back

                             veronica
                       submissively
               hello heather

     pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper heather
     chandler smiles the content of what heather says is
     consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks
     is sexy dangerous and mysterious she is a mythic bitch

                             heather chandler
               veronica finally got a paper of
               kurt kellys i need you to forge
               a hot and horny but realistically
               lowkey note in kurts handwriting
               and well slip it into martha
               dumptrucks lunch tray

                             veronica

                             heather chandler
                       looking off
               dont think

     pov on cafeteria line

     unattractive and quite overweight martha dunnstockdumptruck
     guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in
     line

     cafeteria entrance

     veronicas arm seemingly involuntary latches onto the
     outstretched pen

                             heather chandler
               splendid ill dictate veronica
               needs something to write on
               heather bend over

     both heather mcnamara and heather duke bend over heather
     chandler violently laughs

                             heather chandler
               how nice two assholes no waiting

     heather mcnamara and heather duke stand erect embarrassed

                             heather chandler
               heather duke back down

     veronica scurries to the contorting heather duke

                             heather chandler
               dear martha youre so sweet

     the jocks table

     the traditionally handsome kurt kelly and the massive ram sit
     with other typical jocks taking in veronica and the heathers

                             kurt
               itd be so righteous to be in a
               veronica sawyerheather chandler
               sandwich punch it in ram

     kurt and ram raise their right arms and slam their fists
     together

                             ram
               hell yes i wanna set a heather on
               my johnson and just start spinning
               her like a fucking pinwheel

     ram makes a frantic spinning motion

     cafeteria entrance

     in slow motion veronica finishes the note and rises up along
     with her makeshift desk heather duke

     heather mcnamara hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line

     veronica hands the note to an impressed heather chandler

     martha dunnstockdumptruck pays the cashier and then grasping
     her lunch tray with both hands moves toward veronica and the
     heathers

     heather mcnamara excitedly tugs on heather chandlers arm as
     martha approaches with a tranquil smile heather chandler
     passes the note to her frantic disciple

     in a selfconsciously clandestine manner heather mcnamara
     saunters past martha then wields around to sneakily tuck the
     note onto marthas tray

     the slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles
     past a magnetic preppie peter dawson and a thin black
     bespectacled dennis the guys are working a large stand which
     has a cashbox reading the foodless fund and a banner reading
     westerburg feeds the world

                             peter
               come on people lets give that
               leftover lunch money to people
               without lunches those tater tots

               in africa theyre thanksgiving dinner

     heathers table

     the girls reach their table with heather mcnamara and heather
     duke sitting themselves down first

                             heather mcnamara
                       looking to the stand
               god arent they fed yet do they
               even have thanksgiving in africa

                             veronica
                       low key sarcasm
               oh sure pilgrims indians tater
               tots its a real party continent

     heather chandler draws up a clipboard

                             heather chandler
               sawyer guess what today is

                             veronica

               i forgot

     another angle

     veronica and heather chandler briskly bop away from the table
     as a wounded heather duke retreats to the catcher in the rye

                             veronica
               hey this question wouldnt be that
               bizarro thing you were babbling
               about over the phone last

               gave me another topic that was
               political id spew burrito chunks

     veronica shakes her head and looks off shes suddenly
     captured by the sight of a james deanesque guy sitting stark
     in a long tan gunslinger coat behind arebelwithoutacauselunchbox they make eye contact

     transfixed veronica crashes into seated betty finn a
     slightly overweight unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by
     clones

                             betty
               sorry veronica

                             veronica
               betty finn gosh

     veronica crouches down embarrassed and rueful

                             veronica

               to your birthday party last month

               a big date heck id probably skip

     veronica gently laughs at bettys innocent awe

                             veronica
              dont say that

                             betty
              oh ronnie you have to look at
              what i dug up the other day

     betty pulls from her purse a picture showing a young betty
     finn and veronica sawyer arminarm dressed in halloween
     costumes betty is an angel veronica is a witch

     veronica glows at the photo until heather chandler tows
     veronica away causing the picture to fall face up on the
     floor

     another angle

                             veronica
               i was talking with someone

     heather chandler veronica in tow hits the country club kids
     with a salvo of false pleasantness capped by a scowling
     smile

                             heather chandler
               hi courtney love your blouse ooh

     courtney expresses elation in spite of herself as heather
     chandler delicately takes a tot and turns around to face
     veronica heather chandler inserts her finger in her mouth
     doing the inducevomiting signal before devouring the tot
     and turning back around

     panting veronica collapses at a desk in the coat room she
     draws a vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours
     some in her beer cup slouching down in her chair

     veronica lights a match from a 711 matchbook she eerily
     brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it
     touches

     with an eek of pain she tosses the match away into the vodka
     cup setting it afire veronica laughs to herself before

     int heather chandlers bedroomday

     heather chandlers bedroom is lushly and expensively furnished
     with a glass coffee table as an eyecatching centerpiece
     heather chandler halfsleeps in twisted bedsheets as mrs
     chandlers voice attacks through the door

                             mrs chandler os

               lingo this

     int the chandler kitchenday

     the sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before
     veronica and jd burst through the door

                             veronica
                       quietly
               trust me she skips the saturday
               morning trip to grandmas even
               when shes not hungover

               little hangover cure thatll induce

     veronica opens the refrigerator jd opens the cupboard
     beneath the sink

                             veronica
               what about orange juice and milk
               whats the upchuck factor on that

     jd holds up a bottle of cleaning fluid

                             jd

               kill her

     veronica and jd make queasy eyecontact veronica descends
     back into the refrigerator with some workedup enthusiasm as
     jd suavely pours bits of various toxic containers
     detergent scouring powder into a glass beer mug

                             veronica
               okay well cook up some soup and put
               it in a coke sick eh now should it

               man veronica pull the plug on that
               shit i say we go with big blue

     jd raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue
     liquid veronica stares at the glass scared by her own
     thoughts

                             veronica
               what are youdoing you just

               okay well use this she wont be
               able to tell what shes drinking

     jd pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the
     poisonously blue beer glass contents into it an eerie pause
     ensues veronica takes out a milk carton and a container of
     orange juice she struts back to the counter in anger icily
     muttering

                             veronica
               just give me a cup jerk

     jd sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup veronica
     tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange
     juice into the cup

                             veronica
               milk and orange juice hmmmm maybe
               we could cough a phlegm globber in
               it or something

                             jd
               yeah great

               youre not funny

     jd turns on his heel and slinks away veronica glares down
     at the mess of toxic containers

     with both arms veronica clumps the toxic containers together
     and drops beneath the sink to put them away jd swaggers
     back into the kitchen as veronica bobs back into view

                             jd
               im sorry

     jd kisses the back of her neck veronica closes her eyes
     with a grudging smile

                             veronica
               bonehead

     veronica dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups

     not the one with milk and orange juice in it

     int heather chandlers bedroomday

     heather chandler angelically sleeps as veronica and jd

     veronica stares off as jd paces like a caged animal he
     scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees
     cliff notes forthe bell jarplus a magazine proclaiming
     the fall of the american teen under heather chandlers body

                             jd
               we did a murder in ohio thats a crime

                             veronica
               like a suicide thing

                             jd
               adolescence is a period of life
               fraught with anxiety and confusion

                             veronica
                       calming down
               i can do heathers handwriting as
               well as my own

     veronica takes some stationery from the desk and begins
     writing calling out her words

                             veronica
               you might think what ive done is
               shocking

                             jd
               to me though suicide is the
               natural answer to the myriad
               of problems life has given me

                             veronica
               thats good but heather would
               never use the word myriad

                             jd
               this is the last thing shell ever
               write shell want to cash in on as
               many fiftycent words as poss

                             veronica
               she missed myriad on a vocab
               test two weeks ago all right

                             jd
               that only proves my point more the word
               is a badge for her failures at school

                             veronica
               youre probably rightpeople think
               just because youre beautiful and
               popular life is easy and fun nobody
               understood i had feelings too

                             jd
               i die knowing no one knew the real me

                             veronica
               thats good have you done this before

     veronicas smile dies as she looks to heather chandlers corpse

     int school conference roomday

     at the head of a long conference table is the bearlike
     principal gowan circling the table is the grayhaired but
     savvy mrs pope the yuppie black counselor paul hyde two
     large disciplinariantypes and most noticeably the
     eccentrically dressed ms pauline fleming coats are in chairs
     and cigarette smoke is in the air as the group batters their
     way through a morning mourning conference

                             principal gowan
               any other principal would take the same
               position keep things business as usual

                             counselor hyde
               heather chandlers not your everyday
               suicide she wasverypopular

                             principal gowan
               come on paul i let the kids go before
               lunch and the switchboardll light up
               like a christmas tree

                             counselor hyde
               the parents will be sympathetic sir
               these are troubled times for the young

                             mrs pope
               i must say i was impressed to see
               that she made proper use of the word
               myriad in her suicide note after
               brutalizing it in a vocabulary test

                             pauline
                       dramatically cutting in
               i find it profoundly disturbing that
               we are told of a tragic destruction
               of youth and all we can talk about
               is adequate mourning times and
               misused vocabulary words

     a collective sigh goes across the room

                             principal gowan
               oh christ

                             pauline
               the school meaning both students
               and teachers must revel in this
               revealing moment i suggest we get
               everyone into the cafeteria and
               just talk and feel together

                             principal gowan

     int pauline flemings classroomday

     the desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an
     amusingly chaotic position by paulines pupils she is
     furious

                             pauline
               i said a circle you imbeciles forget
               it just sit down im just sothrilledto be given an example of everything
               ive taught you that example is
               heather chandler i have the note

     pauline melodramatically lifts the suicide note the class aaahs

                             male student
               awright

                             pauline
               ill pass the suicide note around
               the room so you can feel its tragic
               beauty for yourself let us share
               together the feelings the suicide has
               spurred in us all who wants to begin

                             female stoner in army jaket
               i heard it was really gnarly she sucked
               down a bowl of multipurpose deodorizing
               disinfectant then she smashed

                             pauline
               now now were not here to rehash
               the coroners report lets talkemotions

                             allout nerd
               are we going to be tested on this

     a stunned pauline glares until preppie peter dawson speaks
     the note continues to be breathlessly passed around

                             peter
               heather and i used to go together
               but she said i was boring i realize
               now i wasnt really boring she was
               just dissatisfied with her life

                             pauline
               thats very good peter

     veronica lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by
     putting her hands over her face

                             pauline
               dear veronica heather was your
               soulmateshare

                             veronica
               heather was cool but cruel the good
               looks and bad manners gave her power
               but it could not give her happiness

     the class stares to veronica as the suicide note is passed to
     her she acknowledges it in horror passes it on then
     continues realizing her ability to create truths for a
     captive audience

                             veronica
               she realized the only way she could
               be happy was to give up her power and
               the only way she could do that was death

     pauline cries the pupils applaud veronica queasily smiles

               things youve been saying to really
               happen its always been a fantasy of
               mine to have two guys at once
               sure you can write penthouse forum

     revealed to be lounging on her bed jd laughs out loud
     veronica throws a book at him

                             veronica

     into a laugh

                             veronica
               i dont get the point of me writing
               a suicide note when well just be
               shooting them with blanks

                             jd
               get crucial we wont be using
               blanks this time

                             veronica
               you cant be serious hey listen
               my bonnieandclyde days are over

     veronica drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed
     with a patient smile jd pulls her back down

                             jd
               do you take german

                             veronica
               french

     jd flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber

                             jd
               these are ich luge bullets my
               grandfather snared a shitload of
               them in ww two theyre like
               tranquilizers only they break the
               surface of the skin enough to
               cause blood but not any real harm

                             veronica
               so it looks like the persons been
               shot and killed when theyre really
               just unconscious and bleeding

     jd nods then stands to pace the room his mind whirring

                             jd
               we shoot kurt and ram make it look
               like they shot each other by the time
               kurt and ram regain consciousness
               theyll be the laughingstocks of the
               school the notes the punchline
               howd it turn out

     veronica clumsily extracts the note from her purse she also
     plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of kurts handwriting of
     the opening noteforge scene she proudly displays both
     papers

                             veronica
               first tell me this similarity is
               not incredible

                             jd
                       warmly
               incredible similarity

     veronica pulls back the note and reads

                             veronica
               ram and i died the day we realized
               we could never reveal our forbidden
               love to an uncaring and ununderstanding
               world the joy we shared in each others
               arms was greater than any touchdown yet
               we were forced to live the lie of sexist
               beer guzzlingjockasshole

                             jd
               exquisite but i dont think
               ununderstanding is a word

                             veronica
               we dont want to make them out to be
               too secretly eloquent why would the
               germans invent a bullet that doesnt
               kill people i mean itwasworld war
               two not a school play

                             jd
                       rapidfire
               they used them on themselves to
               make it look like they were dead
               really quite a brilliant device but
               too flamboyant to seriously produce

                             veronica
               neat lets try it out on jfk

     veronica swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable
     tabby entering the room jd rips it away from her

                             jd
               it doesnt work on small animals

                             veronica

                             jd
               uh well hey lets take a look at the
               homosexual artifacts i dug up to plant
               at the scene now prepare to be a
               little disappointed

     jd lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the
     contents on the bed

                             jd
               weve got an issue of stud puppy a
               candy dish a joan crawford post card

     kurt steps into the scratchedinthedirt circle next to him
     a confused ram walks past veronica and steps into a circle at
     the opposite end of the foggy clearing

                             veronica


     the guys pause then slowly start taking off their clothes

     rips out her gun and swings it toward kurt using both hands
     she fires but misses completely kurt runs away onto the
     path veronica throws down her gun with a smile

                             veronica

     and confused she watches jd bolt into the woods

     off the path

     moves into the opening and raises his gun kurt runs back

     veronica approaches rams body with increasing shivers he
     does not look bleeding and unconscious he looks bleeding and
     dead dead dead

               and gods losing

     veronica drops her head back and closes her eyes popping out
     her monocle she swoons down against the bed onto the
     floor and curls into a fetal slumber

     int the cafeteriaday

     students eat and buzz together in typical cacophony all are
     wearing black armbands a jukebox roars

     pauline fleming and an entourage of students such as peter
     dawson and the heathers invade the cafeteria heads raised high

                             pauline
               peter kill the jukebox

     as the music amusingly grinds to a halt pauline hoists up
     a bullhorn to her lips and crackles

                             pauline
               could i have your attention

     a startled geek rodney splatters milk all over himself

     students whip their heads around to the front of the cafeteria
     martha dunnstockdumptruck warily looks up from her plate

     pauline fleming chants with soaring selfimportance

                             pauline
               our school has been torn apart by
               tragedy im here today to fuse it
               back together through togetherness
               i want everyone to clasp hands
               we need to connect this cafeteria
               into one mighty circuit

     a tableau of dumbfounded students stare at the bullhorn woman

     int hallway outside of cafeteriasame timeday

     hungover in dark sunglasses veronica bustles toward the
     cafeteria entrance clinging to an armful of books while trying
     to tie a black armband onto herself

     int the cafeteriaday

     paulines evita peronlike composure is crumbling

                             pauline
               yo whats the problem i know you
               know how to hold hands ringaround
               therosyapocketfulofposyforget it
                       looking to her watch then peter
               where are they

     her back to the viewer veronica enters the cafeteria heather
     duke floats into view and tightly knots veronicas armband

                             veronica
               i see ms phlegms on another crusade
               with usual success

                             heather duke
                       looking to the viewer
               i have a feeling this onell work

     veronica turns to the viewer and halfgasps

     two 2person video camera crews and a still photographer burst
     into the cafeteria slightly battering the intheway veronica

     pauline smiles in relief she wields around lifting the horn

                             pauline
               the cameras are here lock your paws

     slightly confused but awesomed a table of country club kids
     including courtney stand and latch out to each other a nearby
     table with betty finn and friends follow suit

     veronica looks on with a growing sense of queasiness

     the cafeteria swirls into a frenzy with members of more
     excitable cliques like the jocks and the heavy metalers
     jumping over and onto tables anxiously bumbling into hand
     holding constellations camera crews weave beside them
     in a corner the photographer snaps a shot of a thumbsup
     peter dawson with his arms around female stoner in army jacket

     pauline runs ahead of a hustling camera crew and grabs hold of
     a chain of handholding jocks she pulls the chain until it
     connects up with a grateful chain of betty finns

     a sleeping heather mcnamara drearily awakens to the havoc around
     her she takes off her black armband ties it around her
     eyes and droops her head back down on a table

     veronica lets her books slide from her hands shaking her head

     martha dunnstock nervously looks to her outofcontrol peers

     heather duke slyly looks to veronica with an if you cant
     beat em smile then saunters into the fray she slides onto
     the lap of heavy metaler matt the photographer snaps a shot

     pauline forces apart the handholding heavy metal lovers jackie
     and steve sandwiches dennis in between them and madly departs

     the photographer now shoots a pic of a thumbsup peter dawson
     with his arms around an all out nerd

     veronica stands before the chaos back to the viewer in much
     the same way heather chandler did in the opening scene

     pauline and the geek squad look to martha dunnstockdumptruck

                             rodney
               i may be a geek but i have my pride

                             pauline
               gotchacould i get some stoners
               over here please

     frightened and flustered martha dunnstockdumptruck quakes
     for a moment then crawls underneath her table

     a last panoramic view of the hustling camera crews amid the
     panderingly anarchic students unfolds

     veronica suddenly finds herself flanked by jd the exiting
     camera crews flow past them

                             jd
               was it as good for you as it was for me

     a dumbfounded veronica watches pauline and peter approach

     veronica sighs then rolls over into a crawling position and
     eventually into a walkingoutthedoor position

     as to face the second heather duke warily lowers herself into
     the second desk as jd flops a manilla envelope onto it
     heather duke opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8x10s

     the first shot shows a young heather duke in a summer camp
     uniform that vibrantly reads heather she is holding one end

     a spooked heather duke splashes water on her face and looks up
     into the mirror in a trance she pulls her hair back heather
     chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon jd gave her

     a betty finnalike moves up to the sink beside her two chic
     babes enter the bathroom with pouting expressions seemingly
     in a trance heather duke bends over and wipes off her wet hands
     using the oblivious betty finnalikes dress heather duke
     winks to the nowgiggling chic babes and saunters off

     int hallwayday

     heather duke bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly
     strut down the hall she scowlssmiles in perfect heather
     chandler fashion to various passersby

     another hallwayday

     disoriented veronica somnambulates down the hall she suddenly
     brakes amid the flow of student traffic to stare at a locker
     the locker wears a police linedo not cross sticker veronica
     pulls out a school spirit club id card and moves to the locker

     with the card she wrangles the locker open it contains a
     coat recognizably heather chandlers on the inside door is a
     sizable mirror a cute little heather license plate an
     alexander haig for president sticker and a picture of veronica
     and the heathers all wearing sunglasses and acting tough

     veronica zeroes in on a three frame photo booth picture in
     the first frame veronica and heather chandler stare
     stonefaced in the second frame the two girls are screaming
     at the top of their lungs in the third frame they have
     returned to a stonefaced state veronica touches the picture
     with a quivering smile as two hands flap around her eyes

                             heather duke
               guess who

                             veronica
               heather

     veronica turns around stunned the heather chandleresque
     heather duke can be seen in the locker mirror veronica
     violently pushes heather duke away and storms off

     heather duke peers in the open locker a pair of red earrings
     flash out at her biting her lip she reaches for them

     int veronicas bedroomnight

     lying on the floor veronica concentrates on her phone with
     a deep sigh she pushbuttons out a number she pauses then

                             veronica
               ouch your machines got the most
               obnoxious beep heather im sorry

     veronica slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather
     address book she severely scans through it tossing it away
     veronica then descends into the sundry junk of her night
     table drawer and draws up another address book
     this one is frayed and pink polkadotted she peruses it and
     dials

                             veronica

     ext sawyer backyardlate afternoon

     betty finn hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in

               ronnie

     veoncia gigglingly shoots but misses the wicket and instead
     hits bettys ball disturbed by the sudden dilemma she
     determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from bettys

                             betty
               hey youre not settling for the two shots

     veronica sighs then knocks bettys adjacent ball sailing
     toward the porch and a statuesque earringwearing heather
     duke who does not budge as the ball whizzes past her

     heather duke walks toward the girls followed by a meandering
     desultory heather mcnamara who picks up a green mallet and
     fragilely swings it her early robustness a forgotten memory

                             heather mcnamara
               croquet wont be the same without heather

                             heather duke
                       condescendingly to the passing betty
               oh betty leaving so soonhey im red

     later in the game

     red ball underfoot heather duke savagely sends heather
     mcnamaras green ball into the flower bed

               around theyre going to think uncool
               is the rule at westerburgdamn

     heather dukes shot swerves wide of the wicket

                             veronica
               youre so polluted talking down to
               people making fake notes

               to lectureronnie you were

               seventeen magazine and shes the
               before half of a scarsdale diet ad

     heather duke bashes her ball into veronicas and prepares
     to send it

                             heather duke
               some people just dont matter why
               should those who do carry their
               weight am i right

     as heather duke swings down her mallet veronica steps on her
     own ball when heather dukes mallet makes contact the two
     balls slam against each other unmoving with a loud smack

                             veronica
               no youre wrong its not even
               your turn

     the depressed and disoriented heather mcnamara laying
     against a tree pipes in

               shes rightboy croquets not

               veronica but me and heather are
               going to walk over to the mall
               maybe by the time we head back
               your tamponll be flushed

     as heather duke and heather mcnamara meander out the back of
     the yard an annoyed veronica revolves back toward the house
     to see jd sitting comfortably at the patio table with a
     drink

                             veronica
               christ doesnt anybody knock

               dark horse huh you make me blush

     veronica reaches the patio gently swinging her croquet mallet
     excited with the thought that jd has come to change his ways

                             veronica
               did you come to tell me something
               something nice remotely apologetic

                       angrily blowing up at her bangs
               just finish your drink and get out

     shouts can be heard booming around her

     as she places the cup down beside her it is revealed martha
     is completely alone in the gym the others being sad workings
     of her embattled imagination

     she lifts the cup back up to her mouth but the plastic lid
     pops off and a gush of coke splashes onto her bigfun tshirt

               causing them to open their petals and
               reveal their hopes and fears by a
               stroke of luck tv cameras were
               fortunate enough to happen to be on

               think its all just doubles tennis
               adults can be horrible to other adults
               when teenagers complain that they
               want to be treated like human beings
               its usually because theyarebeing

     students sitting in foldout chairs before him father ripper

               vivacious young lady we all knew her
               to be but her soul was in antartica
               freezing with the knowledge of the way
               fellow teenagers can be cruel the way
               parents can be unresponsive and as she
               writes so eloquently in her suicide note
               the way life can suck well all miss

               shes rubbing noses with jesus

     a group of cheerleaders including heather mcnamara are lazily
     doing cartwheels on the gym floor on a small stage set up

     veronica cautiously treads down the empty hallway trying to
     keep in control suddenly packs of students burst from
     classroom doors behind veronica the excited swarms of students
     move toward and past veronica who has braked her troubled
     treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers  she latches
     onto geek rodney in a panic rodney looks down at his clutched
     arm with a nervous smile

     veronica ignores rodneys amiable attemots at conversation to
     inquisitively move forward through the crowd

     int the gymday

     jd darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors
     he pops the doors open and sees the crowd of students move
     toward the gym he suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set
     of stairs

     int the hallway leading to the gymday

     veronica continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of students
     heading for the gymnasium she stops to watch her classmates
     file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread
     she again latches onto a passing rodney

                             veronica
               rodney whats underneath the gym

     couple disgruntled students before careening down the staircase
     beside the gym

     int hallway outside the boiler roomday

     jd walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room eyeing
     the pounding generators inside he stops at a heavy steel door
     placing down his gym bag jd proceeds to swiftly pick the
     lock he swings open the steel door

                             veronica os

     jd suddenly kicks out into veronicas stomach doubling her
     over and causing her to drop the gun jd gracefully retrieves
     it

     int the gymday

     the pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy students in the
     bleachers earthily shouting giggling cheerleaders making
     swaying pyramids valiant band members struggling to be heard
     various jocks stand on the stage with principal gowan as a
     yearbook photographer flashes away

     int the hallway before the boiler roomday

     veronica bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs
     jd raises the gun to her head

                             jd
               live by the sword

     veronica swings her left arm up knocking jds gun hand
     upward she then sails her right fist into his face the blow
     annoys him more than it hurts him but jds momentary loss of
     composure allows veronica to come in with another much harder
     right hook the blow sends jd stumbling back against the
     boiler room jarring the gun loose

     they simultaneously lunge for the gun veronica having the
     better grip pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun
     from jd she loses control of it flinging it down the hall
     veronica pops up to retrieve it but jd moves his legs
     scissorsstyle around her and trips her

               this thing you can end it

     her and throws her against the steel boiler room door

     a jostled veronica raises the gun jd howls then bounds
     toward veronica causing them both to careen down the steel
     steps of the boiler room at the same time he inadvertently
     kicks the gym bagbomb down along with them the gun spins from
     veronicas hand and slides away the bomb flies out of the bag
     onto the boiler room floor a digital clock on the bomb clicks

     veronica fires the gun at jds feet the bomb clicks to 149
     she focuses her eyes on three red buttons on the bomb

     jd snatches up his switchblade and lunges toward veronica
     she springs away causing him to bring the knife down past her
     and onto the middle red button stopping the clock on the bomb
     at 0017

                             veronica
               cool guys like you out of my life

     veronica fires the gun twice into jds stomach coughing and
     moaning he splatters against a generator

                             veronica
               but dont worry these here
               were ich luge bullets

     jd closes his eyes and slumps to the ground veronica wearily
     regards the image of the knife stuck in the stopped bomb

     veronica wearily pushes open the front door and emerges outside
     of the school she closes her eyes to therapeutically bask in
     the suns rays a slight smile trembles onto her face a
     strange voice kills it

     puts it in her mouth she then folds her arms

     to 000 nothing happens an annoyed jd breaks out of his
     crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm

     int gymthe pep assemblyday

     the sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering upanddown
     pep assembly into chaos wailing students pour out of the bleachers
     screaming less out of fear than a whoa dude sense of excitement

     ext the front of the schoolday

     veronica stands in the same position in front of the school
     with her arms still folded only now her cigarette is lit and
     her face and clothes are blackened in ash flames flicker in
     bushes behind her veronica drags on the cigarette and turns
     to go inside

     students some of whom are tearing down prom banners for the
     thrill of it heather duke rushes up to veronica and grimaces

     veronica tosses away the cigarette she then grabs heather duke
     by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around

     veronica takes off heather dukes red ribbon and ties it around
     the hair of her own head she kisses heather duke on the cheek
     leaving a black stain veronica calls off
