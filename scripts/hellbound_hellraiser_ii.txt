hellbound hellraiser ii

                                      screenplay by

                                       peter atkins

                                   based on a story by

                                       clive barker

                                       second draft

                                     november 1 1987

                

               fade in

               titles

               the screen is composed of large straightedge areas of black 
               and white that rest against each other in a manner that 
               suggests some kind of pattern without making a final sense 
               it is as if we are too close to something that could we see 
               it from a distance would be clear to us

               these areas shift and change  both their own shape and 
               their relationship to their neighbors new patterns are being 
               made new solutions found  but they are just beyond our 
               comprehension the effect should be aesthetically pleasing 
               but simultaneously frustrating and perhaps a little 
               unsettling

               shortly into this sequence and subsequently intercut 
               throughout we begin to see in flashback the story of 
               hellraiser arriving first as very short shockimages these 
               brief sections eventually convey to the audience all the 
               necessary emotional and narrative information they will need 
               to understand the background to hellbound

               meanwhile the black and white shapes are still moving the 
               unseen patterns still shifting

               over this constantly mobile background the titles begin to 
               appear

               as the titles unroll another change comes over the puzzle 
               pieces behind them where before they moved and related only 
               in two dimensions gradually we see that they are now claiming 
               depth as well the puzzle we are looking at is now a three
               dimensional one the pieces are now solid blocks of various 
               geometric shapes locking together moving apart finding 
               their final position

               finally as the titles come to their conclusion the camera 
               pulls back until we can see clearly what we have been looking 
               at as the final piece clicks into positions we see it is 
               the lament configuration from hellraiser

               the closed box rests before our eyes a moment and then the 
               circle in the centre of the side that faces us gives way to 
               an image of a dusty street with a market simultaneous to 
               this the camera tracks into this image until it fills the 
               screen

               ext a street bazaar  day

               the track continues up through the market and then turns 
               through the stalls to find a store behind them as we track 
               through the stores doorway we pass through a beaded curtain 
               that momentarily reminds us of the torture room in hellraiser

               int store  day

               once we are in the store itself though this impression 
               disappears it is an ordinary slightly seedy junk shop

               the stall seems to sell an odd mixture of items native 
               trinkets share space with secondhand items from european 
               colonists these secondhand goods give us some sense of 
               period they suggest the late twentiesearly thirties 
               this is reinforced by the sounds coming from one of them an 
               oldfashioned mahoganycased wireless a foreign voice speaks 
               from it in a language we dont understand though perhaps 
               the words bbc world service are discerned in the middle 
               and then a dancehall tune of the period begins to play 
               depending on availability it would be nice to have something 
               relevant  ill follow my secret heart perhaps or dancing 
               in the dark

               into shot comes an english officer his uniform too suggests 
               the twenties the last days of empire he is tall thin 
               and darkhaired but at no stage do we see his face clearly 
               he stands in front of the stall

               the trader suddenly stands behind the counter he has been 
               crouched beneath it as if checking or preparing something 
               he is a big impressivelooking black man his face is totally 
               impassive as he stares at his customer

               neither of the men speak obviously a deal has already been 
               struck and today is the payoff

               the officer a little arrogantly  suggesting racist 
               contempt slaps down a bag of gold on the stalls counter

               keeping his eyes firmly on the officer he reaches beneath 
               him and brings something up from under the counter and places 
               it in the officers outstretched hand he is holding a lament 
               configuration

               the officer turns and leaves the camera tracks out of the 
               store looking at the trader as he watches the departing 
               officer

               int the officers quansett hut  day

               it is typical of temporary military quarters complete with 
               a curved ceiling of corrugated material it is stripped of 
               furniture the blinds are down

               the officer still in uniform sits crosslegged the box 
               held before him

               he is already well into the solving process and very soon 
               after the shot begins the box begins to speed its own 
               solution

               finally two sections of the box shoot upwards and begin to 
               peel apart from each other ready to reveal its secret

               the officer suddenly nervous drops the box and scuttles 
               back across the floor to stare at it the box lands upright 
               its extended parts still open above it for a beat of two 
               nothing happens we become aware of the officers pulse 
               throbbing excitedly on the soundtrack

               int the officers quansett hut  day

               officers pov 

               lowly we the camera and the officer move towards the still 
               silent but menacing box

               we approach it until finally we are above it looking down 
               into the opening it has made in itself there is undefined 
               movement inside

               suddenly something flies up directly at us we glimpse it 
               only briefly but enough to see its nature unlike the hooks 
               that flew at frank in hellraiser this is more organic than 
               metallic

               pink and fleshlike but on a long grayblue stalk it flies 
               upward its lips peeling apart gapingly to reveal scores of 
               yellow discoloured and viciously sharp teethlike hooks

               the officer screams and the screen begins to take on a red 
               tint so that just as the thing is about to fill the screen 
               with its hungry mouth the entire screen turns red

               the red screen is held for a second and then suddenly becomes 
               complete blackness

               int black space

               the black screen continues and rising slowly from it and 
               falling back slowly into it in a dreamlike surrealistic 
               manner come various images of the officers tormentpleasure 
               in hell

               by various camera tricks such as stepprinting or optical 
               blurring his face is still not clearly seen but is seen 
               enough for us to see his sensual almost orgasmic responses 
               to what is being done to him

               cuts appear spontaneously across his face leaving a grid 
               like crisscross pattern of wounds

               finally a disembodied hand gripping a hammer drives nails 
               into each corner formed by these wounds and as the face 
               comes into full view for the first time we realize who this 
               is it is pinhead from hellraiser

               pinheads completed face floats on the blackness and stares 
               out at us

                                     pinhead
                              echoed  slow
                         kirsty come to daddy

               the tiny silence following pinheads words is shattered by a 
               piercing and terrified scream

               int hospital room  night

               the scream continues but the blackness is replaced by 
               kirstys anguished face it is she who is screaming the 
               scream subsides replaced by breathless panting accompanied 
               by rapid eye movement

                                     ronson
                              off camera
                         ah youre awake good

               we pull out to see that kirsty is sitting up fully dressed 
               on a hospital bed ronson a police detective sits on a 
               plain wooden chair which is the only other piece of furniture 
               in the room

               the walls are bare save for a piece of primitive art on one 
               wall and on another a circular barred window looking out

               ronson stands up and walks to the foot of the bed he rests 
               his hand on the beds metal frame and smiles a perfunctory 
               smile

                                     ronson
                         tell you what  well make a deal 
                         ill tell you what i know then you 
                         tell me what you know ok

               kirsty is still reorienting herself she blinks a few times 
               and then focuses on ronsons hands gripping the bed

                                     ronson
                         ok

               kirsty looks up at ronsons face and then around at the room

                                     kirsty
                         where am i

                         oh excuse me

               ronson reaches in his jacket and flashes an id

                         mess

               kirstys eyes prick with tears she looks away from ronson

                                     kirsty
                              to herself

               int junk room lodovico street  night

               cortez a police officer shifts some unpacked crates to 
               allow a closer look at the shriveled and deformed corpse of 
               one of frank and julias victims

                                     cortez
                         jesus

               cortez prods at the corpse with his nightstick attempting 
               to turn it over a stream of maggots pours from the mouth 
               and the cavity that used to be its throat

               cortez jumps back in disgust and knocks against one of the 
               several wardrobes in the cluttered room another corpse flies 
               out at him as decayed and flyblown as the first

               cortez draws his gun and empties it blowing the corpses 
               head off scattering flesh mucus and bone  but no blood  
               everywhere before realizing it is already dead

               he realises what he has done and lowers his weapon sheepishly

                                     cortez
                         oh shit

               int hospital room  day

               ronson is sitting back in the chair looking at the now 
               slightly calmer kirsty

                                     ronson
                         we got two missing people and a house 
                         full of corpses

               he holds out his hand towards kirsty in a theatrical manner

                                     ronson
                         talk to me

               kirsty swings her legs off the bad but remains sitting on 
               it her feet on the floor she doesnt look directly at ronson 
               but begins to take in the few details of the room for the 
               first time

                                     kirsty
                         i thought steve had talked to you

                                     ronson
                         oh pardon me i obviously didnt 
                         convey my hesitation to take his 
                         story at facevalue no you talk to 
                         me but  do me a favor  none of 
                         this demons crap

               kirsty closes her eyes almost wincing as memory comes

               kirsty opens her eyes consciously she slows the rhythm of 
               the dialogue down

                                     kirsty
                         he talked about demons huh

                                     ronson
                         yeah

               kirsty turns her head to look directly at ronson

                                     kirsty
                         its true all of it its all true

               ronson stares at her impressed by her conviction and 
               intensity

               there is a second of shared silence

               suddenly a shocking electronic crackle shatters the mood 
               ronson starts then realises it is the radio at his belt he 
               snatches it up and speaks into it

                                     ronson
                         ronson

               int bedroom  lodovico street  night

               another officer kucich is standing radio in hand by the 
               bloodstained mattress cortez stands beside him gun now 
               safely reholstered

                                     kucich
                         kucich here sir we just found 
                         another one though it suffered a 
                         little

               kucich looks at cortez who looks embarrassed

                                     kucich
                         er accidental damage in discovery

                         looks like someone was messed up

               ronson throws kirsty a look of exasperation with his 
               colleague

               the camera stays on kirstys face as ronson speaks

                                     ronson
                         what the hell are you asking me for

               without waiting for a reply ronson switches the radio off 
               and clips it back to his belt

               int bedroom  55 street  night

               we are looking at the mattress kucich has left the room

               cortez draws a pad from his packet the pad is stapled and 
               the staple has been badly inserted and is not closed property

               in the act of tearing a label from the pad cortez catches 
               his thumb on the staple

                                     officer
                         shit

               the label is adhesivebacked cortez licks it and presses it 
               on the mattress he writes on it  55le1 as he stands up 
               from doing this a single drop of blood from his thumb lands 
               on the mattress it is important that we see it is only a 
               single drop  and nothing like the amount larry spilled on 
               the floorboards

               cortez leaves the room to fetch a colleague to help him move 
               the mattress we move in to see the drop of blood disappear 
               very quickly into the mattress as if it is being sucked in

               as this happens we hear on the soundtrack the faintest 
               rumble

               int operating room  night

               a somewhat antiquated and frightening operating room filled 
               with machines monitors and surgical instruments the corners 
               of the room fall away to shadow

               sitting upright in the centre of the room is a female patient  
               she is awake and staring out at the camera twin probesclamps 
               are in each of her ears to hold her in place her head is 
               shaved and the skin on the back of her head has been cut 
               open and peeled apart the flaps of the skin are held away 
               from the area being worked on by four clamps we never 
               actually see round to the exposed brain itself

               immediately behind her and probing with professional skill 
               and coolness into her exposed brain is doctor malahide he 
               is in his late forties and looks like all the great doctors 
               look  rational civilized competent and powerful there 
               is an intensity in his eyes and the lines of his face though 
               that suggests something more than normal

               the room has several attentive listeners and observers but 
               the one nearest to malahide is his personal studentassistant 
               kyle macrae young conventionally goodlooking with an 
               open friendly face

               malahide is holding forth on the secrets of his trade several 
               times looking away from his patient while still working on 
               her to make sure his audience understand his points

                                     malahide
                         we can bring them back properly more 
                         often than scientific orthodoxy 
                         dictates ladies and gentlemen and 
                         the knife far from the enemy of of 
                         analysis is often its greatest ally 
                         in solving the puzzles of psychosis 
                         analysis isolates and massages 
                         surgery pinpoints and corrects 
                         though youve got to know what youre 
                         doing of course

               polite laughter from several students

                                     malahide
                         some things are obvious here for 
                         example

               he prods in at a specific area

                                     malahide
                         are the optical motor nerve control 
                         centers

               the patient begins to blink in time with malahides prodding  
               the affect is halfcomical halfdistressing perhaps malahide 
               carries it on just that halfsecond too long for innocent 
               demonstration but the students give impressed murmurs anyway

                                     malahide
                         now this case a deeplyburied 
                         psychosis severe enough to produce 
                         frighteningly frequent hysteria and 
                         aggression incurable say others 
                         not so analysis isolates the knife 
                         exposes medication controls

               as he speaks malahide injects a syringe directly into the 
               patients brain her face spasms momentarily

               malahide stands back slightly his face is serene calm and 
               confident

               he takes a small motorised drill and sets to work on the 
               brain

                                     malahide
                         and then ladies and gentlemen we 
                         rebuild with all the care and 
                         knowledge that our years of training 
                         have given us

               he looks around at them all smiling slightly

                                     malahide
                         we bring them back

               the students murmur their approval perhaps they even applaud

               malahide acknowledges their reaction with a modest nod

               suddenly an intercom on the wall cuts in

                                     intercom
                         dr malahide the new arrival is 
                         awake and appears very distressed

               malahide steps back briskly and begins to peel his cloves 
               off

               he nods at a nearby student

                                     malahide
                         my part in this is over you may 
                         tidy up for me kyle you come with 
                         me

               malahide and kyle leave the room

               int hospital room  night

               kirsty has her hands over her face and is shaking ronson 
               stands and crosses to her he takes her hand from her face 
               and calms her

                                     ronson
                         easy easy whatever happened 
                         whatever you saw its not here now

                                     kirsty
                         i saw it him but i got away and 
                         i took the box and i solved it and 
                         they came

                                     ronson
                         who

                                     kirsty
                         the cenobites

               she stares directly at ronson daring him to disbelieve

                                     kirsty
                         the demons

               ronson stares back perhaps a glimmer of belief in his eyes

               on the soundtrack the sudden and shocking sound of a door 
               being slammed open and hitting the wall

               kirsty screams even ronson is startled

               in the doorway are doctor malahide and kyle malahide advances 
               into the room smiling apologetically as he does so

                                     malahide
                         sorry must get that door fixed 
                         detective ronson

               malahide holds his hand out as ronson nods in response

                                     malahide
                         i am doctor malahide

               the man shake hands malahide gestures behind him

                                     malahide
                         my assistant kyle macrae and this 
                         must be kirsty

               malahide speaks quickly as if to get the formalities out of 
               the way as he says her name he smiles benignly at kirsty 
               who still distraught from her memories and shocked at the 
               slamming of the door simply stares at him

               malahide turns his attention back to ronson drawing him 
               away and speaking to him in a lower voice

               meanwhile kyle walks over to kirsty and smiles at her  
               long enough to embarrass her into smiling back

                                     malahide
                         ive read the boys statement quite 
                         the adventure they believe they had 
                         id like to talk to her alone do 
                         you think

               ronson looks over his shoulder at kirsty he then looks 
               carefully at malahide and then nods slowly

                                     ronson
                         mmmm ok frankly i think shes 
                         more your territory than mine shame

               ronson looks back at kirsty

                                     ronson
                         kirsty doctor malahides going to 
                         look after you now maybe we could 
                         talk some more tomorrow

               kirsty nods vaguely and then just as ronson reaches the 
               door calls out to him

                                     kirsty
                         wait the mattress youve got to 
                         destroy it she died on it you see 
                         the mattress its haunted now she 
                         can come back like frank she can 
                         come back

               ronson smiles helplessly at her then glances at malahide 
               with a you see what i mean expression and leaves the room

                                     kirsty
                         the mattress

               malahide stares at her briefly with a strange expression on 
               his face and then abruptly follows ronson through the door

               kirsty is too absorbed to notice this odd behavior but kyle 
               stares incredulously as malahide leaves the room

                                     kyle
                         uh excuse me a moment

               he follows to the door and stands in the doorway looking 
               down the corridor

               int hospital corridor  night

               ronson stands before a set of doubledoors talking to a 
               uniformed officer

               malahide comes into view walking swiftly and instantly 
               talks over their conversation

                                     malahide
                         detective ill be able to help this 
                         girl but i need your assistance

               int hospital corridor  night

               looking back at the corridor we see the door to kirstys 
               room ajar and kyle standing by it looking down

               int hospital corridor  night kyles pov

               a long shot of malahide and ronson kyle and we are too 
               far away to hear what is said but malahide in nodding and 
               gesturing emphatically as if persuading ronson of something

               int hospital room  night

               kyle returns into the room and closes the door his expression 
               is puzzled troubled then he remembers there is a patient 
               here and he smiles

                                     kyle
                         so youre kirsty huh

                                     kirsty
                         you a doctor too

               kyle smiles again

                                     kyle
                         nearly a doctor im kyle macrae 
                         call me kyle

               kirsty draws a deep breath temporarily calmed she even 
               manages a smile

                                     kirsty
                         hi kyle

               malahide reenters the room

                                     malahide
                         now kirsty

               kirsty looks at him warily

                                     kirsty
                         the cop he didnt believe me

                                     malahide
                         i suspect not but that doesnt 
                         necessarily mean youre wrong does 
                         it

                                     kirsty
                         do you believe me

               malahide offers a reassuring laugh

                                     malahide
                         well i dont know yet however 
                         youre not lying you believe this 
                         is the truth

                                     kirsty
                         it is the truth

               suddenly the door opens again an intern is standing there 
               for the briefest of moments malahide looks furious and then 
               catching himself assumes his calm demeanor

                                     malahide
                         well

                                     intern
                         sorry dr malahide but its tiffany 
                         shes escaped again

               malahide sighs

                                     malahide
                         very well

               he looks down at kirsty

                                     kirsty
                         im sorry kirsty kyle will come 
                         back with something to help you sleep 
                         we shall speak tomorrow

               malahide and kyle follow the intern from the room kyle giving 
               a last friendly smile as the door closes behind them

               ext carnival  night

               we are staring down the midway of a deserted carnival on 
               either side stalls and rides beckon to pleasures that their 
               locked doors and tarpaulindraped entrances deny a light 
               rain is falling

               a huge wooden cutout of a grinning clown dominates one stall 
               while the sign beneath him seems to state the ethos of the 
               whole place lots o fun

               another has a banner proclaiming freak show with the 
               subheading youll gasp at the geek

               on the horizon in the distance almost denying the reality 
               of what we are seeing tower vast cranes of unimaginable 
               height while beyond them impossibly huge oildrums squat 
               against the moonbright but cloudy sky

               into shot and running down the midway comes a girl tiffany

               tiffany is a girl in her early teens but looks younger then 
               her years due to her boyish figure and her slightly over 
               delicate features

               for the last months tiffany has been finding ways out of 
               the institute and making her way here where she has one 
               special obsession which we will soon see

               following her into shot but many yards behind come two 
               interns from the institute they contrast each other almost 
               comically one being tall and plump while the other is smaller 
               and thinner theyre not quite the stan and ollie of the 
               medical world but with some serious rehearsal they could get 
               there

                                     1st intern
                         oh jesus  shes gonna make it

               even as the first intern says this we see tiffany make a 
               sharp left turn into a stall entrance

               ext hall of mirrors  entrance  night

               a front view of the stall into which tiffany has run the 
               large sign above it proclaims hall of mirrors and a smaller 
               sign perched above a distorting mirror to one side of the 
               entrance says youll be amazed

               the two interns enter at a run

               int hall of mirrors  night

               there follows a hopelessly onesided pursuit through the 
               mirror maze as tiffany effortlessly eludes the two interns

               there are three major facets to this sequence 1 comic relief  
               as the two interns make fools of themselves

               there could even be a room of distorting mirrors where the 
               thin intern becomes fat and the fat one thin

               2 tiffanys ease and expertise with patterns and puzzles

               3 confusion of the audiences sense of the real and the 
               unreal

               this goes on long enough for us to realise the 1st intern 
               was right to worry how long tiffany could elude them then 
               jarringly as the screen is full of reflected tiffanys there 
               suddenly appears amongst them a single image of malahide

               everything stops

               the image of malahide and we shouldnt he sure yet if were 
               looking at a reflection or the real man puts its hands out 
               palms up

                                     malahide
                         tiffany come

               all the tiffanys move quietly toward him until they all 
               disappear from view then the real tiffany comes into shot 
               her back to us and walks toward what we now see to be the 
               real malahide who is standing in a doorway deliberately 
               framed like a mirror to confuse the customers

               tiffany places her hands docilely on to malahides 
               outstretched ones

               int hospital room  night

               kirsty has been dozing fitfully but is awakened by strange 
               noises at first terrified she slowly realises it is simply 
               someone being put in the room next door

               she waits until activity has ceased and then moves to her 
               door

               it is unlocked she moves out into the corridor

               int hospital corridor  night

               looking warily from side to side kirsty edges out into the 
               corridor along it and then stops by the door of the 
               adjoining room

               int tiffanys room  night  cu

               a hand fits a piece of jigsaw puzzle into the space it 
               belongs

               we know it is a jigsaw by the shape of the pieces but it 
               is clearly not the conventional type  a picturesque photo  
               because all we can see at this closeup angle are large areas 
               of black and white

               int tiffanys room  night

               we now see that the puzzle is on the floor of a room of a 
               similar size to kirstys it is slightly more decorated it 
               has curtains and wallpaper and a tiled floor sitting cross
               legged on the floor next to the puzzle is tiffany

               the puzzle which we can now see more clearly is an intricate 
               abstract design in black and white there are several pieces 
               still unfitted but tiffany is working steadily efficiently 
               and with complete concentration

               on a wall behind her there is a visual record of her progress 
               over the last few months sealed in plastic by staff members 
               are puzzles she has solved with dates marking her 
               advancement they begin with the simplest wood block animals 
               usually given to very small children passing through photo
               puzzles of increasing difficulty and culminating in one or 
               two other examples of the kind of complicated patternwork 
               she is involved in now

               int hospital corridor  night

               we pull out to see that this is kirstys pov from the 
               glass panel in the door of tiffanys room

               tiffany looks up at one point and eyecontact is made kirsty 
               gives a tentative smile and a small wave tiffany stares at 
               her

               the stare is long but unresponsive and finally tiffany returns 
               to the puzzle

               kirsty has her back to us and the camera is quite close in 
               when a hand suddenly moves into shot and touches her shoulder

               kirsty jumps back in alarm fear on her face but it is only 
               kyle

               kyle raises his hand in apology

                                     kyle
                         oh jesus im sorry god if anyone 
                         should know not to do that its me 
                         im sorry ok

               kirsty nods and gives a nervous smile kyle still embarrassed 
               by his foolishness and eager to change the subject nods 
               towards the glass panel

                                     kyle
                         sad huh shes been here six months 
                         her names tiffany

                                     kirsty
                         whats the matter with her

                                     kyle
                         almost complete withdrawal she hasnt 
                         said a word for nearly two years

                                     kirsty
                         god thats terrible

                                     kyle
                         yeah doctor malahides got her doing 
                         these jigsaws and things though 
                         says its helping to bring her out

               kyle ushers kirsty back into her own room

               int hospital room  day

               as he closes the door to kirstys room kyle reaches into 
               the pocket of his labcoat and produces a small box of pills

                                     kyle
                         anyway lets concentrate on you for 
                         a moment wanna suck on this for me

               kirsty looks up at him sharply he is proffering a pill and 
               grinning facetiously

                                     kirsty
                         hey good joke kyle do you always 
                         come on to the mentally ill

               kyles face falls he blushes pressing the pills into 
               kirstys hand he backs off to the door apologising

                                     kyle
                         shit sorry heres the pills red 
                         face door bye

               he exits hurriedly closing the door behind him kirsty grins 
               despite herself she looks at the pill for a second or two 
               and then puts it firmly back in the box realising there is 
               no bedside table she puts the box on the wooden chair

                                     kirsty
                         jesus im glad im not paying for 
                         this place

               she is about to lie down on the bed when she senses something 
               is wrong in the room

               kirsty is instantly tense again she swings her head to the 
               side and tenses in horror stifling a scream

               in the corner of the room against the wall lying in a pool 
               of blood is her skinned father larry

               kirsty emits a pained moan of pure anguish as she realises 
               what she is looking at

                                     kirsty
                              under her breath
                         daddy

               the thing in the corner raises its arm weakly from its side 
               and begins to write on the wall in its own blood

               it writes i am in hell help me

               kirsty covers her eyes with her hands and begins to sob

               kirsty takes her hands from her eyes

               the figure has gone the pool of blood has disappeared but 
               on the wall the words remain

               kirsty makes herself rise from the bed and walk slowly across 
               the room

               her eyes full of tears she stretches out her arm and touches 
               the word i

               as her fingers make contact the words instantly disappear

               she presses her bloodied finger quickly to her lips before 
               that last trace of her father can vanish too

               int tiffanys room  night

               tiffany is still sitting up crosslegged weeping her puzzle 
               is completed

               ext the institute  day

               basically an establishing shot to show it is the next morning 
               but it also serves to show malahide walking briskly to work 
               his suit is tasteful and simple but discreetly expensive
               looking he walks with purpose and looks straight ahead 
               acknowledging only with polite nods the respectful greetings 
               of various junior doctors and nurses he passes on his way 
               he enters the institute

               we should also see several patients being walked or wheeled 
               around by staff during this shot

                                     malahide os
                         and how are we feeling today

               int large ward  day

               this is a large traditional hospital ward with a line of 
               beds down each long wall and a wide central aisle

               nearly all of the beds are occupied and at the far end of 
               the ward there is a male patient in a wheelchair

               all the patients eyes turn immediately and happily to 
               malahide as he crosses the room continuing his speech

                                     malahide
                         better good

               he doesnt stop his progress but walks straight through the 
               room and into the corridor

               as the door closes behind him the wheelchair patient scowls

                                     wchair patient
                         105 years and he still doesnt know 
                         my name

               int hospital corridor  day

               malahide walks swiftly down the corridor in which we saw him 
               talk to ronson earlier but this time the camera follows him 
               through the double doors and further down the corridor

               he enters an elevator and the doors close in front of him

               int basement corridor  day

               malahide exits the elevator into a lower corridor one not 
               so carefully decorated

               we are in the area in which the more deeply disturbed of the 
               institutes patients live

               the rooms are smaller closer together and there is an 
               observation panel set in each door

               malahide looks into the first four rooms

               in the first a middleaged overweight woman sits completely 
               motionless in the middle of the floor she is dressed in a 
               shapeless white robe and is sitting crosslegged her head is 
               shaven her eyes are rolled completely up into the sockets 
               so that only white shows

               in the second a very thin man of about thirty is pressed as 
               tight as he can be into one corner of the room his hair is 
               long and he has a full beard he is naked but not unadorned  
               his body and much of his cell wall is smeared in excrement

               in the third a man of about malahides agestands in the 
               centre of the room he is of normal build but his head is 
               shaved his face scalp and hands are covered in self
               inflicted and amaterurish tattoos  all of crosses he is 
               dressed in tshirt and jeans with both hands he holds aloft 
               a silver crucifix pointing it in all directions as if under 
               constant siege by devils he mutters prayers and invocations 
               constantly

               in the fourth a man in his early twenties restrained in a 
               straitjacket he shuffles around on the callfloor his 
               eyes twitching and flitting from one part of his body to 
               another

                                     browning
                              muttering
                         get them off me get them off me

               offcamera we hear the sound of kirstys sobbing  which 
               bridges the cut to

               int hospital room  day

               kyle enters having heard kirsty crying she is sitting with 
               her legs over the side of the bed with her face in her hands

               kyle immediately sits next to her and puts an arm around her 
               shoulder he doesnt force her to speak he lets her let the 
               tears out finally she looks up

                                     kirsty
                         i i had a visitor

                                     kyle
                         what

                                     kirsty
                         oh jesus i cant explain its 
                         its i dont know how to help i 
                         have to save him and i dont know 
                         how to help

                                     kyle
                              carefully
                         kirsty im sorry dont understand 
                         i

                                     kirsty
                         i know noone can but i have to 
                         save him wheres the other doctor 
                         he said hed listen he promised

               kyle responds quickly to this his faith in malahide is 
               strong despite that curious incident of the previous night 
               when malahide followed ronson out of the room

                                     kyle
                         dr malahide yes look ill fetch 
                         him you take it easy  im sure he 
                         can help

               kyle stands up making soothing motions with his hands and 
               heads for the door

                                     kirsty
                         help no noone can help i just 
                         want someone to listen or i will go 
                         crazy

                                     kyle
                         if anyone can help he can

               kirsty turns and gives kyle a strange look as he opens the 
               door

                                     kirsty
                         yeah he got a ticket to hell

               int hospital corridor  day

               we track with kyle down the corridor eventually reaching an 
               impressive door which is slightly ajar even before we reach 
               it we hear malahides voice he is clearly on the phone 
               because of the nature of what he is hearing kyle pauses 
               when he reaches the door listening with a confused expression 
               on his face

                                     malahide os
                              gradually fading up
                         officer kucich yes doctor malahide

                         the house not the hospital yes 
                         fine and thank you

               we hear the phone click kyle waits a moment and then walks 
               swiftly through the door speaking as he does so

               kirstys face fills the screen her voice is slightly dreamy 
               as if she is still trying to understand herself the story 
               she is about to tell

                                     kirsty
                         it must have been going on forever

               her voice trails off we pull out to see kirsty sitting up 
               on her bed malahide on the wooden chair and kyle standing 
               by the door

               malahides voice pulls her back

                         kirsty

               kirsty snaps back and continues to speak in a more normal 
               voice

                                     kirsty

                         then let us speak of it

               we track in slowly towards a modern house that we will learn 
               is malahides up the drive towards the front door

                                                               dissolve to

               int malahides hallway  twilight

               the track continues along the hallway and into the obsession 
               room

               int obsession room  night

               the track continues

               the room is dim lit only by stray shafts of moonlight

               on the floor in the centre of the room is the mattress

               the track stops a main light is clicked on and malahide 
               moves into shot malahide pours himself a scotch from the 
               decanter that sits on the writing table and approaches the 
               mattress

               he is clearly very excited he walks around the mattress 
               two or three times never taking his eyes off it

               he walks back to the writing table throws his drink back 
               puts the glass down and leaves the room

               ext malahides house  night

               malahide leaves through his front door and walks toward the 
               hospital

               int obsession room  night

               after a few seconds silence we hear a repeated clicking sound 
               as if something is being forced followed by a louder snap 
               and the sound of a sash window being opened

               the curtains balloon inwards part and kyle steps into the 
               room

               he stands still for a moment as if making sure he is alone 
               and then begins to take in his surroundings

               the room is entirely devoted to malahides secret obsession  
               with the paranormal in general and the lament configuration 
               in particular

               it is a fairsized square shaped room prints paintings 
               and photographs cover the walls all of these pictures relate 
               in some way to his obsession photographs of ghostsightings 
               portraits of magicians from cagliostro to crowley prints of 
               arcane symbols and pentagrams etc

               specifically we recognize a print that resembles very closely 
               the jigsaw he has had tiffany recently solve also there 
               are framed diagrams which look very old of the lament 
               configuration  both open and closed

               on a long low table there are three glass cases in each of 
               these cases is a lament configuration on each case is a 
               small label giving a location a date of acquisition and a 
               number  which we may assume to be the number of deaths 
               attributable to that specific box

               these labels read     cairo 3459 7 
                                      lyons 6272 4

               there are also on a small desktop bookshelf on a writing 
               table editions of malahides own books he seems to have 
               spent his career publicly denying what he is privately 
               obsessed with  because the books titles include possession 
               not demons but disease the myth of the diabolic and 
               the internal inferno

                                     kyle
                         jesus christ jeesuskerrist

               we assume he has visited malahides house before but he has 
               clearly never seen this room

               he stares at the mattress with incredulity as if he still 
               cant believe his superior has had it brought here then he 
               begins to look around the room in more detail he approaches 
               the glass cases and bends slightly to look at their contents

               kyle shakes his head

                                     kyle
                         oh shit

               int basement corridor  night

               malahide walks past a bank of meters and huge circuit breakers 
               on his way to the lower and of the corridor by the cells of 
               the very disturbed he stops by the cell of the man in the 
               straitjacket we hear from the outside the familiar muttering 
               of browning malahide enters the call

               int brownings cell  night

               as malahide enters browning looks at him his eyes demand 
               not plead and he speaks through clenched teeth

                                     browning
                         get them off me get them off me

               int obsession room  night

               kyle is rooting through the drawers in the writing table

               generally the contents are unremarkable  handwritten notes 
               a few patients casefiles etc  but in one of the drawers 
               he finds a black ringbinder which he takes out and lays on 
               the table

               it is a book of faces there are about fifteen sheets in the 
               binder some of them are genuine photographic prints some 
               photocopies of original photos they range widely in age 
               race and sex they are all fullface portraits 
               chronologically the range is extensive too some pictures 
               generally photocopies appear to date from the earliest 
               days of photography the late 1880s others have an edwardian 
               appearance or suggest the 1920s only one or two seem to 
               be less than thirty years old

               kyle flicks back and forward in the book wondering on the 
               significance of these people

               he is lost in the musings when the click of the front door 
               tells him malahide has returned

               kyle closes the book and quickly slips it back into the 
               drawer

               he heads rapidly for the window he came in through but 
               realises malahide is too close for him to open it and make 
               good his escape instead he stands between the window and 
               the curtains pulling the latter closed over him

               malahide enters the room leading browning who is still strait 
               jacketed

               int behind the curtain  night

               we see kyle standing very still in the limited space behind 
               the curtains it is clearly seen that given the thoroughness 
               with which he closed the curtains and his immobile position 
               he is unable to see what is happening in the room he can 
               hear but not see

               int obsession room  night

               malahide leads browning across to the mattress standing 
               beside it he unbuckles and removes the straitjacket from 
               his patient

               browning beneath the straitjacket is naked to the waist 
               his arms and cheat are a mass of scars of various age and 
               size

               malahide gestures to the mattress now that his arms are 
               free browning is scratching furiously

                                     malahide
                         mr browning please lie down

               browning lies down still scratching trust and hope in his 
               eyes

               int obsession room  brownings delusion brownings 
               pov

               as if looking through brownings eyes we see his body 
               stretched out before us on the mattress

               the naked chest and arms are covered with raised lumps red 
               and painfullooking

               as his scratching arms attack these lumps they break open 
               revealing vile black insects that have hatched beneath his 
               skin browning brushes these away while he scratches at the 
               remaining lumps

               int obsession room  night

               browning has already reopened some of the more recent scars 
               and blood slowly rises to the surface of his skin

               malahide walks over to his writing tableland goes into one 
               of the drawers

               he produces an oldfashioned cutthroat razor and walks back 
               to browning

                                     malahide
                         here this will help

               he proffers the razor browning seizes it malahide steps 
               back quickly a mixture of anticipation and apprehension on 
               his face

               browning slashes at his body and left arm with a short sharp 
               slicing motions in his mind he is lancing the cysts that 
               contain the tormenting insects in reality he is inflicting 
               horrifying damage on himself

               blood pours from the multitude of wounds running over his 
               body and down onto the mattress

               suddenly without any preliminaries two painfully thin 
               flayed mucuscovered arms shoot out of the mattress one on 
               either side of the stillbusy browning

               they wrap themselves tightly across his chest and crush him 
               tightly to the mattress as a head similarly wasted oozes 
               out of the mattress to the side of brownings head

               beneath his delusions browning suddenly has an inkling of 
               what is happening to him his eyes widen and his mouth opens 
               ready to emit a scream but the monster beneath him forces a 
               hand over his mouth as it buries its face into the soft flesh 
               of his neck

               two legs now rise from the oozing slime that the bloodstains 
               on the mattress have become they too wrap themselves around 
               browning so that he is held tight

               finally with titanic effort he gathers enough momentum to 
               roll completely free of the mattress and falls to the floor 
               beside it the thing on his back now is pulling free from 
               the bed of bubbling frothing slime that the mattress now is 
               with a sliding slurping sound

               the monsters face is now deep in the flesh of his throat 
               and even as browning forces himself up first onto one knee 
               and then very unsteadily onto his feet we can see him 
               wasting away  his face losing its fullness and colour his 
               chest sinking in on itself

               the creature which is still wrapped around him and clinging 
               tight is unlike him growing in stature by the second 
               muscles are inflating arteries pumping more vigorously and 
               flesh itself filling out

               its horrific thinness when it first appeared effectively 
               unsexed it but now as its regeneration continues the 
               fullness of its hips the roundness of its thighs and the 
               sacs of fat and muscle that bloom above its ribs confirm its 
               female nature if there was any doubt that this was julia 
               it is now disappearing

               browning is now nearly a walking corpse and it is the strength 
               of his will alone that allows him to take a few faltering 
               steps with julia still enveloping him with the desperate 
               strength with which she clings to him and the way her legs 
               are wrapped around his hips it is like an obscenely perverse 
               parody of sexual passion

               malahide has been watching all this with an incredible mix 
               of emotions playing across his face still human enough to 
               feel both fear and disgust at what is happening he is 
               nevertheless awe struck and exhilarated he has waited all 
               his life for such an irrefutable demonstration of the power 
               and the truth of the supernatural

               similarly the scientist in him is fascinated by the living 
               anatomy lessons that julias regeneration and browning rapid 
               decay offer

               with one last dying effort the nowalmosthusklike browning 
               breaks julias grip and makes a futile step forward as she 
               falls from him he totters towards the curtains

               just as the audience think he will pull them down with him 
               revealing kyle julia grabs his ankle and pulls he falls 
               back to the floor

               int behind the curtains  night

               the loud noise of brownings fall renews kyles resolve to 
               see what is going on carefully he shifts his position so 
               that he can see through a small gap in the curtains

               int kyles pov  night

               kyle may have heard one or two strange and unpleasant noises 
               but browning has not screamed nor julia spoken nothing has 
               prepared him for what he sees  a skinned woman sucking out 
               what life remains from the dried husk of a psychotic man

               int behind the curtains  night

               kyles head jerks back shaking as if hes just had an 
               electric shock his mouth moves but no sound emerges

               his terror simultaneously urging speed and silence kyle 
               gingerly maneuvers himself out of the window

               int obsession room  night

               julia lies back satisfied on the floor she looks up weakly 
               at malahide

                                     julia
                         help me

               her voice is perfect malahide stares at her his fascination 
               intense he crosses the few yards that separate them he 
               looks at her lying beside the hollow shell that was browning 
               her eyes stare back brilliant sparkling alive

                                     julia
                         help me

               malahide realises her temporary vulnerability all the life 
               force she has absorbed from browning has made up her body 
               but it will take some moments for the strength to return to 
               her

               fascinated and sympathetic as he is however he cannot yet 
               quite brine himself to touch this creature instead he moves 
               the mattress nearer to her allowing her to crawl back onto 
               it and lie down again

               malahide stares down at her he attempts a smile but is too 
               nervous to make it convincing he is trembling slightly 
               this contact with the beyond is something he has dreamt of 
               for years but nevertheless the physical reality is 
               overwhelming

               julia treats him to the approximation of a smile she is far 
               from nervous

               she studies herself her figure is fully formed her 
               womanliness undeniable all she is missing is a skin she 
               stretches her arms

               she lifts her legs she writhes on the bed in pleasure like 
               an xray photograph of a calendar girl

               malahide stares at her following the sensual movements of 
               her body he swallows a little embarrassed by his response 
               to the naked display he is privileged to watch

               julias eyes twinkle at him

                                     julia
                         dont be embarrassed youre my 
                         friend

               she looks away and continues her stretching and wiggling 
               more conscious of it now as an erotic display

               the strength has flooded through her body as she rises to 
               her feet and stops off the mattress smiling at malahide

               malahide backs away from her as she moves towards him doing 
               his best to return her smile

               after a few steps julia stops and simply stares into 
               malahides eyes he too stops and returns the gaze the camera 
               circles them slowly several times studying them  the 
               dressed nervous man and skinned confident woman

                                     julia
                         well

               malahide says nothing perhaps he swallows nervously the 
               camera continues its circling movements the scene fades to 
               black and julia begins to laugh small sensual giggles at 
               first building finally as the blackness comes into an almost 
               hysterical crescendo of raucous joy

               int hospital room  night

               kirsty is again lying on her back on top of the bed she is 
               a stark contrast to julia no display no laughter

               her eyes are open and redrimmed from weeping now there is 
               also complete silence

               all the more jarring then the sudden sound of someone 
               fumbling at the handle of kirstys door

               her eyes widen in alarm and she flings herself off the bed 
               scanning the room for anything that can be used as a weapon

               there is nothing but the chair and she she has all but lifted 
               it aloft when she sees that it is kyle who comes into the 
               room

                                     kirsty
                         shit kyle this is getting to be a 
                         habit what is it some kind of shock
                         therapy

               she was angry relieved and amused when she realized it was 
               kyle and all these showed in her voice and face now they 
               drop away completely replaced by a nervous apprehension as 
               she becomes aware of the blank horror on his face

                                     kirsty
                         oh jesus what is it

               kyle opens his mouth a few times as if unsure what to say

                                     kyle
                         its all true

               int tiffanys room  night

               tiffany walks around her room staring at her completed 
               puzzles  those on the wall and the one on the floor  and 
               waiting for the next one

                                                                  fade out

               a simple shot tells us it is the next morning

               int obsession room  malahides house  day

               malahide dressed in a black suit is in the room staring 
               at the empty mattress we track with him through to his living 
               room

               int living room  malahides house  day

               in contrast to the secret and private obsession room this 
               room is the tasteful and upmarket room of the successful 
               professional

               it is a long spacious room with modern furniture and white 
               walls

               the walls are mostly free of decoration save for two or three 
               large canvases of abstract art

               the longest wall is broken up only by a low circular table 
               which rests against it about half way down on this table is 
               a very simple black vase containing a spray of beautiful 
               white lilies

               above this vase on the wall is a large frameless mirror

               as malahide enters the first thing he sees is a bloody palm 
               print on one of his white walls he blinks at it and looks 
               down into the room we cut to julia at first it seems she 
               is staring at the lilies but as we track around her we 
               realise she is staring at the reflection of her skinned self

               her face snarls at herself she roars with rage forms her 
               hand into a fist and shatters the mirror

               malahide rushes towards her she swings round and freezes 
               him with a glance

               they hold their positions for a moment malahide nervous and 
               julia furious and then julia makes herself relax she sighs 
               takes a few deep breaths and then speaks

                                     julia
                         im cold

               close up on a strangely art deco electric fan heater with 
               bright red coils emitting waves of heat

               we pull out to see malahide standing by the table with the 
               flowers there is now a halffull glass of wine on the table 
               along with an ashtray where a cigarette burns away ignored 
               a pack of cigarettes is now visible in the breast pocket of 
               malahides jacket

               julia enters the room and closes the door behind her she is 
               dressed in one of malahides suits it is a light weight 
               suit of white linen a suit for expensive holidays in hot 
               countries

               she crosses the room to the table pausing slightly in the 
               centre of the room to allow malahide to look at her

                                     julia
                         well

               malahides nervousness has retreated a little he manages to 
               smile he nods his head slowly a few times

                                     malahide
                         yes yes you look

                                     julia
                         surreal strange nightmarish

                                     malahide
                         no you look

               he pauses lost for words

               julia doesnt wait for an answer she crosses to the table 
               and takes up his glass of wine she downs it in one

               malahide stares at her a little surprised

                                     julia
                         yes i still like wine

               she smiles strangely at him and then moves closer slowly 
               keeping her eyes on his she reaches into his breast pocket 
               for his packet of cigarettes and places one in her mouth

                                     julia
                         and more

               for a moment malahides face is stone then slowly he 
               returns her smile and drawing his lighter lights her 
               cigarette

               int shopping mall  day

               a large multilevel shopping complex obviously upmarket and 
               expensive

               we see malahide riding up one on the central escalators 
               looking around him as he does so as if searching for a 
               specific shop

               he reaches the next level and begins to walk along one of 
               the several avenues that lead away from the central square 
               containing the escalators

               he walks past several shops looking in their windows a 
               chic specialty shop a window full of clocks a cutlers 
               finally he stops in front of one he stares at its display 
               window

               the window is classily minimal there is in fact only one 
               dress in it it is an exquisite white cocktail gown the 
               gown is full length but quite tightfitting merely flaring 
               a little from below the knee and has a halterneck

               malahide walks into the shop

               int malahides bedroom  day

               we are looking at a reflection of malahide in the large mirror 
               that covers the inside of his wardrobe door his real hand 
               and his reflected hand come together at the edge of the door 
               and tip it slightly changing the image that the mirror shows 
               us

               now we see julia she is in the dress from the shop in the 
               mall it is a perfect fit and shows her figure off very well 
               being a halterneck however her skinned arms and shoulders 
               are completely bare also it is quite low cut at the front 
               exposing a fair degree of visceral cleavage and at the back

               julia turns fully around in front of the mirror examining 
               herself from every angle her mood is unreadable until she 
               speaks

                                     julia
                         close it

               malahide does so he understands and tries to console her

                                     malahide
                         its a beautiful dress

                                     julia

               time cut

               int living room  malahides house  day

               close up malahides hands applying wide white surgical 
               bandages to julia

               we pull out as malahide steps away from julia they are both 
               standing in the middle of the living room floor

               julias arms torso and head are now completely enclosed in 
               neatly and professionally applied bandages there are three 
               slits for her eyes and mouth but apart from these she is 
               completely covered over these she is still wearing the white 
               dress

                                     malahide
                         there

               julia lifts her arms slightly to look at them and then touches 
               her bandaged face she turns towards malahide the camera 
               begins the same circling movement it made around them the 
               previous night

               malahides nervousness has practically disappeared he has 
               helped this woman he has bandaged her and dressed her he 
               is slightly in awe of her but it is now tinged with 
               excitement not fear

               the cameras circling grows faster

                                     malahide
                         well

               julia walks towards him slowly raising her hands when she 
               is close enough her hands cup his cheeks she pulls him 
               towards her and tipping her head to one side kisses him 
               her body moulds itself to his

               she leans her head back were they have kissed blood has 
               pressed up onto the bandage from her skinned flesh it looks 
               like smeared lipstick

                                     julia
                         well

               malahide puts his arms around her waist they kiss tenderly

               slowly almost nervously he lowers his hands until they 
               rest on her buttocks and presses her in towards him they 
               begin to spin themselves now echoing the camera movements

               they cross the room kissing blindly until they come to 
               rest against the wall that bears julias bloody palm print 
               julia twists their bodies so that malahide is pressed against 
               the wall and begins to move her hips forcefully and sensually 
               against malahide

               the camera is stationary now watching without movement as 
               malahide begins to raise julias dress up her legs her hand 
               on his wrist helping and encouraging

               about halfway up the thigh the bandaging disappears and the 
               raw flesh is exposed

               the kissing and the fumbling continue until they are making 
               fast and violent love against the wall

               his hands clutch tightly at her hips and he pulls his face 
               away from the kissing to lean it on her shoulder so that we 
               see his face as it grimaces in ecstasy

               he cries out and shudders and slowly both their movements 
               stop

               he strokes at her back gently and their bodies relax

                                     julia
                              almost coyly
                         now all we need is a skin

               close up on shower jets hitting kirstys face and naked 
               shoulders

               her eyes are closed but she smiles in pleasure as the water 
               refreshes her

               a knocking is heard kirsty moves her head out of the waters 
               path and shouts

                                     kirsty

               bathroom facilities is in the one room there is a sofa  
               with sheets and blankets on it  a bed a diningallpurpose 
               table with two chairs shelves full of records and books 
               and a small working desk against one of the walls the desk 
               is weighed down by text books and notes and tacked to the 
               wall above it are medical prints some of the brain and 
               central nervous system but also two fullcoloured anatomical 
               prints  one of a man and one of a woman they could almost 
               be portraits of julia and frank

               kyle fully dressed is standing by the bathroom door his 
               hand still in a knocking position

                                     kyle

               the bathroom door opens and kirsty comes into the main room 
               dressed in a toweling robe that is clearly a hers not a 
               his

               she crosses the room to a mirror rubbing at her wet hair 
               with a towel

                                     kirsty

               kirsty gestures at the sofa

                         as much as that bed of nails allowed

               kyle glances meaningfully at the bed as he replies

                                     kyle
                         well the sofa isnt often used for

               kirsty returns the smile via the mirror

               kyle crosses the room to sit at his dining table empty coffee 
               cups the remnants of a loaf and some cheese suggests their 
               breakfast was simple and finished some time ago

               kirsty gathers her clothes from by the sofa and moves back 
               into the bathroom to dress

               kyle waits a few moments and then speaks

                                     kyle
                         i think i need to talk about what i 
                         saw

               for a moment they laugh together but then stop kirsty stares 
               downward and then suddenly bursts into tears

                                     kirsty
                         what can i do how can i save him

               kyle joins her on the sofa he offers an arm but she shakes

               kirsty heads instantly for kyles door

                                     kirsty
                         im going

               kyle runs across the room and puts a restraining hand on his 
               door

                                     kyle
                         wait a minute what do you mean 
                         im going to the house

               kirsty nods and pulls at the door handle

                                     kirsty
                         get out of the way

                                     kyle
                         are you crazy

                                     kirsty
                         i dont know kyle youre the fucking 
                         expert now get out of the way

                                     kyle
                         why

                                     kirsty
                              shouting
                         because im going to get my father

               tears start to her eyes and she stares at kyle defiantly 
               then she repeats more softly

                                     kirsty
                         im going to get my father

               there is a twosecond silence between them as they stare at 
               each other

               finally kyle backs away from the door raising a finger

                                     kyle
                         two seconds just two seconds dont 
                         move

               he rushes across the room grabs a jacket and moves back to 
               the door

                                     kyle
                         ok lets go

                                     kirsty
                         kyle you dont have

                                     kyle
                         i know i dont have to its just my 
                         time of the month to be a complete 
                         fucking idiot ok

               kirsty stares at him her face at first blank then suffused 
               with emotion she leans across and plants a chaste kiss on 
               his lips then pulls back there is a beat while they simply 
               stare at each other and suddenly they are tight in each 
               others arms kissing fervently but the kiss is fuelled 
               not by passion but by fear and their mutual need for human 
               solace in the face of the unknown

               as the kiss continues the camera pulls back from them

               int the bloodboudoir  day

               close up as julia still bandaged and malahide come together 
               for a kiss they part and as julia moves across the room 
               the camera begins a long track around the room

               first it reaches a naked girl as catatonic as tiffany she 
               says nothing but her eyes betray her terror her hands are 
               tied above her

               julia moves in towards the girl her eyes glittering with an 
               alien hunger beneath their gauze mask as she nears the girl 
               the track passes them and moves through the room

               malahide has done his mistress proud it had been an empty 
               upstairs room no furniture bare floorboards but now it 
               resembles a nightmarish cross between a butchers shop and a 
               bordello

               the camera slowly reveals as it tracks that there are seven 
               more people in the room seven dead people driedout husks

               the tracking is now completing its circle around the room 
               after the corpses we return to julia and the girl  but 
               the girl too is now a hollow driedout shell

               julia moves back into the centre of the room and stands still

               malahide crosses the room to her quickly drawing a wicked 
               looking kitchen knife from his pocket as he does so he 
               reaches julia and raises the knife to her face

               with one swift precise movement he slices the bandages 
               across the side of her face julia raises her hand and pulls 
               the mask away

               the camera sweeps in toward her as she does this until her 
               face is in close up as the bandagemask is pulled aside

               her face is perfect

               ext malahides house  day

               malahide emerges from his front door he is still in his 
               black suit and looks every inch the respectable professional 
               he looks neither left nor right but moves straight off a 
               busy man with things to do

               a few seconds after he has gone offcamera kyle and kirsty 
               emerge from around the corner of the house

               kyle gestures to kirsty to follow him and leads her around 
               to the window he broke in through on the previous night

               int obsession room  day

               the room is much as we saw it last

               the window slides up and kyle pulls himself into the room 
               he looks around it carefully sure that the monster he saw 
               the previous night is no longer in the room he helps kirsty 
               in through the window

               kirstys eyes go at once to the three lament configurations 
               in the glass cases she crosses the room eagerly

               kyle rushes after her and stops her opening one of the cases

                                     kyle
                         wait the thing i want to be 
                         sure its not here

               kirsty nods and kyle leaves the room

               int stairslanding  malahides house  day

               kyle advances carefully and slowly from the stairs onto 
               the landing he looks about him at every step he takes

               ahead of him on the landing is a door which is very slightly 
               ajar

               he advances gingerly down the landing to the door

               when he reaches it he pauses we see his face working as he 
               ponders his choices  should he push it open inch by slow 
               inch or slam it inwards quickly

               very slowly he moves his hand towards the door the camera 
               matches his movement moving in on his hand the door and 
               the space between

               his fingertips are less than an inch from touching the door 
               when another hand shoots into view and grabs his wrist

               julia has crept up beside him on the landing while all his 
               attention was on the door

               kyle swings round in horror his mouth opening to scream 
               when he sees that julia has her other hand to her mouth her 
               finger at her lips in a silencing gesture

               there is of course nothing for him to recognize from the 
               monstrous vision of the previous night julias arms chest 
               and face are completely reskinned now all kyle sees is a 
               beautiful stranger in a white dress

                                     julia
                         sssh i think its still here

                                     kyle
                         what the the thing

               julia nods

                                     julia
                         yes i had to stop you going in there 
                         because i knew youd cry out any 
                         normal person would it its just 
                         terrible

                                     kyle
                         is it in there

                                     julia
                         no not now

               kyle swallows nods and gently pushes the door open he 
               walks into the room

               int the bloodboudoir  day

               the camera follows kyle into the room he reaches the middle 
               before horror and disgust stop him

               he hears a click behind him and turns to see julia has come 
               into the room and closes the door behind her she looks at 
               kyle

                                     julia
                         was i right is it terrible

               kyle stares all around him all eight victims have been sucked 
               dry he is surrounded by dead husks

               his face is ghastly he looks like he is about to faint he 
               nods

               his voice is a cracked whisper

                                     kyle
                         yes yes its terrible

               julia crosses the room rapidly towards him her face is a 
               picture of concern

                                     julia
                         oh you look awful you poor boy 
                         come here

               as she speaks julias arms are opening out to him kyle 
               sees the comfort offered and advances towards her too

               as they come together the camera moves around them and we 
               see for the first time that julia is still incomplete her 
               entire back is still glistening raw flesh the naked bones 
               of the spine still clearly visible

               their arms go around each other just as julia completes her 
               speech

                                     julia
                         come to mother

               as kyles hands touch the sticky mucoid meat of her 
               shoulders it is instantly clear to him what has happened 
               for a moment he freezes in terror

               his arms fly from her and he throws his head back but julia 
               is very strong now and her grip does not relax

               kyles expression is a mixture of terror and confusion as he 
               stares into the beautiful face of the monster

               julia smiles at him a hungry aroused smile

                                     julia
                         whats your name

               kyle can hardly speak for fear

                                     kyle
                         kyle

                                     julia
                         im julia

               she raised one hand from his back to the back of his head 
               and presses his face to hers

               julia plays it exactly as a sensual passionate kiss her 
               mouth wide open her head moving rhythmically and sinuously

               kyles reaction is somewhat different his arms flail in 
               panic though only from the elbow  julias grip prevents 
               anything more and his head makes jerking backward movements 
               against her pressing hand

               the camera moves around the embracing couple until it is 
               behind julia

               the back of her gown as we know is extremely low as the 
               kiss continues we see skin creeping above the line of the 
               gown at the base of her spine and gradually flowing up her 
               back until finally it meets and blends perfectly with ragged 
               and raw edges of the skin at her neck and shoulders julia 
               is complete again

               while this process has been going on kyle has been dying 
               slowly and horribly in her arms his lifeforce being sucked 
               into her through their open mouths his body by the time 
               her back is completely formed is shrunken hollow and dried 
               up

               julia takes her arms from around the corpse of kyle and steps 
               back allowing the husk to fall to the floor

               julia licks her lips and looks down not without affection 
               at the dead kyle she smiles

                                     julia
                         thank you kyle

               int obsession room  day

               kirsty has found the black ringbinder and laid it on the 
               writing table

               she has separated one of the photographs from the others and 
               laid it out on the table beside the binder it is the english 
               officer from the opening sequence kirsty has obviously 
               recognized something familiar in it but she cant quite grasp 
               it completely

               she is still puzzling over it when she suddenly realises 
               that several minutes have elapsed since kyle left her there 
               her head straightens up and her puzzled look is replaced by 
               a slightly worried one

                                     kirsty
                              to herself
                         kyle

               she folds up the photograph and puts it in her pocket

               she crosses to the door and opens it she does not go through 
               it immediately but stands in the doorway for a moment her 
               hand still on the door cocking her head slightly as if 
               listening

                                     kirsty
                              slightly louder
                         kyle

               she cant hear anything but she regards that as a bad sign 
               not a good one she leaves the room

               int stairslanding  day

               kirsty makes her way up the stairs unlike kyle a little 
               earlier she moves up them quite quickly and advances onto 
               the landing

               when she is on the landing and looking at the closed door to 
               julias boudoir she stops standing still and staring at the 
               door

               kirsty suppresses a shudder she bites her lip takes two or 
               three deep breaths crosses to the door firmly and flings 
               it open moving into the room even as she does so

               int the bloodboudoir  day

               kirsty moves three or four steps into the room and then stops 
               dead the door swings shut behind her

               kirstys eyes flick left and right taking in the sickening 
               details of the rooms contents and then stare straight ahead 
               focusing on the figure in white which is turning around to 
               face her

               julia completes her turn and looks at kirsty completely 
               impassively for a moment then her mouth opens up into a 
               smile of welcome  but there is nothing but hate in her 
               eyes

                                     julia
                         kirsty how nice of you to drop in

               julia glances meaningfully at the dead thing that lies beside 
               her feet and then back at kirsty

                                     julia
                         you have surprisingly good taste in 
                         men

               kirstys fear and disgust are momentarily displaced by a 
               furious rage as she realises what julia has done her face 
               erupts into anger and she screams out

                                     kirsty
                         kyle no ill kill you you

               she flings herself across the room at julia even as she 
               speaks

               julia is completely unphased by this attack and simply raises 
               one arm she seizes the wrist of the arm that kirsty has 
               raised into a clenched fist and effortlessly throws kirsty 
               bodily back across the room we realise for the first time 
               the immense physical strength that julia now possesses

               kirsty smashes into the door and falls to a sitting position 
               against it she is shaken and slightly hurt enough not to 
               get to her feet immediately but she stares at julia with 
               undimmed hatred

               julia throws a look halfway between a smile and a sneer

                                     julia
                         oh you can try it you little bitch 
                         id love you to try it but im not 
                         just the woman i was

                                     kirsty
                         what you mean youre something more 
                         than a whore with a vicious streak

                                     julia
                         i mean im something more than human 
                         you little shit

               julia snaps this first line but then holds her anger in check

               she shakes her head and an amused smile plays across her 
               lips

                                     julia
                         oh kirsty they didnt tell you 
                         did they im afraid theyve changed 
                         the rules of the fairy tale im no 
                         longer just the wicked stepmother

               the smile disappears and she delivers the next line with an 
               utterly straight face it is after all the truth

                                     julia
                         now im the evil queen

               the hatred and the heat returns to her voice

                                     julia
                         so come on take your best shot 
                         snow white

               kirsty scrambles to her feet and again charges at julia

               julia steps forward to meet her advance and delivers a single 
               backhanded swipe across kirstys face with such force that 
               not only is the girl knocked off her feet but is actually 
               knocked unconscious

               kirsty rolls onto her back and lies at julias feet

               julia stares down at the unconscious body when it was awake 
               it was kirsty and her attitude to it was based on personal 
               enmity

               now it is simply another body and she judges it differently 
               it is firm full healthy and young we see the expression 
               on her face change from hatred and triumph to pure appetite 
               she licks her lips and her eyes glisten she begins to bend 
               slightly towards it

                                     malahide os
                         julia

               the door to the room opens julia straightens up and looks 
               as malahide stands in the doorway her eyebrows question 
               this interruption

               a second later and it is explained he leads tiffany into 
               the room

               time cut

               int obsession room  day

               tiffany sits crosslegged in the middle of the floor she 
               appears to be alone in the room cradled in her lap is a 
               lament configuration taken from one of the glass cases on 
               the low table

               on a wall behind tiffany one of the large prints that 
               previously hung there has been taken down

               revealed in the space behind  it is a large mirror the camera 
               moves in towards this mirror

               int obsession room  alcove  day

               malahide and julia stand in a tiny and completely bare room 
               on the wall in front of them is a large window through which 
               we see a backview of tiffany in the obsession room

               int obsession room  day

               tiffany looks around the room generally and then turns her 
               attention completely to the lament configuration

               she picks it up and turns it around in her hands studying 
               each of its faces intently

               she begins trying to move the interlinked pieces within it 
               at first she has no success the box appears to be one solid 
               construction with no internal movement possible

               she stops her attempts and studies it again for a moment 
               her face still impassive then she gives a tiny smile and 
               begins again her movements are faster now less tentative

               suddenly there is a click and one of the panels onthe box 
               slides out slightly the little musicbox tune begins to 
               play

               to tiffany this is a marvelous reward  something the jigsaw 
               never offered  and she lets out a little sound in response 
               somewhere between a sigh and a delighted giggle it tempts 
               her to even greater skill and her delighted fingers fly over 
               the box

               another panel moves then two more the tune is prettier and 
               fuller

               int obsession room  alcove  day

               malahide stares fixedly through the window nervous but 
               terribly excited he is breathing rapidly and shallowly

               through the glass tiffanys success continues small flashes 
               of intense blue light begin to buzz around the box the room 
               grows darker and cracks begin to appear in its walls

               julia seems quietly amused  both by what is going on in 
               the room and by malahides heated response to it she glances 
               from one to the other her eyes twinkling

                                     julia
                         youre sure this is what you want

               malahide doesnt take his eyes from the window

                                     malahide
                         its what ive always wanted a view 
                         of beyond

               he pauses perhaps he is being ungallant he turns slightly 
               towards julia and takes her hand

                                     malahide
                         you were almost enough julia but 
                         i have to see i have to know

               julia smiles indulgently she nods

                                     julia
                         oh i quite understand

               int obsession room  day

               tiffany is completely engrossed in the box she seems 
               blissfully unaware of the changes taking place in the room

               the cracks have widened in the walls and in some places 
               pieces of plaster have fallen away revealing the slats 
               beneath

               blue light begins to stream into the room ignoring the 
               geography of what should lie beyond its walls where the 
               light comes through the slats it is as broad beams of light 
               given contrast by the shadows of the slats but it also comes 
               through the smaller cracks and enters the room in intensely 
               bright and very thin beams that crisscross through the room 
               almost like a laser display

               suddenly tiffanys solution is complete the central core 
               of the box rises up and twists itself around into its final 
               position

               int obsession room  alcove  day

               malahide takes an almost involuntary step backward his 
               excitement has now reached the pitch where it is beyond 
               obvious physical manifestation he is perfectly still his 
               face perfectly impassive

                                     malahide
                         shes done it

                                     julia
                         she certainly has

                                     malahide
                         its coming

                                     julia
                         it certainly is

               malahide turns away to meet her eyes

               there is a beat or two where absolutely nothing happens

               the mirror explodes inwards into the alcove

               int obsession room  day

               the room is filled with smoke and suffused with blue light

               two of the walls simply part physically revealing entrances 
               into the corridors of hell these corridors are lined with 
               gray walls and seem to run for a great distance

               tiffany still sits crosslegged in the middle of the floor 
               staring about her in astonishment

               surrounding her in various parts of the room are the four 
               cenobites from hellraiser

               the female cenobite smiles and advances towards tiffany

               the leader of the cenobites pinhead raises a hand

                                     pinhead
                         wait

               the female stops and looks questioningly at pinhead

               pinhead at a more leisurely pace crosses towards tiffany 
               and looks down at her she stares back at him the remnants 
               of her insanity a temporary defense against fear her face 
               registering nothing

               pinhead looks up

                                     pinhead
                         no

               the female looks across at him

                                     cenobite
                         no

               pinhead shakes his head

                                     pinhead
                         no

               he glances down at tiffany again

                                     pinhead
                         it is not hands that call us

               he looks up and stares directly at the shattered twoway 
               mirror

                                     pinhead
                         it is desire

               int obsession room  alcove  day

               the wall opposite the shattered mirror has also opened up to 
               reveal a way into hell

               malahide and julia are no longer in the alcove

               we hear the ringing of their footsteps they are making their 
               way down the corridor

               int obsession room  day

               the four cenobites have gone

               tiffany looks around the room again she stares from one 
               entrance to the other her manner is reminiscent of when she 
               is making decisions during her solving of puzzles

               int bloodboudoir  day

               kirsty is still on the floor in the boudoir of blood this 
               room too is now suffused with blue light and smoke there 
               are no gateways to hell in the walls but there are several 
               cracks in the plaster and these appear to be spreading

               kirsty moans and opens her eyes gingerly she puts a hand to 
               her face rubbing at the place where julia hit her

               still a little groggy she lifts herself slowly to a sitting 
               position her legs stretched out only when she has blinked 
               a few times shaken her head and rubbed her jaw again does 
               full consciousness return  at which point she looks quickly 
               about the room possibly expecting another attack from julia 
               and notices the light and the smoke

               she has been in this atmosphere before she knows precisely 
               what it means her mouth opens and her eyes grow nervous 
               again

                                     kirsty
                         oh shit

               kirsty scrambles quickly to her feet and rushes through the 
               door to the stairs

               int obsession room  day

               kirsty enters the room just as tiffany is about to go down 
               one of the corridors kirsty screams at her

                                     kirsty
                         no

               tiffany stops startled and looks at the doorway and kirsty

               kirsty raises her hands in a placatory gesture and speaks 
               more softly

                                     kirsty
                         wait wait

               kirsty begins to move into the room slowly and shakes her 
               head gently

                                     kirsty
                         hey remember me from the hospital 
                         i was in the next room

               kirsty is rewarded with a small recognizing smile from 
               tiffany kirsty returns the smile

                                     kirsty
                         you dont want to go down there you 
                         really dont want to go down there

               tiffany turns her head once more to look down the corridor 
               and then turns back to kirsty for a second it looks as if 
               kirstys persuasions have succeeded but malahides training 
               has been too thorough tiffany knows a puzzle when she sees 
               one she smiles once more at kirsty and then suddenly turns 
               and disappears into the corridor

               kirsty stands still for a moment as if she cant quite 
               believe that tiffany has done it she shakes her head  
               half in disbelief and half in despair

                                     kirsty
                         jesus christ

               pausing only to pick up the lament configuration from where 
               tiffany has left it on the floor she heads straight for the 
               corridor and follows tiffany in

               int corridorslabyrinth

               we are looking straight down one of the very long corridors 
               of hell

               it has the same architecture as the corridor that appeared 
               in the hospital room in hellraiser walls of stained gray 
               stone broken up by vaguely medievallooking arches

               kirsty comes into view walking away from the camera ahead 
               of her at an illogically far distance given that she entered 
               the corridor only seconds before kirsty is tiffany

               kirsty breaks into a slight run and calls out to the girl

                                     kirsty
                         tiffany wait

               her voice has an unpleasant ring in the acoustics of these 
               corridors and echos horribly kirsty pulls a face and doesnt 
               shout again she increases her pace slightly

               suddenly tiffany makes a sharp turn and enters an intersecting 
               corridor kirsty is forced to increase her speed even more

               kirsty too makes the turn into another corridor even as she 
               does so she sees tiffany disappearing again into yet another 
               intersection

               kirsty follows and again the same thing happens

               this happens several times and always kirsty never quite 
               loses sight of tiffany but never quite catches up with her 
               either

               in short tiffanys instincts were absolutely right this 
               too is another puzzle the girls are lost in a concrete maze 
               full of twists and turns and labyrinthine windings

               after enough turns have been made to completely confuse 
               kirstys sense of direction she makes a final turn into one 
               corridor and sees something different

               at the end of this corridor is a blinding white light as 
               soon as kirsty sees the light the air is filled with 
               beautiful birdsong

               tiffany disappears into the light as soon as kirsty sees it

               despite the light despite the birdsong kirsty is still 
               suspicious and shouts out

                                     kirsty
                         tiffany dont trust it dont trust 
                         it

               but it is too late the girl is gone kirsty follows and 
               vanishes into the light

               int corridorslabyrinth

               julia and malahide are seen in the corridors of the labyrinth

               malahides face is full of delight he is absolutely the 
               enchanted visitor

               julia on the other hand walks with the brisk assurance of 
               one on familiar territory

               the corridors that malahide sees are different to kirstys 
               they are grottolike dotted with stalactites and stalagmites 
               and not immediately unattractive the walls contain portals 
               of a glasslike substance at random intervals that emit 
               blooming lights of different colors and malahide peers eagerly 
               into several of these

               in one the view is like an aquarium an alien fish swims 
               past his eyes its body resembles a human brain but it has 
               pincerlike claws malahide presses his hand against the 
               glass as the thing comes nearer

               suddenly from within its body the thing produces a perfect 
               human forearm and hand and meets malahides hand on the other 
               side of the glass

               malahide starts slightly but then keeps his hand there he 
               is turning his head to call julias attention to this marvel 
               when the thing suddenly forms a fist and begins to beat 
               against the glass with tremendous force

               malahide jumps back sharply but the thing shatters the glass 
               and leaps out at him he gasps and runs up the corridor the 
               thing hopping after him on its one hand

               as they pass julia she tuts with the slightly exasperated 
               but indulgent tone of a parent or a teacher she steps on 
               the thing squashing it flat it emits a horrible deathcry

                                     julia
                         do be careful

               int hells sitting room  day

               white light fills the screen and kirsty steps through it 
               into view instantly the white light contracts and disappears

               kirsty finds herself standing in a beautiful family sitting 
               room

               the room is bathed in the warm light of a perfect summers 
               day

               the birdsong kirsty heard earlier continues but is if 
               anything even more melodic even more sweet

               the room is vaguely edwardian in its decor real wood 
               furnishings and decorative porcelain ornaments there is a 
               large wooden dresser on top of which are many photographs 
               in oldfashioned brass frames

               despite herself kirsty cannot resist a smile of pure pleasure 
               at the appearance of the room

               she touches some of the furniture as if to assure herself 
               it is real

               she approaches the dresser and picks up one of the large 
               framed photographs she gasps in pleasure

               we see the photograph it is a family group and looks to be 
               have been taken ten to twenty years ago it is of a man a 
               woman and a young girl of four or five

               the man is clearly larry albeit a younger version and the 
               little girl has dark thick slightly curly hair  just 
               like kirstys the woman is beautiful and has similar hair 
               to her daughter

               kirstys eyes prick with tears  but they are clearly tears 
               of happy memories she smiles

                                     kirsty
                         mommy

               kirsty puts down the photograph of her family and looks around 
               the room again a troubled look crosses her face

               despite the apparent summer light in the room kirsty suddenly 
               realises what it is that is odd

               she looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her 
               face

               there are no windows in the room and no door

               at this point the odd discordant note in the birdsong becomes 
               apparent it is nothing too obvious at the moment  the 
               total effect is simply less sweet than it was

               kirsty looks back at the photograph and snatches it up with 
               a look of concern

               the photograph has changed it is now a wedding photo the 
               wedding of larry and julia

               suddenly the photograph begins to bleed blood pours from 
               the paper itself pressing up and smearing against the glass 
               so that it is momentarily framed blood without a single 
               trace of the picture showing the blood begins to escape out 
               of the frame trickling over the lip that holds the glass in 
               place and dripping onto kirstys fingers

               with a cry of horror kirsty drops the frame it lands on 
               the floor and the glass shatters the blood continues to 
               flow in fact now that the glass does not restrain it it 
               fairly fountains out spreading across the floor

               kirsty steps back and glances at the dresser blood is flowing 
               from every frame pooling on the dresser and overflowing 
               onto the floor

               by now the discordant elements in the birdsong are very 
               much predominant and as kirsty sweeps all the frames off 
               the dresser and onto the floor with a scream of anguish the 
               birdsong gives way completely to a hideous dissonant 
               shrieking

               kirsty throws her hands to her ears

                                     kirsty
                         nooooo

               she rushes at one of the walls and begins beating it with 
               her fists

               the walls are soft and pulpy and give slightly as her fists 
               strike like flabby flesh kirsty stands back in disgust

               the wall visibly bruises before her eyes swelling and 
               purpling

               the light in the room like the birdsong has changed utterly 
               it is not dark but simply dull featureless and depressing

               kirsty turns away in disgust and finds that the whole room 
               has given in to decay the sofas and chairs are mildewed and 
               rotten the wooden furniture is ridden with woodworm and 
               rot a skinned rat runs across the room beside the buckled 
               and chipped skirting board

               a rotten leg gives way under a small chest and the bottom 
               drawer spills out freeing a whole family of quite large 
               spiders which run wildly across the floor

               suddenly the room begins to fill with smoke churned up by 
               an everincreasing intensity of wind the smoke obscures the 
               screen

               int bare chamber  hell

               the smoke and wind subside but not entirely

               kirsty is standing in exactly the same position in a room of 
               exactly the same proportions but which is completely empty 
               and which has walls of the same gray stone that the corridors 
               do

               suddenly rising up from behind kirsty comes pinhead

                                     pinhead
                         ah kirsty and we thought wed lost 
                         you

               kirsty swings round in terror as the mist continues to clear 
               she sees advancing to join pinhead the female cenobite and 
               the chatterer beyond them it is now revealed that this 
               chamber has no fourth wall it gives directly onto the 
               corridors

                                     female cenobite
                         so sweet of you to come back

               kirsty begins to work furiously at the box she has brought 
               from malahides house it sent them away at the end of 
               hellraiser

               she obviously hopes it will work again

               pinhead raises a hand and the box simply flies out of kirstys 
               hands and hovers in the air between them kirsty stares 
               openmouthed

                                     pinhead
                         how can it send us back child  
                         were already here and so are you

               suddenly pinhead works at the box himself  by remote control 
               and with dazzling skill

               he turns the box rapidly through positions kirsty and we 
               have never seen before  even opening it out at one stage 
               into a large twodimensional square finally it closes 
               itself down  but in a wholly new shape a white multi
               faceted diamond shape  and drops back into kirstys hands

               he stares at kirsty and makes a small gesture with his brow 
               it is almost cute if anything it resembles the cocky arent
               iclever look steve gave kirsty after swallowing the cigarette 
               in hellraiser then his face assumes its normal deadly 
               blankness

               kirsty shakes her head dumbly and begins to back into a 
               corner hoping that if they converge on her she might just 
               be able to slip around them and get back to the labyrinth

                                     kirsty
                         no you you cant it wasnt me 
                         i didnt do it i didnt open the 
                         box

                                     female cenobite
                         didnt open the box and what was it 
                         last time didnt know what the box 
                         was and yet we do keep finding each 
                         other dont we

                                     pinhead
                         oh kirsty so eager to play so 
                         reluctant to admit it

                                     female cenobite
                         perhaps youre teasing us are you 
                         teasing us

               to some extent kirstys ploy is working the cenobites are 
               moving closer together as they advance to the corner in which 
               she stands

                                     kirsty
                         but i didnt open it i didnt

                                     pinhead
                         then why are you here

                                     kirsty
                         ive come for my father

               kirsty shouts this with brave defiance pinhead laughs in 
               response a very unattractive sound

                                     pinhead
                         but hes in his own hell child and 
                         quite unreachable

               suddenly kirsty makes her break shouting out as she does so

                                     kirsty
                         i dont believe you

               it seems for a moment she has succeeded she swings around 
               the side of the cenobites and begins to run across the 
               chamber the cenobites do not move but suddenly from nowhere 
               a hook flies across the room attached to a metal chain the 
               hook buries itself in the wall only inches in front of 
               kirstys face the chain pulled tight and barring her path 
               the wall begins to bleed

               kirsty screams

               the cenobites turn to face her but make no attempt to cross 
               the room to her new position

                                     pinhead
                         but its true he is his own hell  
                         just as you are in yours

                                     kirsty
                         and what about you

               pinhead almost smiles at the naivete of the question

                                     pinhead
                         its different for us

                                     female cenobite
                         weve always been here

                                     pinhead
                         we have no more surprises

               suddenly as quickly as it came the hook withdraws from the 
               wall and flies back into nothingness

               pinhead puts out his hand in an expansive gesture

                                     pinhead
                         but please feel free explore 
                         well always be here

               int corridor

               kirsty cant quite believe this but she has no intention of 
               questioning it she runs into the corridor and away with 
               pinheads last words echoing after her

                                     pinhead
                         we have eternity to know your 
                         flesh

               delighted cenobite laughter follows her back into the 
               labyrinth

               kirsty drops the transformed box into her pocket as she begins 
               running through the corridors again the labyrinth seems 
               tighter now  the corridors shorter the turns sharper

               corner after corner we see kirsty turn

               accompanying this tightening the light in the corridors 
               becomes gradually murkier  not quite dark more like the 
               oppressive colourlessness that descends before a thunderstorm 
               breaks

               occasionally there are little hissing noises from the walls 
               themselves which are accompanied by small jets of dull and 
               heavy smoke escaping between the bricks

               over all this there grows in volume on the soundtrack a 
               rhythmic labored resonant sound  a sound somewhere between 
               breathing and machinery

               suddenly as kirsty turns one more corner a hand reaches 
               out to touch her

               kirsty throws herself back against the far wall of the 
               corridor unsure whether to fight or flee then her face 
               relaxes it is tiffany

               int corridorslabyrinth

               in another corridor within the labyrinth malahide and julia 
               are walking

               they too have found their way into the inner sections they 
               too are in tighter sharper corridors where the light is 
               distressing they too hear the machinelike breathing noise 
               and what is revealed behind the portals in the corridor walls 
               is less ambiguous in its unpleasantness in one we see 
               chatterer in some hells equivalent of a beauty salon he is 
               being remade this involves the scar tissue being manually 
               peeled from the upper part of his face to reveal beneath 
               small vicious human eyes

               malahides attitude has begun to change as well his 
               nervousness now clearly outweighs his delight he rushes on 
               to the next portal

               if the last room was a beauty salon this is the orgy room 
               but the orgy is very strange it is a very dark room filled 
               with a faint layer of smoke in the background a bound man 
               is having his chest licked by a kneeling woman she pulls 
               her face back for a moment her tongue is horrifically long 
               and studded with short sharp blades the mans chest is 
               stripped of skin where she has been attending him his face 
               is a picture of ecstasy

               in the foreground three people are buried up to their waists 
               in the floor they are naked the one in the middle is a 
               woman the other two men the one in front of her faces 
               her the one behind has his back to her back they are all 
               very close the men have various hooks in their chests 
               connected by chains to the unseen walls and their faces are 
               impassive the woman is unwounded and her head flicks back 
               and forth as if in the grip of a sexual climax of stunning 
               ferocity the movements of her head keep the details of her 
               features blurred until finally it turns to give malahide a 
               threequarter profile and holds its position its mouth open 
               its eyes halfclosed in pleasure it is julias face

               malahide gasps and pulls back from the portal the camera 
               tracks back to reveal that julia is still in the corridor 
               just a few yards in front of him

                                     julia
                         come i have such sights to show 
                         you

               malahide shakes his head crazily from side to side and begins 
               to back away

               julia looks at him and walks toward him slowly she smiles 
               she strokes his cheek she moves closer gently slipping her 
               arms around him and molding her body to his she extends her 
               tongue and licks lightly at his lower lip he opens his mouth 
               and returns the kiss pressing her body more firmly to him 
               the kiss becomes quite passionate

               kirsty and tiffany are now walking together

               kirsty is talking to her as calmly as her sense of urgency 
               will allow

                                     kirsty
                         do you see you were right this is 
                         a puzzle too but were caught in 
                         the puzzle

               kirsty stops walking and catches hold of tiffanys arm 
               tiffany stops looks at the hand holding her arm and then 
               looks into kirstys eyes

                                     kirsty
                         yeah

               tiffany smiles directly at kirsty and then returns her nod

                                     kirsty
                         yeah

               tiffany nods again more emphatically

                                     kirsty
                         yeah

               kirsty throws her arms around tiffany and hugs her

               int corridorslabyrinth

               julia is leading malahide down a corridor which has 
               intersections every few yards on both of its sides

               julia walks past these shadowed entrances without pause 
               without a single sidelong glance she is clearly confident 
               clearly back on her own turf

               malahide on the other hand glances nervously into every 
               one before moving on

               there is also one last portal he looks into he is gazing 
               into a room where the floor is a vast seething pool of 
               maggots suddenly something breaks the surface it would 
               doubtless scream were its mouth not full of maggots it is 
               browning his nightmare has come true his skin is producing 
               the maggots in a constant spewing flow from numerous sores 
               that pack his face

               malahide turns away and calls to julia

                                     malahide
                         enough god thats enough we have 
                         to go back

               julia smiles at him

                                     julia
                         go back what an earth makes you 
                         think we can go back

               malahides jaw drops

                                     malahide
                         i want to go back

                                     julia
                         sorry friend no day trips to hell 
                         here you are here you stay and 
                         forward the only way to go

               julia turns back and walks an down the corridor

               malahide with a glance back at the maggot pool turns after 
               the now departing julia

               int corridorslabyrinth

               kirsty and tiffany are walking warily along a corridor when 
               suddenly the corridor wall parts with a roar both girls 
               jump and tiffany cries out

               a new and very narrow corridor has been revealed the girls 
               stare down it it culminates in a door despite being set in 
               a blank gray stone wall the door is normal but frightening  
               because it is an exact replica of the front door of 55 
               lodovico street larrys house

               before kirsty can react to this a voice issues from beyond 
               the door

                                     voice
                         kirsty

               kirsty stops dead in her tracks she looks at the door and 
               moves toward it walking slowly down the corridor tiffany 
               follows

                                     kirsty
                              very tentatively
                         daddy

               only a low moan comes from behind the door

                                     kirsty
                         tiffany wait here if im not back 
                         real soon  get out get home

               leaving tiffany in the corridor kirsty opens the door and 
               steps in

               int the brothers room

               the door that kirsty opens gives directly on to a room

               like the sitting room earlier this appears to be an ordinary 
               room and not a stone wall chamber

               its wallpapered walls were once white but are now yellowed 
               and old overhead there is an equally ancient four bladed 
               wooden fan that turns sluggishly

               in the middle of the floor is a small low table of vaguely 
               eastern design

               on this table lie a hand of cards face down an empty and 
               cloudy tumbler and a soiled ashtray

               over by the far wall the wall opposite to that containing 
               the door there is a mattress on the floor a body like shape 
               on this mattress is obscured by a heavy blanket that covers 
               it

               to the side of the mattress a latticed wooden screen stands 
               hiding whatever is behind it from those entering the room 
               if the atmosphere of the room reminds us of anything it is 
               of the seedy bazaar where frank first bought the lament 
               configuration

               we are looking at the door as it opens inwards and kirsty 
               slowly and nervously walks into the room

               kirsty advances into the room she stares at the mattress 
               ahead of her above it written in blood on the wall is the 
               message she saw in her vision i am in hell help me

                                     kirsty
                         daddy

               a low moan comes from the far end of the room kirsty assumes 
               it issues from the figure hidden beneath the blanket and 
               walks nearer lifting her arm in readiness to remove the 
               blanket

                                     kirsty
                         daddy its kirsty

               there is no response kirsty arrives at the mattress and 
               pulls the blanket back she leaps backwards her hand at her 
               mouth stifling a scream

               lying on the bed is a husk like figure vaguely female in 
               shape despite its appearance of long decay it is dressed 
               in vaguely sexual garments of leather suddenly the eyes 
               pop open revealing a vague remnant of life

                                     kirsty
                         oh god

               kirsty hurriedly throws the blanket back over it

               a voice issues into the room it sounds like larry but as 
               we shall see it is not

                                     voice
                         no over here behind the screen

               kirsty walks carefully around the screen giving it a wide 
               berth in case of a trick

               there is a figure standing against the wall behind the screen 
               it is deeply shadowed by the screen itself but is clearly 
               male

               kirsty gulps back a sob and her eyes fill with tears

                                     kirsty
                         daddy

               the figure leans slowly into the light speaking as he does 
               so

                                     frank
                         thats it baby come to daddy

               kirsty stands still there is a second where her face 
               registers nothing then she screams

                                     kirsty
                         no

               it is her uncle frank back in his skin and dressed in white 
               shirt and jeans

               frank chuckles kirsty backs away from him into the room 
               frank puts out his right hand in a placatory gesture kirsty 
               realises he is not moving after her she also sees that his 
               body is curiously angled the left side still in the deep 
               shadow cast by the screen is there something else there 
               something she cant quite see franks voice stops her 
               wondering

                                     frank
                         whats the matter kirsty its only 
                         frank its only uncle frank

               kirstys anger at being tricked wins over her fear and 
               distress and she shouts at frank in fury

                                     kirsty
                         i should have known i shouldve 
                         known he wouldnt be here this place 
                         is only for filth like you

               frank sneers

                                     frank
                         oh right daddys died and gone to 
                         heaven eh

                                     kirsty
                         yes

                                     frank
                         shit bull shit

               frank pauses and smiles then he begins to move more fully 
               into the room shifting his weight as he does so and dragging 
               what was hidden into the light kirsty screams again

               franks white shirt is cut off at the left shoulder his arm 
               is bare and from the elbow down to the wrist joined to 
               another forearm the flesh is completely fused like that of 
               siamese twins as frank moves into the room the owner of 
               the other arm is revealed it is his brother larry kirstys 
               father

               larry like his brother is dressed in a white shirt cut 
               off at one shoulder and jeans and like his brother has 
               his skin back

               his face is frozen into a permanent expression of terror and 
               he seems incapable of any independent movement simply being 
               pulled along by frank

               kirsty steps back in horror

                                     frank
                         see hes here you should learn to 
                         believe your uncle frank

                                     kirsty
                         no he shouldnt be here it shouldve 
                         been a trick

                                     frank
                         fraid not baby he belongs here 
                         with me were the same brothers 
                         equal and opposite pure appetite  
                         pure banality too much feeling  
                         none at all

               kirstys fear of frank is now outweighed by her contempt for 
               his argument

                                     kirsty
                         youre full of shit frank cotton  
                         my dad wasnt like that at all he 
                         could feel he could love he loved 
                         me

               kirstys voice breaks

                                     kirsty
                         he he loved me

                                     frank
                         dont waste your tears look at him

               her hatred for frank gives kirsty her strength back

                                     kirsty
                         he loved me you bastard he loved 
                         me he loved my mother he even loved 
                         that bitch you betrayed him with

               frank begins to move towards kirsty again larry dragging 
               behind him

                                     frank
                         ah julia she hasnt been to see me 
                         recently thats why its so nice to 
                         have you here baby daddys little 
                         girl so pretty when shes upset 
                         come to daddy

               frank is very close to her now kirsty attempts to run across 
               the room frank seizes her arm and throws her back against 
               the wall he moves in close and presses against her his 
               voice is midway between arousal and anger

                                     frank
                         now dont be naughty kirsty or 
                         ill have to punish you first  
                         perhaps youd like that would you 
                         like that

               kirsty screams and stares pleadingly at the still frozen 
               larry

                                     kirsty
                         daddy daddy i love you help me

                                     frank
                         im your daddy now kirsty

               frank leans in to kiss the terrified kirsty

               suddenly a hand appears at franks throat and hurls him off 
               kirsty it is larry roused by his daughters cries

                                     larry
                         get your fucking hands off my 
                         daughter you bastard

               suddenly the room previously full of slow movements and 
               tension is full of furious violent action as the fused 
               brothers kick tear and punch at each other in a paroxysm 
               of killing hatred

               int the centre of hell

               malahide and julia are at the end of a corridor they turn 
               into an open space a vast open space it is desertlike in 
               its expanse almost vanishing into infinity at its furthest 
               reaches

               it is crisscrossed by catwalks on one of which malahide 
               and julia now stand beside these catwalks the ground falls 
               away into miledeep dark abysses

               above the catwalks dominating the huge space is the master 
               of the labyrinth

               the master leviathan is a monumentally huge white multi 
               faceted diamond spinning on its own axis entirely 
               unsupported by any physical means above its territory

               apart from its very immensity the most unsettling thing 
               about leviathan are the beams of black light that shine out 
               from the corners of all its many facets due to the fast 
               spinning these beams shoot and swoop around the chamber 
               like a negative laser display of dazzling complexity

               the sound that has been in the corridors is now magnified 
               it is the sound of leviathans breath

               malahide has walked the last few yards like a man in shock 
               now a black beam strikes his face and images of horror flash 
               before his eyes at almost subliminal speed his face suddenly 
               crumbles into an expression of incredulous terror he makes 
               a noise halfway between screaming and retching and drops to 
               his knees by the edge of the catwalk

               unfortunately this allows him to look down into leviathans 
               pit looking down with him we are given a sudden and 
               vertiginously sickening realization of hells immensities 
               there is a drop of miles visible down the pit and all the 
               way down as far as the eye can see there are other catwalks 
               cutting across the pit at various angles

               malahide looks back up his scream renewed by his sight of 
               the pit two or three of the beams of black light flit across 
               his face filling his eyes with more subliminal images of 
               horror as they pass a child a knife and a dead animal a 
               naked woman whose private parts are made of sharp oily 
               metal perfect hands ending in crumbling leprous fingers

               suddenly leviathan stops spinning effortlessly instantly 
               two more beams are projected at malahide but as they come 
               within a few yards of him they become writhing pink limbs 
               that fly out seize malahide and lift him into the air he 
               screams out

                                     malahide
                         no no julia help me

               malahide is held in the air as julia replies

                                     julia
                         but you wanted this you wanted to 
                         see you wanted to know and here it 
                         is the heart of hell leviathan

               as she says this two of the things facets part to reveal a 
               raw and gaping cavity lined with angry sorelooking purple 
               flesh directly behind the dangling malahide

               the purple and pink walls of this flesh gash peel apart and 
               open in various places to reveal blades hooks and needles 
               at the end of various vestigial limbs

               the limbs holding malahide draw him back inexorably into 
               this cavity

               he has one last moment to meet julias eyes

                                     julia
                         why do you think i was allowed to go 
                         back for you no it wanted souls 
                         and i brought you and you wanted to 
                         know now youre both happy

               malahide is now held within the walls of the gash he opens 
               his mouth for one final scream but one of the tiny needle
               topped limbs flies at his mouth and sews his lips together 
               with heavy blue wire before he can utter it

               his eyes widen in both agony and horror

               julia smiles

                                     julia
                         goodbye doctor its been real

               the gash heals itself closing malahide within

               despite the gash having closed over malahide the leathery 
               flesh that covers that area is a mass of movement ripples 
               and bumps

               small rips and gashes appear and disappear on its surface 
               allowing us occasional and partial glimpses of malahide and 
               what is happening to him

               at one stage malahides hand and forearm appear a long deep 
               running cut has been made down the arm and the flesh peeled 
               and folded back revealing the meat and the muscle beneath 
               as we watch two of the tiny operating limbs sew the flaps 
               of flesh still folded back to the rest of the arm leaving 
               the wound open and unhealable

               another gash opens and malahides face is visible here too 
               the needles are at work diving into and out of his flesh in 
               a complicated sewing pattern that is finally pulled together 
               beneath one ear leaving malahides features permanently 
               pulled out of shape and decorated with running stitches of 
               metal wire

               again malahides torso appears naked two large triangular 
               blades make deep parallel slashes down his chest two 
               different limbs appear but these have suckerlike tips rather 
               than metallic ones they fasten onto the new cuts as if 
               battening instead they are injecting  as becomes apparent 
               when malahides skin turns blue

               the blueness the conscious disfigurement and the almost 
               decorative open wounds should serve to convey that what is 
               happening to malahide is not simply torture he is being 
               transformed into a cenobite

               julia watches with avid interest

               int brothers room

               larry and frank are fighting furiously tumbling around the 
               room larry is fuelled by righteous anger and revenge but 
               frank has had more experience of dirty fighting

               at one stage their free hands each have hold of the other 
               man by the throat and are rolling along one of the walls 
               each trying to establish the dominant grip

               they smash violently against one of the walls in the room 
               it gives and they fall through into the next room

               int knife room

               this is a small square room with the exception of the doorway 
               to the brothers room every inch of the walls is covered 
               with sharp and deadlylooking doublebladed knives  ie one 
               blade is buried in the wall up to a central hilthandle and 
               the other blade juts out menacingly into the room

               the two brothers tumble into the room their grips loosened 
               by their fall through the wall they land on the floor and 
               rise to their feet staring at each other but taking in the 
               vicious nature of the room as well

                                     frank
                         how convenient

               kirsty comes through and gasps as she sees the walls

                                     larry
                         stay there baby dont come in

                                     frank
                         yes stay there ill be with you in 
                         a minute

               larry and frank trade blows

               frank lands a powerful blow to larrys jaw it straightens 
               larry up and frank slams the flat of his hand against his 
               brothers chest

               larry flies backwards he flings out his arm to balance 
               himself but he is nearer to the wall than he thinks and the 
               impetus of his fall drives his arm onto the knives

               larry cries out frank grins and prepares to force his wounded 
               brother completely onto the knives

               suddenly kirsty flies across the room at frank and beats at 
               his back with her fists

               frank snarls and without turning around completely flings 
               her away from him kirsty goes flying but lands just safely 
               short of the deadly walls

               larry in the pause kirsty gave him and galvanized by her 
               example has found more strength he pulls his arm painfully 
               forward clear of the knives and throws himself to the side 
               forcing frank onto the knives with a vicious push larry 
               impales his brother completely

               frank howls loud and long

               without pausing larry pulls a knife free from the wall and 
               with one vicious slice separates himself from his brother

               larry rushes to kirsty and helps her to her feet they 
               embrace

               there is a cry of horror offcamera we pull out tiffany 
               has followed her friend she stares in shock at larrys 
               wounded arm and at the impaled frank

               int the centre of hell

               julia is being given more glimpses of the transforming 
               malahide

               the major surgery seems to be complete there are no spinning 
               blades of needles in sight as the gashes open malahides 
               head is completely bald and his face like the rest of his 
               skin is blue the only new sophistications are that his upper 
               and lower eyelids have been stretched wide and stapled to 
               his face and forehead and that a new mouth has been sliced 
               into what was his cheek before his features were pulled 
               permanently to one side

               over the sound of leviathans breath and the cenobite 
               machinery still at work on malahide franks howl is heard

               julias head turns to the direction of this new sound

                                     julia
                         frank

               she turns away without a backward glance and moves back into 
               the corridors

               int the knife room

               frank is still impaled on the knives but his anguished howl 
               has become small whimpers of complaint with given his 
               history with the cenobites perhaps the tiniest note of 
               pleasure in there too

               kirsty larry and tiffany are now gathered together to one 
               side of the room near the door that leads to the corridor 
               they should leave but a kind of sick fascination keeps them 
               watching frank

               frank realises only leverage will pull him free of the knives 
               and lifts his forearms up as much as they are free to

               he turns his palms to face the knives and with a growl of 
               selfencouragement drives them deeply onto the knives so 
               that he can begin to push the rest of his impaled body 
               backwards

               it takes several seconds and much pain for him to succeed 
               but succeed he does he flops backwards into the room

               several of the knives have stayed in him rather than the 
               wall  his chest is decorated or armed with many blades

               just as frank begins to stand and just as larry and the 
               girls snap out of it and are about to leave the door from 
               the conveyor belt room opens and julia walks into the room

               kirsty and larry gasp frank gives a slow smile

                                     julia
                         well well all my family together 
                         again how very sweet

                                     frank
                              delightedflattered
                         julia

                                     julia
                              flatly
                         frank

                                     frank
                         i knew youd come

                                     julia
                         you knew

                                     frank
                         yes youre a girl who remembers her 
                         promises

                                     julia
                         oh i do i do

               frank grins his grin taking in larry kirsty and tiffany as 
               well as julia he extends an arm to julia

                                     frank
                         and i know how much i mean to you 
                         come here

               julia does not move

                                     frank
                         come here kiss me and then

               he glances meaningfully at the others perhaps stroking a 
               blade of one of the knives in his chest

                                     frank
                         well have a real family reunion

               suddenly surprisingly larry laughs he is genuinely amused

                                     larry
                         jesus christ frank i dont believe 
                         you you dont know her at all do 
                         you you still think youre in charge

               julia still has not moved

                                     frank
                         of course i am she belongs to me

               julia begins to cross the room to him

                                     kirsty
                         for gods sake he killed you

               julia doesnt pause frank grins

                                     frank
                         shes forgiven me that havent you

               julia is now next to him

                                     julia
                         do you really need to ask

               frank laughs

                                     frank
                         show them

               julia glances at the knives frank shrugs

                                     frank
                         just a small inconvenience babe

               julia shifts position so she is standing behind him she 
               wraps her arms around him one stroking his belly the other 
               across his shoulders frank leans his head back and twists 
               it slightly

               they kiss

               julia removes her arm from his stomach and slips it behind 
               him

               nothing happens for a second and then suddenly franks 
               whole body spasms we almost think it may be with pleasure 
               until he breaks from the kiss and we see the confused 
               expression on his face  and the blood bubbling at his mouth

               there is a ripping bursting sound and julias hand emerges 
               from his chest covered in his blood clutched in her hand 
               is his ruptured still pumping heart

                                     larry
                         jesus out out

               he shepherds the girls quickly through the door to the 
               corridor

               franks body begins to twitch julia holds it tightly

               int corridorslabyrinth

               they reach the end of the corridor it terminates in a t 
               junction

               tiffany automatically heads in one direction kirsty makes 
               to follow but larry hesitates

                                     larry
                         wait a minute why are we following 
                         her who is this

                                     kirsty
                         this is tiffany

               kirsty shrugs

                                     kirsty
                         shes good at puzzles

                                     larry
                         fine

               they take the turn tiffany has indicated

               int the knife room

               julia still holds frank tight

               slowly she raises the hand which holds his heart until it 
               is in front of his face franks eyes are glassing over but 
               he can still see

                                     julia
                         nothing personal babe

               without ceremony she bursts the heart with one quick squeeze

               int the centre of hell

               larry kirsty and tiffany come running toward the camera

               initially oblivious to the fact that the corridor they were 
               running along has widened and the walls retreated suddenly 
               they come to a stunned halt together staring ahead of them 
               with awestruck faces

                                     kirsty
                         oh my god

               the camera moves around them to take in what they see they 
               are of course in the central chamber of leviathan

               leviathan is spinning again the black beams flying around 
               the chamber

               tiffany screams kirsty grabs her

                                     kirsty
                         tiffany listen youve solved it 
                         but weve got to solve it the other 
                         way see see weve got to get out

               tiffany is frozen

                                     larry
                         come on

               leviathan spins the beams fly

                                     kirsty
                         please tiffany please get us out 
                         take us home please

               tiffany nods they are just about to leave when leviathan 
               stops spinning

               a large beam flies down carrying an object which lands on 
               the catwalk before the humans who all take a step or two 
               backwards

               the beam withdraws

               the object at first resembles a large and bloody plastic 
               bag but then internal movement begins to rip at this 
               covering hands appear out of the rips and complete the 
               removal we realise that the baglike thing was a kind of 
               caul a membranous afterbirth that some creatures produce 
               their young in

               the thing inside completes its escape and stands clear of 
               the shredded caul like a newborn child it is stained and 
               soiled with amniotic fluids and blood but it is not a new 
               born child

               it is a new cenobite and it used to be malahide the 
               transformation we caught glimpses of is now complete its 
               skin is entirely blue its head entirely bald the decorative 
               wounds and tortures we saw being applied are all present  
               its flesh is peeled back in various places its features are 
               threaded and distorted by wire its eyelids are stapled 
               open

               for a second it stands and regards the humans before it

               tiffany gasps in recognition

               kirsty too knows what it was

                                     kirsty
                         malahide

               for some reason kirsty draws from her pocket the photo she 
               took from the obsession room she stares at it

                                     kirsty
                         jesus christ of course

               the malahide cenobite stretches its arms and flexes its 
               fingers

                                     malahide
                         and to think i hesitated

               it looks at the humans again its gaze finally settling on 
               the still shocked tiffany

                                     malahide
                         tiffany come i have a whole new 
                         world of puzzles for you to enjoy

               it reaches out its hand to her

                                     malahide
                         a whole new world of pleasures for 
                         you to endure

               tiffany confused and used to obeying her doctors voice 
               tentatively stretches out her arm to meet the malahide 
               cenobites

               larry suddenly walks between tiffany and malahide the 
               expression on his face is strange it is not fear nor 
               defiance

               it is simpler than that he is really really pissed off

                                     larry
                         no ive had enough of this shit  
                         who the hell are you

                                     kirsty
                         its

               larry waves a hand at her but keeps his eyes on malahide

                                     larry
                         never mind never mind

               he points a finger at malahides face which is attempting a 
               version of pinheads imposing glacial stars but frankly 
               isnt quite making it

                                     larry
                         fuck you and the horse you rode in 
                         on

               suddenly he forms a fist with his unwounded arm and smashes 
               it straight into malahides face malahide is completely 
               decked

               larry grabs tiffany by the shoulders and speaks urgently to 
               her

                                     larry
                         ok youve done it before you can 
                         do it again get us out of here

               the three of them run back up the catwalk

               leviathan spins wildly and a myriad of black beams flow from 
               it

               as they shine into the catwalk they become limbs like those 
               that captured malahide but all with different tips some 
               are organic vicious mouths some are hooks or blades some 
               are faces some are as if leviathan is too angry to be 
               thinking straight beautiful flowers

               the limbs fly up the catwalk but the humans have gained too 
               great a start the limbs retract rapidly into the black 
               lights

               malahide staggers to his feet just as leviathan redirects 
               its energy into forming and projecting one much fatter limb  
               it is dirty pink and segmented like a vast earthworm the 
               end peels back as it flies toward malahide revealing a cruel 
               metallic and rapidlyspinning surgical saw

               just as malahide stands up straight the limb smashes into 
               the back of his skull there is a distressing whirring noise 
               as the limb seals itself fleshily to malahides skull and 
               the former surgeon twitches and dances in horrible involuntary 
               movements as leviathan takes over what little mind remains

               int corridorslabyrinth

               kirsty tiffany and larry are running tiffany making the 
               decisions as to direction

               down one corridor blades and knives jut out from the opposite 
               walls at random intervals and they have to weave at high 
               speed between them they negotiate the corridor successfully 
               but just as kirsty bringing up the rear emerges from it 
               she stumbles and halffalls the restructured box falls 
               from her pocket and rolls back a few feet up the corridor

               tiffany who is nearest to her helps her to her feet and 
               as she does so catches sight of the box or white diamond 
               as it is now she makes as it to go and get it kirsty holds 
               her arm

                                     kirsty
                         no come on we have to get out of 
                         here

               tiffany moves away with kirsty but not without a backward 
               glance and a puzzled expression

               they all make another turning suddenly when they are about 
               halfway down this next corridor a new gap opens up behind 
               them in the wall and a terrible sucking noise is heard  
               corridor debris disappears into the vacuum

               luckily larry has reached the end of the corridor and grasps 
               the corner with one hand seizing kirstys hand with the 
               other  kirsty grabs tiffany and the three of them flatten 
               themselves against the wall fighting against the suction  
               the force is tremendous and larrys finger are slowly losing 
               hold

               int corridorslabyrinth

               close up on a hand picking up the restructured box from the 
               corridor floor they have just left

               int corridorslabyrinth

               the sucking force is growing stronger by the second not 
               only is larrys right hand losing its grip on the edge of 
               the wall but his left arm  stretched tight as it clings 
               to kirsty and via her tiffany  is bleeding profusely 
               again

               suddenly julia appears at the top of the corridor next to 
               larry

               in her hand is the white diamond box that kirsty had let 
               drop

               she stays just out of range of the sucking wind she stares 
               at larrys weakening fingers and smiles

                                     julia
                         oh poor larry you never could hold 
                         on to anything for very long could 
                         you

               suddenly audaciously his face set in a scowl of anger 
               larry lets go of the wall before she realises what is 
               happening he has grabbed julias wrist and pulled her off 
               her feet into the corridor he lets go almost immediately 
               and with a superhuman effort grabs at the corner again before 
               the wind can claim him and the girls

               julia is not so lucky without support or foothold she is 
               seized by the wind and hurtles to the gap in the wall

               she manages to brake herself by flinging her arms out to 
               either side of her for a moment she is hold there and then 
               the pressure begins to draw her in

               in her left hand she still holds the box but her right hand 
               is only a few inches from tiffanys left

               tiffany reaches her hand to her not knowing julia as the 
               others do their fingers just manage to interlock when julias 
               face registers a disbelieving shock

               there is a terrible ripping sound julias new skin so 
               recently gained is giving up its hold and has ripped right 
               up the spine julia is drawn from it

                                     julia
                         noooooooooo

               with a final slurping sound the skinned woman slips from 
               the skin and disappears down the new corridor

               the momentary break in tension allows larry to make one last 
               effort he rounds the corner and pulls the girls after him

               tiffany finally realising what has happened screams in 
               terror and disgust especially when she looks at what she 
               has brought round the corner in her hand she drops julias 
               skin to the floor as the three of them scramble to their 
               feet and begin to run again

               still clutched in the skins hollow fingers is the white 
               diamond box

               as they turn another corner they see very far in the 
               distance a glimmer of light tiffany points excitedly

                                     kirsty
                         my god its her room

                                     larry
                         lets go

               he starts urging the girls down the corridor  a long and 
               very narrow one  but kirsty shows some resistance

                                     kirsty
                         no no theres something wrong

               before they can discuss it a new rushing sound is heard 
               they look back

               hurtling towards them is the engineer from hellraiser

               tiffany screams

                                     larry
                         jesus ok no more arguments just 
                         run

               they begin one last panicfuelled run down the narrow 
               corridor the engineer at their heels

               the sequence is equivalent to kirstys pursuit by the engineer 
               in hellraiser the twist here being that as they approach 
               the entrance into tiffanys room the walls of the corridor 
               already thin begin to close together

               larry is bringing up the rear the corridor is now so narrow 
               only single file is possible and he can almost feel the 
               engineers breath on his neck

                                     larry
                         go go go go go

               finally almost impossibly they reach the gap in the wall  
               tiffany tumbles through then kirsty and finally larry 
               less than a microsecond after larry has made it the walls 
               seal themselves

               int tiffanys room  2nd version  day

               as we see clearly the room they have come into we perhaps 
               share the feeling that kirsty expressed in the corridor 
               something is wrong

               the tiles that make up the floor are patterned as before but 
               the individual tiles are larger the room itself seems more 
               spacious the ceiling higher

               there is a bowl of flowers by the window the flowers were 
               in full bloom before their trip to hell but now they seem 
               long dead

               the audience have to notice most of this for themselves 
               because larry kirsty and tiffany are too relieved by and 
               tired from their escape to take this in immediately larry 
               seats himself in the chair kirsty perches on the end of 
               tiffanys bed tiffany however walks straight across to her 
               window she is the first to notice anything she stares at 
               the flowers

                                     kirsty
                         tiffany

               kirsty rises from the bed and joins tiffany by the window

                                     kirsty
                         but these were daddy

               larry rises to his feet just as he stands a fleeting 
               expression of bewilderment crosses his face he strokes at 
               his right arm with an unconscious gesture as he crosses the 
               room

               kirsty doesnt look at her father right away

                                     kirsty
                         these flowers i saw them just

               she looks at her father a sea of sweat has broken out on 
               his brow and face as he stares intensely at the flowers 
               kirstys voice slows begins to trail off

                                     kirsty
                         the day before yesterday 
                         daddy daddy

               larrys eyes close his entire face screws up as if an 
               excruciating pain just hit him he clamps his arm across his 
               chest the hands clutching his shoulders he opens his eyes 
               and looks at kirsty for a second his expression one of 
               surprise

               then his eyes roll up into the sockets and he collapses to 
               the floor

               tiffany has hardly had time to turn from the bowl of flowers 
               before kirsty is kneeling by her father

                                     kirsty
                         daddy

               larry is unconscious tiffany gasps kirsty looks up at her

                                     kirsty
                         get help

               tiffanys eyes widen she rushes to the door and disappears 
               into the corridor within two seconds we hear an emergency 
               alarm go off and tiffany reenters the room

                                     kirsty
                         pass me a pillow

               tiffany does so and kirsty places it under the head of larry 
               whose lips are now blue and who is breathing very shallowly

               kirsty looks up at tiffany despair in her eyes

                                     kirsty
                         what do you do i just dont know 
                         what to do

               tiffany shakes her head helplessly

               suddenly the door to the room flies open and two interns  
               maybe stan and ollie from the carnival sequence  come in 
               complete with stretcher and gurney they assess the situation 
               with a glance and it is serious enough to make one of them 
               break their professional silence

                                     intern
                         coronary arrest lets be quick

               they are good at their job  within seconds larry is secured 
               on the gurney and they head for the door kirsty and tiffany 
               behind them the following exchanges are spoken on the move

                                     kirsty
                         is he going to be ok

                                     intern
                         we just cant say ors on standby 
                         theyll do what they can

                                     kirsty
                         but its bad

               the interns exchange a glance and decide honesty is best

                                     intern
                              gently but flatly
                         yeah its bad

               int elevator  day

               the elevator is uncomfortably full kirsty and tiffany 
               squashed up against the back while the interns hold the gurney 
               in the centre

               the elevator is descending the ride seems to take longer 
               than it should even though they are going to basement level 
               like the look of tiffanys room its almost normal but just 
               different enough to make us slightly uneasy in an unfocused 
               way

               eventually though it does come to a stop tiffany squeezes 
               kirstys shoulder sympathetically note re tiffanys 
               character  it should be clear to the audience by this stage 
               that though she is still mute tiffany is now a responsive 
               more rounded character

               the interns wheel the gurney out of the elevator and the 
               girls follow

               int basement corridor  day

               the basement corridor is long cavernous and not very 
               pleasant it has a grimier more uncaredfor look than the 
               upper floors and the high ceiling is covered with an intricate 
               system of naked pipes and conduits

               the interns wheel larry down this corridor going so fast 
               that kirsty and tiffany are continually breaking into a trot 
               to keep up with them

               at the far and of the corridor are a set of double doors 
               the nearer they all get to these doors the tackier the 
               corridor seems to become the walls now have pipes running 
               over them as well as the ceiling and several of these pipes 
               are dripping water into small pools on the corridor floor 
               the sound of these drips is artificially loud on the 
               soundtrack

               finally the doors are reached and the interns larry kirsty 
               and tiffany disappear through them

               int preop room  day

               this is a small anteroom to the operating room which is 
               beyond a further set of double doors without ceremony the 
               two interns pass straight across this room to those doors 
               and wheel the gurney through one of them throwing back a 
               parting remark to kirsty

                                     intern
                         wait out here a doctor will talk to 
                         you when we know more

               the double doors part and close giving just a glimpse of 
               the operating room beyond all lights monitors and whirring 
               machinery and the several gowned and masked experts attending 
               to larry

               as the doors close kirsty turns to tiffany expecting a 
               long wait before anyone comes to speak to them surprisingly 
               though the doors open again almost immediately and two 
               figures step through they too are masked and gowned in 
               surgical green and very little of them is visible

                                     kirsty
                         is he going to be all right

                                     1st gowned figure
                              matter of factly
                         no hes not going to be all right

               kirsty staggers visibly shocked by this bluntness

                                     kirsty
                         wh

                                     1st gowned figure

                         ruptured aorta hes going to die in 
                         agony

               as he makes this speech the mask of his colleague stains 
               rapidly with blood as if it is literally pouring from its 
               mouth

               simultaneously his own mask is slowly pierced by a score of 
               nails bursting through from beneath

               tiffany screams

               the 1st gowned figure pulls the mask and cap away from its 
               face 

               it is pinhead his colleague does the same it is the female 
               cenobite

                                     kirsty
                         oh fuck

               shes had too much experience with these two to hesitate 
               she grabs tiffanys arm and bursts through the double doors 
               to the corridor

               int basement corridor  day

               we are now looking along the corridor in the other direction  
               back towards the elevator

               kirsty and tiffany come into shot running rapidly along the 
               corridor

               as they make their way a rumbling flatulent sound is heard 
               from the overhead pipes and they all begin to drip blood not 
               water

               we hear the sound of the doors flying open behind them

               kirsty and tiffany reach the elevator kirsty presses 
               frantically on the call button while tiffany looks behind 
               them with frightened eyes

                                     kirsty
                         cmon cmon

               the sound of steadilypacing purposeful feet is heard coming 
               up the corridor getting louder coming closer

               kirsty begins hammering on the closed elevator doors tiffany 
               stifles a cry with her hand

                                     kirsty
                         come on

               suddenly the doors fly open kirsty and tiffany tumble into 
               the elevator

               int basement corridor  day girls pov

               we see the doorframe of the elevator and the floor buttons 
               beside it and looking down the corridor through the open 
               elevator doors pinhead and the female cenobite marching 
               towards us

               we also see kirstys finger jabbing frantically at the floor 
               buttons the doors are not closing the cenobites are getting 
               very close

               finally just as pinhead breaks from his determined but medium 
               paced stride and speeds up eagerly for the last two or three 
               yards extending his arm as he does so the door slams shut 
               across our vision and we hear the elevator machinery start 
               up

               int elevator  day

               kirsty leans against the back wall of the elevator breathing 
               heavily tiffany stands very still in the middle a frozen 
               expression of fear on her face

                                     kirsty
                         faster you bastard faster

               she slams her fist against the elevator wall the elevator 
               stops its lights flicker

                                     kirsty
                         oh jesus im sorry im sorry i 
                         didnt mean it

               the elevator starts again

                                     kirsty
                         its ok they cant beat an elevator 
                         not upstairs itll be ok

               the lift stops but this time its where they want it 
               kirstys finger hesitates over the door open button

                                     kirsty
                         itll be ok

               she presses the button

               int hospital corridor  day girls pov

               we are looking at the closed elevator door when it opens we 
               will be looking down the corridor on the main hospital floor  
               the floor with the girls rooms on

               the door flies open chatterer ii lunges in at them

               kirsty screams but because of the eagerness of his lunge 
               they are able to get around him as his impetus carries him 
               to the back of the elevator

               int hospital corridor  day

               the door begins to close as the girls straighten up in the 
               corridor and as chatterer ii turns around to come back out 
               at them

               he tries to put his hand out to stop the door closing but 
               succeeds only in trapping his fingers in the door

               kirsty as soon as the doors began to close had hit the 
               down button now she squeals with horror as she realises 
               what is about to happen

               the elevator begins to descend  we can tell this because 
               chatterer iis fingers move down to the floor and are then 
               sliced off

               the girls run off down the corridor

                                     kirsty
                         this way short cut

               they turn into a set of double doors leading to a large ward

               int large ward  day

               kirsty and tiffany enter the ward at a run and then slow 
               down to a confused and horrified walk

               every bed in the ward is occupied some by men some by women 
               and every patient has in their hands and is busily working 
               on a lament configuration

               despite this collective workin the boxes obviously still 
               have the vicious characteristics they have previously 
               demonstrated when used individually  as is witnessed by 
               the ten or so patients who are struggling on with their work 
               despite having one or two hooks and chains connecting their 
               flesh to their box

               kirsty and tiffany move slowly down the room a look of 
               incredulity on both their faces

                                     kirsty
                         oh christ this isnt just personal 
                         anymore

               tiffany nods slowly her eyes flicking back and forth across 
               the ward

               suddenly the wheelchair patient from the earlier scene in 
               this ward who has been between two of the beds on one side 
               of the ward cuts across the girls path he too has a box 
               on his lap as he passes in front of them he looks at them 
               giggles in an unmistakably insane fashion and gives them a 
               conspiratorial wink then he simply proceeds to the other 
               side of the ward

               a second or so after this as the girls edge down the middle 
               of the room they hear a rushing sound behind the double 
               doors they are heading towards

               suddenly the doors slam open and revealed in the doorway is 
               malahide

               but he is not standing there he is hovering about two feet 
               off the floor the umbilical limb that connects him to 
               leviathan is still at the back of his skull his face is 
               contorted in a grin of manic glee as he floats three or four 
               feet into the ward

                                     malahide
                         the doctor is in

               he laughs and the sound is far from human kirsty and tiffany 
               stare at him

                                     tiffany
                         oh shit

               kirsty looks sharply at tiffany for a second as if she is 
               about to comment on her refound voice but instead simply 
               nods she takes her friends hand and the girls begin to 
               walk very slowly backwards to the far end of the ward

               malahide is too enraptured of his new power to pay attention 
               to specific victims and so makes no move to stop the girls 
               slow retreat

               suddenly his palms erupt into a writhing mass of tentacle
               like limbs as his head tips back to emit a wide band of 
               leviathans black light at the ceiling accompanied by 
               renewed inhuman laughter

               taking this as their cue the girls turn and bolt for the 
               doors at the far and of the ward and exit through them

               the limbs extrude from malahides palms only twelve inches 
               or so and are all quite thin but they all have independent 
               movement and they all have various surgicallike gleaming 
               tips malahide floats over to the nearest bed he looks at 
               the patient and then looks at the bladed tips of his new 
               limbs and as if addressing them speaks

                                     malahide
                         i recommend amputation

               there is another burst of laughter as the limbs fly at the 
               patient writhing twitching slashing and slicing

               int hospital corridor  day

               the girls run wildly along the corridor not knowing malahide 
               is working his way through his former patients they come to 
               another door and pause they look back down the corridor to 
               ensure they are not visible as they hide and kirsty pushes 
               the door open with the flat of her hand behind her carefully 
               still looking down the corridor they back into the room and 
               let the door close

               int hospitaltorture room  day

               close up on the girls faces as the door closes in front of 
               them kirsty lets out a breath then they hear the rattling 
               sound behind them they swing round and the camera pulls out 
               to take in the room

               it is like the torture room in hellraiser the walls are 
               black the floor slimy and the room filled with chains 
               hooks and torturepillars and in the room and staring at 
               the girls are the four cenobites

               pinhead glances theatrically around the room as if checking 
               something

                                     pinhead
                         oh no boxes such a shame

                                     female cenobite
                         no more delays kirsty no more 
                         teasing time to play

                                     pinhead
                         time to play

               kirsty looks at his unforgiving face and then her eyes 
               suddenly widen as she thinks of something

                                     kirsty
                         wait

                                     pinhead
                         no more deals kirsty its your 
                         flesh we want to experience not 
                         your skill at bargaining

                                     kirsty

                         and your suffering will be legendary 
                         even in hell

               carefully making no fast movements kirsty reaches into her 
               pocket where she placed the photograph from malahides 
               obsession room she brings out the picture that she realized 
               earlier was of pinhead and hands it to him

               he takes hold of it and looks his face registering nothing

                                     pinhead
                         what is this someone else you think

                         you are you were human remember 
                         remember all your confusions think

               the female cenobite strides across the room

                                     female cenobite
                         enough

               she raises her hand towards kirsty pinheads arm flies out 
               and stops her

                                     pinhead
                         wait

               he is staring at the photograph that great immobile brow 
               finally puckering as if something is stirring

                                     pinhead
                         i remember

                                     kirsty
                         you were all human

               the other three cenobites stop moving and stare at kirsty 
               any advances they were making on kirsty or tiffany stop as 
               the same dim distant recollection begins to stir within 
               them

               suddenly the door bursts open malahide is there still 
               floating his voice still a mixture of hideous threat and 
               insane joy

                                     malahide
                         tiffany come

               he turns his palms downwards mirroring his gesture in the 
               hall of mirrors

               tiffany lets out a moan of terror and shakes her head

               one of the snakelike limbs from malahides palms flies 
               towards tiffanys face before anybody can react its scalpel 
               tip has sliced an inch or so off several strands of her hair

                                     malahide
                         tiffany come

               kirsty throws her arms around the cowering tiffany and snarls 
               at her tormentor

                                     kirsty
                         leave her alone you asshole

               malahide makes no reply but suddenly several more limbs fly 
               towards the girls and begin to weave in front of kirstys 
               face like snakes awaiting their moment

               at this stage the camera cuts to the watching pinhead he 
               lets the photograph of his past life flutter to the floor

               malahide looks up at the tiny noise this makes and his eyes 
               meet pinheads he turns more fully to face pinhead and the 
               other cenobites who are now standing with their leader and 
               a strange smile crosses his face

                                     malahide
                         oh good a fight

               suddenly the air is full of flying chains malahide is hooked 
               everywhere it is like a highspeed version of franks final 
               recapture in hellraiser the chains start tugging almost 
               instantly

               is malahide about to be ripped apart

               with contemptuous dismissive speed the limbs that ooze 
               from malahides palms have sliced the chains to pieces and 
               almost before we have time to realise that three of them 
               have lengthened thickened and hardened and have skewered 
               the female cenobite chatterer ii and butterball to the 
               walls

               the three limbs detatch themselves from malahide the three 
               cenobites are all well above the floor pinned and twitching 
               like the rats in franks attic

               as they die they suddenly revert there are three human 
               corpses on the walls of the room a woman a fat man and a 
               little boy

               malahide smiles be looks at pinhead again and advances 
               suddenly a heavy torture pillar smashes into him knocking 
               him slightly offbalance

               pinhead is backing across the room weaving pillars in front 
               of him as he moves malahide moves forward knocking them 
               out of the way as each pillar is knocked aside pinheads 
               face is more and more human finally when the face we see 
               is nearly that of the english officer from the opening he 
               turns his head slightly away from the advancing malahide and 
               finds kirstys eyes a look passes between them 
               understanding gratitude friendship

               whatever emotion lies beneath it it is clearly a cue and 
               kirsty and tiffany make a break for it bursting through the 
               door simultaneously to this malahide and pinhead find each 
               others eyes a final time for a second everything is still 
               then a single bladed limb flies across the space between 
               them and neatly and calmly slices pinheads throat open the 
               thin red line becomes a torrent of blood and the former lord 
               of hell falls dead at the feet of his successor

               int hospital corridor  day

               kirsty and tiffany burst out into the corridor and almost 
               fall over the patient in the wheelchair

                                     patient
                         so what girls its ok for an ego
                         trip but it doesnt got the job done

               shaking their heads at the insanity they run up the corridor

               tiffany looks slightly distracted and when she speaks it is 
               half to herself

                                     tiffany
                         i have to go back or itll never 
                         stop

                                     kirsty
                              confused
                         what are you talking

                                     tiffany
                              to herself
                         ive got to finish it

                                     kirsty
                         finish what

               even as kirsty says this tiffany has moved past her and is 
               resuming her run down the corridor

                                     kirsty
                         tiffany wait

               kirsty starts after her friend

               they turn back into the main section of the corridor that 
               contains their own rooms tiffany still four or five yards 
               in front of kirsty

               tiffany reaches her room the door is open she goes in a 
               second later kirsty follows

               int tiffanys room  day

               kirsty enters the room it is as we last saw it except that 
               the walls have reparted to give onto the corridors of hell

               carefully and slowly kirsty moves across to the entrance 
               and looks down it she is rewarded with the sight of tiffany 
               just disappearing at the far end of the first corridor with 
               a grimace kirsty follows her in

               int corridorlabyrinth

               tiffanys skill at finding her way through puzzles means the 
               girls are soon in the murkier corridors close to the centre

               hell seems angrier now steam is issuing in jets from the 
               corridor walls the cries of children are heard faintly on 
               the soundtrack leviathans breathing is more dominant 
               perhaps the light is even pulsing in time with it

               kirsty is still several yards behind tiffany tiffany takes 
               a corner and is out of sight for a second or so kirsty dashes 
               around the corner to find tiffany staring with distress at 
               something on the floor

               it is the skin ripped off julia by the vacuum tunnel earlier

                                     kirsty
                         oh gross

               tiffany bends down and retrieves the white diamond box from 
               the empty fingers

                                     kirsty
                         what are you doing what are we doing

               tiffany looks at the box in her hand when she speaks it is 
               not to kirsty but to herself

                                     tiffany
                         i cant do it here i have to go to 
                         it

               int the centre of hell

               leviathan spins and fires light in the centre his machine
               like breathing drowning all other sound we are looking down 
               the catwalk as kirsty and tiffany approach its edge

               the beams of black light wash across their faces as they 
               passed over malahides in the earlier scene images of horror 
               freeze momentarily before them and then pass on only to be 
               replaced by others

                                     tiffany
                         im scared

                                     kirsty
                         no dont let it youve come this 
                         far

               the girls press on whether leviathan is oblivious to their 
               presence or simply doesnt consider them a threat the beams 
               stop striking the girls faces nevertheless the mood remains 
               ominous the audience should feel something is about to 
               happen

               they are six feet from the lip of the catwalk tiffany kneels 
               and holding the white diamond box in front of her begins 
               to move her fingers over it the music box tune begins to 
               play as the box begins to move

               that something that the audience was waiting to happen 
               suddenly does malahide flies up from the abyss beside the 
               catwalk the vastness of the limb that seals him to leviathan 
               is now directly apparent instead of merging into black light 
               the limb itself trails through the air over the huge distance 
               to leviathan itself

               one of the limbs from malahides palms flies out and knocks 
               the box from tiffanys hands it rolls perilously close to 
               the edge of the catwalk

               kirsty grabs tiffany and dragging her to her feet pulls 
               her further back down the catwalk as malahide floats to a 
               landing between them and the box

                                     malahide
                         ah girls and how are we feeling 
                         today

               the blades on the end of his limbs twitch eagerly

                                     malahide
                         you have your whole lives behind you 
                         now

               the limbs fly forward kirsty screams and both girls run up 
               the catwalk

               about halfway back up however tiffany stops turns around 
               and begins to walk back kirsty calls out

                                     kirsty
                         tiffany no

               the camera stays with tiffany as she makes her way back 
               kirstys voice stays on the soundtrack for a time imploring 
               her friend to turn back and then simply stops this should 
               be abrupt enough to make the audience notice but smooth enough 
               to avoid their attention leaving tiffany

               malahide waits happy to see a patient so keen on the knife

               very slowly tiffany moves forward inch by slow inch this 
               is something she has to do the expression on her face is 
               not determination but terror and malahide is very happy to 
               encourage this

                                     malahide
                         surgery is open tiffany what was 
                         todays agenda

               his scalpels flick in the air making small slicing motions

                                     malahide
                         ah yes evisceration

               still tiffany comes forward closer and closer until she is 
               surely close enough to be grabbed

               suddenly she is grabbed but from behind and by a human 
               hand

               tiffany gasps and turns to see who has seized her she 
               screams

               it is julia

               the limbs retract into malahides palms he smiles

                                     julia
                         doctor ive missed you

               julia having presumably just replaced her skin is not quite 
               as perfect as before there are bloody lines like scars 
               beneath her ears and chin as if the skin required some 
               adjustment before being put on

               julia moves forward her left arm still holding tiffany her 
               smile returning malahides

                                     malahide
                         i knew youd come back

                                     julia
                         im a girl who keeps her promises

               julia is right next to malahide now smoothly she releases 
               her grip on tiffany and embraces malahide sensuously he 
               returns the embrace they kiss

               unseen tiffany moves to the edge of the catwalk and picks 
               up the box her fingers move over it finding its solution 
               suddenly leviathans breath becomes a roar of anger and 
               fear

               malahide breaks away from his kiss his face a mixture of 
               confusion and rage julia plants both hands in the middle of 
               his chest and pushes he falls over the lip of the catwalk 
               but almost before he drops from sight he is suddenly pulled 
               backwards through the air screaming as leviathans limb 
               retracts julia jumps back shouting

                                     julia
                         do it tiffany do it

               tiffanys fingers fly over the box and suddenly we see what 
               is happening the mountainlike leviathan is following the 
               movements of the small replica in tiffanys hands as tiffany 
               inverts the new configuration back towards a closed box 
               leviathan too is being twisted and turned being closed

               the whole centre of hell shakes as if suffering a mild 
               earthquake julia and tiffany almost lose their footing but 
               tiffany continues working she is nearly there leviathan 
               is halfway between its white diamond majesty and a huge 
               closed box

               tiffany takes her hands from the box it is done the larger 
               box operates a few seconds behind its control so that we 
               can intercut the final sliding and creaking into position 
               with the following human drama as leviathan makes its final 
               closing the mild tremors of before become larger hell shakes 
               violently and this time tiffany does lose her footing she 
               looks set to tumble into the vast abyss to the side of the 
               catwalk but just manages to catch hold of the edge with one 
               hand the small box flies from her hand and hurtles down 
               into the miles of blackness below tiffany dangles over the 
               edge her feet kicking wildly for a foothold that doesnt 
               exist

               suddenly a hand extends to her she looks up it is julia 
               for a second nothing happens

                                     julia
                         trust me

               tiffany lifts one hand off the edge and grabs at julias 
               proffered wrist

               julia begins to pull up and for a moment it seems the crisis 
               is over then a terrible and familiar ripping noise is heard 
               the skin of the arm that tiffany clings to begins to rip 
               free at the shoulder gradually like a shirts threads 
               unraveling it comes off tiffanys weight pulls it clear 
               like a very long and very tasteless evening glove and it 
               seems she will finally make the long drop at the final 
               second as the armskin comes off the entire skin flies 
               from the body and falls with its arm into the abyss tiffany 
               screams she is going to die

               but suddenly the two arms that have just lost their skin fly 
               out again and catch her fingers tiffany is hauled over the 
               edge and staggers to her feet staring into the bloodied 
               face of kirsty who had donned julias skin to help her 
               friend

               the two girls share a quick and joyous embrace and then run 
               rapidly up the catwalk the camera stays with leviathan

               the rumbling stops and the mountainous box creaks into its 
               final sealed position

                                                                  fade out

               fade in

               int recovery room  day

               close up on a bowl of beautiful flowers sitting on a shelf 
               in the recovery room

               the camera tracks out to let us see larry pale drawn but 
               basically okay in the rooms single bad he is wired up to 
               various drips and monitors

               sunlight is flooding into the room from a window and the 
               camera continues its track up to and through this window to

               ext hospital main entrance  day

               kirsty is kissing tiffany on the cheek tiffany is dressed 
               in smart clothes and has a small traveling bag in her hand

                                     kirsty
                         so whatre you going to do open up 
                         a gamesshop somewhere sell jigsaw 
                         puzzles

               tiffany gives a smile

                                     tiffany
                         oh yeah

               there is a slightly awkward pause

                                     kirsty
                         well gbye

                                     tiffany
                         its been hell

               they share a rueful knowing smile like the smile of soldiers 
               back from a war who say goodbye on a dockside and know they 
               will never meet again

               tiffany turns and walks down the long path to the hospital 
               gates kirsty watches her for a few moments and then turns 
               and reenters the institute

               the camera tracks back to the window of the recovery room 
               and we watch through the window as kirsty enters the room 
               she bends to kiss her fathers cheek larry slips an arm 
               around her shoulders and they embrace the camera moves away 
               again

               int hallway  malahides house  day

               the camera tracks slowly up malahides hallway the hallway 
               is lined with packing cases filled with items from the house 
               a workman is shoving something into one of the cases as the 
               camera moves past him he speaks

                                     workman
                         so whose was all this shit

               the camera reaches the doorway of the obsession room as an 
               answering voice is heard

                                     2nd workman
                         not our problem

               the track continues into 

               int obsession room  day

               and we see the 2nd workman he is crouching over the mattress 
               which is still in the middle of the floor of the otherwise 
               empty room

                                     2nd workman
                         gimme a hand with this

               almost faster than the eye can register it a hand shoots 
               out from the mattress and grabs his wrist

               he has about half a second to issue a strangled shout and 
               then hideously quickly a matter of two seconds or so his 
               body is drained of all life and the dried husk collapses to 
               the floor

               the first workman appears hurriedly in the doorway and then 
               freezes an awestruck expression on his face

               julia is rising headfirst and upright from the centre of 
               the mattress the movement is smooth magical unsettling 
               it is graceful but not slow

               julia is fully fleshed fully skinned and fully dressed 
               she is in a replica of the dress malahide bought for her 
               but this one is jet black she looks fabulous

               as the workman stands openmouthed her feet clear the 
               mattress

               but they dont stop there she slows to a graceful halt about 
               six inches above the mattress she stretches and flexes her 
               arms sensually than her head swivels and her excited aroused 
               eyes meet those of the workman

                                     julia
                         im julia love me

               suddenly her head tips back and accompanied by julias 
               delighted laughter a wide beam of hells black light flies 
               at the ceiling from her open mouth instantaneously it spills 
               across the ceiling and falls like a fountain of blood across 
               the screen

               complete blackness

               the credits roll

                                         the end
