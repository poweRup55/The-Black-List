               kroenen pulls out a doubleended blade it spins like a 
               giant bone saw slicing across the statue

               no apparent damage until crackkkkk a diagonal line appears 
               and the top half falls

               kroenen reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and 
               winds himself up

               ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and 
               removes a large reliquary jar containing golden sand

               six guards hurry in they point their flashlights and guns 
               at kroenen

                                     guard 1

               kroenen starts shaking as if in a seizure and readies two 
               twin blades

               bullet tears into kroenens arm spewing forth an explosion 
               of dust he turns the guards shoot again kroenen maneuvers 
               the steel deflecting the bullets which 

                ricochet wildly  and finally hit three of the guards 
               they fall silently to the floor

               kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives

               the last guard raises his gun

               by an unseen force

               the flesh on his neck pushes upwards held by an invisible 
               force he starts floating in midair

               the blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows 
               red and amber they outline a figure formerly submerged in 
               shadows grigory he gestures with both hands as if holding 
               an imaginary doll

               his arm muscles twitch under his skin shifting changing 
               gaining strength

               with a quick gesture grigory twists the lower and upper parts 
               of the guards body in opposite directions

               with a wet crunch the guards shadow on the wall goes limp 
               grigory looks at ilsa

                                     grigory
                         ready the welcome my love 

               ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto 
               the floor

                         essence of sammael the hell hound 
                         the seed of destruction

               grigory slices the air with his open hand creating fleeting 
               glyphs and a small black flame dances on his open palm 
               he deposits it in midair at the center of the circle

               then the sand begins to move like liquid mercury lines 
               fuse into a pile it melts and bubbles growing and foaming 
               bones are formed tendons and ligaments join together 
               growing growing into sammael

               subway ads he lands in a shower of glass and debris on a 
               wooden bench breaking it in two

               sammael climbs up into the mezzanine

               hellboy gets up  his back bristling with glass shards  
               and hears a wail a young girl is pointing at a box of kittens 
               abandoned on a bench

                                     yound girl

               sammael charges hellboy scoops up the box holds it high 
               using his bone blade sammael pulverizes the bench

               next sammael slashes at hellboy scattering a dozen shrieking 
               citizens

               illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps hellboy advances 
               blood dripping from his forehead and nose

               hellboy starts to reload but  sammaels tongue shoots 
               out hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and  traps 
               the tongue with his stone hand 

                                     hellboy
                         second date no tongue

                while catching the box with his tail the kittens are 
               fine

               using the tongue he throws sammael out a glass window

               sammael dangles above the tracks but he rejoints himself 
               and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel 
               from here he pulls on hellboy sliding him toward the jagged 
               glass

               sammael pulls harder enters the tunnel

               hellboy fights to free himself but his sweaty face is 
               millimeters away from being sliced by the glass all seems 
               lost when

               whaaaaa a train appears out of nowhere heading straight 
               for sammael

               it splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on 
               sammaels body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks

                                     hellboy
                              to manning
                         crap this guy moves like a cockroach 

               hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab

               int  hexagonal stone lab  day

               hellboys footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor 
               manning moves along behind him

               the record finishes playing silence 

               swish kroenens whirling blades slice the air ripping 
               into mannings arm as kroenen goes in for the kill  

                hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield kroenen 
               bears down but hellboy fends him off with powerful deliberate 
               blocks

               kroenen hauls out one of his long swords

                                     hellboy
                         screw that

               hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig bammmm 
               he punches kroenen in the face crumpling the steel mask 
               smashing its lenses

                                     hellboy
                         you killed my father 

               bammm another hit

               kroenen staggers back with each blow finally the mask falls 
               off

                                     hellboy
                         give your soul to god your ass is 
                         mine

               an asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face kroenen is 
               laughing

               int hexagonal trap door pit  day

               bam under his feet a huge trapdoor falls open he and 
               manning drop through along with the phonograph

               hellboy grabs a rope it spins through a copper pulley but 
               a large knot jerks him to a stop hellboy snatches mannings 
               hand but loses his backpack

               he looks down the phonograph hits the ground with a crash

                                     manning
                              panting whispers
                         well its not that big a fall

               klangggg the entire bottom bristles with sixfoot 
               sparkling steel blades

               int above the hexagonal trap door pit  day

               kroenen cautiously leans over the pit he cant hear a sound

               as he peeks  swish a loop of the rope wraps around his 
               neck and yanks him forward before he goes over he 
               frantically digs his blades into the floor anchoring himself

               int hexagonal trap door pit  day

               hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso 
               manning clings to his powerful back as he climbs up hand 
               over hand

               int above the hexagonal trap door pit  day

               kroenen goes to cut the rope

               int hexagonal trap door pit  day

                                     hellboy
                              reaching the top
                         oh no you dont 

               hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and with a 
               brutal stonefist yank pulls kroenen into the pit

               with a horrible scream kroenen drops headfirst past them 
               and onto the spikes he wriggles like a fish caught on a 
               hook only making it worse as he slides further down the 
               blades

               int above the hexagonal trap door pit  day

               hellboy climbs out and sits sees kroenens blade embedded 
               in the floor holding it the prosthetic hand still ticking

               int above the hexagonal trap door pit  day

               hellboy peers down still alive kroenen frees one arm 
               slicing through his own ropy bicep

                                     hellboy

               int bottom of hexagonal trap door pit  day

               hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge kroenen emits 
               a horrid scream as it crushes him

               int above the hexagonal trap door pit  day

               manning sits down bandaging his injuries hellboy kneels 
               down

                                     hellboy

               manning nods weakly hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up 
               his zippo

                                     hellboy

               just ahead a cavein pieces of ceiling timber coffins 
               and corpses form a chaotic barrier as they squeeze past

                                     myers

               a few bones roll by wet earth drops onto their shoulders 
               they draw their arms close to their bodies pointing their 
               flashlight beams straight down a moment of strange intimacy

               eggs

               sammael is there gnawing on a dry arm bone with the hand 
               still attached when the light hits his face his milky pupils 
               constrict a snarl

               a second sammael emerges from the water it shakes itself 
               off a third one raise its head

               myers and liz try to back away but a metal wall rises right 
               behind them klankkkkk they are trapped

               dust and rocks fall from above the four identical creatures 
               move in on liz and myers myers shoots one in the head three 
               times the creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with 
               pebbles

               one of them springs as it flies through the air hellboy 
               crashes through the ceiling he lands on top of it along 
               with a ton or two of stone the creature is crushed

               clamps onto hellboys back the other onto his leg hellboy 
               howls the third one joins in like lions dragging down a 
               zebra this time though the zebra fights back

               a beat of silence then myers slaps her across the face 
               once hard the heat ripple builds the air vibrates around 
               her her pupils kick back light like an animals

                                     liz
                         go now

               myers ducks behind a rock as lizs arms blaze with fire

               the two approaching sammaels are ready to pounce

               on top of hellboy one of them turns its head like a lion 
               hearing the hunters gunshots a staggering hellboy sees 
               lizs body shake in a surge of whitehot energy

               the water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of

               the fire engulfs the creatures devours them all

               int tunnel b  underground tunnel cavern area   day

               the screen fades to white and then

               silence then a pulse a high ringing tone a heartbeat

               hellboy pushes away the halfcooked remains of two sammaels 
               the other creatures are little more than blackened bones he 
               stumbles forward no water left everything is halfburied 
               in a cracked bonedry bed of mud liz lies on the ground 
               on her side unconscious

               myers is alive but too groggy to even acknowledge it weakly 
               hellboy turns around in the eerie silence of his deafness 
               he sees grigory  laughing noiselessly witness to an absurd 
               comedy

               ilsa approaches and  in a simple brutal move  hits him 
               with a hammer

               int catacombs  night

               hellboys stone arm glows ancient symbols of fire burn the 
               stone flames momentarily engulf his body

               int catacombs  night

               hellboy roars as his horns majestically burst forth out of 
               his mouth energy and light boil like condensing breath on a 
               winters night

               inebriated with power the new prince of hell smiles with 
               supreme arrogance his shadow falls on the white marble of 
               the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone 
               turns black as obsidian

                                     myers
                         no dont do it listen to me

               hellboy inserts his enormous paw into the first imprint on 
               the stone slab  clack he turns it like a lock

               a beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky

               ext view from the city  night

               visible from all over moscow the beam blazes to the moon 
               the same phenomenon as in the prologue but this time its 
               more intense with ripples and haloes

               int the other side  night

               again the infinite starry space again the ogdru jahad 
               the ruby beam pierces the darkness

               int catacombs  night

               hellboy watches as the first imprint disappears in its place 
               a burning glyph

               myers struggles with his bindings the rough hemp cuts his 
               skin but he manages to free one hand

               ext on the other side  night

               ogdru jahad shifts suddenly breaking free gelatinous limbs 
               uncurl expand its enormity puzzles the eye obscuring the 
               frame

               int catacombs  night

               hellboy thrusts his hand into the second imprint clack he 
               turns it

               myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it 

               int the sky  night

               in the storm clouds lightning illuminates gargantuan 
               tentacles reaching into the earthly plane

               int catacombs  night

               grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs

                                     grigory
                         the final seal open it

               hellboy puts his hand inside clack before he can turn 
               it myers reaches the rosary ilsa lunges at him he clobbers 
               her full in the face she staggers back and down

                              to hellboy
                         remember who you are

               he throws the rosary at hellboy instinctively hellboy 
               catches it it smokes in his hand

               he tosses it away it lands next to the explosive belts

               hellboy opens his palm seeing the smoking charred imprint 
               of the cross and beads he looks over at grigory

               with a bloodcurdling scream hellboy grabs his horns with 
               both hands brutally snaps them off energy spews from the 
               stumps

               he stabs grigory with one of them grigory drops to his knees 
               holding his stomach hellboy drops the bloodstained horn

               the final lock disappears into the stone the light flickers 
               and the connection with the moon is broken

               ilsa licking her bloody lips looks up the sky is silent 
               the thunderclouds are parting the eclipse has ended

               grigory crumples in agony

               the burning glyphs in hellboys stone hand dim down his 
               features and body resume their usual shape all is quiet

                                     grigory
                         you will never fulfill your destiny 
                         you will never understand the power 
                         inside you

                                     hellboy

               he breaks myers chains helps him up

               int catacombs  night

               hellboy painfully takes lizs limp body in his arms myers 
               stands by his side

               he kisses her forehead caresses her hair then walks down 
               the steps

               myers steps on something he looks under his foot a smashed 
               glass eye then out of the silence a whisper

                                     grigory
                         child

                                     grigory
                              dying
                         look what youve done 

               he looks up in his empty eye socket fleshy tendrils shift 
               lazily

                                     grigory
                         youve killed me  an insignificant 
                         man but you have brought forth a 
                         god

               he uncovers his abdomen long fleshy pseudopods spill out 
               of the wound like intestines

               a large entity erupts from grigorys torso and claws the 
               air

                                     grigory
                         behold my master behemoth guardian 
                         of thresholds destroyer of worlds

               covered in steamy slime a seven foot multitentacled shape 
               baby behemoth  lands on the stone slab the squirming flesh 
               surges up like greasy pink foam growing exponentially by 
               the second

               ilsa kneels and embraces grigorys corpse kisses him on the 
               mouth a gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them

                                     ilsa
                         hell will hold no surprises for us

               a tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both

               int catacombs  adjacent tunnel  night

               in a passageway hellboy carefully hands lizs body over to 
               myers

                                     hellboy
                         keep her safe no matter what ill 
                         deal with whatevers back there

                                     myers
                         alone

                                     hellboy
                         how big can it be

               as if in response a massive tentacle fills the tunnel 
               reaching for him oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash 
               onto hellboy´s head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed 
               finally confronting 

               int the catacombs  night

               behemoth the size of a house 

               hellboy  head smoking  writhes in the grip of the 
               tentacle it suddenly throws him toward the ceiling

               as he arcs back down abm  he cracks the floor wide open 
               next to him the rosary and the explosive belts he tries to 
               grab them the tentacle slams down blocking his way

               the vibration sends the belts down into the crack they bounce 
               off a small ledge and land further down far below grinding 
               cogwheels and gears

               hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble 
               statue

               hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all hes worth 
               fwap he cuts clean through the tentacle the tip hits the 
               floor rolling into the crack

               from out of behemoths stump a mass of wriggling tentacles 
               replaces the cutoff section they squirm around hellboys 
               face as he slashes again and again fighting his way forward

               he leans into the crack stretches his arm struggling to 
               grab the belts a few inches short he jumps into the crevice 
               onto the first ledge it crumbles

               the gears below grind a few falling bricks the belts slide 
               away

               a tentacle captures hellboy pulls him up at the last second 
               he grabs the belts with his tail

               the beast raises hellboy high a multilayered mouth opens 
               in the body of behemoth the most horrible proboscis ever 
               seen

               hellboys tail passes him the belts

               the timers on them are crushed a spark spurts useless

                                     hellboy
                         they never work 

               he wraps them around his stone arm

                                     hellboy
                         ugh  now this is gonna hurt 

               he pulls the pin on all the explosives behemoth drops him 
               into a squidlike beak and gulps him down

               after a moment a weird gurgle emanates from the creatures 
               innards then 

               int catacombs  night

               a surge of light roils within the thing outlining the pulpy 
               organs the creature starts to burn

               omit

               int catacombs  night

               a chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as behemoth 
               is enveloped in a cloud of fire goo and soft flesh

               hellboy lands with a sickening bonecrunching thud

               with a bellow behemoth goes down the limp tentacles missing 
               hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light 
               finally just a few cinders of flesh float in the air

               int catacombs  night

               hellboy stands covered in goo two final shockwaves of light 
               ripple over the ground

                                     hellboy
                         ouch  it did hurt

               int adjacent tunnel

               hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots myers painfully 
               drags himself over lizs body is on the floor

               manning limps in from an adjacent room hellboy cradles lizs 
               head in his huge hand holds her against his powerful chest 
               and whispers in her ear

               a beat or two then a moan

                                     liz
                         in the dark  i heard your voice  
                         what  did you say  

               he looks at her lovingly caressing her hair

                                     hellboy
                         you on the other side let her go 
                         because for her for her  ill 
                         die ill cross over
                              beat
                         and youll be sorry i did

               myers smiles liz looks at hellboy for the first time as 
               what he is the man she loves a warm gentle fire rims her 
               body

               manning watches agent myers smiles a sad smile illuminated 
               by the flames

               hellboy and liz kiss the fire haloes them and builds as tom 
               waits cinnys waltz fills the air

                                                                  fade out

                                         the end
