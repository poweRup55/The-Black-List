               title sequence

               in the darkness a bloodcurdling cacophony the squeal of 
               unoiled winches the rasp of hooks and razors being sharpened 
               and worse the home of tormented souls  above this din one 
               particular victim yells for mercy  a mixture of tears and 
               roars of rage

               by degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by the 
               surrounding tumult until without warning his voice pierces 
               the confusion afresh  this time  reduced to a naked scream

               from the din music an unearthy rhythmical sound and from 
               the darkness in rhythm with the music an image appears

               a house number 55 lodovico street an old three storey 
               late victorian house with gaunt trees lining its overgrown 
               garden its curtains are drawn there is newspaper over 
               its top window

               the image appears and is wiped off again in rhythm with the 
               music a second image of the house again only closer 
               appears then darkness again then the house a third time 
               from the driveway so it continues as the titles begin to 
               run images appearing from darkness and then wiped off again 
               all following the same slow tolling of the soundtrack

               the images now take us inside the house first the hallway 
               then the staircase then the empty rooms number 55 has been 
               left unoccupied for many years it seems though much of 
               its furniture remains covered in dustsheets on the 
               mantelpiece of one room a plaster saint in the kitchen 
               evidence of life here opened tins bread bottles of spirits 
               a glass

               we move upstairs the images still divided by darkness we 
               see the upper landing an open door and through it a 
               makeshift bed blankets strewn an open suitcase and its 
               contents more liquor

               we move up a flight and approach a room off the top landing 
               the door of which is also slightly ajar the light within 
               swings backwards and forwards and for the first time we 
               understand the rhythm of image and then darkness which has 
               taken us through the title sequence it is the rhythm of the 
               light in this room as it swings to and fro

               we move towards the door as the final title is sucked through 
               the gap into the torture room beyond

               int torture room  night

               the bare bulbs in the room weve entered swing violently 
               disorienting us there are chains  dozens of them  
               disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling all are 
               swinging back and forth some end in hooks with pieces of 
               skin and sinew adhering some are serrated others simply 
               drip blood

               the bell tolls on

               on the bloodspattered floor a box some six inches square 
               which resembles an elaborate chinese puzzle box later well 
               learn its name and function its called the lament 
               configuration and its a way to raise hell literally for 
               now it remains an enigma

               a hand its flesh systematically pierced with needles reaches 
               down and picks the box up

               in close up we see just what an elaborate construction it 
               is made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers it is 
               open at present its polished innards exposed out of it a 
               banal melody played on a hidden mechanism the hands which 
               belong to one of the demons  a cenobite  move over the 
               box

                                     cenobite
                              unseen
                         its over

               delicately the hands begin to reconstruct the box sliding 
               the welloiled parts back into place the tune simplifying 
               with each manoeuvre

               the room is getting darker the chains are disappearing into 
               the gloom

               we see tantalizing glimpses of other figures turning from 
               the light and fading into the darkness we catch sight of 
               monstrous faces but only for the briefest of moments then 
               theyre gone

               the box is almost returned to its unopened condition

               the last sounds to fade are the tune from the box and the 
               bell

               it tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place

               the light stops swinging the panel clicks the tune stops

               at last a long shot of the room at the far end the window 
               is covered with yellowed newspapers there is dust settling 
               through the air

               otherwise it is empty

               the bell fades

               its as if nothing ever happened here

               except

               somewhere very quietly a creaking that could be the sound 
               of floorboards or the low agonized gasp of a thing barely 
               alive

               int hallway  day

               the wind is blaring as we watch the door of number 55 from 
               the doorstep voices one is that of larry cotton the other 
               his wife julia clearly larry is attempting to get inside 
               we hear the sound of keys tried in the lock

                                     larry
                         its one of these

                                     julia
                         were going to freeze to death

                                     larry
                         ok ok

               the sound of another key tried in the lock

                                     julia
                         maybe somebody changed the lock

                                     larry
                              slightly irritated
                         like who

                                     julia
                         just a thought 

                                     larry
                         ah

               the key is turned

                                     larry
                         success

               the door swings open

                                     larry
                         voila

               we see the pair on the doorstep larry is an american in his 
               early forties an attractive man who has lost his edge in 
               recent years he looks harassed he smirks too much a little 
               but significant corner of him is utterly defeated julia 
               his wife is english and looks perhaps ten years his junior 
               she is beautiful but her face betrays a barely buried 
               unhappiness life has disappointed her too of late and 
               larry has been a major part of their disappointment

                                     larry
                         well this is it

               they step over the threshold

               int upper landing  day

               the door of the torture room creaks as the wind blows it 
               opens an inch from downstairs we hear julias voice

                                     julia
                         it smells damp

                                     larry
                         its just been empty a while

               int hallway  day

               larry slams the front door

               int upper landing  day

               the torture room door creaks closed again

                                     larry
                              from below
                         besides its an old house

               int hallway  day

               he stands in the hallway not certain which way to go from 
               here

                                     julia
                         how long since you were here

                                     larry
                         the best part of ten years

               larry picks up some mail  circulars mostly  from behind 
               the door then leads julia through from the hallway to explore 
               the ground floor

                                     larry
                         i wanted to sell it off at one point 
                         after the old lady died but i 
                         couldnt get frank to agree

               he opens one of the doors and looks inside

                                     larry
                              with pleasure
                         christ its not been touched

               he continues along the passageway he opens another door 
               and steps into a large room he opens one of the curtains 
               light pours in dustladen shafts falling on the sheeted 
               furniture

                                     larry
                         look at this

               julia lingers in the doorway

                                     julia
                         why didnt he want to sell it

                                     larry
                              dismissively
                         i dont know probably wanted a 
                         hideaway

               he pulls a sheet off a chair

                                     larry
                         look at this stuff

               the chair is ugly old fashioned julia is unimpressed

                                     julia
                         not exactly modern

                                     larry
                              shrugs
                         well sell it sell everything

                                     julia

                         brothers

                         he wont complain he can pay off 
                         some of his creditors

               larry is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the 
               moment he leaves the room moving past julia to explore 
               further

                                     larry
                         you know we have to let kirsty see 
                         this place before we do anything to 
                         it shell love it

                                     julia

               larry pauses looks at her

                                     larry
                         you dont like it

               julia shrugs

                         its better than brooklyn

               she turns back down the hallway he watches her then follows

                                     larry
                         youre still blaming me

                                     julia

                                     larry

                         we came back

               we are hearing the tip of a debate theyve had dozens of 
               times which immediately annoys them both

                                     julia
                         all right

                                     larry

                                     julia

                                     larry
                         oh christ julia

               julia wanders back to the bottom of the stairs then starts 
               to climb

                                     larry
                              exasperated to 
                              himself
                         shit

               int landing  day

               julia climbs the stairs her face charged with suppressed 
               feeling shes sick of larry his enthusiasm depresses her 
               his compromises anger her whats between them is stale 
               like this house

               int torture room  day

               the door opens a fraction

               int kitchen  day

               larry has stepped into the kitchen to find the remains of 
               the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence now 
               rotted and fungal it smells to judge the expression on his 
               face it also puzzles him then from above

                                     julia
                         larry

               he leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom 
               of the stairs

                                     julia
                         larry

                                     larry
                         i hear you

               he starts up the stairs

               int lower landing  day

               larry reaches the top of the stairs

                                     larry
                         where are you

                                     julia
                              out of sight
                         in here

               larry follows julias voice to the end of the corridor

               julia is standing in a doorway beyond the bedroom we saw 
               in the titles sequence untouched since then

                                     julia
                         squatters

               larry steps past her and throws back the blankets

               woodlice scurry away he goes to the suitcase and starts 
               looking through it besides clothes theres a lot else that 
               speaks of its owner bricabrac picked up in a lifetime of 
               adventuring handful of bullets fragments of an erotic 
               statue coins and notes from a dozen countries amongst the 
               stuff some photographs

               larry peers at them one pictures a goodlooking intense man 
               in his mid to late thirties in bed with a naked chinese 
               girl

                                     larry
                         frank

               at the door we see julia almost flinch at the name

                                     julia
                         hes here

               a dog is barking outside a lonely sound despite her bravura 
               while speaking to larry its apparent from her expression 
               that its taken some determination on her part to resist his 
               offer and she is a little anxious

               int hallway of lodovico street  day

               julia is three steps from the bottom of the stairs

               inside now she moves from one box to another and opens it 
               to find it full of bathroom bricabrac

                         the bed or not

               int kitchen  day

               the kitchen is chaotic cutlery crockery utensils pans 
               and foodstuffs have been heaped on every available surface 
               kirsty has found the kettle but is having difficulty turning 
               on the tap she struggles with it no joy just a rattling 
               sound in the pipes as the system lurches into action

               int lower landing  day

               the pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster the camera 
               moves along the corridor hugging the wall at the end of 
               the corridor stands julia in a patch of sunlight she has 
               the photograph of frank in her hands

               she looks intently at it

               a closeup of the photograph then franks voice

                                     frank
                         can i come in

               julia looks up from the photograph

               int julias flashback  day

               a front door opens on the step of another house stands frank 
               with two suitcases its raining outside hard the rain has 
               plastered his hair to his scalp which only emphasizes his 
               raw good looks

               hes unshaven his eyes are dark and intense

               again the line she remembers

                                     frank
                         can i come in

               the splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of water as 
               we

                                                               cut back to

               the present day

               int kitchen  day

               the tap has come on suddenly spraying kirsty with water  
               she jumps back soaked

                                     kirsty
                         shit shit

               she reaches to turn the pressure down

               int hallway  day

               the men are struggling with the bed again

                                     larry
                              calls through

                                     kirsty
                              from kitchen
                         sure

               int lower landing  day

               again julia returns her gaze to the photograph

               int julias flashback  day

               the same scene frank in the doorstep now we

                                                                    cut to

               the person who opened the door its julia a younger julia 
               her hair arranged differently her clothes brighter it is 
               two weeks before her marriage to larry she looks at the man 
               on the doorstep without a trace of recognition on her face

                                     frank
                         youre julia right

                                     frank

               he looks at her eyes glittering his hold on her is almost 
               mesmeric

                                     frank
                         there is going to be a wedding

                                     julia

                                     frank
                         well can i come in or not

                         welcome

               he steps inside now he is close to her rain running down 
               his face we can hear his breath sense the almost 
               intimidating intimacy of his presence

                                     frank
                         thats nice to know
                              pause
                         have you got a towel

               int lower landing  day

               julia stares down at the photograph off scrren kirstys 
               voice

                                     kirsty os
                         have you got a towel

               julia looks up at the top of the stairs kirsty soaked from 
               the tap julia looks up and hurriedly pockets the photograph

                                     julia
                         kirsty

                                     kirsty
                         hi i got soaked

                                     julia
                         theres a towel in the bathroom

                                     kirsty
                         which is where

                                     julia
                         just to your left

               kirsty ducks into the bathroom we

                                                               cut back to

               julia its clear the memory of her first meeting with frank 
               has affected her deeply the tears that threatened earlier 
               are close

               int bathroom  day

               kirsty has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself

                                     kirsty
                         did dad tell you i got a room by 
                         the way waterloo center of the 
                         known universe

               silence from outside

                                     kirsty
                         julia
                              she puts her head 
                              out of the bathroom

               int lower landing  day

               julia has gone

               int upper landing  day

               the door of the torture room is pushed open julia steps 
               inside

               int lower landing  day

               kirsty hears the creak of footsteps on the boards above 
               julias behaviour puzzles her but shes not about to waste 
               time thinking too hard about it she starts downstairs again

               int torture room  day

               we have an odd hovering point of view of julia as she steps 
               inside the room something about the atmosphere distresses 
               her

               there is a scratching sound she looks down a woodlouse 
               recalling franks foresaken bed crawls along the edge of 
               the skirting board she crosses to the window and tears 
               away a little spyhole in the aged newspaper

               from downstairs the voices of the bedmovers

                                     1st man
                         have you got it

                                     2nd man
                         ive got it i told you 

                                     larry
                         wait wait

               the light through the window falls on her eye

               the screen becomes a whiteout from which emerges

               int julias flashback  day

               a bedroom with afternoon sunlight pouring between the slats 
               of bamboo blinds outside we can hear children playing summer 
               games inside a fly buzzes

               julia the younger self is holding her wedding dress in 
               front of her displaying it

                                     julia
                         well

                                     frank os
                         i dont want to see the dress

                                     julia
                         but you said 

                                     frank
                         i dont want to see the dress

               julia lets the dress drop a few inches in front of her she 
               stares at frank

                                     frank
                         you know what i want

               still she doesnt let the defence that the dress offers  
               a reminder of her imminent marriage  fall she stares 
               though and theres an invitation in her eyes

                                     frank
                         i want you

               now we

                                                                    cut to

               frank he is not so bedraggled as in the first scene but 
               the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat to his face  
               standing half in shadow he looks almost dangerous

               now julia lets the dress drop putting it on the bed behind 
               her

                                     frank
                         thats better

               frank steps towards her

                                     julia
                         what about larry 

                                     frank
                         forget him

               frank takes hold of her she doesnt resist him though there 
               is barely disguised fear on her face

               he puts his hand inside her blouse

               int torture room  day

               in extreme close up julia blinks into the light through the 
               window as larrys voice from downstairs calls her from her 
               reverie

                                     larry
                         slowly will you slowly

               again a whitecut from which emerges

               int julias flashback  day

               the two are naked on the bed both sweating now

               beneath them the wedding dress crushed under their weight

               their lovemaking is not straightforward there is an element 
               of erotic perversity in the way frank licks at her face 
               almost like an animal his hold on her too tight to be loving 
               the sequence escalates into a series of strange details from 
               their locked bodies nails digging into palms sweat rivulets 
               running down their torsos and once in a while we see their 
               faces julia watching frank mesmerized and amused by his 
               intensity frank almost pained by his desire to push the 
               experience to the limit their passion is rendered stranger 
               still by the way the light through the window falls on their 
               bodies making striped creatures of them

               at last as their urgency increases we move up until were 
               looking directly down on the bed from here it is julias 
               face we can see and the ecstasy of the moment has seized 
               her her arms are flung up over her head her eyes are closed 
               as she murmurs

                                     julia
                         oh my god oh my god oh my god

               the scene whites out

               int torture room  day

               julia is still staring into the light she sobs very quietly

                                     julia
                              a whisper
                         oh frank

               int hallway  day

               downstairs larry and the men have moved the bed across the 
               hall to the bottom of the stairs

               all three are weary now and getting careless

               as they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead for larry 
               whose hand is moving closer and closer to a nail proturbing 
               from the woodwork of the bannister

                                     larry
                              to movers
                         will you take the weight while i 
                         take a step up

               he backs towards the stairs  and the nail

                                     larry
                         damn it will you take the 

               the side of his hand is impaled by the nail he cries out 
               the weight of the bed which he cannot relinquish drives 
               the nail deeper and gouges a long cut from the ball of his 
               thumb to his wrist blood pours out

                                     larry

               he drops his edge of the bed and disengages his hand from 
               the nail upon which hes injured himself he lifts his hand 
               from which blood is pouring

                                     larry

               julia is standing in the middle of the room a single dart 
               of light through the hole she tore in the newspaper strikes 
               her face softly on the soundtrack the scrabbling noise of 
               the woodlice

               larry his hand running with blood climbs the last flight 
               of stairs

                                     larry
                              weakly
                         julia

               int torture room  day

               julia hears him and turns from her silent communing with 
               the room she crosses towards the door too late

               it opens larry steps inside blood pouring from his right 
               hand which he attempts to staunch with his left hand

                                     julia
                         what have you done

                                     larry
                         i cut myself

               blood has started to drip unnoticed by either of them onto 
               the bare boards heavy splashes

               larry looks sick his face clammy with sweat she stares at 
               him without a trace of feeling for him on her face

                                     julia
                         is it deep

                                     larry

                                     larry
                              he leans against the 
                              wall
                         shit

                                     julia
                         let me see

               she goes to him he looks away as she unglues one hand from 
               the other and looks at the wound blood comes faster hitting 
               the floor between them

                                     julia
                         its probably going to need stitches

                                     larry
                         im going to throw up

                                     julia
                         no youre not

               the blood keeps hitting the floor slap slap slap

                                     julia
                         well get you out into the fresh 
                         air

               he is again clamping his hand over the wound as julia helps 
               him to the door they leave the torture room

               we hear their voices receding down the passageway as we 
               again assume that hovering view point the floor is heavily 
               spattered with blood

                                     julia
                         take it slowly

                                     larry
                         so damn stupid

                         no you wont

               int hallway  day

               kirsty is half way up the stairs as julia and larry head 
               down

                                     kirsty
                         what happened

                                     julia

                         will you drive he needs stitches

                                     kirsty

                                     julia
                         the keys are in the kitchen

               kirsty heads back to the kitchen julia helps larry towards 
               the front door

               the camera swings away from them upstairs and begins to 
               track

                                                           lapdissolve to

               int upper landing  day

               we continue to track towards the torture room

               downstairs the front door slams

                                                           lapdissolve to

               int torture room  day

               from outside the sound of a car door slamming an engine 
               starts the car drives away

               we move towards the blood on the floor as we watch it begins 
               to disappear as if being absorbed by the room we pan up to 
               the wall the plaster is not quite smooth indeed it now 
               begins to grow restless and cracks something begins to 
               move in the wall

               wedding scene flashback

               the screen is white until a veil is lifted from it and we 
               are staring into larrys smiling face offscreen the 
               priests voice

                                     priest
                         you may kiss the bride

               as larry leans forward to do so we cut round to julia the 
               recipient of this kiss though she smiles as she receives 
               the kiss her glance strays towards the front pews her gaze 
               first settles on her maidofhonour kirsty then behind kirsty 
               to frank who is standing tapping his fingers on the pew now 
               he looks up at her his glance lethal then he breaks into 
               a smile that displays his utter contempt for the ritual in 
               hand and with it julias glance returns to larry whom she 
               embraces

               the scene whites out

               int lounge  day additional flashback

               we cut to a room in larrys house littered with wedding 
               presents and cards celebrating the imminent wedding julia 
               is standing beside the window watching frank who walks 
               around the room like a caged animal

               larry enters with a bottle and glasses his manner jovial  
               he fails to notice the glances between julia and frank

               he sets the bottle in the middle of the table

                                     larry
                         you should have called

                                     frank
                         i didnt know if id get here

                                     larry
                         well were pleased you did
                              to julia
                         arent we sweetheart

               julia smiles

                                     larry
                         look im going to have to leave you 
                         guys to keep each other company

                                     julia
                         larry

                                     larry
                         anyway its bad luck to see too 
                         much of the bride before the wedding

               he exits as he does so frank moves to the table his eyes 
               on julia all the time as he pours a glass of whisky we 
               hear an outer door slam

                                     frank
                         what shall we drink to

               he lifts the glass

                                     frank
                              ironic
                         wedded bliss

                                     julia
                              defensively
                         im very happy

                                     frank
                         sure you are

               he crosses to her

               int dining room  night

               an explosion of laughter we

                                                                    cut to

               the remains of a rack of lamb its gravy now congealed scraps 
               of meat adhering to the bone here and there this is the 
               centrepiece of the table reduced to a battlefield by the 
               guests who are laughing offscreen

               we pass along the table taking in dirty plates and cutlery 
               napkins glasses and emptied wine bottles finally we reach 
               julia who is still sitting at the table while the others 
               have retired to more comfortable seats she looks utterly 
               miserable and a little drunk

               the room has been spruced up for the party candles are 
               burning on tables and mantelpiece there are pictures on the 
               walls but this is essentially cosmetic the place has not 
               been refurnished or redecorated

               we move to the party guests two we recognise kirsty and 
               larry who is presently entertaining the gathering with an 
               account of his accident the others are new faces an american 
               couple bill underwood and his wife evelyn who are of an 
               age with larry and a younger bespectacled man  a work 
               colleague of larrys  steve odonnell

               one other man is seated at the table  he may be a colleague 
               of larrys  much of the following dialogue is to be 
               improvised  all are drunk

               a brandy bottle sits on the table between them and half a 
               dozen other liqueur bottles besides steve it soom becomes 
               apparent has his eyes on kirsty

               larry is halfway through his hospital story gesticulating 
               wildly as he goes through the tale much to the pleasure of 
               the rest his hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged

                                     larry
                          always hated the sight of my own 
                         blood i go out like a light anybody 
                         elses no problem but mine you 
                         know goes straight to my head 
                         anyhow damn doctors poking around 
                         and im saying im going to pass 
                         out and hes saying no youre not 
                         no youre not next thing i know 

               we

                                                               cut back to

               julia who watches her husband unamused

                                     larry
                          i wake up on the floor

               gales of laughter at this

                                     larry
                         and it was him who was looking sick

               while the following dialogue runs we see that steve has 
               claimed one of the paper serviettes from the table and is 
               tearing it  a litter of pieces surrounding his chair  
               into a pattern much to kirstys amusement he looks up from 
               his concentration to see her looking at him they smile at 
               each other

                                     bill
                         probably thought youd sue

                                     evelyn
                         doctors 

                                     larry

               this wins another round of laughter

               int lower landing  night

               julia walks along the landing while the laughter  muted 
               by distance  wafts up from below

               from the floor above she hears something more

               she stops puzzled then starts up the second flight of stairs 
               towards the torture room

               int upper landing  night

               she approaches the torture room and steps inside

               int torture room  night

               the sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here its 
               barely audible but there is another sound a shifting sound 
               in the corner of the room

               she reaches for the light switch and turns it on the bulbs 
               been broken however she stares around the room trying to 
               make sense of the shadows

               nervously she approaches the wall on which four streaks of 
               light from the window fall now she looks towards the window 
               and realizes that the newspaper has been torn as if by four 
               fingers her breath catches suddenly shes afraid

               she stands absolutely still eyes wide in the gloom

                                     julia
                         whos there

               on the far side of the room a movement in the shadows

               julia almost retreats but something keeps her staring into 
               the murk as something  the remnants of a human form made 
               of twisted blistered strands of flesh raises its head 
               its squatting against the wall unable to lift itself into 
               a standing position its eyes however have life in them 
               and hunger this though hes unrecognizable is frank

                         were not all frigid

               kirsty has turned to look at him both of them are aware 
               where the banter is leading smiles play on their faces as 
               they speak

                                     kirsty
                         oh no

                                     steve
                              moves closer to her
                         well youve just been talking to the 
                         wrong people

               he kisses her with considerable feeling

               int bedroom  night

               larry snores loudly julia lies beside him wide awake  
               staring at the ceiling

               larry turns over muttering to himself

               int torture room  night

               the door opens julia is standing there in her nightgown

               frank raises his wretched head

                                     frank
                         well

               julia stares at the thing moving in the shadow

                                     julia
                         yes

               ext number 55  day

               the door opens julia steps out of the house and starts 
               towards the street  as she does so she glances round

               ext window of torture room  day

               we approach the window knowing that frank watches behind 
               it

               ext number 55  day

               julia heads off down the street

               int pet shop  day

               a monkey chatters its wizened face grotesque then the din 
               of a shop full of birds and animals floods the soundtrack 
               parrots canaries dogs etc we pan across the shop to kirsty 
               who has been left alone at the counter she is working in 
               the shop but she doesnt have much grasp of the job so far 
               there are several customers in the shop one browsing amongst 
               the cages a mother and two children peering at animals and 
               another at the counter he has a lizard in a cardboard box

                                     kirsty
                         im afraid i dont know im new 
                         here

                                     customer
                         well who does isnt there anyone in 
                         charge

                                     kirsty
                         hes out at lunch maybe if you come 
                         back tomorrow 

               its clear that kirsty is as concerned about the others in 
               the shop as she is about the customer with the lizard

               her eyes keep drifting away towards the children who are 
               running their fingers up and down the cages

                                     customer
                         you know what a hassle it was bringing 
                         it here

               somebody else enters the shop only glimpsed by kirsty

               the newcomer is a derelict with matted hair and beard face 
               filthy she catches sight of him moving behind the cages 
               meanwhile the customer is still complaining

                                     customer
                         if its dead by tomorrow 

                                     kirsty
                         it looks quite healthy to me 

               the child is at kirstys side he tugs on her sweater

                                     kirsty
                              to child
                         what

                                     customer
                         well id hoped for better service 
                         than this i must say 

               the child takes kirsty away from the counter the customer 
               outraged to be ignored leaves the shop

               the child leads the way round the back of the cages

               there kirsty finds the derelict with his hand in a vivarium 
               of grasshoppers he is chewing

                                     kirsty
                         what are you doing 

               the man drops the lid he continues to chew

               she looks at the mans hand he is holding several insects 
               we can hear them and see their legs between his fingers

                                     kirsty
                         give those back

               the mother meanwhile claims the child who starts to cry 
               the derelict lifts the handful of insects and stuffs them 
               openpalmed into his mouth then limbs twitching between 
               his clenched teeth he retreats towards the door

                                     kirsty
                         oh my god

               the derelict exits the mother is hurrying her children away

                                     mother
                         how disgusting

                                     kirsty
                         oh god

               she turns and finds herself face to face with steve

               a monkey screams accompanying her turn makes her jump

                                     kirsty
                         oh

               the monkey continues to chatter

                                     steve

                         its a fetish of mine

               she grins he kisses her the monkey bares its teeth

               int bar  day

               by contrast a quiet bar discreet music a welldressed 
               clientele several couples occupy booths other solitary 
               drinkers are at the bar

               amongst them julia

               now we see her more closely we realize shes gone to some 
               considerable effort to make herself ravishing theres nothing 
               crude about the change its a subtle transformation which 
               shows off her considerable beauty she drinks soda water

               she has an admirer sitting alone at one of the tables is a 
               middleaged man by the name of prudhoe a nervous slightly 
               paunchy individual she glances over at him his eyes dont 
               leave her for a moment hes trying his best to get the 
               courage to approach her

               she looks away and concentrates on her drink now she takes 
               out a cigarette fumbling for it her hands are trembling 
               slightly she lights the cigarette draws on it and as she 
               does so she seems to make up her mind that shes not the 
               equal of it she stubs the cigarette out puts cash on the 
               bar for her drinks and gets up to leave

               suddenly prudhoes at her side

                                     prudhoe
                         not much fun is it

                                     prudhoe
                         drinking alone

                                     julia
                         not much

                                     prudhoe
                         i wonder maybe

               hes so nervous he can barely speak

                                     prudhoe
                         as were both on our own we 
                         could have one drink together

               julia looks at him he seems to almost be offering himself 
               to her theres a long pause while she tries to make up her 
               mind then

                                     julia
                         why not

               she smiles the smile works wonders prudhoes nerves diminish 
               somewhat julias simply increase now that shes committed 
               herself again she opens the pack of cigarettes as prudhoe 
               calls the barman over

                                     prudhoe

                              looking straight at 
                              him
                         that depends

                                     prudhoe
                         oh

               he stares at her not certain he interprets her correctly  
               she stares back then the tiniest of smiles which he  
               scarcely believing his luck  returns

               int torture room  day

               the camera moves across the room we can hear franks ragged 
               breathing and as we move in we see on the floor beside 
               him the box  the lament configuration  its sides 
               gleaming frank still squatting on the floor taps a tattoo 
               on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers

               then voices outside julia laughs

               he raises his head

               ext doorstep  day

               julia opens the front door she is still very nervous 
               fumbling with the keys prudhoe stands a pace behind her

               int hallway  day

               they step inside julia closes the door

                                     prudhoe
                         you know its not often i you 
                         know

                                     prudhoe

                         you know its funny i feel like 
                         ive known you for years

               he approaches her his gestures made slightly clumsy by the 
               alcohol hes drunk he kisses her she presses him off her

               suddenly shes no longer certain she can go through with 
               this but his mood changes at her rejection the drunkeness 
               becomes meanness

                                     prudhoe
                         what are you playing at
                              he takes hold of her 
                              breast
                         this is what you brought me here for 
                         isnt it

               she stares at him

                                     prudhoe
                         well isnt it

               int torture room  day

               of julia and prudhoes approach up the stairs

                         thats right

               julia opens the door prudhoe is smiling

               the smile drops as he stares at the bare dark room

                                     prudhoe
                         this isnt the bedroom

                                     julia
                         no

               for an instant hes thrown off tiller hes suddenly anxious

                                     prudhoe
                         whats going on

                                     julia
                         we dont need a bed do we

               he steps inside the room

                                     prudhoe
                         i suppose not

                         i prefer the floor

               he turns to her aroused by this talk

                                     prudhoe
                         first time for everything

                                     julia
                         thats right

               julia moves towards him

                                     julia
                         why dont you take off your jacket  
                         youre warm

                                     prudhoe
                         yeah why dont i

               she slips the knot of his tie we can hear her pulse on the 
               soundtrack she glances over prudhoes shoulder he follows 
               her gaze but she diverts him with a peck on the cheek

                                     prudhoe
                              takes over his 
                              undressing
                         why dont you do the same

                                     julia
                         maybe i will

               prudhoe now starts to shed his jacket and trousers trying 
               not to take his eyes off julia for an instant

               we watch from franks pov as he drops his underwear

               he still wears his shirt which he starts to unbutton

               we move back into a tighter shot

                                     prudhoe
                              voice slightly slurred
                         you know youre very beautiful

                                     julia

                                     prudhoe
                         you know you are loveliest woman i 
                         ever set eyes on

               julia smiles

               prudhoe stops unbuttoning his shirt

                                     prudhoe
                         oh christ

                                     julia
                         whats wrong

                                     prudhoe
                         too much drink better empty my 
                         bladder

               she steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door

                                     prudhoe
                         ill be a moment

               as he moves to the door she throws a piece of cloth off a 
               hammer which lies beside the wall prudhoe takes hold of 
               the door handle turns it its stuck

                                     prudhoe
                         the doors stuck

               before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head he 
               doesnt fall but the blow sends blood down the back of his 
               shirt to avoid the following blow he stumbles blindly towards 
               the wall but julias not going to be stopped now he holds 
               the back of his head  dazed apologetic pitiful  while 
               she moves towards him

                                     prudhoe
                         dont i please im sorry

               she eclipses him

                                     prudhoe
                         im so sorry

               she raises the hammer

                                     prudhoe
                         i dont understand

               she strikes him he slides down the wall his jaw broken 
               blood pouring from his face he twitches then the twitches 
               stop

               she drops the hammer and stares down at the corpse

                                     julia
                         enough

               the room sighs in the corner franks shadowy form leans 
               forward

                                     frank
                         dont look at me

               julia backs towards the door as the broken skeletal form 
               crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance

               int upper landing  day

               julia steps out onto the landing and leans against the wall 
               waves of sheer relief breaking over her

               in the room behind her terrible sounds of feeding

               int bathroom  day

               julia steps into the bathroom and looks at herself in the 
               mirror blood is spattered on her face her hands are 
               similarly stained she is trembling from head to foot

               stripping off her blouse and flinging it over the side of 
               the bath she douses her face neck and breasts with cold 
               water then she stares up at her face again examining it  
               she can scarcely believe what shes done

               int lower landing  day

               she crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the torture 
               room

               int torture room  day

               she opens the door

               as she does so frank retreats into the shadows we are granted 
               a fleeting glimpse of him his body fuller than before but 
               still horribly vulnerable

               julia looks at prudhoes corpse a trail of blood leads away 
               from it into the darkness the body itself is a grotesquely 
               misshapen husk now the muscle and fat withered the eyes 
               sunk into the skull the lips drawn back to expose the gums 
               a ghostly sight

                                     julia
                         jesus christ

               julia looks across at frank who is no longer sitting but 
               standing in the shadows

                                     frank
                              his voice stronger
                         do i disgust you

               she doesnt reply

               he stretches his arm into a passage of light his flesh 
               glistens and pulses

                                     frank
                         see its making me whole again

               he turns his arm over for her appreciation

                                     frank
                         every drop of blood you spill puts 
                         more flesh on my bones and we both 
                         want that dont we

               she nods

                                     frank
                         good come here

               she stares unable to move

                                     frank
                         come here damn you i want to touch 
                         you

               still she doesnt move

                                     frank
                              more softly
                         come to daddy i only want to touch

               she takes a step towards his outstretched arm his fingers 
               touch her face she steels herself against them now he 
               starts to trace the line of her jaw stroking her now her 
               lips caressingly

               suddenly a sound from downstairs the front door is opened

                                     larry
                              from below
                         sweetheart

               julia withdraws from his touch

                                     larry
                              from below
                         where are you

               int hallway  day

               shot from the stairs of larry he looks up the flight

               he takes a step towards the stairs

               int torture room  day

               julia takes a step backwards her foot hitting prudhoes 
               corpse

               int hallway  day

               larry is still at the bottom of the stairs

                                     larry
                         are you there

               for a moment it looks as though hes going to climb the 
               stairs then he thinks better of it and goes through to the 
               back of the house

               int torture room  day

               julia has wrapped the corpse of prudhoe up in its clothes 
               and is now lifting it the body is lighter now having been 
               drained of nourishment its head lolls back and its dentures 
               drop out hitting the floor loudly she freezes no sound 
               from below she backs out of the room with her burden

               franks arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at 
               them

                                     frank
                         whos a pretty boy then

               soft laughter from the darkness

               int junk room  day

               julia pushes the door of the junk room which is on the upper 
               landing open inside a chaos of teachests and bricabrac  
               she lays the body down

               int kitchen  day

               larry has come through to look for julia he hears a noise 
               above he looks up

                                     larry
                              quietly
                         julia

               he leaves the kitchen

               int hallway  day

               again larry steps into the hallway and gazes up the stairs

                                     larry
                         are you there

               he starts up

               int lower landing  day

               julia steps into the bathroom and then locks the door behind 
               her

               larry ascends to the top of the stairs

                                     larry
                         julia

                                     julia

                                     larry
                         are you all right

                                     julia
                         just feeling a bit sick

                                     larry
                         oh babe

               int bathroom  day

               julia still trembling sits on the edge of the bath

                                     julia

                         ok

               she listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and 
               stairs then she crosses to the mirror and tries to erase 
               the signs of panic she puts a comb through her hair and 
               adjusts her blouse that done she unbolts the door and steps 
               out into the landing she doesnt go down however but up  
               back to the torture room

               int torture room  day

               she opens the door

                                     julia
                              very softly
                         frank

               a crunching sound in the shadows franks hand opens dropping 
               the pieces of prudhoes dentures which he has crushed onto 
               the floor in a rain of plastic teeth

                                     frank

               with a bloody tongue thunder rolls

               kirstys dream

               the thunder carries over to a dream

               we are in the dining room of number 55 except that everything 
               is once more shrouded in sheets

               we cut to kirsty moving through the room her face pale 
               her hair glued to her forehead with sweat

               somewhere a bell is ringing flies buzz on the dinner table 
               a form is covered in a sheet its clear that the shape is 
               human she reaches the table and looks at the body

               suddenly blood begins to seep through the shroud beginning 
               at the head  eyes and mouth  then spreading across the 
               body there are sobs beneath the shroud

               she reaches for it to snatch it off the body

               the blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet

               she pulls

               we glimpse only a moment of whatd beneath a naked body 
               scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot

               she screams

               her scream becomes louder as we

                                                                    cut to

                                     frank
                         the cenobites the creatures the box 
                         set free
                              a pause
                         sometimes i think theyre still here 
                         just behind the walls them and their 
                         hooks and their beasts just waiting 
                         to break out again except that ive 
                         got the box

                                     julia
                         youre still afraid

                                     frank

                         the limits pain and pleasure 
                         indivisible

               julia looks at the box there is a flash of light in it

               we seem to be moving down the corridor thick with smoke

               suddenly figures emerge from the smoke the cenobites

               she lets out a yell

               another flash theyve gone now there are fresh appalling 
               images in the box we see frank naked the shadows of hooks 
               falling over his body blood runs over his skin the image 
               begins to distort

               julia wants to look away but she cant the images become 
               more appalling still flesh is gouged and ploughed and now 
               the hooks are in the skin and the image is even more 
               distorted we are no longer certain of what were seeing a 
               mouth opens in a soundless scream then the image blacks 
               out when frank speaks again his voice trembles

                                     frank
                         they took my body but my spirit 
                         they left that here in the boards 
                         in the walls watching the world 
                         but not able to touch it

                                     julia
                         and the blood let you out

                                     frank
                         it gave me a little chance and i 
                         took it they wont get me back im

                         not in the whole wide world

               int kirstys room  night

               music from the radio a love song the radio is badly tuned 
               the song sounds tinny it fades then comes back into focus 
               again we move round the room over an unfinished puzzle 
               left on the bed over a few pictures of larry set lovingly 
               beside the bed and finally onto kirsty who is drying her 
               hair after a shower

               the radio channel slips the radio whines then an 
               evangelists voice on the airwaves

                                     evangelist
                         the devil is watching you thats 
                         the message i came here tonight to 
                         bring you the devil is watching you 
                         and he sees the corruption in your

                         every night every day 

               kirsty has got up now and is trying to change channels but 
               the controls defeat her she gets more and more annoyed

                                     kirsty
                         cmon damn you cmon

                                     evangelist

                                     kirsty
                         no he doesnt damn thing

               eventually she pulls the back off the radio the batteries 
               fall out

                                     kirsty
                              to herself

               thunder

               int dining room  night

               more thunder and the sound of heavy rain against the windows

               the television is on larry and julia are sitting on the 
               couch larry is watching a boxing match he has consumed 
               several beers the cans are beside his feet and theres 
               another in his hand

               julia reads a magazine glancing up at the screen to see the 
               match getting more heated blood is starting to flow

                                     larry
                         is this upsetting you

                                     julia
                         ive seen worse

               larry looks at her

                                     larry
                         are you all right

                                     julia
                         fine

                                     larry
                         only ill turn it off 

               theres a sudden raising of shouts from the screen as one 
               of the boxers hits the canvas larry turns his attention 
               back to the match

                                     commentator
                         and hes down hes down

               the thunder rolls on

               int torture room  night

               the lightning finds its way through the holes in the 
               newspaper frank is watching through the window his face 
               occasionally washed with light his hand on the window frame 
               taps out the same tattoo hes tapped out before he turns 
               away from the window and his foot catches the box it rolls 
               across the floor

               int dining room  night

               the boxing match is heating up again

                                     commentator
                         and now hes in trouble hes really 
                         in trouble 

                                     larry
                         what was that

               julia looks up from her magazine

                                     julia
                         thunder

               the violence on the screen is horrific as swollen faces 
               burst beneath punches

                                     larry
                         no something else

               larry stands up

                                     julia
                         maybe i left a window open 

               she gets up and crosses to the door

                                     julia
                          ill go see

                                     larry
                         no ill do it

               he opens the door and steps out into the hallway

               int upper landing  night

               in such tight close up we cant sec that frank has in fact 
               left the torture room we see his features register that 
               somebody is coming

               int stairway  night

               larry is climbing the stairs julia follows

                                     julia
                         it was nothing

               larry has reached the top of the stairs he looks up the 
               next flight

                                     julia
                         larry

                                     larry
                         whats wrong with you

               shes desperate to stop him climbing to the torture room

                                     julia
                         i just hate the thunder

               he crosses to her

                                     larry
                         im here

               he puts his arms around her she responds

                                     larry
                         youre shaking

               he hugs her tight kissing her lightly the thunder shakes 
               the house

                                     larry
                         theres nothing to be afraid of

               he kisses her neck his hands restless on her

                                     larry
                         ill just go check upstairs

               he kisses her again she in order to distract him kisses 
               him back her passion is artificial but he doesnt register 
               that

                                     larry
                         oh baby

                                     larry
                         come with me then

               he starts up the stairs

                                     julia
                         please

               int upper landing  night

               he reaches the top of the stairs first he throws open the 
               junk room lightning flashes on boxes inside then he moves 
               towards the torture room

               the thunder rolls more loudly

               she follows him along the landing desperate to stop him

               too late he throws open the door

                                     julia
                         dont

               lightning floods the room its empty she stands beside him 
               at the door

                                     larry
                         we must have rats

               she looks back down the stairs wheres frank gone

               larry turns to her holding her again on the threshold of 
               the torture room

                                     larry
                         see quite safe

               he kisses her much harder this time a sexual kiss

                                     larry
                         lets go down ill make it better

               he kisses her again

               int bedroom  night

               a shadow moves across the screen as the door opens and larry 
               puts on the light he has hold of julias hand he leads her 
               inside she sits on the bed illuminated by the light from 
               the landing and the occasional flicker from the window 
               larry kneels between her legs and kisses her breasts his 
               eyes closed

               julia glances into the shadows of the room she senses franks 
               presence

                                     larry
                         oh babe

               he starts to unbutton her dress shes distracted by her 
               suspicions he has his hands against her almost before she 
               realizes whats happening

               we have her pov as she looks around the room the dressing 
               table the wardrobe the curtains at the window does 
               something move in the shadows

               a flash of lightning no theres nothing

               larry gets onto the bed and draws her against him kissing 
               her this is not the intense slightly dangerous lovemaking 
               she experienced with frank but a fumbling slightly foolish 
               exchange larry is so wrapped in attempting to make the right 
               moves he doesnt register the fact that julias attention is 
               elsewhere

               now we have a pov from the far side of the room of the 
               two figures on the bed the only sound the thunder and larrys 
               murmured words of seduction which we can barely make out

                                     larry
                         i love you honey let me oh 
                         god i love you

               neither of them have undressed fully theres just a tangle 
               of clothes around them which removes any trace of eroticism 
               from the scene

               a close up of julias head laid on the pillow shows just 
               how uninvolved she is  while larry works eyes closed 
               julia looks down the length of her husbands body the door 
               of the wardrobe swings open frank is watching she registers 
               horror larry is oblivious to all of this of course

               we have a close up of frank watching the lovemaking

               now he steps out of the wardrobe julia makes a moan of 
               horror which larry takes as enthusiasm

                                     larry
                         oh baby i love you

               from julias pov we see the form of frank shamble towards 
               the lovers

               from franks pov we see the lovers on the bed

               larrys back vunerable julia seems to realize what he 
               intends

                                     julia
                         no

               larry barely hears her

               frank is at the very end of the bed now and julia becomes 
               highly agitated

                                     julia
                         no  no you mustnt please no

               larry stops his lovemaking

                                     larry
                              looks at her
                         huh

                                     julia
                         please

                                     larry
                         whats wrong with you

                                     julia
                              almost sobbing
                         please i cant bear it

               larry is angered and utterly perplexed at this he disengages 
               his arms from around her

               julias pov as frank retreats

               larry rolls off julia

               the wardrobe door closes click

                                     larry
                         i dont understand you one moment 
                         youre all over me the next its  
                         dont touch me

               he sits on the edge of the bed

                                     larry
                         i just dont understand

               he gets up and leaves the bedroom julia remains where she 
               is  we have a shot of the bed and her upon it from franks 
               end of the room  she stares at the wardrobe through the 
               crack of the open door frank stares back a flicker of 
               lightning illuminates his face his skeletal grin

               softly beneath the assault of the rain on the roof we hear 
               laughter

               int a small restaurant  evening

               kirsty and larry are sitting eating a meal together in an 
               intimate restaurant larry has little appetite to judge by 
               his plate he looks as if he hasnt slept for several nights 
               kirsty by contrast is sparkling

                                     larry
                         maybe we should never have come 
                         back

                                     kirsty
                         maybe you should give it some time

                                     larry
                         i guess

                                     kirsty
                              skirting her real 
                              feelings
                         shes not like mom shes i dont 
                         know moody i thought that was 
                         what you liked about her

                                     larry
                         you dont like her at all do you

               the straightforward question silences kirsty for a moment 
               she wants to be delicate with her fathers feelings but 
               honest at the same time

                                     kirsty
                         i dont know her shes so sealed 
                         up

               larrys face is full of the desire for reassurance

               kirsty tries to offer it

                                     kirsty
                         if you love her she must be worth 
                         loving just give me some time

               larry nods a weak smile on his face

                                     larry
                         she doesnt even want to leave the 
                         house

                                     kirsty
                         really

                                     larry

               but julia manages to coax him inside she closes the door 
               behind them

               with his fingers its colonel bogey and now he hums it 
               too outside the door a footfall

               frank moves in the corner sykes catches the motion from the

               the doorstep and looks up at the house

               int torture room  day

               in the room pandemonium sykes blood pouring down his face 
               flails out at julia the hammer flies from her hand he lunges 
               for the door but she manages to kick it closed

               sykes has taken hold of julia and is using her as a shield 
               against frank who is bearing down upon him for the first 
               time we see franks true colours where julias concerned 

                                     sykes

               frank has sykes face to the wall sykes is sobbing now

               the room is covered in blood

                                     frank

                              to julia

                         please

               julia leaves closing the door

               frank seizes hold of sykes neck his fingers entering the 
               flesh either side of his neck vertebrae sykes screams

               int kitchendinging roomhallway  day

               stairs

               int lower landing  day

               half way up the stairs the scream stops she climbs the 
               rest of the way surrounded by a graveyard hush

               int torture room  day

               a soundless slowed shot as sykes his face wasted by franks 
               feeding breaks from franks hold and lunges for the door

               int lower landing  day

               kirsty starts up the second flight of stairs

               int torture room  day

               the same slowed soundless horror as sykes reaches the door  
               frank is a pace behind him

               in real time and accompanied by the most horrific shriek 
               sykes flings himself from the torture room the flesh is 
               hanging off his face his eyes bulge in terror

               seeing kirsty he starts towards her behind him frank his 
               body glistening he catches hold of sykes by the neck sykes  
               shrieks stop the eyes glaze over the body judders as death 
               claims it then frank drops the corpse and looks up at

                         from me and that makes the pleasures 
                         so much sweeter

               as he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the pus and 
               bloodstained shirt thats glued to his abdomen and pulls 
               theres a flow of fluids

               franks head is thrown back and he screams

               but its all shes got as he comes after her again she 
               stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box he 
               howls she races for the door but hes after her he strikes

               she dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool

                                     kirsty
                              breathless

                                     kirsty
                         fucking have it

               she throws the box it sails past frank and smashes through 
               the window

                                     frank
                         no

               he goes to the window she takes her chance shes out of 
               the door in a moment

               int upper landing  day

               kirsty propels herself out of the room and down the stairs 
               while frank vents his anger above her

               int hallway  day

               she flings open the front door and pitches herself  
               bleeding and bruised  into the daylight beyond

               ext number 55  day

               as she stumbles away down the path she sees the box at her 
               feet in a litter of broken glass she picks it up and 
               continues to run

               ext lodovico street  day

               series of shots from kirstys pov as she staggers along 
               the street the soundtrack whines the image threatens to be 
               eclipsed by darkness people stare at her as she runs a 
               child points

               finally the camera slows she stands still

               voice off camera

                                     voice os
                         are you all right

               the camera swings giddily around in the direction of the 
               speaker a woman comes into view

                                     woman
                         do you need any help

               as she speaks the picture fades to white

               kirstys dream part two

               the whiteness continues to fill the screen distant 
               incoherent voices are heard and the thump of blood in the 
               inner ear

               then darkness seeps into the whiteness patterns like 
               rorschach inkblots ambiguous yet interpretable as sexual 
               or horrific imagery with the darkness soaking over the 
               scene like blood through the sheet in her first dream 
               fragments of franks previous dialogue

                                     frank
                         come to daddy

                         some things have to be endured

               the darkness is filling the screen

               and suddenly she wakes

               int hospital room  night

               kirsty is lying in a bed in a private room a television is 
               on in the corner of the room the sound turned down to a 
               sibillant whisper a nurse sits in front of it glassyeyed 
               on the screen a wildlife programme animals are tearing 
               each other apart kirsty groans the nurse stands up and 
               crosses to the bed

                                     nurse

               as soon as shes gone kirsty throws the sheet aside and starts 
               to get out of bed she feels sick disorientated the sound 
               of the animals on the television distresses her

                                     doctor

                         lie down

               the nurse has now crossed to the bed and is now coaxing kirsty 
               back between the sheets unwillingly she goes

                                     kirsty

               she looks at him balefully

                                     kirsty
                         no

                         promise to stay put

               she nods the nurse exits

                                     doctor

               hes gone then gets out of bed and crosses to the door 
               its been locked she struggles with the handle

                                     kirsty
                         shit shit shit

               shes close to tears she crosses back to the bed while the 
               vultures on the television fight over a carcass the box 
               lies on the bed she picks it up turning it over in her 
               hand

               int upper landing  night

               frank is standing in the shadows he is wearing a fresh shirt 
               he smirks julia watches him

                         i need a skin then we leave 

               int hospital room  night

               kirsty puts down the receiver and puts the phone back on the 
               bedside table

               she still frets in order to direct her attention from her 
               anxieties she picks up the box and plays with it for a while 
               scarcely thinking about what shes doing suddenly a click

               her face lights up with pleasure as she slides a part of the 
               box open and to accompany the revelation a twinkling tune

               she smiles

               the television picture flickers but she doesnt notice

               the door opens its the nurse

                                     nurse
                         what a pretty tune

                                     kirsty
                         my father doesnt answer i have to 
                         go find him

                                     nurse
                         im afraid youll have to wait until 
                         the police have spoken to you keep 
                         trying your father hell answer 
                         eventually

                                     kirsty

                         hes coming over will you let him 
                         in

                                     nurse
                         of course this isnt a prison you 
                         know
                              she lowers her voice
                         look if youd prefer to tell me what 
                         happened instead of a policeman 

               kirsty shakes her head

                                     kirsty
                         you wouldnt believe me

                                     nurse
                         try me

               for a moment it seems kirsty weakens then she thinks better 
               of it

                                     nurse
                         well if you change your mind whats 
                         this friends name

                                     kirsty
                         steve

               the nurse goes to the door as she exits kirsty picks the 
               box up again and at her ministrations it opens a little 
               wider

               ext number 55  night

               the front door closes

                                     larry
                              inside
                         julia

               int hallway  night

               larry stands in the hall julia comes down the stairs

               she looks pale even ill

                                     larry
                         whats wrong

                                     julia

                                     larry
                         what are you talking about

                                     julia
                         its better you see for yourself 

               she turns and starts up the stairs he follows

               int hospital room  night

               kirsty has opened more of the box the tune is more complex 
               now

               somewhere a bell has started to ring now she works the 
               final mechanism of the box the bedside light flickers and 
               goes out

               the bell rings light pours out of the box she drops it 
               shocked

               the bedside light comes on again

               she looks up

               in the wall opposite the end of her bed a very narrow doorway 
               has simply opened in the wall

               leaving the box on the bed she gets up and goes to the gap 
               as she approaches she hears the distant rhythmical sob of a 
               baby she stands at the doorway

               int corridor to hell  night

               we look back at her a diminutive figure framed against a 
               shot of light from way way down the corridor

               int hospital room  night

               the sobbing goes on kirsty stares down the corridor  which 
               is lit brightly in some places and is absolutely dark in 
               others  not certain of whether to venture down it or not

               she glances towards the door of her room from the other 
               side of which comes the reassuring sound of the hospital 
               going about its business whats to fear

               int corridor to hell  night

               she steps into the corridor the walls rise into darkness on 
               either side of her their surfaces like the interior of a 
               pyramid pitted with age and rotting away

               she starts towards the sobbing child bare feet on the 
               impacted earth of the passageway

               the sobbing gets louder as she advances her form disappearing 
               entirely as she passes through the intermittent darkness

               once she glances back towards the hospital room to reassure 
               herself that its still there it is though its no more 
               than a sliver of light at the far end of the passageway

               she advances a few more paces the atmosphere is growing 
               denser smoke thickens the air

               then a light glows at the other end of the corridor

               the sound of the sobbing child ceases

               she stops walking

               ahead the smoke clears and the light brightens and we see 
               a creature  the engineer  hanging in the space between 
               the walls it is in silhouette against the light but we can 
               see enough to know that it resembles no earthly animal its 
               vast black limbs hold it suspended above the corridor 
               clinging to the stone its front limbs vestigial by 
               comparison hang down from beneath its vast head its tail 
               is curled over its back

               kirstys expression registers this horror the engineer moves 
               into the light its irises narrow to slits from the tail a 
               vast sting oozing pus  like venom glides into view

               and then 

                it comes at her advancing along the corridor by bracing 
               its legs against the walls its breath is a growl in its 
               belly until it moves into darkness when all sound from it 
               ceases only to erupt again as it finds the light

               kirsty turns and starts to run

               it comes after her at speed darkness light darkness light 
               roars and silence 

               its jaws spill its thick saliva its eyes gleam

               kirsty runs blindly down the corridor back towards the safety 
               of the hospital room but its very close on her heels 
               lingering 

               as she comes within a few yards of the room it closes on 
               her

               int hospital room  night

               she flings herself through the door with the engineers breath 
               on her back and turns 

               the doorway has gone the wall is sealed she approaches the 
               wall the engineer scratches on the other side

               then she realises that the bell is still ringing and theres 
               a foul smell in the air

               she looks around

               shes not alone

               standing across the room from her lit by a strange 
               phosphorescence that has no visible source are four 
               extraordinary figures

               they are cenobites each of them is horribly mutilated by 
               systems of hooks and pins the garments they wear are 
               elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh laced 
               through skin in places hooked into bone

               the leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head at 
               inch intervals at his side a woman whose neck is pinned 
               open like a vivisection specimen accompanying them is a 
               creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping rectangle  the 
               exposed teeth sharpened to points and a fat sweating monster 
               whose eyes are covered by dark glasses

               when the lead cenobite speaks we recognise the voice as 
               that of the creature from the beginning of the film

               kirsty stares in amazement

                                     kirsty
                         where the hell did you come from

               the cenobite gestures the box is lying on the bed

                                     cenobite
                         the box you opened it we came

                                     kirsty

                         good suffering

               the chatterer comes for her as it does so desperation brings 
               a plan to kirstys head

                                     kirsty

                                     cenobite

                         significance has that

                                     kirsty

                         but if you cheat us

               we hear the sound of the engineer in the walls

                                     cenobite
                         well tear your soul apart

               we cut back to the cracking plaster which cracks further 
               we hear steves voice and pan back into an empty room steve 
               is in the doorway looking at the deserted bed

               the nurse is with him

                                     steve
                         she was trembling from head to foot

                                     nurse
                         i told you to wait with her

                         i thought she was going to collapse

               he approaches the bed

                                     nurse
                         it was a trick to get you out of 
                         the room ill start looking for 
                         her

               she exits

                                     steve
                         maybe shes gone back

                          to her fathers house

               int stairwell  night

               kirsty is hurrying down an echoing hospital stairwell 
               carrying the box wrapped up in a tshirt

               ext number 55  night

               lights burns in the house upstairs and down

               int hallway  night

               music is playing in the house a slow soft ballad which 
               drifts eerily along the corridor the briefcase that larry 
               brought in with him and set down in the hallway when julia 
               led him upstairs is still there we take it in then look 
               up the stairs from whence the music comes a naked bloody 
               figure moves across the landing is it larry

               int bedroom  night

               julia sits in front of the dressing table mirror she has a 
               glass of whisky in front of her she sips from it

               weve seen her in many moods through the story now we see a 
               mingling of fear and exhilaration in her face

               the door opens

               we see a reflection in the dressing room mirror it is the 
               figure we glimpsed on the landing

               she stands up and turns to him

               we cannot see the details of the man as he approaches her 
               but when he puts his fingers on her cheek he leaves a mark 
               there

               ext street  night

               kirsty hurries down the street the wind is chilly sometimes 
               we hear a bell in it

               ext street  night

               steve gets into his car and turns the ignition he drives 
               off in pursuit of kirsty

               int bedroom  night

               two shadowy naked figures stand face to face in the bedroom 
               we can see no detail of their features we move down their 
               bodies they are standing in a shining pool of blood

               the male of the couple pads towards the bedroom door leaving 
               a trail of blood behind him we can still see very little of 
               the man

               scene deleted 

               scene deleted

               ext lodovico street  night

               kirsty turns the corner of the street and starts down it 
               the wind is strong now it is full of sibilant whispers 
               hurrying her along

               int bedroom  night

               julia dresses

               ext doorstep  night

               kirsty reaches the doorstep as she does so the whispers die 
               away completely she beats on the door no reply

               she beats again more urgently

                                     kirsty

               we hear a voice offscreen is it frank or larry

               impossible to be sure

               the light is behind him his features are shadowy but we 
               can see that he is badly bruised

               cenobites voice

               kirsty turns away from larry julia leads her out into the 
               hallway

                                                                    cut to

               larry still sitting at the table his fingers drum a familiar 
               tattoo beneath his breath he hums colonel bogey

               int upper landing  night

               julia pushes open the door of the torture room it creaks 
               wide lying on the floor in the middle of the room is a 
               skinned corpse in a tangle of torn clothing

               it steams there is blood everywhere that too steams

               kirsty is revolted as she steps away from the door it slams 
               behind her she turns to try and wrestle it open again but 
               it wont be budged she turns again the cenobites are 
               standing in the room more shadow than substance

                                     cenobite
                         we want the man who did this

               she turns and starts to pull on the door this time it opens

                                     kirsty
                         no

               she starts down the stairs again the bell has begun to ring 
               again distantly and there is the sound of birds thousands 
               of birds beating on the other side of the hall

                                     julia
                         where are you going

               kirsty ignores her and hurries down to larry

                                     kirsty

                         here and it isnt over 

               int hallway  night

               kirsty descends the stairs larry has stepped out of the 
               dining room and is moving to intercept her as she makes her 
               way to the front door

               the sound of wings and bells  and a terrible slow thunder 
               which underpins it all  mounts in volume

               larry snatches at her arm

                                     larry
                         where are you going

                                     kirsty

               she shrugs off his arm the thunder is increasing

                                     larry
                         stay with me 

               julia is on the stairs watching this exchange

                                     larry
                          its all right really it is

               he touches her face fondly

                                     kirsty
                         i cant stay

               she goes to the door

                                     larry
                         come to daddy

               she hesitates at the door and turns

               int hallway  night kirstys pov

               the thunder fills kirstys head as she stares at larry who 
               has opened his arms to her

                                     larry
                         come to daddy

               her gaze moves up to julia who is on the stairs

                                     julia
                         no damn you 

               int hallway  night

                                     kirsty
                              mouths
                         oh my god

               everything is slowing down the bells and the thunder fill 
               the soundtrack

               larry smiles as kirsty moves towards him tears have begun 
               to fill her eyes she searches for him his smile decays as 
               he realizes her objective her nails rake his cheek the 
               flesh puckers and tears along the brow blood flows the 
               mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little and franks 
               twisted features come into view

                                     julia
                         frank

               kirsty screams as frank lunges for her the lights in the 
               hallway flicker and threaten to go out

               kirsty avoids franks blow but in doing so allows him to 
               get between her and the front door shes trapped his torn 
               face flapping he opens his jacket the interior of which is 
               bloodstained and pulls a knife from the lining

               suddenly julia is behind her gripping hold of her hair

               frank advances on kirsty but in the last moment before the 
               fatal stab kirsty twists avoiding the blow julia shrieks 
               and stumbles forward the knife gleaming as its buried to 
               the hilt in her side

               kirsty slips from between them julia collapses into franks 
               arms he holds her up

               kirsty makes a dive for the front door but frank lets julia 
               slip and intercepts kirsty julia falls back against the 
               wall dying kirsty retreats to the bottom of the stairs  
               frank follows

                                     frank
                         youre not leaving now 

               as he follows julia reaches out and takes hold of his sleeve

               kirsty flees the only route she can upstairs the house is 
               creaking in every board and rafter now

               frank turns on julia trapping her against the wall

                                     julia
                         help me frank for gods sake

               he puts his hands around her neck and leans towards her at 
               the last moment she seems to understand that he intends not 
               to kiss her but to steal what little life she has left

                                     julia
                         no frank 

               from the stairs kirsty glimpses him battering upon her

               then she looks away and runs up the stairs

               when we look back julia is withering in franks arms

               int lower landing  night

               the landing is smoky the lights have taken on a yellowish 
               tinge the air is full of moans

               kirsty is desperate for a hiding place she tries one of the 
               doors but its locked she opens another and the din of 
               birds wings gets louder

               int bird room  night

               a pov shot lunging towards kirsty in the doorway she 
               slams the door in the face of whatevers coming for her

               int hallway  night

               frank hears the door slam he drops julia to the ground 
               shes dead her flesh rotting on her face

               frank starts to climb the stairs his eyes burning with 
               hunger

               int lower landing  night

               kirsty is cornered from below franks voice

                                     frank
                         where are you beautiful

               kirsty starts up the second flight of stairs as franks 
               shadow is thrown up on the wall below

               int upper landing  night

               kirsty is faced with a choice the torture room door is open 
               but the skinned body is in there so instead she heads for 
               the junk room and opens the door

               int junk room  night

               moonlight falls through the window illuminating a chaos of 
               furniture and boxes she crosses to the window and tries to 
               get it open it wont budge

                                     frank
                              somewhere below
                         where are you honey

               she looks around for a lever to open the window with 

               int lower landing  night

               frank reaches the landing and opens the bedroom door calling 
               for her then he starts up the last flight of stairs

                                     frank
                         come to daddy

               int junk room  night

               kirsty lifts a cloth off one of the boxes staring up from 
               the box is the corpse of prudhoe his eyes and mouth open in 
               a silent shriek

               she reels back from the box terrified and as she does so 
               the door opens she backs into the shadows as frank shambles 
               into the room he scans the chaos

               we cut back to the shadows kirstys eyes are wild with 
               terror

               frank sees nothing he turns back to the door and shambles 
               away the door closes click

               kirsty breaks cover she crosses to the door and listens

               theres no sound cautiously she opens the door the landing 
               outside is deserted

               int upper landing  night

               she steps onto the empty landing the light swings gently 
               here is a subtle creaking in the walls but no sign of frank

               she goes to the bannister and looks down the stairwell to 
               see if theres any sign of him on the floor below nothing 
               behind her the torture room door opens

               suddenly frank lunges from the darkness of the room knife 
               in hand she flings herself out of the way of the swipe but 
               hes upon her in seconds cutting off her escape route to 
               the stairs

               she has no choice but to retreat towards the torture room 
               he comes upon her driving her backwards through the door 
               with jabs of the knife

               int torture room  night

               she backs into the room in the middle of which lies her 
               fathers corpse she looks down at its skinned face

                                     kirsty
                         oh my god

                                     frank
                         dont mourn him he was dead long 
                         before we laid a finger on him

               kirsty has been pushed to the limits of endurance she can 
               be terrorised and pushed no longer death looks easy by 
               comparison with more of franks horrors

                                     kirsty
                         you bastard 

                                     frank

                                     kirsty

                         talking to remember frank

               as he speaks the bell begins to toll again frank hesitates 
               in his approach towards her

                                     frank
                         whats going on

               light begins to pour through the walls of the room

                                     frank
                              realising
                         no

               he starts towards the door but hes too late the cenobites 
               are moving through the light towards him the chatterer 
               already stands in his way behind him the lead cenobite 
               speaks

                                     cenobite
                         frank

                                     frank
                         no

                                     female cenobite
                         we had to hear it from your own lips

                                     cenobite
                         frank

               frank turns on kirsty

                                     frank
                         you set me up you bitch you set me 
                         up

               the pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate 
               and the cenobites move through it towards frank

                                     cenobite
                              to kirsty
                         this isnt for your eyes

               kirsty crosses towards the door as she reaches for the handle 
               she hears frank roar behind her she turns he breaks between 
               the cenobites knife in hand but as he comes within striking 
               distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead

               they have their hooks in him we see in his arms and legs  
               in his back and sides in his scalp and neck and temples  
               hooks attached to countless chains which arrest his progress 
               they plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her 
               but at a gesture from the leader of the cenobites the chains 
               are hauled in he flings back his head yelling the knife 
               drops from his hand

                                     cenobite
                              to kirsty
                         out

               she turns back to the door and opens it frank is hauled 
               back towards the centre of the room

                                     frank
                         bitch

               the house is growling  from basement to eaves now as kirsty 
               steps onto the landing

               int upper landing  night

               behind her frank howls

               she looks back

               they have him in extremis his body spreadeagled hooks in 
               a hundred places pulling at his flesh he fights like a 
               wild animal snarling and cursing they pull the chains 
               tighter

               int torture room  night

               a close up of franks face he suddenly stops fighting he 
               raises his head his eyes staring up at kirsty from beneath 
               a bleeding sweating brow he flicks his tongue over his 
               bloodied lips

               then 

                he comes apart

               int upper landing  night

               the door slams as franks body is torn apart in a welter of 
               blood and flesh fragments

               something heavy thuds against the door

               kirsty turns and starts down the stairs

               int stairs  night

               she hurries down the stairs the walls creaking and groaning

               its dark the air full of groans

               ext lodovico street  night

               steve drives up to the house the sound of creaking is audible 
               to him too he goes to the door and knocks

               int stairs  night

               as kirsty starts down the next flight of stairs she sees the 
               female cenobite on the half landing she starts up towards 
               kirsty

                                     female cenobite
                         no need to leave so soon 

               there is more knocking on the door

                                     kirsty
                         keep away from me

               ext doorstep  night

               steve keeps beating on the door and tries to shoulder it 
               open

               useless he backs away from the door as he does so theres 
               a movement in the bushes and a wind passes through the trees

               for a moment it seems something is about to jump out at him

               but theres nothing

               he starts off down the side of the house while a baby sobs 
               distantly on the soundtrack

               int lower landingbedroom  night

               the sound of creaking is very loud now there are falls of 
               plaster dust from the ceiling we are aware that the house 
               is ready to fall around kirstys ears

               the female cenobite is on the lower landing now kirsty 
               glances through to the bedroom where the box sits on a chair 
               beside the door she can see it in a patch of moonlight she 
               crosses to the door and opens it reaching for the box without 
               looking up

               the lead cenobites voice makes her look up however he is 
               standing in the middle of the room the sound of birds loud 
               around him he is wiping his bloody hands on a sheet from 
               the bed on which julia has sprawled eyes wide and a staring 
               at the ceiling there is a horrid implication in the position 
               of the corpse and the state of its clothing the sheet around 
               the body is soaked in blood

                                     cenobite
                         just in time

                                     kirsty
                         stay the fuck away from me

               she starts to manipulate the box

                                     cenobite
                         weve got such sights to show you 

                                     kirsty
                         you can keep them

               the female cenobite has appeared at the door behind kirsty 
               as she tries to manipulate the box she starts to succeed 
               too

                                     cenobite
                         dont do that

               the cenobites image starts to break up

                                     cenobite
                              howled
                         damn you

               the cenobites howl fades as he is claimed by darkness his 
               image spiralling away into ether

               the female cenobite makes a sound of rage and comes at 
               kirsty but she has the knack of the box now the female is 
               also sucked away into nothingnesss her scream fading

               ext back door  night

               steve shoulders the door open there is smoke in the kitchen

               cups and saucers fall from the shelves as the house trembles

               all the cutlery rattles

               int stairs  night

               kirsty starts down the stairs again as the falls of dust 
               increase at the bottom of stairs an extraordinary sight a 
               bride heavily veiled kirsty hesitates the house grinds 
               around her suddenly a voice

                                     steve
                         is there anybody here

               she turns as steve appears around the corner from the 
               kitchen

               the veil is suddenly snatched from the figure behind

                                     kirsty
                         steve 

               its the chatterer at the back it snatches at the box its 
               hands closing around hers but she manages to close another 
               portion of the box steve moves towards her as the chatterer 
               is claimed by darkness as steve moves away from the corner 
               of the passage we see that the last of the cenobites  the 
               blind man  is coming for him weapon in hand the hook 
               goes for steves throat he cries out as the blood comes

               but suddenly the roof above the cenobite breaks open and a 
               fall of dust and filth buries the creature the fall which 
               misses steve by a hairs breadth drives both he and kirsty 
               into the vestibule

               there is a further fall of rubble and timbers down the stairs 
               effectively sealing off any escape route but the front door

                                     steve
                         lets get the hell out of here

               steve crosses past her to the door as he puts his hand on 
               the handle kirsty looks down to see that the box in her 
               hand still has one piece unfinished

                                     kirsty
                         dont

               too late he turns the handle the door is flung open and 
               the engineer clinging to the sides of the door swings down 
               into the hallway

               steve is flung backwards against kirsty the box falls from 
               kirstys hand the beast moves to bite at steve who scrambles 
               out of the way leaving kirsty in the front line

               the box lies between kirsty and the engineer which now uses 
               its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her its legs 
               still bracing it in the door

               she snatches for the box the engineer its mouth oozing 
               fluids almost catches her arm

               again she tries this time one of its arms seizes hold of 
               kirsty and drags her towards its jaws

               behind kirsty steve snatches up a piece of plaster and flings 
               it in the engineers face it momentarily relaxes its grip 
               on kirsty who slides her hand from its hold and claims the 
               box she now has slime on her fingers the box defies her 
               manipulations

                                     steve
                         come on come on

               the engineer crawls towards them up above the din of the 
               roof collapsing timbers and dust hurtle down the stairs

                                     kirsty
                         shit shit shit

               the engineer is almost upon her it rears up its saliva 
               dropping on her

               and then miraculously the last piece of the box slots into 
               place

               the same vortex that seized the other cenobite seizes the 
               engineer howling its complaint it is drawn out into the 
               darkness beyond the door and disappears

               its voice grows thin and fades

               finally silence

               the house is still

               kirsty gets to her feet steve does the same

               together they move to the door and out onto the step

               scene deleted

               ext number 55  night

               the roars and creaks from the house cease

               ext wasteland  night

               the fire burns in a wasteland kirsty and steve stand at a 
               distance watching it now kirsty starts towards it steve 
               follows

               when she reaches the fire she throws the box into the flames 
               they both watch it consumed there is a look of satisfaction 
               in kirstys face the damned thing is finally destroyed

               they leave the fire heading off towards the street

               when theyre some distance away a familiar figure shambles 
               out of the darkness on the far side of the bonfire its the 
               derelict we first saw in the pet shop he watches kirsty and 
               steve for a moment then he steps into the middle of the 
               fire

               the sound of the flames draws kirstys attention she turns

               the derelict bends down and picks up something from the ashes

                                     kirsty
                         steve

               steve now turns and both of them watch as the derelict stands 
               up burning from head to foot with the box in his hand it 
               is untouched by the flames

               we see the flames consume the derelict the beard ignites 
               and burns away the face crisps and curls the flesh falls 
               away

               beneath blackness in the midst of which we glimpse yellow 
               slits of eyes 

               then a wind the flames billow up around the figure and 
               are just as suddenly extinguished

               the wind blows towards steve and kirsty carrying ashes

               we have the pov of the ashes rushing towards steve and 
               kirsty 

               suddenly they or the spirit in the wind rises up over 
               kirsty and steves head it climbs at a great rate leaving 
               the two figures diminutive beneath

               and on the wind the voice kirsty heard out of her radio 
               the nameless evangelist 

                                     evangelist
                         the devil hears you the devil sees 
                         you every night every day the 
                         devil knows your souls

               darkness
