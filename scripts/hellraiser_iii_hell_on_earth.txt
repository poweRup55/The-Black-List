ext   derelict street   twilight

night is falling in a forgotten part of the city

the streetlights are a joke  three out of four are dead
only a large moon and some cloudstreaked stars illuminate this
dark and derelict street

once the hub of an industrial area now the buildings are
abandoned the sidewalks choked with litter and debris  stores
are boardedup windows are glassless walls are graffitied

at various points several bums warm their hands at trashcan
fires

angle on two bums

  as their eyes move following something moving down the
street  heard off is the sound of a smooth and powerful
engine

angle on street

down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an
incongruously expensive car  a range rover a rich kid is
going shopping

the car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only
open store on the block

angle on store

a dim light bulb shines within  the only indicator that the
store is still trading  its windows are grimy its door
defaced  above the door  barely legible through the accrued
dirt of city years  a sign carduccis antiques and curios

angle on car

the side door opens  helped on its way by the kick of an
expensive leather boot  and jp monroe steps out

jp is 24 rich handsome and spoiled his hair is slick with
designergrease his slim frame is wrapped in a 600 leather
jacket

for a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous
glances up and down the ruined street  he shows no anxiety at
being in this twilight part of town  cocooned in the
confidence of wealth hes never felt threatened in his life
satisfied hes in the right place he walks confidently through
the doorway



                                                            2

int   carduccis antiques   night

the store itself looks like an antique  old wood panelling and
shelving victorian display cases and faded wallpaper  it is
grimy dusty and dimlylit  and apparently unattended

it is packed with merchandise  shelves and aisles overflow
onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through

the stock is a strange surreal mix  discarded items from 50s
america norge fridges toasters frankie lymon albums share
space with older items framed pictures victorian automata
wax dolls and a specialty of the store items of punishment
stocks iron boots chastity belts whips could that really
be an electric chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room

angle on jp

he wanders through the merchandise casting appraising glances
at some items  some he even runs his hands over  grimacing at
the dust and grime they leave on his fingers  but his manner
suggests he is looking for something specific

near the rooms center is an old hoarding from the dead days of
vaudeville and travelling shows  it is tall and broad and is
leaning against something behind it

angle on hoarding

  which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of
hyperbolic comeons to longdead punters

you will be amazed they shouldnt be alive freaks of nature
an educational show for all the family presented under the
auspices of professor emmanuel bocklin tragedian and
menagerist

angle on jp

  as he moves the hoarding aside

                           jp
              wow 

revealed is a sixfoot tall black rectangular pillar covered
in beautifully detailed 3d carvings all in the same mattblack
finish as the pillar itself  the pillar is extremely bizarre
as if a new york avantgarde sculptor has interpreted a totem
pole for jaded modern tastes  the carvings are of dead rats
copulating skeletons  filigreepatterned boxes and faces

one of these faces  recognizable to the audience but not to jp
 is the ossified visage of pinhead the demon from the first
two hellraiser pictures

                                                            3

angle on jp

  as he leans in to study this face already fascinated by its
calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom

a voice off startles him

                           bum
              you want it

jp whirls round in shock  a bum is standing close to him

angle on bum

he has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard
his eyes are a piercing excited blue  otherwise he is
indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside –
ragged tatty clothes features blackened with grime

angle on jp

  as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door
beyond has this character just wandered in from the street

                           jp
              is it yours

angle on both

the bum smiles shaking his head knowingly

                           bum
              no  not mine  yours

jp nods still a little uncertain

                           jp
              how much do you want for it

                           bum
              whatever you think its worth

jp digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of
cash  without counting or checking he proffers it

the bums hand flies out and siezes jps pressing the money
between their palms making the exchange into a handclasp

in the background out of focus is pinheads face on the
pillar

                           bum off
              enjoy 


                                                            4

the focus switches so that the hands in foreground blur and
pinheads frozen face becomes sharp as if he is silently
watching this deal take place

the bums hand moves away with the money as we

fade to black


int   hospital emergency room   night

blackness   voice over

                           joey
              its a mystery to me 

smashcut to fullframe video image image of joanne
summerskill standing and looking directly into camera as if
we are watching a tv broadcast  in shot behind her is a quiet
hospital emergency room  no patients no staff just beds and
intensivecare equipment

joanne  or joey as she prefers to be called  is 23 years
old an attractive and clever brunette with a quiet sadness in
her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden

dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a tv newsperson she
holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station wqqy

her direct address to the unseen tv camera continues

                           joey
              most nights this innercity emergency
              room would be a chaos of blood and panic
              and grace under pressure  but tonight
              as you see its like death took a
              holiday  its a mystery to me  a
              mystery how those assholes at
              assignments knew it  this is joey
              summerskill for wqqy  emergency room
              no story  really really pissed off

despite the nature of her last few words joey has ironically
kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster  now she
breaks mood looks away from the camera and with a dismissive
wave of the hand begins to walk out of shot

                           joey
              ah break it down doc  its a bust

cut to wide

  to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but
are in the er in real time  as well as joey the room contains
her cameraman doc fisher and an er nurse
                                                            5

doc  a 45 year old with a weight problem a nicotine
addiction and a cynical attitude  lowers a shouldermounted
video camera and watches joey walk to a watercooler against a
wall his expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy

the nurse is a middleaged woman of asian ancestry  she has a
puzzled expression as she addresses doc

                           nurse
              she can talk like this on television
              she can say this thing  this assholes

doc replies but keeps his eyes on joey as he crosses to her

                           doc
              no sweat sweetheart  its for the
              european satellite   joey rein it
              in kid  they couldntve known

joey sucks angrily at water from a papercup and then crushes
and bins the cup like an act of revenge

                           joey
              i know  i know  but its just so 
              neat isnt it  the first gig that
              isnt cute kids or diet gurus and its
              taken away from me

                           doc
              yeah well like you said  its a
              mystery  but thats all it is
              mystery  not malice  what you think
              the station paid off every accident
              victim in the city to  

doc is interrupted by the ringing of a cellphone he has
holstered at his waist  he picks it up

                           doc
              speak

                           cellphone

              hurry  youve got ambulances to beat

the line goes dead  doc looks at joey  she heard it all  he
shrugs apologetically

                                                            6

                           joey
              better hurry doc  a real story  with
              a real reporter

                           doc
              joey   look you wanna ride  i can
              go by your place

                           joey
              youd lose the moneyshots  no  ill
              catch a bus  or a cab  dont worry
              about it  go

                           doc
              ok  be careful  and lighten up  story
              of your life could be right round the
              corner

                           joey
              that is the story of my life

with a rueful smile joey watches doc leave

joey and the nurse exchange glances  joeys impassive but
vaguely friendly the nurses a little disapproving if the
cameras gone what the hell are you still doing here


int   hospital corridor   night

joey makes her solitary way along a mediumlength corridor
that has two sets of double swing doors at either end one set
giving on to the er the other toward an exit  joey is heading
for the latter her mood sad and defeated

angle on exit doors

suddenly  smash  the doors burst open from the other side

angle on corridor

the mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled
rapidly through the doors

two paramedics both male both about joeys age are pushing
the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other  they
completely ignore joey and also ignore the teenage girl who is
running beside the gurney

the girl  terri  is 18 or 19  she is a palefaced blonde
dressed as if for a desperatelyseekingsusan party and is
keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses



                                                            7

as joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them
pass it is neither the paramedics nor terri that get her
attention  it is the boy on the gurney

angle on gurneyboy

the teenage boy lies flat on his back semiconscious his
eyelids fluttering his breathing shallow

horribly shockingly dangling from his face and body are long
heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor
there are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried
in his skin

angle on corridor

the dialogue as the gurney is rushed to the er doors is rapid
fire and overlapped the paramedics responding only to each
other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions

                           terri
              it wasnt my fault  it wasnt my fault

                           paramedic 1
              10 milligram iv valium stat  how the
              fuck did this happen  

                           terri
              it was outside  i wasnt even with him

                           paramedic 2
              you ever see anything like this before

                           terri
              he must have stolen it

                           joey
              whats going on

                           paramedic 1
              yeah sure  five times a fucking day
              just push

once the gurney has passed her joey runs along behind it

                           terri
              it was off the statue  in the club

                           joey
              what happened to him

                           paramedic 2
              think theyll get him back


                                                            8

                           terri
              its nothing to do with me

                            paramedic 1
              worst case of status ive seen  even
              money at best

the foot of the gurney slams into the er doors and the
paramedics slide it rapidly through

                           joey
              wait  im a reporter  tell me where he
              was 

angle on er through doors

the nurse and a middleaged doctor are seen through the doors
preparing emergency equipment  the doctor already has
fibrillator pads in his hands

the paramedics follow the gurney through and turning rapidly
push the doors closed from the inside

angle on corridor

joey and terri are alone excluded from the er activity joey
turns to speak but terri is already halfway to the other doors

joey runs after her

                           joey
              hold on  hold on please  i need
              talk to you

                           terri
                     over her shoulder
              its nothing to do with me  i wasnt
              even with him

joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the doors
she grabs at her arm to slow her down

terri turns snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of fierce
anger  she backs toward the doors making gestures of
dismissal and denial with her hands

                           terri
              look lady  i told you  its not my
              problem  i was just there

                           joey
              where



                                                            9

                           terri
              under the underground  can i like go
              now

                           joey
              under the underground  whats that
              where is 

suddenly the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly
loud scream agonized and terrified coming from the er

both girls freeze but then their reactions are very different
joey turns instantly and runs back toward the er  terri
watches her for a beat and then heads through the other doors

the scream continues a howling horrible sound

joey reaches the er doors and throws them open  and freezes in
terrified shock


int  emergency room   night

the doctor

  is on the floor as if flung there by some powerful force
the fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression
is awestruck and disbelieving

the nurse

  is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments
muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross

the two paramedics

  are flattened against the far wall terror on their faces

angle on table

the boy is on the emergency table  its him thats screaming
his body is arched tight in shock eyes and mouth wide open

hes wired up to an ecg and the monitor shows a heartbeat that
should be measured on the richter scale

the chains  all still connected to his face and his body – are
rigid and tight being pulled straight up into the air as if
tugged taut by invisible hands

the boys skin is stretched and pulled at those points where
the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible
that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues


                                                            10

the scene is held for a terrible frozen moment  then suddenly
the chains drop the scream stops and the boys body slumps

there is a massive electrical surge  the ecg flatlines before
it and the other monitors go haywire sparking and spluttering

cut to wide

the lights in the room flicker and strobe

the fibrillator pads arc angrily the doctor flings them away

electric energy seems to run along the slumped chains and they
disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric meltdown

lighting and machinery return to normal ecg still flatlining
and the medical staff stare thunderstruck at the dead boy

for the first time the other people in the er become aware of
joeys presence in the doorway

                           doctor
              whos that  get her out of here

the nurse heads for the doors  joey is already backing away

angle through doors into corridor

  as joey backs away an expression of numbed shock on her
face  the doors close over blocking her out

angle on fibrillator pads

  still arcing

crossfade to


int   crosstown bus    night

close on flickering neon light in the bus cabin

angle on joey

  glancing at the light from her seat

joeys pov  various angles

the bus is almost deserted  three other passengers  a punk a
bag lady and a wino  are spread out around the interior  all
seem lost in worlds of their own but their vacant alienated
stares highlight joeys isolation and tension  fear has
entered her life


                                                            11

the bus moves through the neonlit loneliness of downtown
streets

angle on joey

  her face lit by reflected storesigns and streetlights is
lost and distant as if she is submerged in some dreamsea of
memory and sadness

int   tv station editing suite   day

a wall of tv monitors each monitor showing joey sitting on a
couch with a painfully thin older woman  brittany vertue

brittanys probably 50 but her face is as tight and smooth as
surgery can make it  she is dressed in the standard uniform of
the healthavatar brightlycolored leotard over black tights

joey has a big paperback book  beyond hunger the brittany
vertue guide to holistic dieting  which she holds to camera
she smiles and turning to face brittany crosses her legs

the image freezes  and replays  joey crosses her legs again
and again  and again

              see you gotta remember joey this is a
              local station  as in local to this
              galaxy

joey slams her coffee mug down and stands up

                           joey
              theres a story out there

                                                            13

                           brad
                     jumping in warningly
              not on station time

face then turns to doc

                           brad
              lot of attitude there doc 

he starts up the video tape again and on the monitors joey
once again crosses her legs on the couch

                           brad
               but great legs


int   under the underground   night

close on a screaming male face twisted as in pain or fury

pull back rapidly to reveal the face belongs to the lead singer
of thanatos  he is on a nightclub stage with the rest of the
band all of them dressed in that shitpoorwhitetrashondope
look favored by all such rich young businessmen with guitars

a tatty banner across the back of the stage proclaims under
the underground presents thanatos

the scream ends replaced with the roaring thunder of drums and
guitars as thanatos kick into some thrashmetal

the dancefloor of the club is packed with kids dancing to the
incredibly fast incredibly loud music

many of the kids favor the same look as the band but its not
exclusive college types are there too along with some – male
and female  sporting the glitzmeetssleaze look of terri

the club itself is of course dimlylit and the basic decor is
black  where it is distinguished from hundreds of others is in
the bizarre sculptures and pieces of artwork that hang from the
ceiling and walls all in tones of black silver and gray

various angles on sculptures

a headless armless torso wrapped in barbed wire

a pair of male and female heads  bonsailike trees grow out of
every orifice  eyesockets nostrils ears and mouths

                                                            14

a human arm with the skin and flesh of its upper half peeled
open and pinned out to reveal inside  instead of bone and
sinew  an entire miniature metropolis beautifully detailed

a black bird cage containing a fetal skeleton

various angles on club

kids also crowd the bar and the tables on the outskirts of the
dance floor  it is a hot sweaty faintly aggressive
atmosphere  people jostling for position shouting to be
heard etc etc

the camera finds joey  incongruous by dress and demeanor –
pushing her way among the crowd

the music is too loud and overpowering to hear joeys voice but
it is clear as she moves through the confines of the club that
she is approaching various people and enquiring after terri

four kids at a table

 shake their heads and shrug

a punk

 stares blankly and blinks

two bimbos

 giggle purse their lips shake their heads

joey

  catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance
floor and pushes through the crowd to follow  she taps the
figures arm but as it turns she realizes it is a man – some
70s revivalist glitterrocker  he looks quizzically at her

joeys mouth moves and this time she seems to get some
response  the glitterrocker mouths a name

joey cant hear him  she hands him a business card and a pen

he scrawls a name on the back of the card and joey nods her
thanks as he moves on

close angle on card

  as joey reads the name terri on it  she flips the card to
reveal her name and number and writes terri  please call

angle on bar


                                                            15

  as joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a barman
who looks at it nods and puts it beneath the counter

angle on exit

  as joey makes her way out

angle on dance floor

camera moves into the tightlypacked throng on the dance floor
making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center

the crowd parts slightly to reveal in the direct center of the
floor the tall black pillar from the opening sequence

the pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele
dance around it  it seems very in keeping with the decor of
the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence

the pillar has been mounted upside down so that it looks even
odder than our first glimpse of it  near the bottom the
inverted face of pinhead black and frozen can be seen

the camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary motion
to the pillars own movement and as it does so draws closer
and closer making for a disorienting vertiginous image

as this happens the raucous sound of the band thanatos begins
to fade into a whirl of echo and to be replaced by a whirring
spinning sound which we only recognize fully as we

cut to


ext   dense jungle   day     joeys dream

the screen is filled with dense jungle foliage

the chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound of
helicopter blades one element of a sound montage conveying the
sense and feel of a jungle war helicopters in flight machine
gun fire distant explosions confused shouts and cries

a pov camera pushes its way through the lush humid greenery

the camera seems to be searching for something glancing this
way and that shoving leaves and tall grass aside

voices begin to emerge clearly from the sound mass offscreen
as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her goal

                           soldier 1
                         off
              call for a medivac

                                                            16

                           soldier 2
                         off
              dont die man  dont fucking die

the dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the
pov camera  pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage
it finally gains a clearer view and stops looking ahead

in a tiny clearing ten feet from the camera still partially
obscured by the jungle two camouflageclad soldiers lean over
the prone body of a third  it is unclear due to distance but
there is a lot of blood on the soldiers body and uniform

a new sound joins the sound montage  a persistent rhythmic
ringing sound  the other elements die away until only this is
left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we

cut to


int   bedroom joeys apartment   night

joey jerks upright in bed as the ringing continues  confused
and disoriented her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if
shes trying to understand where she is and what is happening

finally she registers the phone and leans toward her bedside
table to pick it up

angle on bedside table

  favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to the
phone  its warm green figures show the time is 235

                           joey
                     off sleepily
              god  this better be birth marriage or
              death 

angle on joey

  as she picks up the handset and puts it to her ear

                           joey
              uhhuh

                           terri
                     on phone
              uh  hi  is this  er  joanne

                                                            17

                           terri
              you like  left me a card  at the
              club

                           joey
              right  right

joey swings out of bed to sit on the edge much more alert now

                           terri
              right  so  well what do you want

                           joey

              the hospital last night

joey cant resist another glance at the clock

                           joey
              yeah  sure  you mean  tonight

                           terri
                     surprised at joeys surprise
                      bit of a culture clash here
              of course tonight  is that a problem
              like if youve got a guy there or
              something 

                           joey
              no  no  its fine  come now  i was
              having bad dreams anyway


int   main room joeys apt    night

close on the front door of the apartment as it opens to reveal
terri leaning against the doorframe

clad identically to how we last saw her terri clutches a well
stuffed leather bag containing all her worldly possessions

                           terri
              hi  howre you doing

not waiting for either reply or invitation she moves forward

                                                            18

  as terri walks past the dressinggowned joey and heads
straight for joeys sofa and sprawls on it laying her bag on
the floor beside her

                           terri
              you got anything to drink

joey closes the door raised eyebrows registering her slight
disapproval at terris cavalier attitude  her voice however
is polite

                           joey
              i put some decaf on  er  make
              yourself comfortable

                           terri
              right

joey walks past terri and through to her kitchen from where we
hear the sound of coffee being poured

terri looks around at joeys room

various angles on room

the large and spacious room suggests that even if joey is
dissatisfied with her job shes at least being paid enough to
make it bearable  the room is very ordered very neat but
stops short of being prissy

a very large picture window takes up all of one wall  at the
moment of course the drapes are closed  another wall is taken
up by a huge shelf unit packed with books videos and cds
joeys obsession with getting the whole story seems to be
true of her personal life as well as her professional

angle on terri

  having finished her quick examination she calls out

                           terri
              so  what was your bad dream

joey reenters carrying two mugs of coffee

                           joey
              what

                           terri
              your dream  you said you were having a
              bad dream

                           joey
              oh yeah 

                                                            19

she hands one coffee to terri and sits opposite her

                           joey
               well ive been having it for years

              why are you so interested

                           terri

              vietnam  i never knew him  never met
              him  we dont even know the details  i
              dream of battlefields  of searching
              of trying to find out

                           terri
              thats great

                           joey

                                                            20

                           terri
              whatever  all i know is  this is it
              for me  just me my bag and a series
              of shithead boyfriends  itd be good to
              see something else  have a nighttime
              life  be somebody different

terri pauses then smiles like shes just realized something

                           terri
              hey  this is great isnt it  just
              girls talking  like having a
              conversation  good coffee  you got a
              cigarette

joey waits letting herself catch up with terris goodnatured
but marginally strungout personality  she looks around the
room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes

                           joey
              uh   yeah  yeah somewhere  wait a
              minute

joey crosses to the big shelfunit and pulls out a concealed
pack of cigarettes a zippo lighter and an ashtray from behind
a shelf of videos  we notice that the videos are the world at
war volumes 1 thru 26  she brings the smokes to terri

                           terri
              great  thanks  you gonna have one

                           joey
              im trying to quit

                           terri
              oh go on  have one  fuck it  you
              think youre going to live forever

she smiles and proffers the pack to joey who shrugs smiles
and takes one  terri picks up the zippo and sparks it a huge
flame leaps out of the lighter producing an instant of terror
from terri  joey pulls the lighter back from terri and closes
the lid extinguishing the flame  terri draws a book of matches
from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette

                           joey
              sorry  it was my fathers  its
              temperamental

                           terri
              its okay  its just someone burned me
              once



                                                            21

joey takes the book of matches from terris hands and lights
both cigarettes  terri takes a long fearful look at the
burning flame and then takes a deep calming drag of her
cigarette

                           terri
              wanna know how i look at it  way i see
              it is  you give up right  three
              days later you get hit by a fucking
              truck and you know  you just know –
              that your last thought as you go under
              those wheelsd be jesus h christ i
              coulda smoked another three packs

she lays the book of matches down  joeys eyes go to them

terris eyes flick to the matchbook and her mood changes
becoming subdued and a little sullen

                           terri
              oh  you wanna talk about that stuff

                           joey
              yes i do  terri something awful
              happened to that boy  i have to find
              out what it was

                           terri
              but i dont know anything  really  i
              just came out of the club and the kid
              was already in the street  he

              did you know him

                           terri
              no  id seen him in there a few times
              before  he was just a punk  id never
              like danced with him or anything
              anyway he was a thief  he mustve
              taken it from the statue

                           joey
              taken what

                           terri
              the thing  he was lying there in the
              street moaning  but he pointed at it
              
                                                            22

                           joey
              wait a minute  he was already 
              wounded  when you found him

                           terri
              yeah  thats what im saying  and it
              was lying next to him  and he pointed
              at it before he passed out and 

                           joey
              wait  wait  the chains  where did the
              chains come from

                           terri
              thats what im trying to tell you 

terri rummages in her bag getting hold of something

                           terri
              he said they came out of this

she holds her hand out and the camera tracks in to meet it

angle on terris handbox

resting on her palm is a black cube about 4 inches square  it
has the same mattblack carbonized look as the pillar and is
recognizable as one of the carvings we saw on it

there is fine filigree patternwork over each of its surfaces
and to audiences familiar with the hellraiser movies the box
is recognizable despite its black coating it is the lament
configuration the puzzle box that opens the doors to hell

there is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of
the box  presumably where the boy from er had broken it off
the pillar  camera favors this jagged shard as we

crossfade to

very close on its upper left section  we are looking at a hole
in the pillar that matches the pattern of the shard on the box

cut to wide

the club is empty  the dim lighting of working hours has been
replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes
and the club has that eerie notquiteright look that all night
places have when subjected to a harsher light

                                                            23

two workers are in the final stages of clearing the nights
debris  emptying trash into big black plastic bags wiping
down tables and bars etc

work completed they head to the main exit

one of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent
clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting
the other shouts across the apparently deserted club

                           worker
              all done mr monroe

they stand a second but no response comes  the first turns to
the second and shrugs

                           worker
                     mouthing silently
              ass hole

his coworker grins and they let themselves out

a beat  another door opens into the club and jp monroe – the
clubs owner and the man we saw buy the pillar   walks into
the main room of the club from his private room at the back

jp walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom
he describes a circle around the dance floor throwing glances
at his odd sculptures and finally walks into the center of the
room to stand before the pride of his collection the pillar

the pillar of course is stationary at this time though it is
still mounted upside down

jp smiles possessively at the pillar  and then registers the
mutilation where the box has been ripped away

                           jp
              what the  

he leans in closer to stare at the hole

suddenly jarringly there is a quiet but distinct squeak that
seems to come from within the hole

jp starts back a little a small expression of anxiety on his
normally supercilious face  he glances to right and left gets
a grip and leans forward again

angle on pillarhole

  as again the noise comes  is it a squeak  or is it the
creaking shifting of hidden machinery hidden chains


                                                            24

jps hand moves tentatively into shot approaching the hole
slowly slowly it reaches wristdeep into the blackness

angle on jp

very close on jps face  quizzical enquiring  and suddenly
contorted in pain

                           jp
              aaaaaahh

angle on pillarhole

  as jps hand whips out of the hole shaking in shock and
pain  a rat is hanging on to one of jps fingers its sharp
teeth buried in the flesh

jp swings his arm violently through the air dislodging the rat
with the force of his swing  a spray of blood is seen to come
from jps wounded finger

angle on rat

  as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and
scurries away deeper into the darkness squeaking furiously

angle on jp

  as he looks down at his finger face snarling

                           jp
              son of a 

angle on finger

very close  blood seeps from the tiny teeth marks

                           jp
                         off
               bi 

jps voice is cut off by a strange sizzling noise heard off

jps face moves up to look at the pillar  a look of awe and
shock crosses his face

angle on pillar

some small drops of blood stand out bright red on the blackness
of the pillar  the sizzling noise is coming from them

suddenly the drops draw together magically into one large ruby
of blood  already larger than possibility would allow  then
it gets wierder the blood suddenly dissipates into six or
seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar
                                                            25

the streams of blood dont simply fall straight  they seem to
follow some pregouged pattern running down the pillar tracing
the blackened organic contours of the carvings

they all culminate at the point of pinheads chin  and then
separate again running over his frozen black face along the
carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features

when every canal line on the demons face is filled neatly with
blood a blue light seems to glow from within the pillar
through pinheads face giving it temporarily the blue tone he
had enjoyed in unlife

angle on jp

close on his awestruck face  bathed in reflected blue light

angle on pinhead

  as gradually the blueness subsides again the visible blood
vanishing with it leaving the same frozen implacable blackness
as before but charged now with a waiting power

fade to black


int   kitchen joeys apt   day      next morning

blackness

                           joey
                          off
              oh my god 

close on stove top

a frying pan sits atop a burner  it contains the ugliest mess
of scrambled eggs you have ever seen  or perhaps its an
omelette  there are other ingredients in there but theyre
burnt so black theyre unrecognizable  at least half of the
mixture lies all over the stove top instead of in the pan

                           joey
                          off
              did i sleep through an earthquake

various angles

  showing the chaos all around the kitchen spilled flour on
work surfaces eggshells on the linoleum a knockedover glass
of orange juice the juice soaking into a piece of kitchen

molasses

joey in her dressinggown stands in the doorway with a
shocked expression on her face

terri in an oversized mans shirt stands by the stove holding
a fishslice and smiling nervously

                           terri

joey watches terri walk out of the kitchen sighs in relief
and grabs the kettle


int   main room joeys apt

joey sits drinking her coffee as terri walks round the room
with hers

                           terri

terri walks past joeys tv set sound down cartoons playing

angle on tv

the box is on top of the tv  in the warm light of morning it
seems innocuous and harmless like just another ornament

different angle

  as terri walks on pausing by the shelves of books

                           terri
              wow  lotta books  you read all these

                           joey
              no  i buy them to impress people  of
              course ive read them

                           terri
              cool  i read a book once  it was like
              all these people discovering who they
              used to be  you know like
              reincarnation  it was really good  you
              ever read that

                           joey
              i dont think so  but its a
              fascinating subject  did you 

but terri has already moved on  she is by the big picture
window  the drapes are now open

                           terri
              great view  great view  look at this

joey stands and walks to join terri

                           joey
              actually im pretty familiar with the
              view 

girls pov  through window

joeys apartment is on a high floor and her window overlooks
many lower buildings giving a view of the city beyond




                                                            28

                           joey
                          off
               but it is good  you know over to
              the left you can 

                           terri
                     looking to right and pointing
              whos that

on the flat roof of a nearby building a retarded teenage boy
sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small
jerrybuilt pigeon coop  its door is open and it is empty

the boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude his
stillness and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an
atmosphere of sadness and loss

as joey tells his story we intercut between the pov of the
roof and the girls at the window

                           joey
              i dont know his name   i saw the
              whole story  a wounded bird was on his
              roof  i could hear its cries from here
              he went straight to it  i couldntve
              id be frozen between pity and fear
              but he wasnt  its pain spoke directly
              to him  he picked it up  nursed it
              fed it  and it got better  everyday
              hed watch the pigeon  everyday the
              pigeon would watch him i saw him learn
              learn that there was one more thing he
              had to do to make the rescue complete
              and one day just as afternoon became
              evening he leaned over opened the
              cage and walked away  didnt look
              back  but he heard the sound of its
              wings

                           terri
              and he still sits there

                           joey
              every day

                           terri
              maybe he thinks itll come back

                           joey
              no  he knows it wont  it was his
              final act of love and part of him knows
              that and part of him doesnt yet



                                                            29

                           terri
              bullshit  he shouldve kept it  itd
              live longer  its dangerous out there
              people get hurt

angle on joey

  as she realizes she has a wounded pigeon of her own

                           joey
              what  i wasnt talking about  i 
              do you want to stay  you want to stay
              here for a while

terri shrugs gives a nervous smile

joey crosses to the tv picks up the box and weighs it in her
hand

                           joey
              ok  ok  its a done deal  but look –
              you have to help me  ive got to solve
              this thing  ive got to know whats
              going on

terri follows across the room and sits on the sofa

                           terri
              but i dont know whats going on

                           joey
              maybe not  but you know more than i do
              you know something about this box
              something about a statue

                           terri
              yeah  i found it  i knew held like it
              and i figured

              there  he bought the statue

              found it





                                                            30

                           terri

                           terri
              sure  why

                           joey
              its saturday morning  lets go
              shopping


ext   derelict street   day

joeys mazda 323 drives down the street

the daylight street is still creepy but in a different way no
bums no trashcan fires nothing  it has the feel of a ghost
town as if nothing has breathed here for years

angle in car

joey at the wheel has a disbelieving look on her face

terri smoking flicks ash through her wounddown window

                           joey
              jesus  are you sure this is the street

                           terri
              yeah  happening isnt it

                           joey
              what on earth were you doing down here

an evasive silence

                           joey
              terri

                           terri
              buying some drugs alright

                           joey
              oh terri 



                                                            31

                           terri
              for somebody else alright  not for me
              i dont do that shit anymore

                           joey
              then you shouldnt even be around it
              you know its 

                           terri
              here  here  pull over

joey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store

terri scrambles out of the passenger door

                           terri
              yeah  see  i told you it was here

close angle on joey

  as she looks at terri from behind her face worried for her
new and screwedup friend


int   carducci’s antiques   day

joey and terri enter the store

the store is different its selection of merchandise reduced
the 50s and 60s junk hardware is still there along with some
of the more mundane victoriana but it seems more normal –
none of the odd items of punishment memorabilia are there

also because it is daylight the store seems merely old
interesting and musty not creepy or odd

there seems to be noone in attendance

angle on girls

  as they walk through the store

                           mama
                          off
              can i help

the voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the
counter as mama carducci moves into view from beneath it

mama an ancient and slightly eccentric italianamerican woman
eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasnt had a
customer in decades  not aggressive just surprised



                                                            32

                           joey
              yes  thank you  we were wondering 
              terri show her the box

terri removes the box from her purse and holds it up

                           mama
              no  sorry  not interested  not for my
              customers  have you tried

              everything sold as is  no guarantees
              no returns

                           joey
              no  we want 

                           mama
              i took back everything bought on a whim

              lady will you shut the fuck up and give
              her a break

a sudden silence  both mama and joey stare at terri in
surprise

mama looks back at joey

                           mama
              quite a mouth  so whats the problem
              you tell me  you i like

joey smiles  terri raises her eyes to heaven  mama waits

                           joey
              thank you  this came off a  statue
              a pillar  we wondered if you knew
              anything about the piece  about where
              it came from

mama squints at the box as if trying to recognize it

                           mama
              oh  yeah  yeah  that thing  ugly
              real ugly  i sold that

mamas eyes scan the store

                                                            33

                           mama

              the store feel strange  whod make such

              anything about it

angle on rear of store

joey and terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall

a shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden
floor a few yards in front of the shelves

joey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and
begins to look through it

                           joey
              terri check out the other folder

terri still holding her purse and the box looks around for
somewhere to put them  all the shelves are full  she lays
them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins joey at
the shelves grabbing up the second folder

                           terri
              what am i looking for

                           joey
              god knows  anything  contacts  clues

terri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she
flicks through the contents

                           terri
              jesus  youre gonna pay her for this
              shit  its like fucking business papers
              for gods sake

bored terri wanders off to lean against another shelfunit

angle over joeys shoulder on folder

  as she flicks through the contents

terris dismissive summary seems justified  all joey sees are
obscure and meaningless casenotes and paperwork  each item is
letterheaded the channard institute

joeys hand reaches a large envelope  scrawled in hand across
it is the phrase dr channard  personal papers  joey draws
the contents out and begins to sift through them

the first item is a dusty blackandwhite photograph of an
officer in english army uniform circa 1920  joey blows the
dust from the photo

low angle  on box

  which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight the dust
from the photo settling next to it

on joey

the next photo is that of a beautiful young woman  joey flips
it over  gummed on the back is a typewritten slip that says
cotton kirsty  case no  5719

on box

the sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard off
and then fades as something strange begins to happen

suddenly the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by
an invisible wind  it is drawn up so that it forms an
impossible spiral in the air  spinning like a miniature
hurricane it hovers over the box  the sunlight seems to grow
brighter  is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or
is the box itself glowing and shining

                                                            35

close angle on joeys face

  as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans 

joey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what
she is seeing 

the next item in the folder is a xerox sheet a reproduction of
what appears to be an ancient document

it is a diagram like a designers drawing or plan  and it is
of the box seen from various angles

close angle on joeys face

  as she realizes what she is looking at

                           joey
                        softly
              alright 

joey turns folder in hand to look at the box on the floor and
compare it to the diagram

joey gasps

the miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears
inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it

as if on cue the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud
as the last particle of dust disappears into the box

joey mouth open in shock lets the folder drop from her hand
the sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts
terri who walks back round from the other shelf unit

terri looks at the dropped contents and then up at joey

                           terri
              joey  

                           joey
                     still staring at box
              help me pick em up terri  i think
              the lady just made a sale


int   main room joeys apt   early evening

joey is sitting behind a desk  she has a phone in one hand and
a pen in the other

spread out over the desk are various documents  the photo of
kirsty the diagram of the box typewritten transcripts etc 
and a scratchpad on which joey has scrawled several numbers
                                                            36

joey is in midconversation on the phone

                           joey
              yeah  yeah  yeah  no its
              important that i speak to  what  no
              dont           a beat       put
              me  on  hold  you  stupid  bitch

joey slams the phone down

she stares at the papers at the scratch pad takes a deep
breath and punches out a number on the phone

this time joeys voice is different

                           joey
              hi  now listen  and listen good  im
              the station manager at wqqy  for the
              last halfhour youve been dicking
              around with my assistant  let me tell
              you something  with or without your co
              operation we are making this expose  i
              assume youre smart enough to guess
              which version is going to make you look
              good  now if you cant put one hand on
              that cassette and the other on a fedex
              mans butt within thirty seconds then
              you damn well better put me through to
              somebody who can

a pause while somebody jumps through hoops at the other end

joeys voice transmogrifies again now its a seductive
persuasive purr

                           joey
              dr  fallon  how nice of you to take my
              call  i understand youre in charge of
              video archive from the channard
              institute  


int   under the underground   night

another night in under the underground

kids dance

customers jostle at the bar

couples neck in shadowed corners

loud metal music blasts out from speakers next to the various
sculptures on the walls and ceiling

                                                            37

the center of the dancefloor is packed

the pillar is missing

angle on bar

sitting alone at a bar stool  though surrounded by tightly
packed customers  is sandy a very pretty teenage girl  she
is the same basic type as terri blonde frail young  too
young in fact to be legally in a club like this

sandy stares at her empty glass  and stares at it wistfully
enough to suggest she doesnt have the money to get it
refilled  she is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but
her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character

reverse angle

sitting at the opposite end of the bar his eyeline confirming
he is looking at sandy is jp monroe

the barstool beside jp is occupied by a teenage boy who has
his back to the bar and is talking to a group of his friends

jp has a speculative predatory look on his face  without
shifting his gaze he raises his hand and within seconds the
barman is leaning over to hear his request

close on sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her  laid
alongside the glass is a beautiful longstemmed red rose

sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight
at the rose  she raises her eyes and looks across the bar

jp returns the smile

he turns to the boy beside him and murmurs something unheard

the boy glances round as if ready to argue with whoever is
speaking to him  on recognizing jp however he vacates the
seat without an argument and stands to join his friends

jp looks back across the bar at sandy and gestures at the empty
stool beside him an attractive welcoming smile on his face

sandy gets up and carrying the drink and the rose makes her
way across to sit beside jp

angle on jp and sandy

the deafening music playing in the club means that they have to
lean in close to hear each other speak

                           jp
              welcome
                                                            38

                           sandy
              youre jp monroe right

                           jp

                           jp

                           sandy
              oh come on  therere lots of girls here
              who look better than 

                           jp
              dont do that  dont put yourself down
              if you have a quality be proud of it

while talking and without taking his eyes off sandy jp
gestures at the barman and their glasses

                                                            39

                           jp
               let it define you  whatever it is
              most of the roses die behind the bar
              this is the first ive given out for
              nearly a month

                           sandy
              no  really

two full glasses join the still halffull ones on the bar

                           jp
              yes really

                           sandy
              wow  thank you

                           jp
              no  thank you

angle on glasses

timefade

angle on glasses

now there are six empty glasses on the bar and two halffull
ones

angle up to jp and sandy 

  except theyre not there  the two barstools are empty


int  jps private room   night

the music off from the club is dull and muffled

jp1s private room is the size  and shares the general
appearance of  an expensive studio apartment

his room looks like an annex to his club  black walls black
fittings artworks of elegant cruelty  show that jps taste
for the bizarre is not just professional

camera explores the room as the sound of breathing grows off

angle on pillar

  now the right way up it stands in a corner of the room  as
usual it looks jarring and impressive but it doesnt really
seem out of place in jps room

the breathing off becomes mixed with moans and small cries

                                                            40

angle on bed

jp and sandy both naked are on the bed making love  well
maybe sandys making love  jps having sex

it is a selfish phallocentric scene concentrating on jps
concern only for his own gratification  it may be an erotic
sight but its not a pretty one

jp is on top  he has hold of both sandys wrists in one of his
hands and his body is working away rhythmically  he is half
upright looking down at her  no kissing

close on jps face  his eyes open staring down at sandy

close on sandys face  her eyes closed half in pleasure half
in shame

smashcut to pillar

close on pinheads face  suddenly horribly the monsters
eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers  a
blue light seems to pulse from within the pillar lending color
to pinheads face

pinhead continues to watch the lovemaking until it comes to a
climax

as jp groans out his orgasm and collapses forward onto sandys
body pinheads eyes close  the blue light disappears and the
pillar is just the pillar again


int  main room joeys apt   night

angle on desk

  favoring the telephoneanswering machine its red message
light blinking in the darkness of the apartment

heard off is the sound of joey coming in to her apartment 
doors opening and closing bags being put down footsteps etc

joeys hand comes into frame and presses the message button

wider angle

  as joey waits for her machine and glances around the room
for terri

                           joey
              terri

angle on sofa  joeys pov

                                                            41

the sofa is empty

joey looks puzzled and is about to call again when the machine
kicks in

                           fallon
                          on ansafone
              ms  summerskill  joanne  hello  this

              the honor of sqwaaaaalk

joey has her finger on the fast forward button

                           joey
              in your dreams pal

the chipmunksqueal of fallons voice is replaced by the
warningbeep of a second message  joey lets it play

                           woman
                       on ansafone

              reach me here at kyzy in monterey area
              code 805  sqwaaalk

joey stops the tape

                           joey
                       to herself
              shit why now why not last week oh 

she glances round at the empty room again troubled by terris
absence  she crosses to her bedroom door


int   joeys bedroom   night

joey enters the darkened room  and then stops a few feet from
the door

terri  lit only by the moonlight through the blinds  is lying
on one side of joeys bed fast asleep  apart from her shoes
which she has kicked off she is fully dressed

joey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend her
face sympathetic affectionate and troubled

joey reaches over takes one of the pillows from the other side
of the bed and lays it at the bottom end

                                                            42

she slips off her shoes shrugs off her jacket and 
delicately carefully  climbs on to the other side of the bed
laying her head on the pillow she had moved

                           joey
                        whispered
              goodnight terri 


int   jps private room   night

jp on his bed in his shorts enjoying a postcoital cigarette
blows smokerings at the ceiling and all but ignores sandy

sandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering
around the room admiring it and chattering

                           sandy
              so cool 

she approaches the pillar  leans in close  closer  and
 nothing happens

                           sandy
              radical

she walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls

angle on painting

its a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece  the
kind of crap youd buy in a melrose gallery

perhaps its called biker crucifixion  nighttime somewhere
rural a hells angel arms outstretched and stripped to the
waist is tied to a tree by cruellytight barbed wire wrapped
around his body  at the foot of the tree his biker friends
party drink and fuck harleys parked in the distance  the
crucified angels eyes are raised to the moon  hes smiling

wider angle on sandy and painting

                           sandy
              wow  youve got great taste  this 
              well  this really says it you know
              its really  dark

angle on jp

still staring at the ceiling jp pulls a pained face  like
hes heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times

                           sandy
              dont you think

                                                            43

                           jp
              mmnhmnn

sandy turns to look at jp troubled by his unresponsiveness

                           sandy
              do you mind me talking about your stuff

                           jp
              unhunh

a beat  sandy stares at jp  jp stares at the ceiling

                           sandy
              if it bothers you just say so

jp sighs

                           jp
              it doesnt bother me  im just not
              interested

                           sandy
              oh  like im not an interesting person

jp blows a smoke ring at the ceiling

sandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the
bed   and yes fright fans this does put her in front of the
pillar  though hopefully the blossoming argument will distract
audience attention

                           sandy
              but you gave me a rose 

                           jp
              and tomorrow ill give one to somebody
              else  get dressed  get out

                           sandy
              you shit  who do you think you are

                           jp
              im jp monroe you stupid little bitch
              now get the fuck out of my life

                           sandy
              you  i cant fucking believe you you
              bastard  you get me in here 

                           jp
              right  like you were hogtied or
              something


                                                            44

                           sandy
              look at you  you think youre some god
              damn prince or something  with your
              shitty little kingdom out there and all
              this ugly shi 

sandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and halfway
through her last line has turned to indicate the pillar

suddenly  bam big scare moment  two blackened arms fly out
from the center of the pillar and grab sandys gesturing arms

the blue light burns from within illuminating pinheads face
as his eyes open filled with demonic glee and hunger

an impossible wind begins to whistle through the room as if an
echoed glimpse of a storm in hell

sandy screams in mortal terror

jp jumps from the bed cigarette falling to the floor  he
backs away to the opposite wall face shocked scared shitless

                           jp
              jesus christ

pinhead smiles sardonically

                           pinhead
              not quite

pinheads arms pull sandy tight against the pillar and his
face stifling her scream

jp flattened against the far wall watches in horror as sandy
held tight against the pillar suffers a horrible death

sandys lifeforce is sucked from her  drawn into the pillar
into pinhead

it is a matter of seconds only but in those few seconds 

her body begins to collapse in on itself turning grey and
lifeless  it is made worse by the fact that until the very end
sandy keeps struggling writhing in the grasp of the monster

the wind keeps blowing through the room

finally a dry lifeless husk she is dropped to the floor

the blue light fades from within the pillar the wind
disappears



                                                            45

the pillar is again black and stationary  but its contours are
different more rounded  it looks more organic as if shifting
its raw material into new alignments new configurations  the
pillar seems to be in a process of becoming  and the obvious
suggestion is that what it is becoming is pinhead

pinheads head arms and torso now protrude from the pillar
they are not completely free and  now that the eating of
sandy is concluded  seem incapable of independent movement but
there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before

even though the blue light has faded pinheads face is
noticeably different  it is bluetinged and more fleshy in
appearance  capable of movement  and speech

angle on jp

  who has sunk to the floor staring at the pillar

                           jp
              what  what  

wider angle

                           pinhead
              what did you see  the same as i
              appetite sated  desire indulged  you
              saw the working of the world in
              miniature

jp shakes his head in denial  but hes already a little more
together than he was after all the pillar cant move and hes
several yards from it

                           jp
              that had nothing to do with the world
              not this one anyway

                           pinhead
              on the contrary  it has everything to
              do with the world  and our dreams of
              how it will succumb to us  you enjoyed
              the girl

              good monroe  there is no evil  there

              me to 

jp shakes his head in furious denial

                           jp
              no  no no no  no fuckin way  im
              gone 

grabbing at his jeans jp heads out of his room  rapidly


ext   city streets outside club   next day

the sun is high  its about noon

like most clubs of its type under the undergrounds exterior
is far from prepossessing  its set in an old brick warehouse
in a rundown section of town

jps range rover pulls up and jp gets out carrying a long slim
black bag  he glances round the allbutdeserted street and
enters the club


int  jps private room   day

close on pinheads face in repose back to its statuelike
state

the sound of the door off opens the monsters eyes

jp enters closing the door behind him

he doesnt look at the pillar  he stays by the door and keeps
his eyes on the long black bag he has brought in with him

he unzips it  his manner is that of a man who has made a
decision and is not about to listen to contrary argument

                           pinhead
                     off
              another offering

jp doesnt respond  he draws a doublebarrelled shotgun from
the bag cocks it and loads it

jp turns to face the pillar drawing a bead on pinhead

pinheads expression is wearily amused
                                                            47

                           pinhead
              im touched  that is the gun you used
              to kill your parents

jp visibly staggers as pinhead lets slip this knowledge

pinhead smiles

                           pinhead
              i understand  their fortune was so
              tempting their affection so
              conditional  what else could you do

                           jp
              fuck you

he pulls the double trigger

a massive blast resounds around the room but thats about it
the 30 ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar

                           pinhead
              thank you  now shall we talk sensibly

jp lets the useless gun fall from his hand

                           pinhead
              dont flee from yourself  if you have a
              quality let it define you  cultivate
              it  it is you  by helping me you will
              help yourse

                           jp
              what  what are you talking about  why
              should i help you

                           pinhead
              because you want to  youve always
              wanted to  look at your pictures  look
              at your sculptures  look at those
              tawdry representations and then 
              imagine  imagine a world of the body as
              canvas  the body as clay  your will
              and mine as the brush and the knife
              oh i have such sights to show you

its working  jps eyes are glittering with excited interest

                           jp
              what are you





                                                            48

                           pinhead
              a dark star rising  i was bound to
              anothers system by a soul i once
              possessed  a friend relieved me of that
              inconvenience  now im free  born
              again of blood and desire

                           jp
              hey thats what makes the world go
              round

pinhead raises an amused eyebrow at jps little joke

                           pinhead
              you see were not so dissimilar

                           jp
              but how in gods name 

                           pinhead
              god  my god was diamond and black
              light  and i was his dark pope  all
              that is changed  a terrible beauty is
              born  with a place at my right hand for
              a man of your tastes

jp cruises the room contemplating this

                           jp
              how do we start

                           pinhead
              it has already begun


int   tv station editing suite   night

angle on monitors

many screens fill the frame all of them crackling with snow

cut to wide

joey is alone at the control desk  she has a video tape in her
hand and feeds it into the master machine

she looks up at the stillghosting monitors and then presses a
few buttons on the console

the snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a time
code ticking away at the bottom of each screen

                           joey
                     softly
              alright  lets see what we got here
                                                            49

the blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images of
kirsty the girl in the picture in the antique store

the video image is primitive shot with a nonprofessional
camcorder and is a simple medium longshot of kirsty dressed
in a simple white smock sitting in a hospital room

kirsty addresses the camera directly though occasionally looks
up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor

intercut through kirstys monologue between a single monitor
image the wall of monitors and the watching and listening
joey

                           kirsty
                     on video
              i dont know what the box is  but i
              know what it does  i     looks up
              to side     ive said all this before
              do you     blinks nods as if
              listening  looks back to camera  i saw
              it open  i opened it  i saw what came
              out  i dont know what else to call
              them  demons  demons live in the box
              or come through the box from somewhere
              else  its a gateway to hell  or the
              south bronx     smiles ruefully at her
              own joke  looks up to side as if
              chastised for kidding around  nods
              continues     i know you dont believe
              me  i know what it sounds like  but
              what else  jesus talk to ronson
              talk to the other cops  they saw the
              house  they saw my  my father 

kirsty breaks down into sobs

quickcut to joey

  whose expression shows distressed sympathy  she too has
lost her father

angle on monitors

the video image breaks up into white noise and then comes back
in as if the camcorder was turned off for a few moments

when the image returns kirsty is smoking a cigarette to help
calm her






                                                            50

                           kirsty
                     on video
              solving the puzzle means opening the
              box  opening the box means opening
              doors  and there are some doors you
              dont want to open  and it may be
              metaphorical to you doctor but you
              havent had some bluefaced bastard come
              at you with hooks and chains  it isnt
              delusion it isnt psychosis  its
              reality  its reality     pause
              long drag on the cigarette   maybe not
              this reality  but there are others
              ive seen them

joeys face shows horrified fascination at kirstys story
there is a conviction in the telling which is working on joey


int   main room joeys apt   night

the room is dimlylit

angle on floor by tv set

the floor is littered with videoboxes and tapes  other tapes
are piled on top of the vcr  its like somebody has been
viewing constantly for a week and hasnt put anything away

angle on sofa and coffee table

many books are lying on the sofa the table and the floor
some are lying open most are closed

also on the coffee table are three different softdrink cans a
half empty cup of coffee and a very full ashtray

angle on bookshelfs

terri is standing by the bookshelfs running her eyes and her
finger along some titles

now we understand the chaos in the room  terris home alone
shes bored and trying to find something to hold her interest

she looks away from the shelves and walks idly over to the tv

the box is back on top of the tv  terris hand hovers near the
onoff switch of the tv  then it hesitates and picks up the
box instead  terri holds the box and looks at it  her face
becomes puzzled and she crosses the room to flick on a light
she wanders back to the tv looking at the box



                                                            51

it looks different  its edges are more sharply defined  the
shard where it was broken from the pillar is smaller smoother
the detailed metalwork has some color back and is shining

                           terri
              jeez joey musta polished you up some
              sometimes i think shes wierder than me

terris voice trails off as she continues to look at the box
she turns it in her hands running her fingers over its
filigree surfaces

track in slowly as she cups it in both hands her eyes moving
from puzzlement to fascination and concentration

she rubs her thumbs over the designs  tracking in continues
its tense  is she going to try and work the puzzle

suddenly  brrrrrrrrr  the phone rings

terri jumps in shock nearly dropping the box

she puts the box back on top of the tv and crosses to the
phone  she picks it up

                           terri
              joey

int   main room joeys apt   night

close on terris face  we can almost see her summon the will
power to refuse

                           terri
              no  no  i cant  i just cant

she slams the phone down quickly before he can persuade her
she takes a couple of deep breaths and walks away from the
phone

                           terri
              shit  shit  shit  shit  shit

int   tv station editing suite   night

joey is still at the desk watching the bank of monitors

as kirsty speaks intercut between joey and the monitors

                           kirsty
              looks to side  again  shrugs looks
              back at camera  the box  i dont know
              where it came from  i dont know who
              made it or why  i only know what it
              does  it hurts  it hurts   looks off
              to side as if listening  how  looks
              back  i dont know  it kind of opens
              itself  your fingers move  you learn
              it wants to open thats the thing  and
              it knows when you want to open it  and
              it helps  and it opens  and then they
              come  the cenobites  the demons

angle on wall of monitors

multiple images of kirsty speaking those last few lines

suddenly one  and only one  of the monitors suffers a white
noise wipeout

joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor puzzled  and then
freezes in shock

angle on monitors

  as on the one monitor a new image suddenly appears

a hazy blackandwhite image very grainy like early
experimental tv images of a thirtysomething man in early
twentieth century military uniform

                                                            55

the man  elliott  stares directly out of the monitor screen
and just as kirsty finishes her last line the cenobites the
demons he speaks in an english accent

                           elliott
                         on monitor
              shes telling the truth joey

another burst of white noise and the image is gone

kirsty is back on that monitor just like all the others

                           kirsty
              look you can have me tell this 

joey remains staring at the haunted monitor numb with shock
what the hell is going on

kirstys voice plays off as joey stares

                           kirsty
                as often as you want  theres not
              going to be any breakthrough  you might
              think its delusion but its not  i
              saw them  i looked into their eyes and
              they looked back at me  creatures from
              hell

              people will 

the bedroom is empty nobody on the bed

                           joey
                          off
               talk   terri

joey leaves the door and walks back into the main room

she looks around and then walks over to the phone  something
has caught her eye

angle by phone

a handscrawled note by the phone reads enjoy monterey you
liar

joey registers the note
                                                            57

                           joey
              oh shit

joey shakes her head sadly  what can she do  its the early
hours of the morning  she has no idea where terri is  she
walks back to the bedroom and closes the door behind her


ext   dense jungle   day     joeys dream

thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a pov camera

the sounds of confused battle are heard off helicopters gun
fire distant explosions screams of the dying and the wounded

leaves and branches smack against the frame as the unseen
dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest

the voices of the soldiers  distant echoed repeated  are
heard over the roar of battle

                           soldier 1
                              off
              hes going  hes going  hes going 

                           soldier 2
                              off
              were losing him  were losing him
              were losing him 

the sound of their voices seems to prompt the pov camera to
more furious endeavor

it turns rapidly left and right forcing its way through the
greenery until suddenly with one last push through foliage
thick enough to be a single bush the view changes completely


ext  flanders field ww i   day      joeys dream

the pov camera joey walks out into another battlefield one
of a different character

it appears to be early morning  the skies are grey and
overcast  in the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward

no jungle no trees or grass  the ground is baked mud
disfigured with deep trenches reinforced by wooden slats

the atmosphere is postconflict guns are silent there are no
cries or sound of machinery

scattered around are corpses of many khakiclad soldiers


                                                            58

nothing moves  no birds sing  it is a horrible desolate
image from the bloody pages of history  the fields of flanders
in world war one

a noise begins to be heard off  a low angry buzzing

angle on dead soldier

a cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor
dead face

                           joey
                           off
              noooooooooo 

the buzzing and joeys anguished cry both continue over as we

cut to


int   joeys bedroom   night

joey sitting up in bed eyes wide still screaming

                           joey
              nooooooooooo

the cry cuts off abruptly as joey realizes where she is

she catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that
the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom
are the flies still feeding  she glances around her room

angle on bedroom tv  joeys pov

her tv set is on  the buzzing sound comes from white noise

joey is puzzled and scared

                           joey
              is somebody here  is somebody here
              terri  

she half gets out of bed and then stops transfixed as the tv
screens white noise is replaced by an image

angle on tv

as in the editing suite the image is grainy blackandwhite

the buzzing continues now joined by hissing and whistling that
fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an
impossibly distant station


                                                            59

somewhere in the soundmontage we can almost hear ghostly
voices whispering joey joey joey  

on the screen an english officer  elliott  is sitting cross
legged on the floor of a quonset hut

on the floor in front of him is something at which he stares 
something that the image is not sharp enough to show

wider angle  joey and tv

fear vies with fascination in joeys expression

                           joey
              what  whats going on  whats
              happening

angle on tv

the image disappears in a burst of static which in turn is
replaced by another image still monochrome and grainy a head
andshoulders of elliott staring directly out of the screen

                           elliott
              you have to help me joey

a burst of static and the image disappears completely the tv
is obviously not turned on  the room is silent

joey stares at her dead tv in numbed silence

she falls back into bed pulling the covers protectively around
her staring at the ceiling


int   jps private room   night

blackness

a click is heard off and the room is lit revealing jp by the
door his finger by the lightswitch  he smiles into the room
and walks in looking behind as terri hesitates by the door

                           jp
              come on in

terri moves past him

jp locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket

terri registers this  jp calms her




                                                            60

                           jp
              not a good neighborhood  people
              disappear  a beat  feel like home
              its just like you left it

terri moves into the room glancing around herself cautiously
she registers the pillar

angle on pillar

its plainly different from the last time terri saw it but 
despite what the audience knows about it  it still seems
inanimate a black frozen carving disturbing but harmless

                           terri
              not quite  this wasnt here

                           jp
              no  but as you can see im having
              some work done on it  you found a real
              treasure for me terri  i hope i can
              show you how grateful i am

                           terri
              yeah  yeah it looks different

                           jp

              up  put her heart and soul into it

                           terri
              a girl  anyone i should know

                           jp
              not now no  i mean  now that youre
              here its like she doesnt even exist
              you know what i mean

jp has been cruising the room as they speak  now hes standing
close to the pillar  terri is still some distance from him

                           terri
              yeah right  look 

                           jp
              terri listen    a beat   why dont
              you come here and kiss me  i mean its
              probably ticking away in both our minds
              right  is it going to happen  isnt it
              going to happen  lets get it out of
              the way  see how we feel  then we can
              relax  talk  you know



                                                            61

a pause  a tense one for the audience who know that jp has
obviously decided who pinheads next meal is  terri looks at
jp half suspicious half attracted

                           terri
              i dont think so  not yet  im not
              ready yet

                           jp
              sure  sure  i understand  its cool
              i mean weve got all night

jp smiles winningly and warmly  a nice guy  a nice smile  a
smile a girl can trust

the pillar stands behind him its dark inhabitant still and
silent waiting for the sacrifice


int   under the underground   night

series of shots maybe all crossfaded of kids dancing and
drinking in the club to establish the passing of time  and to
highlight the tension of the scene in jps room by its
proximity to this relative normality


int   jps private room   night    minutes later

jp lounges against his wall smoking close to the pillar

terri is sitting on the bed  shes upset  shes been telling
jp about joey and the phone message

                           jp
              thats terrible  what a bitch  she was
              obviously just using you terri  ready
              to dump you the second she had what she
              needed interfering little whore

                           terri
              no  it isnt  she wouldnt  its
              like i must have done something wrong
              you know  freaked her out  just fucked
              up something good again

                           jp
              hey you didnt fuck it up with me  you
              know that  it was my fault babe it
              really was  and you know im sorry
              and im sorry to see you upset now  i
              hate to see you in pain like this

terri looks up at him her eyes vulnerable on the verge of
tears  she really wants to believe that hes being a nice guy
                                                            62

                           terri
              really

                           jp
              yes  god yes  i  i just want to
              hug you  to hold you  to tell you its
              alright

god the bastards good at this  terri breaks into small sobs
and holds her arms out for him

                           jp
              no  no sweetheart you come to me
              its not fair  i come over there  you
              know  were on the bed  i just

              beautiful  i come over there and id
              just want to touch you  feel you  kiss
              you  and that isnt what this is about
              cmon babe come to daddy  let me make
              it better

terri wipes her eyes gives a small shy smile and stands up

shes walking toward jp  and the pillar

jp puts a hand out  he smiles  reassuring  loving

terri walks  vulnerable  so in need of reassurance and love

wider angle jp terri pillar

shes getting closer  closer  closer 

close angle on jp

  as he blows it  a sidelong glance at the pillar  a sudden
naked hunger in the smiling eyes  a single bead of sweat
some tiny little thing that takes the lid off his game

terri stops dead  she doesnt know whats happening but
suddenly this doesnt feel right

                           terri
              no  wait a 

everything erupts

jp smiling mask wiped off leaps at terri

terri flings herself backward screaming in shock and fear

pinhead suddenly animate and furious eyes wide open face
contorted in frustrated rage black arms clawing at the air
                                                            63

                           pinhead
              bring her to me boy

a furious confused scene of tension and struggle

jp has hold of terri trying to drag her to the monster

terri fights back screaming her disbelief and struggling and
kicking against him  they are perilously close to the pillar

pinhead is furious  roaring tearing at the pillar with his
hands as if trying to physically rip himself free of it

slowly jps size and strength is telling terri is being
dragged nearer and nearer to the demon

at the last possible second  when it seems its all over when
pinheads snatching fingers are centimeters from terris flesh
 terri snatches up a heavy ornament from a shelf by the pillar
and smashes jp right across the head with it

jp collapses semiconscious at the foot of the pillar

terri throws herself back from the monsters grabbing arms

pinhead snarls in frustration hands clenched in fists of rage

wider angle

terri  safely feet away from the pillar  stands shaking and
breathless eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this
creature from nightmare

and suddenly pinhead changes tack he slides from the roaring
beast of a moment before to his more usual persona  the glib
articulate black pope of hell

                           pinhead
              wait  why run  where to  do you know
              where you are

                           terri
              im  im 

                           pinhead
              youre at the door of dreams  and you
              can open it

                           terri
              what are you talking about





                                                            64

                           pinhead
              there are two keys in this room  on is
              in the pocket of this fool  you could
              take it out without me reaching you a
              beat  probably  and you could use it
              to let yourself back in to the world you
              know  the world youve always known
              banal hopeless dreamless

pinhead as ever is hitting the right buttons  terri as we
know has dreamed of dreaming

                           terri
              and  like  the other

                           pinhead
              the other is the key to dreams  to a
              world of black miracles and dark wonder
              another life of unknown pleasures  its
              yours  complete the pattern  solve the
              puzzle  turn the key

angle on terri

  as she looks at the monster  and smiles

                           terri
              where is it

pinhead returns the smile

                           pinhead
              its lying bleeding at your feet

jp is on the floor semiconscious bleeding from the head

                           jp
                     delerious adlib
              unhhh  terri  what  no 

terri edges around the pillar to grasp one of jps limp arms

intercut closeups of pinhead and terri

  as the bond between tempter and tempted is strengthened

terri holds jps arm out 

pinhead stretches his own arm forward 

and jp finally  for one brief second of terrifying clarity 
realizes whats happening



                                                            65

                           jp
                      screaming
              no terri please i didnt mean to

too late  pinheads hand closes around his wrist

terri leaps back out of harms way

pinhead  with awesome strength  yanks jp up to his feet and
pulls him close  he stares into the terrified face of jp

                           pinhead
              i have such sights to show you

jp is sucked dry by pinhead

and terri watches her face perversely excited by this  the
first of the dark miracles that the monster had promised

major fx sequence

  as the transformation of pillar into pinhead is completed

wider angle

pinhead fullyfleshed and incarnate stands in the room  at
his feet are the dry husk that was jp and the steaming hissing
remnants of the pillar like a pool of black toxic oil

he turns and looks at terri  slowly elegantly he walks
toward her

terri backs away across the room  but she backs off slowly
sensuously like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for
her groom

camera moves in close on her glowing eyes and excited face


int   main room joeys apt   night

close on the box  a cloud of dust spirals out into the room in
a reverse action of the dust in the antiques store


int   joeys bedroom   night

close on joeys sleeping face  rem shows beneath her eyelids
and she murmurs in her sleep

very faintly off is the sound of distant music

joeys eyes snap open and glance from side to side  she sits
up in bed and registers the music which seems to have grown in
volume on her waking
                                                            66

it is strange oldfashioned music  a palmcourt string
orchestra playing a sentimental waltz tune reminiscent of the
1920s or earlier

joey looks around the room

there is noone in the room

the tv set is still dead

but  the bedroom door is open a crack and a very strange dim
orange light is creeping in from the main room  and that seems
to be from where the music is coming

angle on joey

  as she gets out of bed

shes cautious and careful moving slowly and quietly as she
wraps a robe around herself and moves to the door

the music continues to play

she opens the door slowly and walks through


int   main room joeys apt   night

this room too is empty

the music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light
is more distinct bathing the walls and the furniture

various angles  joeys pov

  as joey tries to locate the source of the music and the
light

the sofa

the bookshelfs

the tv  with the still and inactive box

the closed drapes over the big picture window

finally 

angle on closet door

both the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet
door across the room  theyre both coming from behind it

joey approaches the closet still tense still careful  she
opens the closet door and looks in
                                                            67

the closet is where joey has stored her past  but shes stored
it neatly

boxed and piled on shelves are old magazines old greetings
cards old photographs old softtoys college diplomas
clippings from smalltown newspapers death of a local hero
tommy summerskill lost in vietnam joanne summerskill class
valedictorian looks to career in media etc etc

also in there stuffed away at the top of the closet is an old
radio  a big old woodandwiregrille valve driven beauty from
which the lilting music is coming

at some stage in its life part of its casing was smashed away
and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes

its an old mainspowered model and its mains cord dangles off
the shelf of the closet  this radio isnt plugged into
anything except the paranormal

close on joey staring at this broadcast from the beyond

                           joey
              how  

joey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and
out into the main room  she sets it down on the coffee table
in front of the sofa

different angle

formal classical framing from a low angle  joey and radio in
foreground big picture window and its closed drapes in the
background

joey kneels up in front of the table

she stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped
fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous
hellraiser movies stare at the box

her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle
she plays with the dial moving through various stations

joeys face is open with expectation as she moves through them
as if she is waiting for clues  or instructions

the music gives way to various voices

an indian voice giving some kind of commentary  the english
words bbc and world service are heard amidst the punjabi

joey turns the dial

a tired sad english voice
                                                            68

                           english voice
                      and the king has sent a
              personal message of sympathy to the
              parents of those brave men who 

joey turns the dial

a resonant french voice

                           french voice
              loiseau chante avec ses doigts  deux
              fois

joey turns the dial

another burst of music this time more raucous and syncopated
a ragtime tune from the birth of jazz

joey turns the dial

dead air  an ominous pause  and elliotts voice

                           elliott
              joey  look out your window

joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address

the radio goes dead  the tubes stop glowing  the room is now
a dimlylit place of shadow and suspense

joey glances back over her shoulder at her closed drapes and
then at the silent radio

she stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes  the camera
rises and tracks in as she walks framing those drapes like
curtains in a theater

with one strong gesture joey sweeps the drapes open  and
gasps

instead of neighboring rooftops and a view of the city joey
is looking directly into the interior of a quonset hut

it is the image from her tv set though fullsize fullcolor
and apparently real

at the far end elliott sits crosslegged on the floor  in
front of him on the floor is the puzzle box

elsewhere in the hut a campbed on which lie a gunbelt and an
officers peaked cap  and an oldfashioned radio  the same
radio that is still in joeys room

angle on joey

                                                            69

  as she stares beyond her window into this impossible scene

                           joey
              tell me  tell me  hello

closer on the elements in the hut as we and joey realize
that everything in there is frozen in time  there is no
movement no sound

wonderingly but carefully joey stretches her arm out before
her  when her arm reaches the threshold of the quonset hut it
disappears into the space once occupied by window glass

she pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath  maybe
she even takes a halfstep backward

                           joey
              im seven floors up  im seven floors
              up i cant 

but she can

she summons her courage steps over the sill and walks into
the impossible


int   quonset hut

we are looking at a solid wall  then through the wall joey
walks into the hut still bewilderment by the sights around
her

still the image does not move  everything is very real very
present  but frozen

joey approaches the immobile elliott and looks from him to the
box and back again

nb joeys speeches to the frozen elliott are bravado her
face and body language betray her awed nervousness at the
bizarre situation in which she finds herself

                           joey
              now what  im here  now what  i just
              walked into madness for you  talk

joey looks back behind her

angle on hut wall  joeys pov

there is no window back into the apartment just a fourth wall

angle on joey and elliott


                                                            70

                           joey
              great  thats just great  you bring me
              here  you freeze up on me  and now
              theres no way out  ive had dates like
              you before  i 

a creak is heard off  joey looks up

joeys pov

at the far end of the quonset hut behind elliott a door has
creaked open an inch or two

joey looks from the door back to the frozen elliott

                           joey
              thanks  i think

joey crosses to the door and opens it  she walks through


ext   flanders field   day

joey walks out onto the world war one battlefield of her most
recent dream  she stands there  an incongruous vulnerable
figure in her nightdress and robe  amidst the corpses the
trenches and the distant plumes of smoke

                           joey
              whats going on  is this a dream

she glances back at the door of the hut she has just left

joeys pov  through hut door

within the hut the frozen elliott still sits

angle on joey

  as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps her eyes
wide in shock

standing on a hillock framed against the grey battlefield
skies is elliott

joey walks toward him

elliott stands calmly and smiles at joey

                           elliott
              joey  how kind of you to come

a beat  joey and the audience take in elliotts impossible
presence as she and he stand amidst the corpsestrewn field

                                                            71

                           joey
              wait  wait  you  you have to help
              me  i dont understand  am i dreaming
              this

                           elliott
              you have to help me  you will
              understand  and no youre not
              dreaming  do you know where we are

                           joey
              its  i dont know  first world war
              right

                           elliott
              correct  the fields of france  and
              many dead flowers  oh  forgive me
              my name was spenser  elliott spenser
              captain

he extends his hand

joey  slowly and nervously  puts her hand out to shake his

                           joey
              joey summerskill

elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand

                           elliott
              well done  brave girl  youve probably
              never shaken hands with a ghost before
              am i right

                           joey
              captain spenser  elliott  i  what
              the hell is going on

                           elliott
              hell is precisely what is going on
              joey  and we have to stop it  i
              because of a special obligation you
              because youre the only person who can
              help and because you know what is
              right and just and true  will you
              walk with me a while

he gestures with his hand and they begin to walk







                                                            72

                           elliott
              there were days in this war days right
              on top of each other when the newly
              dead were numbered in the tens of
              thousands  they called it the war to
              end all wars  though it didnt  you
              know that  there were more wars  more
              dead  your fathers war  your dream
              search for your father led you here  to
              me  joey we need to talk

elliott does nothing dramatic  he doesnt clap his hands or
snap his fingers  but somehow magically he and joey without
moving or changing position are back in the quonset hut


int   quonset hut

the frozen elliott is still sitting on the floor before the
box  the mobile elliott gestures at his frozen self as he
speaks to the bemused joey

                           elliott
              the war pulled poetry out of some of us
              others it affected differently  this is
              me a few years later  were in india
              by the way and its 1921  i was like
              many survivors lost souls with nothing
              left to believe in but gratification
              wed seen god fail you see  so many
              dead  for us god too fell at
              flanders  we adjusted to the loss  and
              if we mourned we mourned in silence
              thousands drank themselves to death
              others went further  i went further  i
              thought i was a lost soul  but until
              this frozen moment i didnt even know
              what the phrase meant

                           joey
              and what is  this frozen moment

                           elliott
              the cusp of my life  what i was what i
              am what i will be  past present
              future all bound here at this timeless
              moment of decision  i was an explorer
              of forbidden vices and pleasures
              opening the box was my final act of
              exploration of discovery

                           joey
              and what did you discover


                                                            73

                           elliott
              something bad

                           joey
              and why are you back  why are we here

again no signal from elliott but the background changes
magically once more


ext   flanders field   day

elliott is once again framed dramatically on the hillock joey
standing close

                           elliott
              because something worse is coming

                           a beat

              i opened the box joey  i found the
              monster within it  and it found the
              monster within me  for decades i served
              hell with no memory of my former life
              until a friend released me  you saw
              her

                           joey
              kirsty cotton  yes  but  if your
              soul was freed why are you back

                           elliott
              because  monster as i was  i was bound
              by laws  the protocol of hell  the box
              had to be opened to let me out  the
              truly innocent were safe  thats no
              longer true  the shell of the beast has
              been fleshed  what i was is out there
              joey  in your world  unbound
              unstoppable

                           joey
              what will he do  what does he want

                           elliott
              hell do what he does best  but hell
              do it unfettered  he wants to walk the
              earth forever indulging his taste for
              all the myriad subtleties of human
              suffering

                           joey
              what can we do


                                                            74

                           elliott
              i like you joey  you ask all the right
              questions  there is something we can do
              but it will require great courage

                           joey
              i dont know 

elliott reaches out and strokes her cheek  gently  lovingly
we see in joeys eyes that there is a response there  a
response beyond the comradely

                           elliott
              joey you walked through your window
              from one reality to another  youre
              stronger than you think

                           joey
              then tell me what to do

                           elliott
              this is his first night on earth  he
              wants to close the door behind him
              like all lieutenants he covets command
              theres a gateway to hell through which
              he can be taken back  he has to destroy
              it

                           joey
              so where is it

                           elliott
              your apartment

joey gasps

                           joey
              wha  

                           elliott
              the box joey  he wants the box


int   under the underground   night

lights flash  music pounds  kids dance  its a wild night at
under the underground and its about to get wilder

the source music thrash metal builds and builds as if
heading for a climax  and then the climax comes

angle on door to jps room



                                                            75

the door blasts open explosively from within  the pieces of
the shattered door fly across the dancefloor accompanied by
chunks of plaster and brick from the doorsurround

various angles quick cuts

flying wood and masonry hit people

one chunk smashes into the dj console bringing the music to a
scratching screeching end

various screams are heard off through the ensuing silence

in the confusion kids scramble for the main doorway  is it a
bomb  is it a streetgang attack

the main doorway slams supernaturally shut bolts flying into
place untouched by human or inhuman hand

confused and frightened faces turn back to look at the source
of the explosion

angle on doorway to jps room

lit from behind by blinding beams of blue light pinhead
emerges through the doorway  slow  elegant  terrifying

pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe
struck crowd look back at him

for the most part the crowd are stunned into silence but there
are a few murmurs from them

                           crowd
                     adlib
              oh my god 

              jesus christ

              what the fuck  

              no no no no no no no 

pinhead scans the club

he looks at the terrified humans  the cruelly beautiful
artworks  the humans  the artworks  the humans  the
artworks

a small smile forms on his face  hes just had an entertaining
idea




                                                            76

int   main room joeys apt   night

the view through the big picture window is entirely normal
again the cityscape by night

suddenly joey seems to appear behind the glass  translucent
like a reflection  and comes through the window into her
apartment solidifying as she steps in

her hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few steps
its as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just hit
her  she falls forward onto the floor of her room unconscious

fade out

fade in

  as the ringing of a phone grows in volume

joey raises her head blearyeyed and glances round the room
trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her

she crawls the few feet to the phone and snatches at it  the
handset falls and she has to gather it up from the floor
maneuvering herself into a sitting position she speaks

                           joey
              hello

                           doc
                     on phone
              you wanted a story  you got it  turn
              on the tv now  and then get your ass
              down here  click 

                           joey
              doc    doc  hello

she puts the phone down and rushes across to turn on the tv


tv imagedocs shouldercam


ext   city streets outside club   night

the images are confusing with the rapid pans and temporary
loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage

docs camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people trying
to catch clear pictures ofwhats been happening

sirens howl red emergency lights flash


                                                            77

it becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster
or a massacre

the club building looks like a bomb hit it  smoke and debris
litter the street  so do corpses

some of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies  others 
glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as doc is jostled and
bustled  seem to be mutilated decoratively  in fact they bear
hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the
club armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire flayed limbs with
machinery inside instead of muscle

                           doc
                     off
              judas priest  will you look at 

suddenly the images are blocked by a very burly cop pushing at
the camera and talking directly into it

                           burly cop
              move it  now  no pictures

                           doc
                     off
              wqqy  i 

                           burly cop
              i dont give a shit  move it or lose
              it


int   main room joeys apt   night

close on joeys face as she reacts in horror to what she is
seeing    intercut with docs footage

                           joey
              oh my god its happening 


back on tv screen

docs camera pans around the area past rubbernecking crowds
past shadowed alleys past police cars and ambulances vehicles
 and then whips back to an alley in the distance

                           doc
              i thought  whats  i think theres
              something up there 

joeys eyes widen in horror as she speaks uselessly to the
screen


                                                            78

                           joey
              no  no doc dont  dont 


ext   alleyway   night    back on tv screen

the hubbub and noise has died away  docs camera is advancing
up a very dimlylit alley  hardly any detail can be seen  the
camera creeps forward  forward  forward 

then suddenly a barelyglimpsed movement very close to the side
and the camera swings wildly toward it

                           doc
              shit  what was 

the face of pinhead almost lost to the darkness of the alley
is glimpsed on the screen as it looms toward the lens

the image disappears to darkness over which docs scream of
mortal terror and agony can be heard before the blackness is
suddenly replaced by a station identification card and then a
very harried anchorperson at a studio desk

                           anchorperson
              well weve  er  yes weve
              temporarily lost our pictures there and
               and 

joey has her hands at her mouth in horror

                           joey
              doc  doc

joey leaps to her feet grabs the box from the tv and stares
at it in her hand

smashcut to


intext    joeys carctty streets   night

joeys hands grip her steeringwheel tightly  her face is
drawn and grim  the box is on the seat beside her she is
driving very fast

she has to slam on the brakes at a red light  she pounds at
the dashboard in frustration

                           joey

ext   the streets of the city   night

close on a terrified face

the face belongs to eddie a 20 year old runner for a drug
gang  his head is pressed tight against a brick wall  his
nose is bleeding and his eye is red and ready to bruise

                           eddie
              ill get it  i promise  ill 

a fist slams into eddies face

wider angle reveals 

an alley  eddie is being held against the wall by two
uniformed cops one in his 40s one in his 20s  the elder
cop has just punched eddie in the face

                           elder cop

                           eddie

              just give him the 

the younger cop pauses looking beyond them down the alley as a
long black shadow falls over them


                                                            80

               money  what the  

the elder cop at the change in his partners tone looks up

standing in the center of the alley at its far end light
coming from behind him so that he is unclear is pinhead

                           elder cop
                     calm expecting obedience
              you fuckoff

he turns back to eddie

                           elder cop
              get your head outta your stinkin ass
              and look at me boy

                           younger cop
                     still looking down alley
              hey 

pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action

elder cop shoves eddie away

                           elder cop
                     to eddie
              get lost

eddie doesnt waste time with questions  hes gone

the cops straighten up and start walking to meet pinhead

pinhead advances still in the shadows still just a black
shape moving forward

                           elder cop
              i have the distinct impression i told
              you to fuckoff  unless i miss my guess
              youve just disobeyed an officer of the
              law

pinhead emerges into the dim light in the alley

                           pinhead
              i am the law

cops halt in shock at this awesome presence both of them
instinctively drawing their guns  and both instinctively
beginning to back up

                           elder cop
              youre one buttugly son of a bitch and
              youre about to dead meat
                                                            81

                           pinhead
              i am the son of eternal night and you
              are about to discover pain has no
              ending

well thats enough of a direct threat for any officer of the
law  both cops fire their guns  once  twice  three times

pinhead keeps walking  he spits out the bullets that his body
has absorbed

                           younger cop
              oh shh 

they empty their guns  useless  and then they turn and run
down the alley  and then stop short  there is a sudden wall
of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world
simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet

the cops turn terrified to look back  instinctively they
spread apart  each walking near to opposite walls

the younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape  he glances
up as if he might be able to jump up to safety  no  too high

pinheads head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command

suddenly the fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible
speed and force

the younger cop doesnt even have time to scream  the ladder
smashes right through his body impaling him

his corpse stands there twitching and shuddering wrapped
around the ladder

elder cop stares in terror at his partners fate

                           elder cop
              no  no  no  no  no  no

pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly

                           pinhead
              curb your tongue

the elder cops body starts to move involuntarily  his
movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to
fight what his body is trying to do

pinheads head moves through various positions  his face is
calm showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but
only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new
found skills

                                                            82

the elder copts shaking puppetlike hands draw his handcuffs
from his belt

his eyes show terror  everything else is beyond his control

he raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open

his mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes

the fear in his eyes increases

he moves the open cuff over his tongue  hes making panicked
moaning noises as if trying to scream

slam  he drives the cuff closed right through his tongue

and screams as best he can

pinhead looks beyond the cop to the wall of blackness and makes
another commanding gesture with his head

a chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the
other cuff

the chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the
darkness hauling the cop off his feet and dragging him along
the alley into the blackness

the cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped
into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead


ext   city streets near club   night

a paramedic is attempting to hold joey back  in the distance
behind them is the wreckage of the club  they are standing
near the alley into which docs camera disappeared

                           joey
              but i have to see him  im his friend

                           paramedic
              lady trust me  you really dont want
              to go 

but joey has slipped past his obstructing arm and runs on into
the alley

and pulls to a horrified stop

                           joey
              no  no

reverse angle  joeys pov

                                                            83

the scene is welllit by police emergency lights  it is taped
off by yellow do not cross banners  paramedics and cops stand
around in various states of shock or disgust

in the middle of it all is doc  quite dead

the body is kneeling up its cold hands resting on its lap and
holding its severed head which stares up at its shoulders  the
camera has been shoved deep between the corpses shoulder
blades and is angled down as if filming its dead face

close on joeys devastated face


ext   innercity church   night

an establishing shot of a church at the top of a small hill


int   innercity church   night

the church is in semidarkness  some candles at an offertory
some others on an altar provide the only light

on the very front pew a priest sits head bent low in prayer

the priest is a young man  probably a good man  were not
really going to have the time to find out

a shadow seems to pass over the priests bowed head

at first it seems he hasnt noticed  then he looks up a
little puzzled  he looks to his right his left then shifts
in the pew to look back along the central aisle

there are rows and rows of empty pews and in the distance the
church door  which is ajar

the priest stands walks to the start of the aisle and looks
back along it again

                           priest
                     calling down aisle
              is there anyone there  hello

silence  a beat

the priest looks puzzled  we see his mind work  hes looked
right looked left looked down  how about 

he turns right round to face the altar

priests pov


                                                            84

to the priest its an image of nightmarish blasphemy  even to
us heathens its pretty shocking

pinhead in all his dark glory is standing behind the altar

                           priest
              how dare you

it gets worse  pinhead staring at the priest all the while
reaches his hand to the back of his head and begins to extract
one of the pins from his skull

the pin is horribly long and sickeningly the last few inches
arent metal at all but some kind of infernal worm  dark
slimy and befanged

pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly
burrows through his flesh pulling its pintail behind it  he
repeats the operation with the other palm

he turns his palms out to show the priest in a blasphemous
parody of christs stigmata

                           pinhead
              i am the way

the priest rushes up to the altar to pinhead

                           priest
              youll burn in hell for this

the priest reaches him  pinheads hand is on his throat
instantly squeezing silence from him

                           pinhead
              burn  what a limited imagination

the choking priest kicks and struggles as pinhead forces him to
his knees before him

pinhead towers over the priest  he smiles

with his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from
the decorative wounds on his chest  he holds the bloody piece
of meat up

                           pinhead
              this is my body  this is my blood
              happy are they who come to my supper

pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh
into the priests aghast mouth

pinhead flings the priest away from him

                                                            85

the priest lands heavily on the floor

pinhead walks forward smashing the altar aside

all the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing
through the church

pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semiconscious priest

and all the candles go out

blackness


intext   joeys carcity streets   night

joey is driving again  and this time shes not even stopping
at red lights  she steams across junctions leaving cars
swerving and horns honking in her wake

something catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side

                           joey
                     appalled
              oh god 

joeys moving pov

up a side street atop a hill is the innercity church  its
on fire

joey swings the car up the hill

smashcut to

joey getting out of the car nearer the burning church  off to
her side is a smaller building the church hall

joey shakes her head at the desecration  she has no doubt
whos responsible

                           joey
              having fun en route you bastard

suddenly a creaking noise from behind her

joey freezes in terror then slowly  very slowly  turns round

joeys pov  shock reveal

the priest  now mercifully dead  is crucified against the
side wall of the smaller building  pinheads nails protrude
from his palms and his ankles


                                                            86

ext   city streets   night

a series of quick cuts of joeys car tearing through the
darkness heading back to her apartment


int   corridor joeys apt bldg   night

joey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door hurriedly
turns the lock and rushes in


int   main room joeys apt   night

joey closes her door and switches on the light  the mood is
suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town  its
very still very slow very quiet

perhaps its too quiet  joey moves into the room slowly
clutching the box in her hands and glancing round  her manner
makes the mood suddenly creepy  is the monster already in the
house

very slowly very carefully joey begins to move round her
apartment  hardly breathing making no sudden movements she
checks her doors  the kitchen  empty  the bedroom 
empty  the bathroom  empty

joey stands back in the center of her main room facing out to
her big picture window  slowly she lets out a big breath and
then draws an equally slow one in  maybe its alright 
maybe the monster isnt here  maybe 

magically eerily slowly the box begins to rise from joeys
hand  her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air

                           joey
              oh shit 

maybe theres one place she hasnt checked  swallowing
nervously joey tilts her head up and back her eyes rising up
in their sockets

the camera tilts low  low  lower  taking in a wider
view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending box 

and the audience screams

like a spider or a lizard pinhead is flat against the ceiling
arms stretched out for balance his face staring down at joey

joey throws her hands to her mouth and screams



                                                            87

pinhead angling down feet first floats elegantly to the floor
to stand facing joey  the box lands in one of his outstretched
hands  he holds it out to show joey  and then suddenly
closes his powerful hand on it apparently crushing it

he flings the remnants from him and they land on joeys floor 
chunks and splinters of wood whirring and spinning machinery
of gold and silver and scores of tiny writhing worms

                           joey
              no

                           pinhead
              watch

thanks to the miracles of trick photography the remnants
suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the
box which sits there intact on the floor

                           pinhead
              the box cant be destroyed  like pain
              or the poor it is always with us  but
              as long as i have it noone can open
              it  now come here and die  you have
              friends in hell waiting to greet you

joey begins to back across the room toward her window

                           joey
              youll have to come and get me you ugly
              bastard

                           pinhead
              spirited  good  ill enjoy making you
              bleed  ill enjoy making you enjoy it

pinhead starts across the room

joey looks at her window  its the normal view  with the
normal sevenstory drop

pinhead closes

she bites her lip goes for it in a literal and metaphorical
leap of faith she runs headlong at the window and jumps at it

the window shatters

pinheads arm reaches out after joey as if to grab her and pull
her back

sidelong angle



                                                            88

  shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows
the nighttime cityscape beyond the window  what it doesnt
show is the front of the monsters arm  thats somewhere else

cut to


int   quonset hut

close on pinheads arm still clutching at the air

suddenly a khakiuniformed arm moves into shot and grasps
pinheads hand armwrestling style

wider angle with optical fx

elliott literally pulls pinhead through from one reality to
another  we see parts of the monster appearing and
disappearing in front of the hut wall as if glimpsed through
tears in reality  its like a tugofwar which elliott wins 
suddenly pinheads there on the floor of the quonset hut

and his other self  elliott  still has hold of his hand

pinhead throws a glance around the hut  he recognizes it 
and the frozen figure at the top end perched before the box

                           pinhead
                     furious rage
              aahhhh

                           elliott
              joey  back to the wall quickly

joey runs around then to the far wall  just in time because
now the pyrotechnics start

elliott tightens his grip and with a nice series of intercut
closeups of these two alternative selves the lifeforces of
elliott and pinhead begin to erupt

electric blue light begins to play over both their bodies
its apparently agonizing both figures arching with the pain
both faces grimacing

joey watches wincing in sympathetic agony

                           joey
              elliott  no  what about you  where
              will you be

elliott grunts his answer through the agony



                                                            89

                           elliott
              back with the damned  no more hope of
              heaven  but i drag this monster back
              with me

                           pinhead
              you stupid interfering foo  aaaaah

various angles on the three selves  pinhead elliott and the
seated officer

the essences of pinhead and elliott  drawn from their bodies
as sweeping glowing spitting arcs of blue light  crackle in
the air of the hut like a miniature electrical storm 

until they suddenly lock together in one more powerful arc
which flies at the body of the seated officer and disappears
inside him in a blinding flash of light

and suddenly as vision returns there is only the seated
officer   and at the far end of the room joey

and almost as suddenly the frozen scene comes to life

the radio near the camp bed is playing

a bead of sweat falls down the officers face as he reaches
forward to pick up the box

the officer apparently completely unaware of joeys presence
begins to work the box

as the process works through we intercut constantly between

1  the officers hands and the movements of the box here in
the hut in 1921

2  exactly matching movements of the box back on the floor of
joeys apartment in 1992  moving on its own linked across the
years to its earlier self

3  joey watching the movements in the hut

                           joey
              elliott  elliott  you cant
              hear me can you  its 1921  im not
              really here 

suddenly small patterns of blue light arc across the box
shocking the officer who drops the box and then stares in shock
and fascination as 

on the floor the box begins to open

the officer kneels up and leans over the box 
                                                            90

and the chains fly  shooting up from within and hooking
themselves cruelly into the officers face and chest

close on the officers face howling in agony

close on joeys face sobbing in distress  she throws up her
hands to hide the unbearable sight from herself and when she
lowers them 


int   main room joeys apt   night

 shes back in her room alone  window intact  normal view

joey stares around her face a mix of sadness and relief

the mood now is very down postcataclysmic postadventure

joey takes a deep slow breath and crosses the room toward the
kitchen door

she crosses the floor without glancing down at it  why should
she  everythings over  but we notice even if she doesnt
that the box is no longer there  but we hardly have time to
register this before 

joey opens the kitchen door

                           joey
              screams

pinhead is framed in the doorway

behind him instead of her kitchen is the black space of hell
 like the torture rooms in hellraiser and hellbound it is
full of shadowy pillars and chains

                           pinhead
              oh no kiss of welcome after 70 years

joey backs away shaking her head in shocked denial

pinhead moves forward very leisurely

                           pinhead
              this will be so good joey  you loved
              him didnt you  i can feel him inside
              weeping for you  he can watch through
              the centuries as we discover the things
              that make you whimper

joeys mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front door

she reaches it throws it open  and screams

                                                            91

jp monroe is in the doorway  but hes only just recognizable
hes now a cenobite  blueskinned scarred mutilated and
decorated with metal and leather

                           pinhead
              you never met did you  this was jp
              monroe

                           jp cenobite
              have you seen what they did to me  have
              you seen what they did  you interfering
              little whore

the jp cenobite moves into the room

joey now near hysteria rushes across the room again to the
one remaining door  her bedroom

she throws that one open 

and terri the new female cenobite walks out at her  she has
the open box in her hand and several cigarette protruding from
different holes in her cheek and face

                           joey
              terri  oh no  no  terri

                           terri cenobite
              oh go on  have one  fuck it  you
              think youre going to live forever

pinhead and jp are advancing across the room toward joey and
terri  joey only has seconds to act 

                           joey
              wanna light you bitch

joey pulls her fathers zippo from her pocket and sparks it up
as she swings it through the air close to terris face

a huge flame shoots out of the zippo as in the earlier scene
and scours across terris face

terri howls in terror throws her hands to her face  and the
box flies from her hands

joey catches it spins it closes it

an arc of blue light zaps across to terri and shes gone 

still in one movement swinging on her heels joey twists the
box again 

and another arc of light zaps jp away 

                                                            92

joey completes her turn  shes facing pinhead  she holds the
box before her like a weapon  and shes got the monster in
her sights 

                           pinhead
              wait

his hands are raised palms out  hes stopped advancing

joey holds the box ready breathing heavy waiting 

                           pinhead
              you can send me back  but why  i can
              help you joey  i can give you what you
              want

                           joey
              youll never know what i want 

despite what shes said we see joeys face register every
word of pinheads reply every nuance every promise  

                           pinhead
              respect  power  you and i can put your
              name on the worlds lips your face on
              its screens 

camera tracks closer to the box in joeys hands as pinhead
speaks  closer and closer until its side fills the screen

crossfade


int  ms summerskills office   day

close on the face of the box still filling the screen

slow pull back to reveal that the box is mounted on a plinth
within a glass belljar

pull back continues  the belljar stands on a tall thin wooden
sculpture stand

pull back continues  the stand is next to a large impressive
desk in an even larger even more impressive office

and seated behind the desk is  well we cant really call
her joey  shes far too impressive for that  is ms joanne
summerskill

her hair is different  her makeup is different  her clothes
are different  everything about this woman speaks of power and
sophistication
