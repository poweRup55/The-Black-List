                         donna
               i think you should visit your son
               and try and get your boss to write
               a note about your performance on
               the job  you need to create the
               impression of a responsible decent
               citizen with familial
               responsibilities who happened to
               slip up once

     they have reached the front door  bernie nods about to exit

                         donna

     and hands them to her

                         donna
                    surprised and touched
               i know things are difficult for you

               our differences with the sec have
               been favorably resolved  in a
               business sense i believe weve
               turned the corner

               of despair  i just have the

               entitled as the saying goes to

     station manager suit and tie patrician are watching the
     monitor while chucky and parker the boyish gofer hover behind

               tell him we open with it at six
               eleven and at seven am

                         gale
               hi chief  you like the suicide

                         wallace
               never reach out

               hello mister wallace

                    to gale
               hes right  its unprofessional

                         wallace
                    to gale
               if you reach out you could get
               pulled over yourself

               didnt save the guy

               saving people is not our job  its
               as wrong to step in and save someone
               as it would be to push someone off

                         wallace
               you wouldnt push the guy would
               you

                         gale
               i said i wished it had at least
               occurred to me to consider saving
               him

                         deakins
               what good would that do

     gale sits on deakins desk

                         gale
               it would make me feel like a human
               being instead of a cynical
               hardbitten newswoman  besides it
               wouldnt be a bad story would it
               newswoman saves suicide

                    dramatic pause
                     then
               its a metaphor for a news story
               only a few hours ago i was standing
               on a ledge sixty stories above a
               street interviewing a man who
               subsequently jumped to his death
               forty million dollars in the bank
               happily married good healthgreatstory

     the audience is attentive mesmerized as they watch her rip off
     the outer skin of the onion and toss it dramatically aside

                         gale
                    continuing
               theres gotta be more  were pros

                    she peels another layer
                     of onion
               maybe the guys been accused of
               child molesting  terrific story
                    she peels more off the
                     onion
               then it turns out the accusation
               was false  wonderful  more story

     the audience watches captivated as the onion gets smaller

                         gale
                    continuing
               maybe the alleged mistress was
               lying setting the guy up
               sensational story
                    the onion is very
                     small

                    she pauses
                     dramaticallywerelookingforthetruthgale considers the tiny remains of the onion in her hand
     then she peels it down to nothing and lets it fall

                         gale
               but what if after all our
               digging after all our painstaking

               one layer then another layer
               until theres nothing left  and
               if its like that do we have any
               obligation to stop at any point
               or do we just keep going digging
               digging digging peeling
               peeling peeling until weve
               peeled it all away until weve
               destroyed what we were
               investigating in the first place

     angle on audience

     attentive as gale pauses dramatically then

                         gale
               ill bet all of you like me
               yearn for just one story that
               isnt about uncovering layer after
               layer of human weakness a story
               that reveals with each new layer
               of investigation something finer
               and nobler something even
               inspirational

     panel  he frowns and looks closer


     intext  bernies carfreeway  night

     looking for exit signs bernie can barely see through the sheets
     of rain that his malfunctioning wipers do little to clear

     suddenly a sign looms into view and disappears before he can
     read it

                         bernie
               damn

     int  main cabin727 in flight  night

     the engines drone  the cabin is peaceful most passengers
     dozing or talking softly as gale glances up from her magazine
     sees susan reading while kelly sleeps peacefully her head in
     susans lap

     ping  the electronic tone  gale looks up sees the fasten
     seat belt sign illuminated

     gale looks toward the dark window  no sign of any lights below
     no city  no airport  strange

     the pa system comes to life and the captains mellifluous
     voice murmurs soothingly

                         pa system
               ladies and gentlemen this is your

               ten to one its a malfunction in

               im going to ask you to fasten your
               seat belts while the flight
               attendants run through some safety
               procedures with you  i apologize
               for the necessity and the
               inconvenience

     murmurs in the cabin  what does this mean  susan looks a
     question at gale puzzled as flight attendants leslie and freddy
     take their positions to demonstrate safety procedures

                         leslie
               first make sure your seat belts are
               fastened securely  then brace your
               arms against the seat ahead at you
               like this  you can use pillows
               or blankets

     pulling off the freeway bernie peers at the signs that greet
     him as he slows to a stop at the foot of the exit

     unable to read them through the windshield he has to open the
     door and stand in the rain

     even then the sign is obscured by torrents of rain


     int  main cabin727 in flight  night

     all eyes are on leslie as she continues her instructions

                         leslie
                when you reach the bottom of the
               chute you should immediately move
               as far away from the plane as
               possible in the event of a fire on
               the aircraft

     glancing around gale glimpses pale strained faces

     she sees the elderly woman holding the arm of a man her son

     she sees a mrs brown squeezing a mr browns hand tightly

     looking back down the aisle she sees mr fletcher putting his
     arm around richies shoulder father and son united against
     fate

     beside her she sees susan trying to comfort kelly

                         leslie
               those of you who can should help
               others who may be unable to move
               quickly

     gale is acutely aware that everyone around her is comforting
     someone else  only she is alone

     back at the wheel bernie is turning right onto an unlit
     highway his single headlight stabbing weakly at the storm ahead
     while his useless wipers clatter loudly and the engine chugs
     farts misses

                         bernie
               im late already  dont quit on me
               now for chrissake  this aint the
               time

     the engine struggles continues

                         bernie
               come on come on 

     the engine surges to life again then begins to throb with
     downright vigor

     bernie frowns  its getting louder

     and louder  and louder  its roaring

     bernies eyes bug with the realization that either hes about
     to take off or that isnt his engine thundering thundering

     a great shadow blurs in the rain ahead

     bernie brakes hard skidding sliding wildly

     bawhoooooooom  huge noise  impact  grinding

     bernie skids to a halt eyes shut tight to prevent himself from
     dying

     but hes not dead  he opens his eyes  stares out the
     windshield

     a blank wall greets him bouncing back his headlights in a blur
     of rain

                         bernie
               now what


     ext  highway  night

     bernie gets out of his car  everything is spooky quiet

     the tail section of a huge aircraft blocks the road directly
     in front of bernies car  he skidded to a stop two feet short
     of ramming the twentyfive foot high vertical fin  the rest
     of the craft is sprawled off the low bridge and into the water
     lost for the most part in the darkness

     suddenly a voice calls out from somewhere forward along the
     fuselage

                         voice
               hey  help  somebody  help

     bernie frowns  helping is not his instinct  approaching the
     edge of the bridge he peers into the darkness

     the plane is corkscrewed through the bridge at such a freak
     angle that the tail rear doors are wedged shut by the metal
     superstructure the wing exits are blocked by the upbent wing
     stubs and the right forward doors are canted hopelessly toward
     the sky while the left exit is partially jammed in the mud near
     the river bank in three feet of water

                         voice
               please  help us  were stuck
               hello  anybody

     int  main cabin727 at rest  night

     engulfed in darkness except for strings of floor lights leading
     to the exits the cabin is a confusion of groans coughs cries
     and the piercing wail of a screaming baby  the floor lights
     seem to be on the walls high on one side and low on the other
     as the cabin is dramatically canted making movement along
     aisles nearly impossible

     leslie battered from the impact her uniform torn is
     struggling to open the forward emergency exit  angled downward
     the door will only open six inches before being blocked by mud
     water pours in around her ankles as she shoves furiously

                         leslie
               somebody give me a hand

                         a voice
               were on fire

               everybody stay calm please
               please stay calm  everything will
               be all right if we stay calm
               somebody give me a hand with this
               door

     her flashlight stabs the darkness reveals frightened faces

     slumped motionless forms

               help the people around you
               everybody  please help each other

     aaaaaaaaah  screams as the plane suddenly shifts violently from
     the interior movement canting further

     angle on gale

     staggering from her seat  wham  hand luggage slams into her
     from an overhead rack  as gale goes down a passenger lands
     on top of her catching her arm at an angle breaking it  the
     passenger climbs off her and struggles down the slope

     gale realizes she cant get up her leg is wedged in the
     framework of a seat  passengers are climbing past her heading
     forward

     susan is fighting her way out of her canted seats clutching
     the terrified kelly to her

                         gale
               i i cant move  im caught

     susan glances at her and their eyes meet  kelly is screaming

     susan turns away from gale and halfcarries kelly toward the
     exit leaving gale alone trapped in pain and fear


     ext  bridge  night

     bernie is climbing cautiously down the undercarriage of the
     bridge toward the water as other voices callout from the
     twisted fuselage

                         bernie
               hold on there hold on there  just
               a minute

     bernie is awkward and very careful climbing down not
     brave or dashing  he doesnt notice that behind him where
     the plane is corkscrewed through the bridge a bouquet of orange
     flames is blossoming in the fuselage of the jet


     int  main cabin727  night

     thick smoke is oozing through the cabin  passengers are
     stumbling over each other clogging the canted aisles while
     others slump in their seats immobilized

     ext  river  night

     having reached the riverbank bernie is reluctant to step in
     the water  he hesitates then he takes off his shoes looks
     in the darkness for a place to leave them

                         voice
               help us  help please

                         bernie
               hold on buddy  i got hundred
               dollar shoes here

     more cries  bernie steps cautiously into the water  up to his
     ankles  deeper

     bernie wades along the huge fuselage toward the voices
     stumbling landing on all fours in the water

                         bernie
               jesus christ

     struggling to his feet hands muddy he blunders toward the
     emergency exit and finds it canted into the water jammed into
     the mud so that it only opens a crack

     mr brown is wedged in the crack trying to force the door open
     without success  glimpsing bernies hands in the crack he
     pleads

                         mr brown
               help us please  we cant get out

     bernie makes a tentative attempt to open the door  he has no

     hammering at an aft exit

     above her across the canted aisle susan is calling out for

     first

     hes opened the door just wide enough for mr brown to squirm
     through the narrow opening then pull mrs brown through

     bernie sputtering is trying to get to his feet when the browns
     knock him down again in their frantic rush to get as far away
     from the burning plane as they can

     as bernie struggles to his feet yet again more passengers are
     oozing out the door  they brush him aside splashing toward the
     river bank while orange flames are flickering wildly now in

     passengers pushing past him  holy smokes  this is ridiculous
     whats he doing here  thicker smoke can barely see anything
     voices cry out in pain and fear  just then he spots something

     a flashlight lies on the floor sending a useless knife of light 
     into the smoky darkness  he grabs for it drops it urgently

     and points it revealing freddy the other flight attendant
     lying semiconscious on the floor bloody groaning

     bernie hesitates  then he leans down still gripping the light
     and half hauls freddy toward the nearby exit where leslie is
     supervising passengers

                         bernie
               hey somebody grab him willya

               out wasnt a passenger

     a nurse gracefully relieves deakins of the flowers hes
     destroying and skillfully vases them while gale questions

                         gale
               a paramedic  a fireman  he didnt
               have a uniform

                         conklin
               from what we could get theres a
               kind of sort of mystery
               guy  involved

                         deakins
               were piecing together different

               went into a burning plane and pulled
               me out anddisappeared

     gale starts to get up struggling with covers iv etc

                         conklin
               not just you  apparently this guy
               is the one who opened the emergency
               exit from the outside

                         deakins

               the plane because of him no

               unworthy of the adoration  we
               all do

     a bluehaired matron extravagantly bejeweled pauses to loom
     over bubber on her way out

                         matron

               is she serious  a half a million

               are going to want to please you
               or use you or both

     bubber hears this digests it considers it  he takes a bite
     of food thinking


     ext  restaurant  night

     as the door to the restaurant opens bubber finds himself
     blinded by winking electronic flashes and sun guns  a crowd
     of fans and media engulf him and gale  its overwhelming  we
     see eager faces and blinding flashes from bubbers pov and
     hear the cacophony of questions

     gale too is adrift in a churning sea of media and onlookers

     police officers move close to help guide gale and bubber to a
     waiting limo

     angle on bubbers pov

     again we see the chaos from bubbers pov a policeman is
     reaching to help him  just then bubber glimpses something
     else beyond the crowd in the fringes homeless people in
     the shadows some applauding him too shy to come forward  in
     particular bubbers eyes fall on an ungainly man his own age
     dressed in rags and carrying a big garbage bag and another net
     sack full of cans  its a stunning image  its as though
     bubber is looking at himself

     the door to the limo is open  gale and several policemen are
     trying to get bubber into the limo and out of the clutches of
     the enthusiastic crowd

                         gale
               come on john

     but bubber isnt paying attention to her  hes turning to face
     the eager crowd raising his arms

                         bubber
               hey hey uh take it easy

     angle on gale

     looking alarmed then amazed

     the crowd is still alive and buzzing but theyre respecting
     bubbers space as he accepts an autograph book from a young
     woman sylvia and speaks shyly

                         bubber
               you uh want me to sign this  uh
               whats your name

                         sylvia

                     smitten
               ssylvia

                         bubber
                    almost shy
               hey if i sign this will you do
               me a favor

     her companions are already teasing her as they thrust pieces of
     paper magazines at him to sign

     angle on gale

     watching in disbelief

     angle on bubber

     signing one after another as he addresses all those close to
     him

                         bubber
               what id like is
                    addressing the group
                maybe some of the rest of you
               could help sylvia here  what id
               like is if youd scrounge up some
               blankets  used ones fifty maybe
                and take em to the folks down
               at the corner of fifth and grand
               pass em out

     cameras are rolling gale watches amazed

                         fat kid
               fifth and grand

                         skinny kid
               he means the homeless people  the
               bums

                         bubber

               andyoullfeel warmer for every
               person you give a blanket to

     gales knits her brow trying to reconcile this performance with
     the apparent yokel she had dinner with a short time ago


     int  limomoving  moments later

     bubber looks back at the crowd as the limo pulls away

                         bubber
               ill bet they do it  ill bet they
               get some blankets

     gale looks at bubber reevaluating him


     int  hotel lobby  later  night

     as bubber and gale cross the luxurious lobby again the center
     of attention a gorgeous blonde very leggy practically
     plasters her plunging neckline against bubber

                         gorgeous blonde
               uplifting  what you did was so
               uplifting  youre a saint john
               bubber

     bubber has trouble untangling his eyes from her tits

                         bubber
               uh no  but i uh wonder if you
               could up support support a
               program to help the needy and

                         gale

               john im sure she could support

               a sort of bodyguard  make sure no
               harm comes to you

     gale ushers the dazed bubber toward a bank of elevators and
     prevents others from joining them in the elevator


     int  elevator  seconds later

     gales mood changes to amusement as she and bubber ascend alone
     giggling she points her chest at bubber

                         gale
               uh if you could just uh support
               uh a small airfield

               i asked john bubber about the
               medal of honor

                         bubbertv
               as far as the medal goes well
               that medals for something me and
               my buddies did almost twenty years
               ago in viet nam  so if im a war
               hero today then i was a war hero
               last week when i was selling cans
               and sleeping in my car when i
               didnt have a medal  i dont think
               a medal makes a hero  you dont
               need machinegun fire or burning
               planes to be brave  people do
               heroic acts every day only theres
               nobody around to take their picture
               or decorate them  little things
               can be heroic  helping someone
               day in and day out giving up your
               life a little every day instead
               of all at once to help

     hurrying down the steps bernie barks over his shoulder at

                    screaming at a cab
               taxi for chrissake

     a cab pulls to the curb and bernie jumps in talking

                         bernie
               i seen on the tv where that

     bernie speaks out the window of the cab as it pulls away

                         bernie
                    then through the
                     window

     stunned donna watches the cab disappear in traffic with bernie
     raving from the open window


     ext  childrens hospital  later day

     limos are parked out front of the hospital and there is a
     gathering of tv vans as bernie exits a cab and charges toward
     the entrance of the hospital a tiny figure dwarfed by the huge
     building  he disappears inside


     int  corridorchildrens hospital

     we discover bernie wandering around lost  a nurse gives him
     a glance in passing and bernie suddenly is aware that his
     appearance is unusual  disheveled  unshaven  he tries to
     smooth his hair a little as he turns into a doorway


     int  special childrens wardchildrens hospital

     stepping through the door bernie is immediately horror stricken

     rows of beds  a room full of seriously sick children  palsied
     eyes out of sync  motor disorders spasms  terrifying
     paraphenalia  tubes machines monitors bags of fluid  a
     place of suffering  to bernie its a vision of a leper colony

     a seven year old spots him clutches at him with clawlike hands
     jerky movements

     bernie recoils in horror backing away

     a five year old blinded by the gauze wrapped around his face
     looks toward bernie and speaks

                         blind childs voice os
               is that him  is he here yet miss
               roberts

     an eight year old with a bandaged arm responds looking at
     bernie

                         eight year old
               naw its just some guy

     a nurse miss roberts appears from behind a curtain suddenly
     and restrains the seven year old as she addresses bernie

                         miss roberts
               excuse me sir  can i help you

                         bernie
               uh well i what i

                         miss roberts

               ward is off limits  if you want
               to arrange a visit

     just then a couple of cameramen back through the door shooting
     its the head end of an entourage of reporters cameramen
     hospital personnel and a couple of security guys that are
     traveling with bubber

     bernie is bumped backward by a cameraman just as he sees bubber
     enter surrounded by media people

     year old and lift him into is arms eyes shining with warmth

     tapping one of the security officers on the shoulder and
     indicating bernie to him

     angle on bernie

     remembering why hes here  its not going to be as easy as he
     thought  he starts to move through the entourage looking very
     out of place

               excuse me pal  uh couldja lemmee
               through here  thanks i

     the security officer is suddenly between bernie and his
     destination

                         security officer
               you gotta press pass sir

                         bernie
               press pass  uh hey i lost it
               listen

     angle on bubber

     holding the seven year old  smiling broadly the child radiates
     joy in the warmth of bubbers embrace his grotesqueness
     miraculously minimized by his mood

                         bernie
                    os diminishing
               getcher goddamn hands offa me  all
               i wanna do is talk to the guy

     bubber and everybody turn toward the sound of the commotion

     bubbers pov

     of an unidentified man bernie obscured by the bodies of the
     two security officers who are hurriedly hustling him off the
     ward

                         bernie os
               hey hold on buddy  this is
               america for chrissake  i got

     is frowning when a doctor reassures him

                         doctor
               all under control  an unfortunate
               man  security will look after him

     bubber nods and turns back to sick kids who seem transfigured
     from bernies gruesome vision to children radiant with hope
     much of their appearance at least was attitude despair

     a 14 year old allen lies comatose in an intensive care room
     tubes in his nose arms and chest monitors all around himhis
     arms and legs in casts and traction

     bubber leans over the unconscious boy speaking intensely while a
     doctor hovers next to him and reporters and cameramen jockey for
     position at the foot of the bed

                         bubber
               listen kid you gotta hang on

     in close with his camera  this is private  understanding gale
     puts a hand on the lens and pushes the camera aside

               ya goddamn phony

     bubber stiffens imperceptibly  dld he hear that right  was
     there a discordant note in the cacophony of voices singing his
     praises from every direction

     bubbers pov

     a sea of shining faces filled with love and admiration surges
     in front of him  and yet that voice again a sour note of
     contraction

                         bernies voice os
               bubber ya goddamn fraud  thats
               my shoe and my money

     angle on bubber

     hearing it looking around urgently but all he sees are
     admirers thrusting at him as hes borne as if on a tide toward
     his limo  nobody else seems to have noticed bernies voice


     int  waiting limo

     as the door slams shut the cheering is suddenly faint  bubber
     sinks back in the opulent seats while faces distort themselves
     against the smoked glass trying to peer into the sanctuary

     then as the limo pulls away bubber hears the voice again
     muffled by the thick glass  he turns looks out the rear
     window  he sees the crowd receding behind him a confusion of
     spectators and is that that hitchhiker bernie being
     restrained by a cop

     angle on bubber

     shaken and frowning with concern he turns away from the scene
     now out of view behind the moving limo

     alone in the luxurious leathered sanctuary he realizes his
     hands are shaking as he reaches for the manila envelope gale gave
     him and tears it open

     he stares at the script titledthe angel of flight 104


     ext  childrens hospital  day

     as the happy crowd disperses an enraged bernie is facing a cop

                         bernie
               dont tell me what i can and cant
               say  this is america

                         cop
                    laughing

     uniformed police linger around the door surrounded by fans and

     door

     dayton we saw him earlier in the courtroom is making his way
     through the knot of onlookers and media personnel gathered
     around the limo and in front of the entrance

     approaching as if to enter he is confronted by one of the
     several uniformed policemen guarding the doorway

                         police officer
               sorry sir  closed to the public

               the seat  i was caught and

               journalists integrity can handle
               it gale i think it would play
               better on the screen
                    then to all of

     bubber starts to say something again but the moment for
     confession has passed theyre approaching leslie who is
     applauding along with the other survivors tears in her eyes

               you leave her here and you sob
               go back in again

     heroic role

               underbelly of crime

                         bernie

                         gale
               in all that smoke and fire john
               had a moment of weakness  hed been
               down and out destitute living in
               his car  it was just an impulse
               stealing my purse

     bernie looks thunderstruck  chucky too

                         chucky
               swiped your purse  while he was
               saving you  you gotta be kidding

                         gale
                    a triumphant 190k at
                     bernie
               and sold it to mister laplante the
               fence whos now trying to blackmail
               poor john

     bernie is too stunned to speak

                         chucky
               hes gotta be a nut  he saves all
               those people and swipes apurse

                         gale
                    emotional
               because he was arealhero chucky
               he was acting out of a deep
               instinctive decency not out of some
               ego thing  he didnt expect the
               media to lionize him  he didnt
               expect a million dollar reward
               he saved fiftyfour people because
               something inside him some
               fundamental love for his fellow man
               made him rush into that plane when
               good sense told him otherwise
               he was willing to settle for some
               credit cards he sold to laplante
                    to bernie
               for how much laplante  a couple
               of bucks  did you give him enough
               for a decent meal

     bernie whos been listening to the description of his own deeds
     with slackjawed amazement is too taken aback to answer

     the van zips past dark city streets populated by derelicts and
     homeless people as gale continues her emotional outpouring

                         gale
               all this is off the record chucky
               because if john bubber lives mister
               laplante is going to give him his
               assurance that there will be no more
               misbehavior on his part  whats
               more hes going to apologize

                         bernie
               im going to apologize to bubber

                         gale
               i could deny i had those credit
               cards on the plane with me

                         bernie

               well maybe i wouldnt liebut
               i could tell the story the way i
               did just now so that people could
               understand that john is even more
               of a hero and that you
               youre the lowest thing that ever
               crawled  your name will be
               synonymous with cynical opportunism
               and blackmail  you wont get a
