        ext residential street  day

        on a very lovely street in a very nice neighborhood tom
        sykes the hider is out for a walk  the hider is a man
        who blends in well with his surroundings  a goodlooking
        man in his thirties  to look at him you wouldnt know
        there was anything wrong

        the hider walks with such strange grace that he could be
        on a conveyor belt a variety of neighborhood houses
        passing him by one style after another

        sunlight and shadow play over the hiders face as he walks
        filtered through the lush trees and greenery all around

        then the hedge hes walking past ends and the next house
        makes him stop  because it isnt a house yet  its a
        halfhouse  a house under reconstruction  part built
        part torn down part finished part matchstick frame  an
        evolving house with a swarm of workmen all over it
        hammering sawing drilling

        the hider stands and watches awhile

                                                   cut to


        ext the house  evening

        the workmen have gone  the hider enters the house from the
        back where its all completely open without doors or
        windows


        int the house

        the hider explores in the waning light  there are building
        materials about  he runs his hand over a pile of bricks
        he looks at some wooden boards and planks leaning against
        a wall  wind howls through the dark house

        he tries the tap on a newly installed sink  water gushes
        out

        where the main stairway will be is now only a ladder  the
        hider climbs it to the next floor  there are a number of
        rooms a hallway to more rooms  on a worktable are some
        plans and blueprints  the hider looks at them

        behind a door is a narrow little stairway  the hider goes
        up it to 


        the attic

        a fairly large attic with a small window at one end  the
        attic is a part of the house that has remained pretty much
        untouched

        the hider looks up


        ext the roof

        a trap door is opened  the hider climbs out from the
        attic  he surveys the scene from up here  below in the
        backyard theres an empty swimming pool a partially
        completed patio piles of dirt

        because the house itself has many curves and corners and
        levels so does the roof  the hider jumps down to another
        section and teeters for a moment where theres a gaping
        hole where the skylight will be  he catches himself
        the hole goes right through the house all the way to the
        ground floor


        int the attic

        the hider drops back in from the roof  he goes to the
        small window and looks out over the front street and
        neighborhood  the hider feels tired  he lies down on the
        attic floor and curls up

        main titles begin

                                                   cut tomontage extint main title sequence

        in which we see the gradual progress of the house as it
        grows toward completion  juxtaposed with the activities
        of the hider as he follows his own secret agenda

        we see builders carefully fit a big skylight into place
        over that hole in the roof

        we see how the hider spends his days  in a library
        studying diagrams in a book on home improvements

        we see him in the house at night up in the attic working
        on the floor in some way hunched so we cant see  hes
        draped a black cloth over the attic window and is
        surrounded by candles

        we see the house taking shape  carpenters finishing a
        staircase

        we see the hider eating alone in a simple cafeteria

        we see the back of the house at night  the hider appears
        over the edge of the roof rappelling down on a rope
        making little toeholds in the wall as he goes  chinkchink
        with a small hammer the sound muffled by cloth  the house
        is quite private from the view of its neighbors and the
        section of wall the hider has chosen for his secret ladder
        is further shadowed by being an indented corner

        we see plumbers at work and painters arrive

        we see the hider cashing his disability insurance check at
        a checkcashing place

        we see the house further along  painters painting
        electricians wiring  landscape gardeners planting

        we see the hider returning to the house at night emerging
        out of shadows  he goes to his special corner looking
        around  and starts climbing  his hands and shoes finding
        the chinks in the wall only he knows are there  in long
        shot if we see the figure climbing flylike up the side
        of the house at all its only because we know hes there

        we see locksmiths installing locks on doors  not that it
        will do any good now

        we see the hider drop silently to the ground at night
        newly planted vines help hide his descent even more and
        cause natural shadows to move on the side of the house in
        the breeze of the night  the hider walks down into the
        empty pool  he stands in the middle of it  theres a full
        moon  the hider spreads his arms as if to float backwards

        splash  we see the hider backstroking off one end of a
        long swimming pool  he rolls in the water and swims to the
        other end where he climbs out  the hider is strong and
        powerfully built  he retrieves a towel from a bench  the
        towel says ymca

        we see the hider at his ymca locker after having a shower
        inside is everything he owns in the world  the locker ispackedwith stuff

        we see the house nearing completion  two men with
        clipboards walk around checking final details

        they go up to the attic  everything looks fine  they go
        back down closing the attic stairway door

        we see the hider at a booth in a coffee shop sketching a
        diagram in a notebook while he eats

        we see the house is done  and here the main titles pause
        because we are almost at the end of our setup now  just
        one more important job to be taken care of


        ext the house  day

        its raining  the house is all finished  there are no
        more trucks parked on the street  no more rubble in the
        driveway  nothing abnormal to set the house apart from any
        others on the street  the house is still and peaceful in
        the rain and part of the neighborhood


        ext backyard

        the swimming pool has now been filled with water  and
        raindrops pound into it


        int the house

        the rooms are stark and empty  white walls  shiny wood
        floors  light reflected off their smooth surfaces  coming
        through the bare windowpanes


        reception hall

        here by the solid front door the house is an invitation
        the hallway leading deeper in  doors to rooms  the
        stairway to the next landing  the skylight over all rain
        spattering up there on the thick glass

        the only other noise indistinct is coming from the attic


        the attic

        the hider has the house to himself now  hes finishing his
        wall  a false wall at the far end of the attic  the real
        wall goes straight for a while then juts off at an angle
        to form a sort of alcove  the hider has bricked off this
        alcove giving the illusion of one straight wall running
        the length of the attic


        the attic  later

        the rain has stopped  now the hider is plastering his
        wall


        the attic  late afternoon

        the hider is taking a breather  he stands looking out of
        the small attic window as he eats a sandwich  to the
        right he sees a nasty neighbor yell at some kids whove
        come to retrieve their ball from his property  the nasty
        neighbor kicks the ball away as hard as he can  on the
        left a car pulls into the driveway of the other
        neighboring house  a mother the nice neighbor bringing
        her kids home from school  a boy and a girl  another boy
        comes by on a bike pausing to talk to the first boy  at
        a house across the street the hider hears a door shut and
        sees a cleaning woman in a white uniform walk away along
        a path


        the attic  night

        the hider stands back to look over his handiwork  the
        false wall is now indistinguishable from the real wall
        such a good job that one wonders why the hider built it
        why hes cut off the extra space behind it apparently
        without access

         but wait  hes made a secret panel in the floor  by
        pushing down in a certain way then sliding away a section
        of floorboard a hole is revealed cut large enough to fit
        him like a coffin  he lies in it covering himself up with
        the sliding floorboard again which clicks neatly back into
        place and 


        behind the false wall

         as he rolls under the wall coming up out of a similar
        trap on the other side  he slides a floorboard cover into
        place over it  he pulls down a foam mattress that hes cut
        to size and blankets from where theyve been hooked up
        he props up two pillows in place and sits against the front
        wall beyond which is the street  he looks over his
        shoulder pulling the lever of a second vent hes installed
        in this wall for air and to enable him to look out over the
        street  across the way a mailman delivers mail to houses
        a woman walking her dog says hello to the mailman  the
        hider looks forward again  hes made a shelf or two for
        himself  there are a few books some snacks a thermos and
        plastic bottles of water  he has a few other things  he
        has a lantern and a flashlight

        the space here is big enough for him to lie down with his
        arms at his sides or to stand comfortably  like a monk
        in his cell its a room of his own


        the attic  day

        silent  empty  the hider behind the wall


        ext the house  day

        oh and one last thing a for sale sign out in front

        main titles end

                                                   cut to

        int the house

                  of our homes

        they step into the light of the reception area their heads
        turning up instinctively to the skylight


        int hiders secret room

        the hider looks tense  and displeased  his privacy has
        been disturbed  there are strangers in his house


        int kitchen  day

        footsteps approaching

                                womans voice

                  has been entirely remodelled

        she comes in and we see that its a second realestate
        lady  with an older couple this time

        the wife goes to the sink and turns the tap  she jumps
        back in fright as it spits violently and no water comes
        out

                                second realestate lady
                         going over

        him


        int main stairway  day

        two men are led upstairs  along the way one of them
        notices a large patch of dampness on the wall and brings
        it to the attention of his friend


        ext the roof

        spreadeagled on the roof as he peeks down through the
        skylight the hider


        int hallway  day

        distastefully

        a room


        int hallway  day

        a fat couple are sniffing the air as they follow a
        realestate man  the realestate man opens the door to a
        room  and acascade of fliesswarms out


        ext the house  day

        the fat couple hurry out handkerchiefs over their noses
        chased by the upset realestate man

                                realestate man
                   in all new houses there are
                  certain kinks to be ironed out

        crane up to that vent in the wall at the very top of the
        house


        int hiders secret room

        he watches the fat couple leaving  his expression says
        yeah thats it go away go away you awful people

                                                  cut to


        ext the street  day

        a car approaches the house


        int an upstairs room

        the hider is lying on the floor in a patch of sunlight
        when he hears the car park and doors open he stands up in
        one quick movement and goes to the side of the window


        ext house

        the original realestate lady has come out of the car
        while from the other side of the car emerges 


        julie dreyer

        a beautiful woman  she gets out of the car with an
        extraordinary grace

        she smooths her skirt with one light brush of her hand
        she turns to look at the house afternoon sunlight falling
        on one side of her face


        the hider

        his face moving closer to the window though keeping to the
        side in shadow


        the hiders face

        a look we havent seen before  a look of fascination
        hes smitten


        julie dreyer

        walking toward the house now glancing gently from side to
        side almost gliding


        the hider

        steps back from the window instinctively neatening his
        hair


        int downstairs

        the front door opens and the realestate lady and julie
        come in

                                julie
                  its been on the market a while
                  hasnt it

                                realestate lady
                  not very long  there have been
                  a couple of bids already

                                julie
                  because it caught my eye when it
                  was in a higher price bracket in
                  the listings

                                realestate lady
                  oh yes well you know when
                  developers remodel a house they
                  often overestimate their costs at
                  first  its not like its been
                  marked down or anything

                                julie
                         a sly look
                  just reduced

                                realestate lady
                         concedes with a
                          shrug
                  sometimes they prefer a quicker
                  return on their investment

                                julie
                  this is a terrific entrance hall
                  what a welcoming feeling

                                realestate lady
                  isnt it

        julie steps on a floorboard that creaks but it doesnt
        seem to bother her  its clear her first impressions of
        the house are very good


        int upstairs  day

        julie and the realestate lady come up

                                realestate lady
                  youll see that theres really
                  much more space than the average
                  three bedroom

                                julie
                  oh space   you said the right
                  thing

                                realestate lady
                  how large is your brood

                                julie

                  husband

                                realestate lady
                  we mustalwayscount the husband
                  by my count thereve been four
                  but i still live in hope

        julie is looking around still liking what she sees  she
        goes into the room the hider was in


        int room

        of course hes not here now  julie walks around the
        room

                                julie
                  well phil wasnt sure he wanted
                  us to be this far outside the
                  city  but we have friends around
                  here and something told me i
                  should take a look at this house
                  i want to be somewhere surrounded
                  bygreen

        the window the hider was at has been opened the
        branch of a tree swaying outside it and julie takes a
        breath the air fresh and sweet

                                julie
                         continuing
                   i just had a feeling

        she walks around the room almost a waltz in beauty  she
        comes to the closet  she opens the door and looks in left
        and right  its quite empty


        int hiders secret room

        above the front bedroom that julie is in  the hider is
        crouched on the floor a look of contentment on his face
        his cheek against the wood like a caress

                                                   cut to


        int therapists office  day

                  yeah things are moving along but
                  shes still involved with this
                  other guy and its a little
                  tricky

                                therapist
                  listen no one ever said
                  expressing yourself to the
                  opposite sex is easy but when the
                  time comes you have to do it and
                  youhopethe outcome will be good
                  for both of you
                  you come out of solitary and you
                  rejoin the human race as
                  difficult as that sometimes can
                  be

                                hider
                  when i was a child i got used
                  to the closets  the boxes  the
                  cabinet under the kitchen sink
                  with that persistent drip  i
                  used to the smell of the boxes
                  wood  cardboard  i got so i was
                  comfortable there in the dark
                  even even that old refrigerator
                  in the yard  that smelled like
                  rust and decay
                         pause
                  it was safe in the boxes  it was
                  when they took me out 

        you dont want to know what his parents did to him when
        they took him out of the boxes

                                therapist
                  in the institution when you
                  were violent did youwantthem
                  to put you in solitary
                  confinement

        he watches the hider

                                hider
                  i guess so  i mean i know im
                  responsible for my own actions
                  it was never because i was angry
                  with anyone  i didnt mean to
                  hurt anyone ever

                                therapist
                  youre responsible for your own
                  actions and you dont mean to hurt
                  anyone  in other words youve
                  doneyourbest  im saying dont
                  carry the burden ofotherpeoples
                  actions on your shoulders because
                  theyre beyond your control

        the hider nods in agreement  theres a pause

                                therapist
                         continuing softer
                  are you still afraid of your
                  parents  of them finding you

        the hider shifts uncomfortably in his chair

                                hider
                  that was years and years ago
                  they must be very old now if
                  theyre still alive

        he puts on a brave face

                                hider
                         continuing
                  no my parents dont worry me
                  anymore  i mean thats why i was
                  ultimately released wasnt it
                  i mean even with the state
                  closing down the hospital and all
                  because im able to be on my own

        floated too far out  she reaches further leaning over the
        deep water and  suddenly two big hands lunge at her back

        falling in and lift her up in the air running back to the
        house with her pushing her inside and shutting the door

                  you allow yourself to get into a

                  potential disapproval becomes the

                  and please dont for gods sake

                  on the contrary  this is
                  tremendous  i mean were all
                  frightened to death of disapproval
                  and were constantly hiding behind
                  these layers we manufacture for
                  ourselves  and im not saying
                  we should you knowdeclareourselves unhesitatingly to our
                  fellow human beings in the
                  interests of total openness and

                  that would be monumentally stupid
                  all im saying is

        int the house  by the patio doors  night

        a scratching at the glass  then a tap  and a clink  and
        a click  and the curtain stirs  and a burglar slips in
        he crouches by the floor a moment listening and getting
        accustomed to the dark


        int dining room  night

        the burglar opens the drawers of some cabinets in here
        looking for loot  its after midnight and the lights are
        out


        int living room  night

        the burglar comes in  he goes over to the tv and crouches
        down to look at the vcr in the trolley underneath  he runs
        his hand over its smooth surface then suddenly leans
        forward to unscrew cables at the back  this abrupt
        movement probably extends his life by a few minutes 
        because when ahammercomes down on his head the blow is
        only a glancing one

        the burglar groans and turns  the hider was thrown off
        balance by his miss  and the burglar has enough time to
        put an arm up for protection  the second blow shattering
        his elbow  he cries out in pain but hes a strong man
        himself  hes a match for the hider  he manages to grab
        the hiders ankle at the same time and pull him completely
        offbalance  the hider throwing his arm out to stop
        himself falling knocking to the floor the vase he bought
        for julie  landing on the floor himself as it smashes
        alongside him  and with a great gasp the burglar pushes
        the big television off the trolley onto the hider

        the hider has the wind knocked out of him as the big tv
        lands heavily onto his chest nearly squashing him like a
        bug  the burglar is already running away clutching his
        broken elbow  but the hiders powerful arm shoots out to
        catch his leg pulling the burglar back while with an
        almost superhuman effort the hider heaves the tv off his
        chest

        the burglar struggles with all his might  the two men
        wrestle on the living room floor  the burglar tries to
        gouge out the hiders eyes  craning his face out of the
        reach of the burglars flailing frenzied fingers the
        hider tries to get a firm grasp on him  he grabs wildly
        at the burglars hair finally getting a good hold  he
        smashes the burglars head onto the glasstopped coffee
        table  bang bang bang  the glass cracks  bang bang
        bang the burglars face into the glass until the
        glass breaks completely

        the burglar wont give up  hes beyond pain  hes only
        trying to survive  his hand is at the hiders throat
        squeezing  they throttle each ether  the burglar is on
        his back his legs kicking at the hider  his shoe catches
        the hider a kick to the ear  they both cough and gasp as
        a release is forced both struggling for a better position
        the burglar trying to slide out from under again the hider
        keeping him down  and now the hider is able to seize the
        burglars arm again and jam the fingers in a door jamb and
        pull the door back  we dont hear the burglar scream
        because the hiders other hand is in his mouth but the
        burglar bites down so hard on it the hider is the one who
        lets out a roar of animal agony and the burglars good hand
        punches at his face the burglar somehow on his feet again
        trying to make it to the dining room

        the hider catches hold of the burglars shirt tearing it
        but pulling the burglar back to the floor  and the
        hiders foot slips in some blood and he lands hard on his
        back hitting his head the burglars torn shirt in his
        hand  the burglar is crawling on all fours to get away
        but his knees slip in the blood too and the hiders legs
        grapple him like a pair of pythons pulling him back and
        the two of them struggle on the slippery floor out of
        breath near exhaustion

        theres a tall plant in the hall  the hider stuffs the
        burglars face in the pot suffocating him in the soggy
        earth  the burglars body twists and turns and kicks as
        hes smothered in the damp dirt the tall plant shaking
        above the two of them casting horrible shadows around the
        entrance hall in the moonlight cast from the skylight

        the hider can barely hold the burglars head in place
        every muscle tensing as the burglars body shudders in
        rebellion  and then the tremendous surge as the burglars
        body breaks free   tall plant tipping as the burglar
        pushes back against the hider with unbelievable strength
         tall plant falling  the burglar knocking the hider
        back flat on the floor the burglar on top but the hider
        still hugging him in a death grip then getting a
        fullnelson hold on the burglars shoulders and neck the
        two of them struggling to a standing position again the
        hider again smacking the burglars head again and again and
        again into the front door this time the burglar sinking
        back to the floor still resisting still breathing his
        good hand still madly feeling for a grip on the hider but
        this time the hiders hold is too strong and when hes got
        the burglar on the floor again hes able to get a knee
        into the small of the burglars back and with the knee as
        leverage and the full nelson on the burglars neck the
        hider pulls back with every last ounce of strength
        pulling pulling moaning with the sheer effort of it until
         the burglars neck breaks

        the hider rolls off gasping for breath  he pulls himself
        to a sitting position against the front door  he sits
        here in the entrance hall under the moonlit skylight with
        the shadows and the dead burglar and the blood and the
        earth all over the floor and he breathes air into his lungs
        as if hell never get enough

        alone with the person he hates most in life  his fists

        he has to do  he starts climbing the wall  hes halfway
        up it  when a flashlight beam hits his face

                                voice

        again and again  stab after stab  the strength of the
        hiders arm lifting the nasty neighbor up off his feet 
        as the hider eviscerates him with  a steel gardening
        trowel the sharp point ripping the nasty neighbors guts
        open tearing upwards the nasty neighbors mouth gaping
        with the shock of it

                                julie
                         sensing a big

                  i think we should talk first

        the water is starting to boil  the cap of the kettle gives
        a little blow  the jaws of the killer dog savagely munch
        his food

                                julie
                  about what

                                hider
                  about us

                                julie
                  mr sykes i think you should go
                  home

        the hider gives a little smile but doesnt move

                                julie
                         continuing
                  i think you should leave

        the hider tenses  julie sees that hes had two totally
        different reactions to what she thought was the same
        statement in each case

                                julie
                         continuing
                  dont you understand

        the hider moves a step closer

                                hider
                         gently
                  yesido understand
                         beginning to repeat
                          himself
                   i was thinking about our
                  conversation the other day  what
                  you said about choices

        the kettle begins a low whistle  the killer dogs ears
        perk up  hes been activated

                                hider
                         continuing
                  you decided that philip should
                  stay away  you made your choice

        julie sensing real danger now glances at the kettle of
        boiling water  the whistle continues to get higher in
        pitch

                                hider
                         continuing carried
                          away by his own
                          internal logic
                  now things are the way theyre
                  supposed to be  ifixedthings
                  in this house

        as the whistle builds the killer dog turns  nobody is
        approaching the kettle at the moment so the killer dog
        doesnt know what to do

                                julie
                  i dont know whats going on with
                  you 

        now she notices bloodstarting to seep through his
        trouser leg

                                julie
                         continuing
                   i dont know who you are i
                  dont know anything about you

        she measures the distance between her and the whistling
        kettle  the killer dog goes into a crouch

                                hider
                  i have to show my feelings  i
                  have to take action


        the kettle

        the whistle reaches its highest pitch


        julie

        rushes toward it


        the killer dog

        springs at julie


        the hider

        throws himself in front of the killer dog  as the dog
        starts to tear him apart

        terror


        int dining room

        julie comes backing out from the kitchen the kitchen door
        swinging closed after her  she keeps backing away her
        hand to her mouth in horror as we hear the horrific
        mauling snarling growling from the kitchen


        int entrance hall

        the awful sounds continue as julie in a daze keeps backing
        further and further away


        ext the house

        the street is empty the neighborhood quiet  except for
        the sounds we hear of the hider in the house being torn to
        bits

        and the camera starts craning up once more up to the top
        of the house moving in on that small vent up there


        int hiders secret room
