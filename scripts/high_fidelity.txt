                         what came first  the music or the 
                         misery  people worry about kids 
                         playing with guns and watching violent 
                         videos were scared that some sort 
                         of culture of violence is taking 
                         them over

               records

               big thin lps  fields of them  we move across them slowly  
               they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books but 
               then the cds start and go on faster and faster forever 
               then the singles then the tapes

                         but nobody worries about kids 
                         listening to thousands  literally 
                         thousands  of songs about broken 
                         hearts and rejection and pain and 
                         misery and loss

               it seems the records tapes and cds will never end until  
               we come to rob  always a hair out of place a face that 
               grows on you  he sits in an oversized beanbag chair and 
               addresses us the wall of music behind him

                         did i listen to pop music because i 
                         was miserable or was i miserable 
                         because i listened to pop music

               int apartment  night

               group of bags huddled next to the door  not the goon

               vacation set but the clothestocoffeemaker moving out 
               variety  rob stares at them his face unreadable his head 
               gripped by a big pair boudokan headphones  we hear what he 
               is hearing something foreboding and upbeat at the same time

               laura robs girlfriend enters the room and he immediately 
               pulls the headphones off  she clocks him for a moment 
               catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment 
               of nonpresence  she begins to heft the bags rob goes to 
               her a little tardy for his big goodbye  laura begins to 
               cry a bit

                                     laura
                         i dont really know what im doing

               he smiles and she doesnt  he adjusts

                                     rob
                         you dont have to go this second  
                         you can stay until whenever

                                     laura

                         might as well you know

                                     rob
                         well stay for tonight then

               laura shakes her head lifts the last small bag and backs 
               out the door  a strap catches on a handle and the two of 
               them wrestle with it a bit while trying to keep the door 
               open until laura awkwardly disappears from view and the 
               door shuts behind rob  he stays right there staring at the 
               shut door for a long moment listening to the fading sound 
               of laura and her dragging bags

               stereo

               robs left hand cranks the volume knob while his right 
               switches the cd changer to something loud and adrenal  he 
               addresses us again

               int apartment stairwell

               laura drags her bags banging down the stairs 

               int robs apartment

               rob moves around the apartment seeming to expand physically 
               looking for change as he continues

                                     rob
                         those were the ones that really hurt  
                         can you see your name in that list 
                         laura  maybe youd sneak into the 
                         top ten but theres no place for 
                         you in the top five  sorry  those 
                         places are reserved for the kind of 
                         humiliations and heartbreaks that 
                         youre just not capable of delivering

               he adjusts the angle of the tv stuffs a creepy family 
               portrait into a drawer

                                     rob
                         that probably sounds crueler than 
                         its meant to but the fact is were 
                         too old to take each other miserable  
                         unhappiness used to mean something  
                         now its just a drag like a cold or 
                         having no money

               he moves through the living room to an open window facing 
               the street  looking down two stories he sees laura emerge 
               from the building and drag her bags toward her car across 
               the street

                                     rob
                         if you really wanted to mess me up 
                         you should have got to me earlier

                                                                    cut to

               gait as he mopes away

                         it would be nice to think that since 
                         i was fourteen times have changed 
                         relationships have become more 
                         sophisticated females less cruel 
                         skins thicker but there still seems 
                         to be an element of that afternoon 
                         in everything that has happened to 
                         me since  all my other romantic 
                         stories seem to be a scrambled version 
                         of that first one

               int robs apartment

               rob sits in his chair a cord leading from the stereo to 
               headphones draped around his neck  behind him is the wall 
               of music

               penny and rob sit on the edge of the bed kissing  rob moves 
               his hand up toward the breast but the hand then seems to 
               have a new idea and dives south to follow the thigh into 
               pennys skirt

                                     rob vo
                         she was so nice in fact that she 
                         wouldnt let me put my hand 
                         underneath or even on top of her 
                         bra

               when he contacts skin penny rolls like a gymnast away 
               and off of the bed out of frame  rob looks away balefully

                         interested in nice just breasts 
                         and therefore she was no good to me  
                         and so i was finished with her

               she leans in to kiss him and he shrugs her off

                         whats the point  it never goes 
                         anywhere

               without looking at her rob turns and walks down the street 
               getting smaller  penny watches for a while

                         started dating a girl who everybody 
                         said would put out and penny went 
                         with this asshole chris thompson who 
                         told me that he had sex with her 
                         after something like three dates  
                         how had penny gone from a girl who 
                         wouldnt do anything to a girl who 
                         would do everything

               a businessman looks up from his paper at rob then back down

               ext clark street  day

               an old chicago block of local merchants on a busy street

               rob makes his way down the street jangling a set of keys 
               and talking to us

                                     rob
                         my stores right up here  its called 
                         the record exchange  its carefully 
                         placed to attract the bare minimum 
                         of window shoppers

               rob arrives at a storefront and begins unlocking a rusty 
               gate with two locks and then a beatendown door

                                     rob
                         i get by because of the people who 
                         make a special effort to shop here 
                         on saturday young men always young 
                         men who spend a disproportionate 
                         amount of their time looking for

               in almost darkness  more light might penetrate the windows 
               if there werent so many recordrelease posters taped to 
               them  a dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug  
               on the walls are bagged 45s you will never hear unless you 
               commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to 
               every noodling of jah wobble and glen glenn and other people 
               youve never heard of

               but as rob opens the door enters and flips a switch causing 
               the fluorescents to sputter we see in his eyes the reverence 
               and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty 
               field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church

                                     rob
                         the fetish properties are not unlike 
                         porn  i would feel guilty taking 
                         their money if i wasnt kind of 
                         well one of them

               as he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back he 
               stops on a dime steps back and pulls a cd from the sea and

               replaces it almost the same position but not quite 
               meticulousness and pride in this gesture

               after a moment the door creaks open behind rob admitting 
               dick a nervous forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile 
               with long greasy black hair a sonic youth tshirt a 
               monstrous pair of headphones and a canvas record bag 
               emblazoned with a label logo

                         it

               the door flies open and barry an acidtongued postpunk 
               rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to 
               conceptualize his own rebellion walks in  his teeth are 
               clenched in airguitar concentration and hes phonetically 
               cranking a clash riff

                                     barry
                         baa  ba ba dang

               dick shrinks back from him instinctively  he stops midstep 
               and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store  his 
               face adopts an exaggerated grimace

                                     barry
                         holy shiite  what the fucks this

                         to and enjoying barry

               barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter and dick 
               gets out of his way

                                     barry
                         well thats problematic because it 
                         sucks ass

               through the red levels

                         it wont go any louder

               barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears

               rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape  barrys 
               head pops out of the stockroom

                                     barry

               points home with a forefinger

                         exotic  she talked a lot about 
                         remarkably interesting things like 
                         music books film and politics

                              over her talking
                         so we didnt have those terrible 
                         strained sentences that seemed to 
                         characterized most of my 
                         relationships  and she liked me  
                         she liked me  she liked me

                         we went out for two years and for 
                         every single minute i felt as though 
                         i was standing on a dangerously narrow 
                         ledge  i couldnt get comfortable 
                         couldnt ever stretch out and relax  
                         why would a girl  no a woman  
                         like charlie go out with someone who 
                         only a few years ago sewed a foghat 
                         patch on his jacket  i felt like 
                         all those people who suddenly shaved 
                         their heads and said theyd always 
                         been punks  i felt like a fraud  
                         and i was depressed by the lack of 
                         flamboyance in my wardrobe

               stands her back to him wearing only her underwear and 
               pulling on a tshirt  a heartbreaking image to look back 
               on

                                     rob vo
                         i worried about my abilities as a 
                         lover  i was intimidated by the 
                         other men in her design department 
                         and became convinced that she was 
                         going to leave me for one of them

               charlie turns around and looks at rob with naked ambivalence

               his head in his hands  the light goes out

                         what i really learned from the charlie 
                         debacle is that you gotta punch your 
                         weight  charlie was out of my class 
                         too pretty too smart too witty

                         dumbest  ive read books like the 
                         unbearable lightness of being 
                         angelas ashes and love in the time 
                         of cholera and understood them i

                         had sworn off men  i had sworn off 
                         women  it made sense to pool our 
                         loathing of the opposite sex swear 
                         them off together and get to share

                         we were frightened of being left 
                         alone for the rest of our lives  
                         only people of a certain disposition 
                         are frightened of being alone for 
                         the rest of their lives at twenty 
                         six  we were of that disposition  
                         everything seemed much later than it 
                         was

               of sarah sitting across the table midconfession

                         when she told me that she met someone 
                         else it made no sense  her meeting 
                         someone else was contrary to the 
                         whole spirit of our arrangement  
                         all we really had in common was that 
                         we were dumped by people and that 
                         we were against dumping  we were 
                         violently antidump  so how come i 
                         got dumped

               rob in his chair

               the music becomes presence again and rob takes the needle 
               off the record

                         you run the risk of losing anyone 
                         who is worth spending time with  
                         but i didnt know that at the time  
                         all i saw was that id moved down a 
                         division and that it still hadnt 
                         worked out and this seemed cause 
                         for a great deal of misery and self
                         pity  and thats when laura came 
                         along

               int robs apartment  night

               rob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor  he 
               looks to camera

                                     rob
                         im reorganizing my records tonight  
                         its something i do in times of 
                         emotional distress  when laura was 
                         here i had them in alphabetical order 
                         before that chronologically  
                         tonight though im trying to put 
                         them in the order in which i bought 
                         them  that way i can write my own 
                         autobiography without picking up a 
                         pen  pull them all off the shelves 
                         look for revolver and go from there  
                         ill be able to see how i got from 
                         deep purple to the soft boys in twenty
                         five moves  what i really like about 
                         my new system is that it makes me 
                         more complicated than i am  to find 
                         anything you have to be me or at 
                         the very least a doctor in robology  
                         if you wanna find landslide by 
                         fleetwood mac you have to know that 
                         i bought it for someone in the fall 
                         of 1983 and then didnt give it to 
                         them for personal reasons  but you 
                         dont know any of that do you  you 
                         would have to ask me to

                                                                    cut to

               rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to enter 
               the club  from inside he hears a guitar playing a tune 
               that becomes familiar not only to rob but to us  when a 
               strong lilting female voice begins to sing we hear what it 
               is baby i love your way by peter frampton

               rob smiles at first but begins to darken as the verse 
               continues  he steps out of line and leans against the outside 
               wall listening  is he beginning to cry  yes he is

                                                                    cut to

                         me the way  a phenomenon based on 
                         a live album that was actually 
                         recorded in a studio  what is 
                         happening  i am getting misty choked 
                         up at a song that i had the good 
                         sense at twelve to realize was so 
                         saccharine and stupid as to be 
                         inarticulatable until michael bolton

               he looks around selfconsciously and paces a bit deciding 
               whether or not to stay  he takes a deep breath and heads 
               in the door

               int lounge ax  night

               as rob enters he looks to the stage where marie lasalle is 
               standing alone with her acoustic guitar heading toward the 
               songs finish  robs expression begins to shift from the 
               melancholy to something else altogether  marie is beautiful 
               and marie has touched his heart  rob navigates toward her 
               though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen  he 
               addresses us over his shoulder

                                     rob
                         sentimental music makes you nostalgic 
                         and hopeful at the same time  maries 
                         the hopeful part  lauras the 
                         nostalgia part  these things happen  
                         they happen to men at any rate  
                         this is why i shouldnt be listening 
                         to pop music

               as he gets closer to the stage 

                                     dick
                         rob

               rob looks over to see dick sitting with barry a few feet 
               away  he shakes it off and sits with them extending a 
               meaningful hand to barry who takes it  they turn back to 
               the stage as marie finishes the song

                                     rob
                         i always hated this song

                                     dick
                         yeah

                                     rob
                         but now i kind of like it

               dick and barry nod then keep watching  all three of them 
               are in their own private fantasies with marie

                                     dick
                         she shouldnt done it on the number 
                         four with a smile

                                     barry
                         isnt her album called number four 
                         with a smile

                         its a reference to a chinese meal 
                         in toronto and i think that there is 
                         a the  but i could be wrong

                                     barry
                         you can be and are wrong

               they drop it so that their eyes can drift back to marie

                                     barry
                         i wanna date a musician

               the line behind them is moving in and marie smiles at them 
               and turns to someone else  they scurry back toward their 
               table

                                     rob
                         what did you tell her about the shop

                         have any customers but i thought 
                         that was a bad thing not like a 
                         business strategy

               rob looks over barry at marie  she catches his eye as she 
               looks over the room  his eyes shoot to the floor

                                                                    cut to

               rob is going through a huge stack of used cds sorting them 
               off into different bins bouncing his head absently to the 
               music  the same song of maries that rob had on when laura 
               called last night

               rob reaches over and hits the speaker button on the phone

               he hangs up fast spins around to look in a cracked onefoot
               square cracked mirror bearing the logo of aerosmith that is 
               mounted on the wall and moves out into the

               front room

               and up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns maries 
               music off  he takes a deep breath and looks up meeting her 
               eyes

                                     rob

               attention  they look up at the light fixture which shakes 
               a little faster with the rhythm of the creaking  someone

                         that all depends

               she kind of backs away and goes back to browsing  the phone 
               rings and rob picks it up

               revealing a tootan woman in her late forties in designer 
               jeans and a tshirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign

               she says nothing

               for him  he follows her in and through a fabulous first 
               floor packed with bigbucks bourgeois rugs art and 
               antiques

               she ushers rob into a large study and turns the light on

               rob steps into the room like an undeserving and carefully

               rob is doing the best to control the onset of 
               hyperventilation  he dares a glance over his shoulder to 
               her to see if this is a joke

               and a stage for jazz  rob slumps back in a booth stirring 
               a drink with his finger  after a beat we hear a door slam 
               off camera and rob looks up with a bit of fear

               heavy footsteps get louder and closer until a shadow shrouds 
               rob  liz stands in front of him

               and turns on him punctuating with a finger in his chest

                         and never paid a dime back  and 
                         then just a few weeks ago you told 
                         her you were unhappy with her and 
                         were kind of looking around for

               she turns again and keeps walking holding a defiant middle 
               finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street

               int subway car  night

               rob sits rocking slightly with the movement of the train

               he stares at an old couple who do not speak to each other

                         done so go off for a minute and

                         always seemed  they picked up where 
                         your precious echo left off and

                         the interesting thing about green 
                         day is that so much of their music 
                         is in truth directly influenced by 
                         in my opinion two bands

               surveys the roaming customers with a semiserious air of

                         lets go in

               she gets out of the car  rob turns to camera speaking 
               quietly and urgently

                                     rob
                         okay number two the stuff i told 
                         her about being unhappy in the 
                         relationship about half looking 
                         around for someone else she tricked 
                         me into saying it  we were having 
                         this state of the union type 
                         conversation and she said quite 
                         matteroffactly that we were pretty 
                         unhappy at the moment and did i 
                         agree and i said yes and she asked 
                         whether i ever thought about meeting 
                         someone else  so i asked her if she 
                         ever thought about it and she said 
                         of course so i admitted that i 
                         daydream about it from time to time  
                         now i see that what we were really 
                         talking about was her and ian and 
                         she suckered me into absolving her  
                         it was a sneaky lawyers trick and 
                         i fell for it because shes much 
                         smarter than me

               he scrambles out of the car

               int apartment  night

               the lock turns and rob enters holding the door for laura 
               who slips by her coat in her hands  she glances down at 
               the table by the door and sees ians envelope

                                     rob
                         you can take it with you if you want

               she slips it into her purse  he stands facing her for a 
               moment then crosses to her takes her coat and tosses it on 
               a chair  she opens the closet and takes out a big laundry 
               sack

                                     laura

                         important things to talk about than 
                         my record collection

               she begins putting books and other things into the bag

               she stands and walks toward the bathroom

                                     laura
                         i guess its not that obvious then

                                     rob
                         no

               as soon as she shuts the door behind her he turns to camera

                                     rob
                         and number three the pregnancy  i 
                         didnt know she was pregnant  of 
                         course i didnt  she hadnt told me 
                         because i had told her i was sort 
                         of seeing somebody else  we 
                         thought we were being very grownup 
                         but we were being preposterously 
                         naive childish even to think that 
                         one of us could fuck around and then 
                         own up to it while we were living 
                         together  so  i didnt find out 
                         about it til way later  we were 
                         going through a good period and i 
                         made a crack about having kids and 
                         she burst into tears  i made her 
                         tell me what it was all about and 
                         she did  i felt guilty and so i got 
                         angry  she told me that at the time 
                         i didnt look like a very good long
                         term bet  that it was a hard decision 
                         and she didnt see any point in 
                         consulting me about it  when the 
                         whole sorry tale comes out in a great 
                         big 

               we hear the bathroom door open

                                     laura os

               laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the 
               door

                                     laura
                         did you say something

                                     rob
                         no  so  is it working out with 
                         ian

                                     laura
                         rob  dont be childish

                                     rob
                         why is that childish  your living 
                         with the guy  im just asking how 
                         its going

                                     laura
                         i am not living with him  ive just 
                         been staying with him for a few days 
                         until i work out what im doing  
                         look this has nothing to do with 
                         anyone else  you know that dont 
                         you  i left because we werent 
                         exactly getting along and we werent 
                         talking about it  and i suddenly 
                         realized that i like my job and i 
                         like what my life is could be turning 
                         into and that im getting to a point 
                         where i want to get my shit together 
                         and i cant really see that ever 
                         happening with you and yeah yeah 
                         i sort of get interested in someone 
                         else and that went further than it 
                         should have so it seemed like a 
                         good time to go  but i have no idea 
                         what will happen with ian in the 
                         long run  probably nothing

                                     rob
                         well then why dont you quit it while 
                         you seem to not be ahead

               laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the 
               laundry bag  rob turns back to camera

                                     rob
                          when the whole sorry tale comes 
                         out in a great big lump like that 
                         even the most shortsighted jerk 
                         even the most selfdeluding and self 
                         pitying of jilted wounded lovers 
                         can see that there is some cause and 
                         effect going on here that abortions 
                         and ian and money and affairs all 
                         belong to all deserve each other

               laura reappears her bag halffilled with clothes and goes 
               to the book shelves next to the records  she starts topping 
               off the bag with books

                                     laura
                         look  maybe youll grow up and well 
                         get it together you and me  maybe 
                         ill never see either of you again  
                         i dont know  all i know is that 
                         its not a good time to be living 
                         here

                                     rob
                         so what you havent definitely

                         chance well get back together

                                     rob
                         well if you dont know theres a 
                         chance right  its like if someone 
                         was in the hospital and he was 
                         seriously ill and the doctor said i 
                         dont know if hes got a chance of 
                         survival or not then that doesnt 
                         mean the patients definitely going 
                         to die now does it  it means he 
                         might live  even if its only a 
                         remote possibility

                                     laura
                         i suppose so

                                     rob
                         so we have a chance of getting back 
                         together again

                                     laura

                         chance of getting back together

               charlestoncabbagepatchboxsteptouchdown dance of pure 
               elation then bounces down the stairs

               bone sit listening to a story tbone is telling

                         different  if you cant hack this 
                         simple strategy there are some women

                         get pushed around ignored and mowed

                         well you couldnt have been 
                         desperate to see it otherwise youd

               beer from the fridge and sits back down  he picks up the 
               phone and dials

                                     rob

               he writes down a number and hangs up then looks to camera

                                     rob
                         you know the worst thing about being 
                         rejected  the complete lack of 
                         control due to loss of control

               he picks up the phone and dials while continuing to talk to 
               us 

                                     rob
                         if i could only control the when and 
                         how of being dumped by somebody then 
                         it wouldnt seem as bad  but then 
                         of course 

               he hangs up quickly 

                                     rob
                          it wouldnt be rejection would 
                         it  it would be mutual consent  it 
                         would be musical differences  i 
                         would be pursuing a solo career

               see the silhouettes of laura and ian in the window  he picks 
               up the phone drops a quarter and hits the numbers hard as 
               he dials a muffled male hello is heard and rob hangs 
               up  he does it again  and again  and again  until

               scruffier than rob and looks not unlike leo sayersteve 
               guttenberg  he stares at laura with amused exasperation

                         the past as they say and i wasnt

                         the dense mists of time now it 
                         wasnt that i really liked marco 
                         more  in fact i thought you were 
                         more shall we say attractive than 
                         him  it was just that he knew he 
                         was goodlooking and you didnt and 
                         that made a difference somehow  you 
                         used to act as if i was weird for 
                         wanting to spend time with you and 
                         that got kind of beat if you know 
                         what i mean  your selfimage started 
                         to rub off on me and i ended up 
                         thinking that i was strange  and i 
                         knew that you were kind and 
                         thoughtful you made me laugh and 
                         i dug the way you got consumed by 
                         things you loved and marco seemed 
                         a bit more i dont know glamorous  
                         more sure of himself

                              pause
                         i dont know  you know what people 
                         are like at that age  they make 
                         very superficial judgements  do you 
                         think thats superficial  he was a

               eyes

                         that you havent laughed this much 
                         in ages and then you see the error 
                         of your ways

               leaving the door open for her she almost goes for it but

                         relationship ill buy her whoever 
                         she is stuff that she oughta like 
                         but doesnt know about  thats 
                         what new boyfriends are for  and 
                         hopefully i wont borrow money from

                         need to have an abortion or run away

                         keen on and to pretend otherwise is 
                         just just psychowank  if she 
                         thinks that then shes missing the 
                         brazilian rainforest for the twigs

               on a stand  laura her younger sister jo and her mother 
               sit in the front row listening to the minister

                                     minister
                         now and forever amen

               he nods offstage and a muffled mechanical noise is heard

               the coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it

               a low baleful human howl is heard starting quietly but 
               gaining in volume

                                     rob vo
                         i hear something in lauras voice 
                         but i know what it is and at that 
                         moment i want to go to her and offer 
                         to become a different person to 
                         remove all trace of what is me as 
                         long as she will let me look after 
                         her and try to make her feel better

               int chapel parlor

               rob stays back watching mourners approach laura and her 
               mother hugging them  after awhile laura sees rob through 
               the throng hanging back  she breaks through and to him 
               holding him close for a long time

                                     rob vo
                         and when she lets go of me i 
                         feel i dont need to become a 
                         different person  its happened

                         already without this  its hard

                         efforts into one part of your life 
                         and it doesnt work out

               she glances at rob embarrassed

                         up hating myself  and maybe you 
                         think i should but its not much of 
                         a life you know

                                     liz
                         maybe ive been a little unfair  
                         but is this really the time

                                     rob

                                     liz

                         then i have to say that just the 
                         once would do

               rob looks around the room beginning to hyperventilate and 
               near tears  he sees laura in a corner of the room surrounded 
               by four or five mourners  he crosses to them and breaks 
               through to her

                                     rob
                         im sorry

               he breaks away from her and slips out the front door

               ext suburban street  afternoon

               so darkened by weather that it is almost night raining 
               torrents and big sheets  rob emerges from the front door of 
               lauras parents house and begins walking down the street 
               hands thrust into his pockets  the rain almost immediately 
               soaks him

               ext another street

               in the distance rob runs toward us  as he gets to us we 
               move with him down the street  he is drenched  we hear the 
               rain and his ragged breath  headlights appear behind him 
               and backlight him getting brighter as the sound of an engine 
               gets louder  rob takes a look over his shoulder looks 
               desperately left and right and vaults himself over a small 
               brick wall and into a flower bed landing on his back in the 
               black wet earth

               the big drops of rain splash mud on his face and he burrows 
               deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back panting and 
               staring up at the sky  offcamera the car engine catches 
               up and a door opens and shuts  he sighs and shuts his 
               eyes

               he opens his eyes again to see lauras face wet as well 
               staring down at him  it is difficult to distinguish rain 
               from tears

                                     laura
                         are you going to lie in that flower 
                         bed all night

                                     rob
                         uh no

               but rob keeps lying there  laura pulls herself to a sitting 
               position on the wall just above him

                                     laura
                         youre soaking

                         youre also an idiot

               rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall 
               next to her

                                     rob

               they swing their legs over the wall and walk to lauras vw

               int lauras car  night

               they drive sort of aimlessly through lauras old neighborhood  
               laura sees something on her left and makes a sudden turn up 
               a narrow road through some overgrown trees  they come to a 
               stop in a formerly paved clearing looking out on a field 
               with an old abandoned school on the other side  laura shuts 
               down the engine

                                     rob

               she pulls herself over him staddling him in the passenger 
               seat and kissing his neck  she pauses and regards him from 
               above

                                     laura

                         skirt today

               laura reaches down and unzips his pants as they keep kissing

                         yes of course  theres nothing to 
                         worry about

                                     rob
                         i didnt mean that  i mean was 
                         that all you used

               laura looks at him motionless then begins to cry

                                     rob
                         look we can do other things

                                     laura
                         i lived with you  you were my partner 
                         just a few weeks ago and now youre 
                         worried i might kill you and youre 
                         entitled to worry  isnt that a 
                         terrible thing  isnt that sad

               she rolls off of him into her seat  they sit there in 
               silence watching the rain run down the windshield

                                                                    cut to

               rob in his chair

               rob to camera

                                     rob
                         later i wonder if i was really 
                         worried about where ian has been  i 
                         have no idea where hes been and 
                         that gives me every right to insist 
                         on protection  but in truth it was 
                         the power that interested me more 
                         than the fear  i wanted to hurt 
                         her on this day of all days just 
                         because its the first time since 
                         shes left that ive been able to

               int bar  later

               rob and laura lean back in a booth facing each other  we 
               get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since 
               we last saw them

                                     rob

                         you

               rob leans forward

                                     rob
                         so if you had a bit more energy wed 
                         stay split  but things being how

                              nodding
                         everythings too hard  maybe another 
                         time i would have the guts to be on

                         into the middle of a bad relationship 
                         like a hand grenade i guess and

                         just that rob seems to think it would 
                         be wiser to start a record label by 
                         putting out a record with business
                         crippling nazi youth shoplifters

                         to find her going through my records 
                         pulling out things that she remembered 
                         me playing when i deejayed and putting 
                         them into the little carrying cases

                         closet somewhere years ago  she 
                         knew i needed a kick in the ass  
                         she also knew how happy i was when i 
                         used to deejay  from which every 
                         angle i examine it it still looks

                         longer than it might seem  you gotta 
                         kick off with a killer to hold the 
                         attention  then you have to take it 
                         up a notch but not blow your wad 
                         so maybe cool it off a notch and 
                         you cant put the same artist twice 
                         on the tape except if some subtle 
                         point or lesson or theme involved 
                         and even then not the two of them in 
                         a row and you cant woo somebody 
                         with joni mitchells big yellow 
                         taxi and then bash their head off 
                         with something like gbhs city baby 
                         attacked by rats and oh there 
                         are a lot of rules  anyway i worked 
                         hard at this one
