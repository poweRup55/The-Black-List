fade in


ext  countryside  day

the end of winter  snow blankets the landscape  a small
stream rushes through the valley  a clear blue sky hangs over
the distant mountains adding to the beauty of the setting

super impose scottish lowlands  1665

the camera begins to pan  the color of the snow begins to
change darkening from pure white to ash gray eventually to
coal black  we continue to pan until we arrive at


ext  village  day

plague  once a charming settlement it is now ravaged by
disease  everywhere bonfires burn sending plumes of black
smoke rising into the sky  the ash and soot drift back down
blackening the earth  villagers scurry about in tattered
clothing their faces soiled by soot as they throw objects of
wood and cloth into the fires

three horsemen ride into the village  two of them we can see
clearly as large powerful men with savage faces  the third
mans mans face is hidden from us in the shadows of a black
hooded cape  he dismounts motioning for the other two to wait
for him

the hooded man walks though the village  the sound of
hammering fills the air as several villagers finish building a
makeshift gallows

                                        cut to


ext  church  day

built of stone it is already centuries old  a villager stands
guard at the entrance  the hooded man approaches and whispers
something in the villagers ear then holds up a gold piece


int  church  day

dark and musty lit only by shafts of light which flow in
through the windows  the hooded man follows the villager
across the stone floor until he reaches a wooden door at the
back



                                                            2

int  stone room  day

no windows  the hooded man enters  in the center of the room
a circle has been drawn  bordering the circle are hundreds of
candles forming a ring of fire  a man stands in the center
his head bowed  his weight supported by thick ropes around
his wrists that are fastened to a wooden beam which runs the
length of the room

                    hooded mans voice
          vieira

vieira looks up  he is old his hair thin and gray but his
eyes are alive defiant  the hooded man moves closer  vieira
follows him with his eyes trying to see the hooded mans face
vieira strains against his ropes  the hooded man does not
move

                    vieira
          how comes it your are not afraid

                    hooded man
          wouldst you harm one who comes to
          aid you

vieiras silence indicates he is listening

                    hooded man
               continuing
          ive come to strike a bargain with
          you  i wish to learn the power of
          changing

                    vieira
          and what wouldst i gain from this
          bargain

                    hooded man
               nonchalantly
          your life

                    vieira
          how

the hooded man slowly pulls back his hood  we see his face for
the first time  it is hard brutal his eyes cold and dark
he grins  a wicked grin



                    hooded man
          i have a magic of my own


                                                            3

the hooded man removes a knife from under his coat  he holds
it before vieira then he quickly stabs it into his chest  his
face fills with pain  blood flows from the wound  he falls
to his knees  a beat  he slowly looks up at vieira as he
pulls the knife from his chest then stands unharmed  vieira
cannot believe what he has seen

                    hooded man
          teach me the chant and i will take
          your place on the gallows


ext  church  later  day

a group of religiouslooking men walk toward the church


int  stone room  day

vieira has finished teaching the chant

                    vieira
          after you recite the chant you must
          concentrate of the form you wish to
          take  the stonger you are the longer
          you can hold the illusion

in the bg we hear the sound of footsteps coming up the
stairs  vieira looks at the hooded man

                    vieira
          they come  quickly take my place

the men enter  one of them looks at the hooded man

                    religious man
          what are you doing here

the hooded man stares at him  a hard unnerving stare  then
slowly his thin lips from a cruel grin

                    hooded man
          just saying goodbye to an old friend

vieira stares at the hooded man angrily


                    vieira
          we had a bargain  you promised

                    hooded man
          i lied

the hooded man walks from the room



                                                            4

ext  church  day

the hooded man walks out  the two horsemen ride up  the
hooded man climbs on his horse  he takes a deep breath as he
looks at a range of mountains in the distance

                                        cut to


ext  valley  day

the sound of swords crossing fill the air  two men one young
the other old fight across the snowswept ground  in the bg
a large stone building is built at the base of a mountain
range

the young man fights furiously his only weapon strength but
he is clearly inexperienced  the old man is agile and easily
moves out of the way of each blow  the young man swings
wildly he loses his balance  the old man strikes his sword
away then pushes him to the ground  the young man looks up as
the older man raises his sword above his head  their eyes
lock  the old man smiles and slowly lowers the sword to the
young mans neck

                    old man
          its over

the old man reaches out his hand helping the young man to his
feet  the young man is clearly angry

                    old man
          your anger blinds you  you must
          learn to control it  when the time
          comes youll only have but one
          chance  you best use it well


int  stone building  day

large and barren  a fires roars in the fireplace  the old man
sits across a wooden table from the young man as they finish
eating

the young man appears restless  he pushes his plate
away  stands up and walks toward the door

                    old man
          where are you off to

                    young man
          to the village for some ale  and if
          the truth be known i need to see
          someones face other than yours old
          man


                                                            5

they smile  the young man takes his sword then puts on his
coat  he picks up a sack and leaves  the old man begins to
clear away the dishes  suddenly he stops  his smile fades
he looks towards the door filled with a premonition  outside
we hear the sound of swords crossing  it lasts only for a
moment  silence

a blinding green light fills the frame of the door  the ground
begins to tremble  the stones of the building shake from the
force  debris falls from the ceiling  it stops  silence

the old man takes his sword from the mantle  the door opens
the sound of the wind rushes in  outside nothing can be seen 
 only the darkness of the night  a beat  the young man
enters the room  the old man smiles at the sight of him  the
young man places his sack on the table

the old man turns his back as he starts to replace his sword on
the mantle  the young mans expression hardens  he stares at
the old mans neck as he starts to raise his sword


old mans pov

in a silver wine chalice he sees the reflection of the young
man who is now slowly raising his sword and about to strike at
the old mans neck

in one fluid movement the old man unsheathes his sword then
turns quickly  the young mans blade slices through the air
missing its target  the old man pivots and slices his blade
across the young mans chest  the young man winces in pain
then takes a deep breath  his body begins to shake violently

a transformation begins  the image of young man begins to fade
and is replaced by the hooded man  he laughs loudly as he
holds up his arms as if prompting the old man for his
appreciation of the illusion

                    old man
               hatefully
          kilvara

the hooded man smiles when he hears his name

                    kilvara
          it flatters me you remember old one
          its been what two hundred years

                    old man
          its not been long enough  what
          witchcraft is this


                                                            6

                    kilvara
          impressive  is it not  the problem
          is i can only keep the illusion for a
          few minutes  i need more power to
          hold the form longer  i need the
          highlander  where is he

                    old man
          i do not know  and even if i did

                    kilvara
               cutting him off
          i know  i know you would not tell
          me  loyalty  it really is a
          concept that eludes me
               shrugs his
                shoulders
          oh well  i shall find him  time is
          on my side

the old man looks sadly at the open door  kilvara notices and
grins

                    kilvara
          is this what youre looking for

kilvara opens the sack  inside it is the head of the young
man  kilvara laughs a deep guttural laugh  he turns and
starts towards the door  suddenly he stops and turns back to
face the old man

                    kilvara
               mockingly
          oh  i almost forgot  your head

                    old man
          it does not come off as easily as the
          young ones

                    kilvara
               amused
          perhaps  but it comes off none the
          less

with a savage yell kilvara draws his sword and lunges at the
old man  the old man steps aside and kilvaras sword smashes
down on the table shattering it into splinters

the two horsemen step into the room and watch  kilvara lunges
again  and again  each time the old man sidesteps him
kilvara swings  the old man ducks  the blade hits the stone
wall  sparks fly  rock explodes  the old man slices his
blade across kilvara chest  a deep gash is cut  blood flows
kilvara examines the wound


                                                            7

                    kilvara
          youre dead

with brutal strength kilvara begins his attack again whipping
his sword through the air furiously  their swords cross 
sparks fly  kilvara is too powerful for the old man  all he
can do is back up  using his sword to block each ferocious
blow  they pass through a large arch at the rear of the room


int  cavern  night

the building is built at the mouth of a vast cave  torches set
in the walls of the cavern are the only source of light  a
wooden bridge is built over a deep ravine  kilvara and the old
man continue their fight across the bridge  the horsemen lag
behind enjoying the battle  the old mans strength is giving
way under the merciless attack

the sparks from each contact is even more dazzling in the dim
light of the cavern  kilvara swings again  the old man tries
to block it  in one fluid movement kilvara scrapes his sword
along the old mans  then lunges forward  thrusting his
blade through the old mans chest  the old man screams in
pain  kilvara lifts him up with the blade  kilvara flings him
off the blade and onto the ground  the old man is on his
knees  kilvara raises his sword above his head

                    kilvara
          there can be only one

kilvara brings the blade down  it slices through the old mans
neck severing his head from his body  kilvara waits
preparing himself  a stream of bright green light begins to
flow from the body of the old man  it grows brighter and
brighter  the body of the old man begins to hover above the
ground then in a pulsing burst of energy the light flows into
kilvara  the force knocks him to his knees

the ground shakes  the walls of the cavern move  suddenly
chunks of rock are blown out of the walls  the rumbling sound
grows louder and louder  blinding green light fills the cave
and then  a deafening explosion  whole sections of the
cavern begin to collapse  covering the exit  trapping
everyone inside


ext  mountain  wide shot  night

the rumbling sound subsides  in the distance we hear the
savage scream of kilvara  the camera moves up the side of the
mountain  as we come over the top we see

                                        smash cut to


                                                            8


ext  new york city  night

the familiar towers of the city skyline stand along the bay
their lights reflecting off the water


ext  street  night

a thick fog hangs in the air  a light wind blows moving
newspapers and other articles of trash along the deserted
street


ext  alley  night

crates and trash dumpsters line the alley  a single naked
light bulb shines down like a spotlight  through the fog the
silhouette of man appears as he steps under the light


moving with the man  reverse shot

we follow the man from behind  he is tall dressed in a long
tan raincoat jeans and sneakers  a small travel bag is slung
over his shoulder  as he moves down the alley he hears a
scraping sound  he stops  but does not turn around

a street punk emerges from behind a trash crate scraping the
blade of his knife along the wall of a building  he studies
the man for a moment as he runs his thumb along the edge of the
blade almost caressing it

                    punk
          whatcha got in the bag

not only does the man not answer  he doesnt even turn
around

                    punk
          hey  you hear me

conner macleod slowly turns around  he is mid thirties
handsome his chin dotted with the stubble of a beard  he is
calm detached  yet under the surface there is a great
sadness from a lifetime of pain and loneliness  he stares at
the punk wearily  knowing both what is going to happen and
what the outcome will be

                    macleod
               softly
          yes  i hear you

                    punk
          good  now give it up

                                                            9


macleod studies the punk for a moment

                    macleod
          go home  while you still can

macleod turns his back to him and starts to walk away  the
punk moves after him quickly  macleod reaches into a trash can
and pulls out a piece of pipe  the punk stops and stares at
macleod

                    punk
               amused
          what do you think youre gonna to do
          with that

macleod raises the pipe twirling it around expertly in his
hand

                    macleod
               deadly calm
          lets find out

a beat  the punk is losing confidence  he looks at macleod

close on macleods eyes

deep  confidant  they radiate an intensity that seems to burn
into the punk

the punk is unnerved by macleods calm  macleod waits letting
him make the next move  a beat  the punk backs away and
disappears into the darkness  macleod stares him for a moment
then drops the pipe to the ground and walks off in the other
direction


ext  street  night

macleod stops at the mouth of the alley where it intersects
with the street  he stares across the street


macleods pov

an old building  a sign reads  russell nash antiques

a sadness falls across his face  his mind floods with
memories as he looks at the building

across the street the door of the antique store opens  rachel
an attractive woman in her fifties exits  locks the door 
walks down the street


                                                            10

macleod watches her affectionately  painfully  as she
crosses the street he steps back into the shadows of the
alley hiding in the darkness  rachel reaches the alley then
stops  thinks  looks back at the antique store  she is
only a few feet away from macleod

close on macleod

macleod struggles to make a decision  slowly he raises his
hand  reaches out  but cannot bring himself to touch her

rachel starts to walk away

                    macleod os
          rachel

no more needs to be said  she recognizes the voice instantly
she turns around slowly and looks behind her  in the bg
macleod steps out of the darkness  he smiles at her weakly

confusion fills her face but is quickly replaced by a wave of
emotion  she moves towards macleod slowly as if trying to
determine if he is really there  she cups her hands to his
face and stares deeply into his eyes  no words are spoken 
none need to be  the power of their feelings are shown in
their eyes

int  antique store  night

crowded with tables chairs cabinets and other rare old
objects of furniture  macleod is seated at a 17th century
dinning table  rachel stands in the center of the room

                    rachel
          you know its not safe here for you

                    macleod

                    rachel
          the police still have a lot of
          questions for russell nash

                    macleod
          i can take care of myself

rachels emotion builds


                                                            11

                    rachel
          why are you here conner  after
          seven years without a word why have
          you come back  you went off to make
          a new life with brenda and that was
          the last i heard

a sadness falls over macleods face

                    macleod
          brendas dead

rachel is stunned

                    macleod
               continuing
          four years ago  ive nowhere else to
          go  youre all i have rachel  and
          im just so tired of being alone

his words touch her  she opens a cabinet and pulls out a
bottle of glenmorgangie scotch  macleod forces a weak smile
in the light he looks tired  she pours him a drink

                    rachel
          it isnt over is it conner

                    macleod
               wearily
          no

                    rachel
          how can that be

                    macleod
          i dont know

rachels face fills with compassion  she reaches out and holds
macleod  he lays his head on her shoulder like a baby


int  library  night

every inch of wallspace is filled with shelves and books
macleod walks along a row studying the titles  a faint grin
falls across his face as he sees a selected works of poetry

rachel enters the room with a tea service and places it on the
table

                    rachel
          is there anything else you need

                    macleod
          no  im fine  thank you

                                                            12


                    rachel
          im glad youve come home conner

                    macleod
          me too

rachel leaves  macleod takes a small book off the shelf and
looks through it  outside a streak of lightning cuts across
the night sky  macleod looks out the window concerned

ext  farm  day

seventeenth century scotland  the camera rise over an old
stone wall  a charming farm house with stone walls and a
thatched roof sits in the distance  smoke drifts lazily from
the chimney


in the field

a man toils behind an ox his arms straining as he guides a
plow through the soft earth  he stops runs his hand across
his brow then turns around  it is macleod  his hair is
longer but he looks exactly the same

the farmer and owner of the land a kindlylooking man in his
fifties walks over to him  he picks up and handful of soil and
tastes it

                    farmer
          it will be a good harvest this year

                    mccleod
          can you really tell from doing that

                    farmer
          what do you think

                    mccleod
          i think you just like to eat dirt

they both laugh  sarah fifteen years old with flaxen hair
and bright blue eyes approaches macleod with a water pale

                    sarah
               shyly
          would you care for some water
          conner

                    mccleod
          aye  that i would lass

                                                            13


conner takes the ladle and pours it over his head  he scoops
out some more water and drinks then winks at sarah  she
blushes and runs off

                    farmer
          i think my sarah fancies you conner

                    mccleod
          shes a treasure she is

                    farmer
          shell soon be of age

macleod understands him only too well

                    mccleod
          your words are kind and they flatter
          me  but i think of her as a sister

                    farmer
          i know that for six months youve
          worked hard and asked for little
          that youre a good and honest man
          what more need i know

the conversation is interrupted by the sound of horses hooves
thundering across the fields  two men dirty and roughlooking
ride up to the house  they have the look of warriors to them
the farmers wife and sarah stand outside the house


ext  farm house  day

the farmer arrives out of breath from his run across the
field  in the bg we see macleod going into the barn

                    farmer
          good day

the men do not answer  the farmer is nervous  he has seen men
like this before  a few other farm hands mostly old men and
women come in from the fields

                    farmer
          you are welcome to share our food and
          our fire

                    warrior 1
          we do not share old man  we take

warrior 1 dismounts  his eyes fall on young sarah  he looks
back at his friend with a toothless grin


                                                            14

                    warrior 1
          you can eat if you want  im going
          to start with her

warrior 1 walks towards sarah who clings to her mother  the
farmer stands in the path of the warrior

                    farmer
          no

warrior 1 backhands the farmer across the face sending him
falling to the ground  sarah tries to run but the warrior
grabs her  he lifts her over his shoulder and carries her
inside the barn closing the door behind them  we hear sarah
scream  a beat  suddenly the doors of the barn crash open as
the warrior flies out of the barn and lands on his back

macleod steps out of the barn his samurai in hand  warrior
2 still mounted on his horse grins

                    warrior 2
          it appears this farmer has a temper

warrior 1 staggers to his feet  he removes his sword and
stares angrily at macleod

                    warrior 1
          this farmer is dead

warrior 1 lunges at macleod who casually sidesteps his attack
and slices his sword across the warriors chest  the warrior
gasps then falls to the ground dead

warrior 2 cannot believe what he has seen  anger fills his
face  he reaches to the side of his saddle and lifts a cross
bow  macleod changes his grip on the sword and holds it like a
spear  he throws it at the warrior at the same time he fires
the cross bow  the sword flies into the warriors stomach
blood flows from his mouth  a beat  he falls from the saddle
dead

macleod is standing an arrow deadcenter in his chest  blood
flows from the wound  he slowly walks into the barn  the
farmer runs after him


int  barn  moments later  day

the farmer enters  macleod is on his knees his face filled
with pain  he pulls the arrow from his chest and stands  the
farmer cannot believe what he has just seen  he crosses
himself


                                                            15

outside through the open barn doors we see sarah and her
mother running towards them  the farmer quickly closes the
doors and bolts them

                    farmer
               stunned
          this cannot be

                    mccleod
          it is  do not ask me how  i do not
          know  i must leave for if i stayed
          others would surely hear of this and
          worse than they will come

                    farmer
          agreed

                    mccleod
               sadly

he looks down in the valley  he can see the lights in the
farmhouse below

                    farmer

          with your name

the farmers voice is distant  he is still unable to grasp
what he has seen

                    mccleod
          thank you

macleod reaches up his hand  the farmer does not take it
macleod understands  he starts to walk off into the night

several four wheel drive trucks and vans  professor paul
dajorski is a typical academic in his fifties beard glasses
pipe tweed jacket  he walks across the field with a reporter
and cameraman

                    professor dajorski
          for years this site was thought to
          hold no archaeological value  that
          is until a few weeks ago when some
          local boys discovered what appears to
          be a collapsed passageway that leads
          into a cavern

                    reporter
          how much longer until you expect to
          enter the main cavern

          going to find in there  it could be
          a huge excavation  a little friendly
          pr never hurt

electric lights are set up at intervals along the tunnel  we

thick sheepskins  he drops from the tree landing before

only three of the four stone walls are standing  a large
section of the roof is gone  inside are about thirty men
warriors fierce and hardlooking  they stand before what once
was the altar and listen as cavenaugh speaks

                    cavanaugh
          ive called this gathering on holy
          ground so that each man might take
          comfort in knowing he is protected
          inside the confines of these walls
          none of us good or evil would dare
          raise a hand against the other in
          gods house

                    man 1
          if god protects us so why has he
          cursed us

                    cavanaugh
          gods purpose for us is unclear save
          that he has given us a gift

                    man 2
          a gift  you call never growing old 
           watching friends and loved ones die
          a gift

                    cavanaugh
          i do not profess to know what is in
          gods mind  he has chosen us  we
          are his warriors through time  the
          final gathering is still far away but
          the prize must be captured by a man
          who is pure of heart  those of us
          who would use the prize for goodly
          purpose must band together against
          those who would use it for evil

in the back of the room standing alone is macleod  his eyes
are on the altar but his mind seems far away

                    mccleod
          the prize  so much blood so that in
          the end the one that remains will be
          mortal again  so much pain so that
          the winner can grow old and have
          children  the prize hardly seems
          worth the cost of it

                    cavanaugh
          there will be more to the prize than
          that  power will come with it  and
          it must be used for good

          world is changing

          aye  yet one such as i who has
          wandered this world for nearly nine
          centuries can remember back to other
          days of change  days of robin of the
          hood and arthur pendragon  they were
          real enough once but they drifted
          into mens dreams and became legend

alone in the pew  he stares at the altar his mind deep in
thought  a priest walks down the aisle  stops  studies him
for a moment then sits beside him

                    priest
          you look troubled my son

macleods mouth hints at a grin from the priests
understatement  he does not look at the priest

                    priest
          sometimes we feel better if we talk
          about the things that bother us  how
          long has it been since your last
          confession

                    mccleod
               distantly
          a long time

macleod stands and prepares to leave

          redemption is one of gods gifts

macleod looks at the priest sadly

                    mccleod

premonition fills him  he turns around knowing what he will
find behind him

the other horseman approaches  he holds his broad sword at his
side

macleod holds his hand up

                    mccleod
          wait  we dont have to do this

the horseman lunges at macleod  he raises the sword and brings
it down quickly  macleod moves quickly to his side  the sword
miss him by inches as it smashes into the railing slicing
through the metal

macleod stares into the horsemans eyes  they are cold
savage  he knows there is not point in talking

                    mccleod
          alright

macleod opens his rain coat and slowly removes the ancient
samurai sword  he expertly twirls the sword as he raises it
over his head and holds it in a fighting stance  a beat  both
men lock eyes  the horseman attacks

blades cross  sparks fly  the men move across the quay
towards the warehouse

the horseman thrusts his sword  macleod steps to the side and
slices the blade of the samurai across the horsemans face  a
deep gash appears blood flows down his cheek  the horseman
touches the wound looks at the blood on his finger then
tastes it  he grins and attacks

the horseman whirls his sword swinging furiously at macleod
blow after powerful blow pounds against the samurai  macleod
is backed up against the railing  the swords cross and
remained locked  each man pushing against the other in a show
of strength

the horseman knees macleod in the groin  macleod doubles over
the horseman brings the butt of his sword down hard between
macleods shoulder blades  macleod falls to his knees
dropping his sword  the horseman lifts the samurai and throws
it behind him  macleod struggles to shake the pain from his
body as the horseman raises the sword above macleods neck

as he brings it down macleod lunges forward hurling his body
into the horseman and picking him  macleods runs across the
quay carrying the horseman on his shoulder  the horseman
raises his sword above his head  macleod heads towards one of
the large windows of the warehouse


int  meat packing warehouse  dusk

crash  glass shatters as macleod and the horseman break
through the window  carcasses of beef hang from hooks on a
curving shaped processing line  slowly the two warriors get
to their feet  the horsemans sword is a few feet behind him
he stands and walks to it  macleod looks around the room
looking for something  anything  that might be used as a
weapon

the horseman attacks swinging his sword wildly  macleod grabs
the racks of beef using them as a shield  the horsemans
blade slices through the meat  macleod back up grabs another
side of beef and pushes it into the horseman  the impact
knocks the horseman to the ground  his sword slides across the
floor  the horseman gets up and walks over to his sword

macleod grabs one of the meat hooks and hurls it towards the
horsemans back  the horseman has just about reached the sword
when the hook spears him between the shoulder blades

macleod pushes a red button  the processing line begins to
move  the hook lifts picking the horseman off the ground
the horseman tries desperately to reach the hook but he
cannot  macleod picks up the sword and readies himself  the
horseman heads back towards macleod   in one fluid motion
macleod cuts off his head  leaving the rope intact  the
headless body continues to swing across the room

a beat  macleod readies himself for what he knows his coming
sparks of green light begin to pulse out from the horsemans
headless body

macleods body stiffens as a jolt of power fills him  overhead
light fixtures crackle as the light bulbs begin to glow  the
engine of an old fork lift comes to life  a radio turns on
filling the room with music


ext  warehouse  night

one by one the windows explode raining a shower of glass on
the dock  and then  silence

an exhaustedlooking macleod staggers out of the building  he
searches through the darkness until he finds his sword then
runs off into the night

the teller hangs up the phone and walks back to her station
mr parker looks pale beads of sweat dot his forehead  the
clock on the wall now reads 122  the teller takes out
several stacks of one hundred dollar bills  she starts to
count them  mr parker scoops them into his briefcase

                    mr parker
          thats okay  i trust you

mr parker walks away  his face sweats more his body
stiffens  he draws the attention of a guard  mr parker walks
behind one of the pillars as he heads for the exit  when we
see him again he looks different  he passes behind another 
and again when we see him he appears different  from pillar to
pillar his shape changes until when he passes from behind the
last one he is now kilvara

the guard cannot believe what he has seen  or what he thinks
he has seen  he weaves in an out of the pillars looking for
any sign of mr parker  there is none  he rushes up to
kilvara who is still holding the briefcase

                    guard
          just a moment sir

kilvara stops  he turns around slowly

                    guard
          would you come with me please

                    kilvara
          i think not

the guard moves closer  kilvara slowly reaches his free hand
under his jacket  the guard instantly removes his revolver and
aims it at kilvara

                    guard
          freeze

kilvara stares at the gun with amusement  in a flash his sword
his drawn  he moves towards the guard  the guard fires  the
first three shots hit kilvara in the chest  his light colored
shirt splatters with blood  the shots drive him backwards but
not down  he staggers forward  the guard fires three more
shots  kilvara falls to the ground on his back


                                                            38

the bank breaks into chaos  customers dive to the ground  the
guard slowly moves over kilvara and kicks the sword away  he
leans over to take a pulse  kilvaras eyes open  he grabs the
guard by the throat and lifts him off the ground and he stands
kilvara pushes him against the wall and stares angrily into his
eyes

                    kilvara
               pissed off
          that hurt

in the bg we hear police sirens  kilvara knows he has little
time  he lets go of the guard picks up his sword and runs
from the bank

          the ones who love them when theyre
          in trouble

                    mccleod

macleod puts his bag down near the counter  he touches
rachels face lightly

                    mccleod

the counter with her foot hiding it from bedsoes view

                    bedsoe

macleod shrugs his shoulders

                    bedsoe

          a body  with its head cut off
          sound familiar

                    bedsoe
          and brenda

a sadness falls across macleods face  bedsoe has seen that
look before  he knows what it means

                    bedsoe
          how

macleod doesnt answer the question  his personal life is not
open for discusion

                    bedsoe
          she was a good woman

                    mccleod
          you didnt bring me here to talk
          about her

                    bedsoe

bedsoe picks up an 8x10 photograph of the headless corpse in
the meat packing warehouse


                                                            41

                    mccleod
          he doesnt look familiar  but then
          hed probably be easier to identity
          with his head

macleod and bedsoe lock eyes  a beat  there is a knock on the
twoway mirror  bedsoe gets up and leaves the room


int  hall  day

bedsoe walks over to captain newsome  we can macleod through

before the guards can begin to move macleod we hear a crackling
sound  suddenly cavanaughs body begins to hover above the
ground streaks of green light flowing out of it  several of
the guards cross themselves  then cavanaughs energy is blown
into macleod

macleod screams  he effortlessly breaks his ropes  he looks
at the headless body with sadness then jumps on a cart and
climbs over the walls

premonition  he looks up and down the street


macleods pov

the streets are empty

macleod reaches under his raincoat for the handle of his sword
and starts walking  as he reaches the corner we hear
footsteps  macleod stops  waits

a uniformed police officer turns the corner and walks towards
him  macleod takes his hand out from his coat and walks past
him  the instant the cop passes macleod he turns  and removes
a sword from under his jacket

jennifer watches helplessly

the cop smiles as he raises the sword over his head  it
gliimers as the light from the street light reflects off it

macleod is walking away  he hears her scream and turns around
just as the sword comes streaking at his head  macleod side
steps the attack the blade slices across his forearm a stripe
of blood appears on his arm  macleod quickly removes his
samurai from under his jacket

the cop studies him for a moment then begins to laugh  a
transformation begins and he turns into kilvara

jennifers face is filled with disbelief from the sight she has
just witnessed

kilvara smiles at macleod his eyes alive with hatred

                    kilvara

          you

                    mccleod
               confused
          this cannot be

kilvara says nothing  he lunges at macleod  their swords
cross  sparks fly  as the battle each other along the
street  their sword cross and lock  they grab each other
hands  their faces inches from each other

                    kilvara

          the kurgan was a pussy

kilvara knees macleod in the groin  macleod doubles over then
pushes forward ramming his head in kilvaras stomach 
pushing him backwards and slamming his back into a wall

lights begins to come on in the windows of the apartments
macleod runs off  kilvara follows  macleod runs around the
corner

jennifer does not move  she is trying to digest what she has
seen  a beat then she runs after them


ext  street  around the corner  night

as kilvara rounds the corner he sees macleod waiting for him
his sword at his side  kilvara runs towards him begins to
raise his sword then stops

sword and looks at macleod hatefully

                    kilvara
          why prolong the inevitable

macleod doesnt answer

                    kilvara
          fine  ive waited over three
          centuries  i can wait a little
          longer

                    mccleod
          why did you wait

                    kilvara
          it was not by choice  a small matter
          of a mountain falling down on us  we
          were trapped inside
               serious
          when the time of the gathering came
          the urge to go was so strong we tried
          to claw through rock with our bare
          hands  what you thought was the end
           was not  this is the end  we are
          the last of our kind macleod

                    mccleod
          it will not end tonight

                    kilvara
          you cannot hide from me  you will
          not stand between me and my destiny
          after i have your head the power will
          let me hold any form as long as i

          i can become the president  i can
          become anyone i want  the world will

kilvara starts to leave  he stops and turns back towards
macleod with a grin  in the bg we see jennifer crossing the

her against the wall  from inside his overcoat he slowly
removes a long sword  he holds the tip of the blade up before

          alright  in the shop you mentioned
          something about

          the calan  do you know who they
          are

                    mccleod

          they were called different things by
          different cultures  the celts called
          them the sourans  the druids called
          them the calans  according to the
          mythology they were spirits sent to
          earth and reborn  some good  some
          evil  both immortal

                    macleod
          immortal

                    jennifer
          yes  they do not age and they cannot
          die  unless their head is cut from
          their body

macleods face betrays nothing

                    jennifer
               continuing
          then the spirit is released and the
          power is absorbed by the calan who
          severs it

                    macleod
          very interesting  i bet kids love
          you at bedtime

                    jennifer
          maybe you can explain what i saw the
          other night

macleod ignores her question

                    mccleod
          have you told lieutenant bedsoe your
          theory

                    jennifer
          no

                    mccleod
          why not

                    jennifer
          because i dont feel like sitting in
          a rubber room for fortyeight hours

                    mccleod
          you dont really believe this do you

                                                            79


                    jennifer
               sidesteps the
                question
          let me ask you something else  at
          the excavation site in scotland the
          tunnel leading into the cavern had
          collapsed  the day we found the body
          someone had moved the rocks making a
          hole in the collapsed section  what
          bothers me is that we found the rocks
          from the hole on our side of the
          tunnel wall

                    mccleod
          so

                    jennifer
          why would someone pull on the rocks
          to get in the cavern  they were
          wedged in tight  they couldnt get a
          grip on them  they would have had
          much more strength pushing on them

                    mccleod
          if they pushed the rocks you would
          have found them on the other side of
          the cavern wall

                    jennifer
          yes  if they were trying to get in
           but what if they werent  what if
          they were trying to get out

a beat  macleod isnt sure how much she knows  but he knows
she is close

                    mccleod
          that would mean theyd been trapped
          in there

                    jennifer
          for three hundred years

                    mccleod
          how could that be  people dont live
          for three hundred years

                    jennifer
          not unless theyre immortal

their eyes lock  macleod studies her  he knows she knows 
or at least suspects  jennifer smiles warmly she places her
hand on macleod arm  then quickly tears the bandage of his
arm

                                                            80

there is no trace of the cut  no scar  nothing

jennifer looks back at macleod astonished  macleod slowly
peels her hand off his arm  his eyes stare deeply into hers

                     mccleod
          youre very smart for someone who has
          not even lived a single lifetime
          maybe too smart

macleod gets up and leaves  jennifer follows

          are you saying that its true

          you asked me earlier if that ring
          meant something to me  it does  it
          reminds me of someone i knew a long
          time ago

jennifer starts to take it off her finger

                    jennifer
          would you like to see it

                    mccleod

          how did you know that

macleod away  his mind drifts as he speaks

                    mccleod
          it came from your great great great
          grandmother isabelle tourez who
          lived in paris and died on the
          guillotine in 1789  alone  and
          unmarried  the ring was given to her
          by someone who loved her  but knew
          that it could never be

macleod looks at her his eyes staring deeply into hers

                    mccleod
          yes

now that she has heard what she suspected a look of doubt
crosses her face  macleod notices it

                    mccleod
          i was born into the clan macleod
          five hundred years ago in glenfinnan
           on the shores of loch shiel


                                                            82

jennifer stares at him  there is doubt in her eyes
suspecting and believing are two different things and her
expression relays her skepticism  macleod picks up a dagger on
the worktable and holds it before his heart

                    mccleod
          ive wandered the world ever since
          then  i cannot die

she tries to stop him but before she can macleod thrusts the
dagger into his chest  his face fills with pain  he drops to
his knees  jennifer watches in horror  a beat  macleod looks
up at her then pulls the dagger from his chest  jennifer is
overwhelmed with astonishment  she slowly drops to her knees
they are inches from each other

                    mccleod
               weakly
          you wanted the truth  now you have
          it

                    jennifer
          and the other one  he is like you

                    mccleod
          he is immortal  yes  but he is
          not like me  we are the last of our
          kind
               he looks at her
          the last of the calans  i do not
          know what purpose we were put here
          for  i only know that if he wins the
          world will suffer for it

macleod starts to stand  jennifer gently places her hand on
his shoulder

                    jennifer
          where will you go now

                    mccleod
          it will end tonight

                    jennifer
          must you fight him

                    mccleod
          he will not stop until it is over

jennifer stares deeply into his eyes  she moves closer and
then gently kisses him  they search each others eyes  she
leans in to kiss him again  macleod pulls away  she starts to
say something he gently puts his finger over her lips and
stares at her fondly  then leaves

slams him into the wall then holds his gun to macleods face

          he said he saw two men fighting in an
          alley with swords  one cut off the
          others head  he shot the surviving
          guy twenty times and he got right
          back up and stabbed him

          maybe he was a lousy shot

bedsoe anger fills bedsoes face  he slowly pulls back the
hammer of his pistol  a beat  he studies macleod for a
reaction  there isnt one

                    bedsoe
          most people would show some sign of
          fear with a gun in their face

                    mccleod
          most people are afraid of death

          most people can die

a beat  their eyes are locked on each others probing
studying evaluating

                    mccleod
          if you really believe that youll
          pull the trigger

                    mccleod

feet away from her on the table  on the second chair a
crossbow has been mounted and aimed at jennifer  a rope is
tied to the trigger and stretched to her chair  a weight has
been tied in the center of the rope  a candle burns behind the
weight  when it burns though the rope the weight will fall and
the crossbow will fire at jennifer

kilvara steps out of the shadows a wicked grin on his face


                                                            87

          save her  all you have to do is blow
          out the candle  of course you have
          to get past me to do it

the rope is beginning to turn black as the candle burns deeper
into it  macleod knows he has little time before the ropes
snaps  he moves towards her  kilvara blocks his path

                    kilvara

the rope is about to snap  strands are staring to fray

macleod runs across the tabletop and jumps onto another as he
heads for the long table across the room

kilvara stands  picks up his sword and runs after macleod


                                                            88

more strands of the rope snap as the flame burns deeper in the
rope  it is just about to when

macleod runs onto the long table  he dives and slides across
it  his samurai extended in front of him

the rope snaps  the weight begins to fall

macleod drives the blade of his sword through the trigger
housing  the weight pulls on the rope  but the blade of the
samurai blocks the trigger from pulling back

kilvara reaches macleod  their eyes meet  macleod knows he
cannot removes his sword to defend himself or the crossbow will
fire  kilvara raises his sword and is about to strike when a
shot is fired

bedsoe is standing in the doorway his gun aimed at kilvara

drops to the ground

hand and slides across the floor  kilvara effortlessly lifts
him off the ground and throws him against the wall  bedsoe
hist the floor hard his face etched in pain from several

macleod stares at him confidently

                    mccleod

is facing kilvara  he removes his samurai  the trigger snaps
back

face

macleod runs towards him  kilvara pulls the arrow from his
chest and manages to raises his sword just in time to block
macleods attack  through the room they battle  macleod
fights fiercely backing kilvara up

jennifer makes bedsoe more comfortable by propping him against
the wall  she looks around the room


jennifers pov

of bedsoes gun on the floor

jennifer rushes over to it and picks it up  she aims it at
kilvara

kilvara sees her with the gun  he knows that if she shoots him
he would be stunned along enough for macleod to take his head

jennifer fires a shot  it misses  the bullet hits the wall
kilvara swings his sword powerfully at one of the wooden
pillars  his blade slices through it  part of the roof
collapses

dust fills the room  silence  jennifer slowly moves forward
trying to see through it  the dust clears  she stops 
stunned and confused by what she sees


jennifers pov

standing in the middle of the room are two macleods

jennifer moves the gun back and forth between each of them
noting knowing which is the real macleod

both macleods look at each other  they lunges at each other
and the battle begins again

jennifer can only watch helplessly

through the room they fight  both macleods swinging their
swords at the other  their swords cross  sparks fly  they
move through the room  fighting fiercely


                                                            90

one of the macleods swings his sword  it slices through the
other arm  the other macleods drops his sword  the first
macleod raises his sword

                    mccleod
          there can be only one

he swings the sword slicing it across the other macleods
neck  a beat  out the gash come a brilliant green light 
then the transformation begins  the image of macleod fades and
is replaced by kilvara  he stares at macleod tries to smile
but falls to the floor and dies

a beat  macleod readies himself  the place explodes in a
burst of green light  windows explode overhead lights flash
on and off then blow up

jennifer and bedsoe shield their eyes from the brilliant
spectacle

macleods body pulses with pain as kilvaras power flows into
him

silence  macleod drops to his knees  jennifer rushes over to
him and helps him to his feet

                    jennifer
          is it over

for a moment it is as if he didnt hear the question then
slowly he looks at her  he picks up his samurai and slowly
slices the blade into the palm of his hand  a cut appears  a
beat  it does not heal  macleod looks at her with a trace of
grin

                    mccleod
          yes  i think it is

                    bedsoe

going to do

                    bedsoe
          no  it was self defense

macleod nods at bedsoe  without words a quiet understanding
is reached between them  bedsoe looks angrily at the
paramedics

                    bedsoe
          well we gonna wait here for my bones
          to heal  or you gonna take me to
