               colour

               raking down a line of suburban gardens lit by a latesummer 
               sun heads move back and forth above the fences that divide 
               the narrow strips of land moving to the sound of unseen 
               lawn mowers

               in one of these gardens two children bill aged eight 
               and his sister sue aged six disport themselves they are 
               sprawled out on the lawn heads and hands intent on 
               something hidden from view in the lush vegetation of a 
               rockery garden beneath those flowers and plants is a dark 
               and mysterious forest shaded by huge leaves and broken 
               up by towering boulders mounted figures of medieval knights 
               ride in guided by bills gigantic hand a wizard appears 
               in the path of the riders who draw up sharply bill gives 
               an impression of neighing horses sues face looms up 
               between large leaves she makes the sound of spooky wind

               in the penumbra of the room the mother grace in droopy 
               flowered frock crosses floats towards the walnut wireless 
               and with trembling hand switches it on its green dial 
               glows with stations like droitwich and hilversum she glides 
               back and drapes herself behind an armchair in which her 
               husband clive sits solemn and motionless

               the sound of the lawnmower ceases abruptly bill looks up 
               sharply the neighbours heads come to rest on top of the 
               garden fences they turn listening bill inclines his 
               head towards the french windows sensing the dread moment 
               he walks towards the door and is framed there he regards 
               his parents

               int rohan house  diningliving room  day

               they look back with unseeing inwardturned eyes young 
               bill gathers confused fragments of the fateful announcement

               clive appears having stripped to the waist but wearing his 
               sam browne from the first wold war they all shriek with 
               laughter clive encouraged by this response does drill 
               movements and then demonstrates how to salute

                                     clive
                         there are many ways of saluting
                              he demonstrates
                         an old soldier insulting a young 
                         subaltern

               his hand flies to his forehead gouging the air the salute 
               transformed into an obscene gesture more laughter

                                     clive
                         as an officer you counter that 
                         with one of these

               he raises his arm slowly and languidly until his limp hand 
               just brushes his temple a faraway look in his eyes disdains 
               any acknowledgement of the insulting salute a tiny skirmish 
               in the class war

               she slaps his face he holds up his hands in mock horror 
               and backs away

               suspended on a thread over his bed the cannon fire 
               gradually resolves into a tapping on the window  blearily 
               he gets up and unlatches it a dishevelled dawn climbs 
               through threading her way between the model airplanes 
               hanging from the ceiling and stepping down over the table 
               on which bill has his shrapnel collection spread

               she pockets it and creeps out of the door smiling smugly

               int rohan house  dawns bedroom  night

               dawn pulls back the covers and slides into bed fully 
               dressed she is asleep as her head hits the pillow a 
               distant siren startsupwarning of an airraid

               grace is instantly alert as the sirens call to one another 
               coming closer she throws on her dressinggown pulls on 
               her furlined boots picks up the everpacked bag at her 
               bedside and hurries out of the door

               grace enters shakes dawn who does not respond grace pulls 
               back the covers and is surprised to see dawn fully dressed 
               wearing makeup and with slightly crooked seams down the 
               back of her legs

                                     grace
                         dawn what have you been up to

               dawn murmurs her protest grace pulls her out of bed but 
               dawn crawls back in

                                     dawn
                         im not going to that shelter  
                         id sooner die

               int rohan house  stairs  night

               bombs are already falling grace switches on a light and 
               hurries down the stairs leading her two children through 
               the familiar routine she calls back bill bumps down the 
               stairs on his bottom half asleep

                                     grace
                         dawn come down here

               she starts back up the stairs but is halted by a bomb 
               dropping close by she runs down again scoops up the two 
               little ones and heads from the living room

               int rohan house  living room  night

               as they approach the french windows another bomb explodes 
               very close by  before its sound is heard there is a 
               tremendous blast which rips off the blackout curtains and 
               sends them floating into the room the windows are torn 
               out and most of the fragmented glass hangs limply from the 
               brown paper that crisscrosses the panes for just this 
               eventuality

               every loose object is hurled inwards the room light 
               flickers on and off and shellbursts illuminate the room 
               from without grace and the children are thrown back against 
               the wall but before they hit it the process is reversed 
               and the blast is sucked out again they are pulled back 
               towards the windows together with the glass and loose 
               fragments of the room this all happens slowly as though 
               the room is filled with water and the windows were a 
               reversible sluice gate sues long blondehair is first 
               blown then sucked across her face then comes the sound 
               of the explosion itself which seems to have the effect od 
               draining water from the room the people and the brica 
               brac all drop to the floor dead weights once more

               the children clutch their ears screaming grace has one 
               or two cuts she gathers up the children spreading her 
               blood on them and frightens herself confused as to whom 
               the blood belongs she wipes it away crying out a desperate 
               prayer

                                     grace
                         please god take me but spare 
                         them

               she carries sue and drags bill through the shattered french 
               windows out into the garden and towards the anderson 
               shelter

               ext rohan house  garden  night

               two more bombs explode further way but still close enough 
               for the blast to force them off balance they stumble and 
               fall covering their ears against the pressure they tumble 
               into the shelter stepping into several inches of water  
               the ackack keeps up the barrage and the exploding shells 
               intermittently light up the sky grace mumbling dawns 
               name clambers out of the shelter to fetch her

               grace sees dawn coming down the garden she looks dazed as 
               she staggers quite slowly with one arm wound around her 
               head as she gets closer grace sees that her eyes are 
               glazed and she is moaning grace leads her into the shelter 
               and covers her with a blanket sue is fast asleep already 
               in spite of everything dawn looks at her mother accusingly

                                     dawn
                         you dont care if i die how could 
                         you leave me there even if you 
                         dont love me

               dawn desperately wants her mother to take her in her arms 
               but grace sits stiffly upright unyielding

                                     dawn
                         tell me the truth you had to get 
                         married didnt you because of 
                         me

                                     grace
                         the ideas you get in your head

                                     dawn
                         thats why you never liked me  
                         im different from you well 
                         everythings different now so it 
                         doesnt matter so there

               finally dawn bends forward and puts her head on her mothers 
               lap and cries at first softly the more bitterly  grace 
               holds her and rocks her at last bill watches this 
               perplexed as perhaps he always will be by the complex 
               emotional interplay that passes between women

               int rohan house  living room  day

               grace and dawn are cleaning up the debris some plaster 
               has fallen and there is a pall of dust they are singing 
               merrily glad to be alive to have survived the night

               outside the front window bill and sue can be seen having 
               ventured out eager to explore the damage done to rosehill 
               avenue

               ext rosehill avenue  day

               bill picks up shrapnel several houses have been damaged 
               one heavily so outside this house a handful of people 
               has gathered watching the arp men as they comb through the 
               smouldering ruins two of them are working a stirrup pump 
               as they extinguish a small fire in a corner of a room 
               some children come up to bill and sue they are flushed 
               and excited bursting with news one buy roger blurts it 
               out

                                     roger

                         no she didnt

                                     roger
                         yes she did didnt she

               he appeals to his companions particularly to a girl jane 
               a little older than the others

                                     jane
                         yes she did killed stone dead

                                     roger
                         you can ask her ask pauline

               he points over at the ruined house and sure enough there 
               is pauline a girl of twelve from time to time a silicosis 
               neighbour goes over to her offering help but pauline 
               shakes her head and looks away she justs stands there as 
               though her mother has told her to wait on that spot and 
               not to talk to any strangers until she got back  the 
               children drift across towards her and stop a few feet away 
               they stare intently studying her face

                                     roger
                         isnt that right youre mum got 
                         killed last night

               pauline nods affirmatively a boy throws a miniature 
               parachute into the air it opens up and drops neatly at 
               paulines feet

                                     roger
                         there you are i told you

               he jabs bill in the ribs finding a physical vent for his 
               excitement bill lashes back at him with a violent anger 
               that scares and quells the other boy the group falls 
               silent

               pauline steals glances at them out of the corner of her 
               eye she is not a popular girl careful and selfconscious 
               and she cannot help enjoying this situation she flushes

                                     jane
                         do you feel rotten pauline

               pauline shakes her head the children move away from her 
               and start to fool around scrapping and laughing but when 
               they get back within a certain distance of pauline they 
               grow quiet and move away again bill nudges sue

                                     bill
                         go and ask her if she wants to 
                         play

                                     sue
                         ask her yourself

                                     bill
                         you do it youre a girl

               sue edges slowly towards her not without nervous glances 
               back at her brother

                                     sue
                         pauline

               pauline does not deign to answer the little girl

                                     sue
                         pauline do you want some shrapnel

               she has fragments in her hand she offers then to pauline  
               it is possibly part of the bomb that killed her mother  
               pauline shakes her head

                                     sue
                         do you want to play

               pauline shakes her head again sue goes back to bill who 
               has been watching carefully at a distance after a moment 
               they turn back and walk home roger sees another newcomer

               the gang loot and pillage smashing as they go behind a 
               piece of broken wall bill discovers a soldier and a girl 
               clasped together the girl is pressed against a door bill 
               moves closer the soldier fumbles with her clothing but 
               she is so wild with passion that his efforts are impeded 
               bill registers the familiar gasps and cries that he is 
               becoming accustomed to hearing from the injured the dying 
               and the coupling the girl moves her head and her face 
               becomes visible over the soldiers shoulder it is dawn 
               she sees bill as he sees her she mouths the words go 
               away he turns to shake and cry he moves away then on 
               an angry impulse picks up a stone and throws it the soldier 
               lets out a cry he turns revealing himself as bruce

                                     bill
                              shouting

               hearing the sacred cry the gang come running they see 
               bill hurling stones and quickly join in bruce protests 
               angrily and throws a couple of rocks himself but he is 
               overwhelmed  he protects dawn from the onslaught and they 
               flee

                                     roger

               comic the dandy dawn is darning stockings the doorbell 
               sounds and dawn catapults from her chair to greet the 
               visitor she returns with bruce now evidently a welcome 
               and regular guest

               bill throws friendly punches one wild one catches him in 
               the crotch he takes it bravely he distributes largesse 
               a tin of corned beef and a packet of tea for grace chewing 
               gum for sue a model barrage balloon for bill and a pair 
               of nylons for dawn

                                     bruce
                         you need suspenders for this kind

               she laughs then holds the stockings against her skin in a 
               transport of sexual delight

                                     dawn
                         im going to cross my legs and 
                         make that rustling noise

               finally and dramatically bruce pulls out a package in a 
               brownpaper bag he gives it to grace she opens it it is 
               a piece of beef steak grace is overcome

                                     grace

                         i saw sirloin

               grace holds the raw meat in her two hands and impulsively 
               kisses it

                                     bruce
                         take it away i know your husbands

               he holds up his hands in supplication

                         sorry sorry too long in the 
                         barrack room

               itma has just ended and a programme has started up about 
               the evacuation of dunkirk its tone is quasireligious  
               patriotic as it tells of the armada of little boats 
               heroically snatching the remnants of the british army out 
               of the jaws of the nazis churchills voice booms out of 
               the wireless

                                     churchill vo
                         if the british empire lasts for a 
                         thousand years men will say this 
                         was their finest hour

               bruce has been horsing around with bill and all the time 
               dawn devours him with her eyes

                                     grace
                         oh do lets listen to this i 
                         never tire of listening to it i 
                         gives me goose pimples

                                     bruce
                         you havent been taking your orange 
                         juice

               the insolent sally gives dawn the excuse to jump on him 
               and force him on to the sofa and into a respectful silence  
               stirring music punctuates the dramatic narration which 
               celebrates the bravery of the soldiers fighting their last 
               ditch stand bruce giggles

                                     bruce

                         got to the beach and we couldnt 
                         run no more and jerry just sat 
                         there and let us alone if hed 
                         come after us boy shakes his head 
                         and laughs as though it would have 
                         been the funniest moment of the 
                         war

               we were beat so bad discipline was all to hell we told 
               the soldiers to jump in the briny there was no grub but 
               we broke into the wine stores and everybody got smashed 
               when the boats came a lot of guys threw away their gear 
               and filled their kitbags with loot one buddy of mine burst 
               into a jewelers his backpack was full of gold and silver 
               we had to wade out to the boats and he was so heavy he 
               couldnt haul himself up he slipped and sank like a stone

               he laughs again the broadcast comes to its moving climax

                                     grace
                         how can you say such things cant

                         and they were still the armada of 
                         little boats brought their precious 
                         cargo into safe havens they lived 
                         to fight another day

                         to fight another day

               the inspiring patriotic music elgar wells up

                         i dont care what you say it filled 
                         our hearts that day the little 
                         people stood up for once against 
                         the tyrant stood up and said no

               bruce impressed despite himself dawn is quite affected 
               too by her mothers deep feeling

                                     grace

               looks into the faces of his family resolutely he takes 
               up a teaspoon picks up the can and begins to eat grimly 
               and steadily he ladles the jam to his mouth they watch 
               him carefully for signs of pain before their doubts are 
               dispelled he has consumed a third of the can bill is the

               and stuff bread and jam in their mouths

               they pause looking out of a shattered window on the street  
               it is a monotonous row of semidetached houses lying 
               between other identical rows now pocked with bomb damage 
               drab and dreary

               a crater on a dangling electric cable and scrambles into 
               the road there is panic and pandemonium the local barrage 
               balloons fins have punctured and it has lost stability  
               it is careering wildly like a kite out of control clive 
               and mac clamber into the street as the balloon skims across 
               the sky its steel cable shearing a chimney stack which 
               tumbles down onto the front garden sending people scattering 
               in all directions bill runs up  mad with excitement as 
               sue and dawn come out of the house with grace and molly 
               and look up  clive sprints across to them

               she giggles the balloon bumps on the rooftop then shoots 
               up into the sky again grace starts to laugh

               clive earnestly dashes back and forth wanting to do

                         other boring old barrage balloons 
                         and decided it was time to have 
                         some fun

               two arp men run down the street urging people to go inside  
               the family retreat grudgingly towards their house but 
               hover in the front garden watching and laughing six home 
               guards march into rosehill avenue at the double the balloon 
               has risen into the sky and the people are drawn out again 
               into the street looking up the home guards come to a 
               halt and raise their rifles

                                     bill
                         boo leave it alone

               the balloon suddenly plunges down towards the street 
               scattering the home guards women scream and everyone dashes 
               for cover again bill laughs derisively

               stirring he slips out of his grandfathers voluminous 
               pajama pants  delicately he lowers himself into the river 
               careful not to crack the perfect smoothness of the water 
               he slides slowly in until only his head is showing he 
               swims out into the centre of the stream without disturbing 
               the water he stops takes a breath then submerges leaving 
               not a ripple never a trace the dawn river is once more

               raises the shotgun aiming along the length of the table 
               the children are statues only their eyes darting from him 
               to the rat and back the barrel is inches from their faces

               next to bills skin dawns first impulse is to make a 
               sarcastic comment but in her new maturity she bites it 
               back and smiles

               and a suitcase on his lap grandfather george adjusts the 
               advanceretard lever and glares at the sullen boy

                                     grandfather george

               bank  extras dressed as soldiers  germans british 
               american  lounge smoke and drink tea

                                     grandfather george
                         strapping fellows playing silly 
                         buggers with a war on outrageous

               bill cranes back watching as long as he can

               ext school  day

               the car draws up outside the school entrance a grim wall 
               surrounds the institution and bill gets out head hung 
               low and walks towards the gate as though to the gallows  
               grandfather george watches from the car he grips the 
               steering wheel angrily a teacher strides past grandfather 
               george shouts after him out of the window

                                     grandfather george
                         all you do is knock the sense out 
                         of them and fill them up with muck

               ext schoolyard  day

               as bill enters he is astonished to see hundreds of children 
               in a state of delirious celebration boys fling their caps 
               in the air they cheer they whoop they run amok behind 
               them lie the smouldering ruins of the school bill cheers 
               louder than anyone he remembers his grandfather turns on 
               his heel and runs back to the road

               ext school  day

               grandfather george is awkwardly turning the car in the 
               road  he drives off bill runs flat out and comes up to 
               the window shouting

                                     bill
                         grandpa theres no school its 
                         been hit by a bomb

               grandfather george slows up

                                     grandfather george
                         i have to hand it to you bill 
                         you come up with some good ones  
                         go back and take your medicine

               he drives off leaving bill stranded a fire engine and arp 
               vehicles race up to the school they pass grandfather george 
               and doubt shows in is face he stops gets out boys are 
               spilling out of school cheering bill runs up to him

                                     bill
                         its true

                                     grandfather george

                         youre making it up

               they get into the car

                                     bill
                         grandpa if you think of something

                                     grandfather george
                         apparently so

               a barking laugh wells up and escapes his throat it bursts 
               forth in great waves like a flood that has been dammed up 
               for years

               ext river  day

               grandfather georges laugh and bills too ring out over 
               the autumn river which beckons to bill with the promise of 
               stolen days

                                                               fade out
