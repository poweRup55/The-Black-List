ext kigali airport day

a burning white sun high in a clear blue sky

                                                           pan down to

a rundown sixties airport peeling in the heat

a mad traffic jam of cars vans motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint
where a rwandan policeman blows his whistle waves some and stops
others as bored rwandan soldiers look on

close on a white van pulls out of traffic a ballsout case of line
jumping horns obscenities

a hand extends from the passenger side of the van rwandan francs
pressed neatly between thumb and palm

the van stops next to the policeman

                        policeman
            mr rusesabagina good morning

in the passenger seat paul rusesabagina late 30s flashes a smile he
is dressed in a sharp blue suit always dressed in a neat suit and tie
it is a matter of pride

a quick shake of hands money passes from one to the other

ext kigali airport tarmac day

the van parked by the runway tarmac african music plays on the radio

paul drums his fingers checks his watch

zozo porterdriver early thirties sits nervously

an airport baggage handler approaches the van

                        handler
            sir the flight is delayed one more hour

                        zozo
                 suddenly worried

                        paul

                        zozo
            what is it like to fly on a plane sir

                        paul
            it depends where you sit zozo in coach
            it is like the bus to giterama

                        zozo
            that is why they call it coach

                        paul
            maybe but in business class there are
            fine wines linens belgian chocolates

                        zozo
                 impressed
            you have taken business class

                        paul
            many times

suddenly zozo slows

paul looks up sees a gathering on the side of the road  a large
crowd of men dressed in exotically yet identically colored shirts

theyre members of the interahamwe  the hutu militia

interahamwe  the hutu militia will de distinguished by these wildly
colored shirts they chant drink beer dance onto the road
obstructing cars threatening the occupants several of them perform a
rhythmic dance  the interahamwe war dance to thumping drumbeat music
from a boombox

                        paul contd
            turn off

zozo scared looks for a side road studies the traffic behind

                        zozo
            there is nowhere to turn sir

as the van approaches

                        paul
            slow down

the van pulls up beside the militia

                        paul contd
            boys do you know the way to mr

rutagundas warehouse

some militia approach they are suddenly friendly helpful

                        militia man 1
            it is one more mile on this road

paul reaches into his pocket takes out some rwandan dollars

                        paul
            this is thirsty work let me treat you to
            some beers

as the van pulls away zozo looks to paul relieved

int rutagandas warehouse day

at his desk in front of a fan george rutagunda late 30s huge gold
chains rolex watch like an african mafia boss but the same
interahamwe shirt he squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso

behind him through his office window the white van is being loaded
with cases of beer

george holds out his massive shirt

                        george
            you will join us at the rally today

paul sits opposite sipping coffee

                        paul
            i will try my best george but these days
            i have no time for rallies or politics

                        george
            politics is power paul and money

paul studies his watch

                        paul
            time is money george we need extra beer
            today

                        george

                        george
            i am always glad to see you paul

george leads paul out into the warehouse

as a forklift lifts a wooden crate george angers

                        george contd
            hell man that is not beer put it back
                        driver
            but sir the carlsberg is behind

                        george

                 to paul
            i wont charge extra

                        paul
            thank you

the driver of the forklift anxiously spins the machine to return the
crate but it slides off and crashes onto the floor machetes hundreds
of them spill out

an awkward moment then george picks one of the crude blades

                        george
            a bargain buy from china ten cents
            each ill get a dollar

            army

                        paul
            i couldnt help

                        tatiana
            you could have asked for a favor

                        paul
            no i could not what do you know about
            favors tatiana about barter and deals

all day long i work to please this
officer that diplomat this tourist to
store up favors so that if there is a
time when my family need help i have
powerful people i can call upon now you
would have me waste a precious favor on a
stranger

                        tatiana
            victor was not a stranger he was our
            neighbor

                        paul
            he was not family family is all that
            matters do you think if you or i were
            being dragged from here any one of them
            would lift a finger to help us

                        tatiana
            they do not have your connections

                        paul
            connections i have no connections only
            favors if i call to help victor a
            general will think paul rusesabagina is
            a fool he thinks my favors are so
            numerous and so insignificant as to waste
            them on everybody then my hard work is
            doubly squandered i insult the general
            and i do not get to use my favor at all
            please leave these things to my good
            judgment

            killed the president

                        colonel oliver
            no but i fear its intention may have
            been to kill the peace accords and spark
            a civil war between the hutu militia and
            the tutsi rebels

                        paul
            the american said intervention is too
            costly better to get photographic
            evidence and snatch up the high command

                        general bizimungu

            the americans who are they to put us on
            trial let us imagine paul when their
            president kennedy was shot they said it
            was a black man then their politicians
            their radio stations gave orders ‘we must
            wipe out these black people before they
            wipe out us’ what do you think would

gives the beer to the soldiers

                        paul
            i am worried about thieves and criminals
            coming into the hotel perhaps you could
            arrange for some police to guard us

                        general bizimungu
            the police are very busy

                        paul
            i understand general but when i last
            talked to the president of sabena he
            promised me that anyone who helped
            protect belgian property would be
            rewarded

bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition

                        general bizimungu
            he did

                        paul
            “well rewarded” those were his words

                        general bizimungu
            if i were to spare a few policemen where
            would i station them

                        paul
            the front gate would be best general

they could check all guests

                        general bizimungu
            i will see what i can do

                        paul
            i admire you general how do you keep
            command of your men amidst such madness

                        general bizimungu
            i am strong paul like a lion

                        paul
            i wish i were like you look at my staff
            they wont work they listen to no one

gregoire who is lying face down on the deck chair doesnt see him
approach the general pulls the deck chair from underneath gregoire and
throws it into the pool as gregoire tries to scramble to his feet the
general propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass

then gregoire hits the brakes

in front of them a makeshift barricade long poles stretched across
two oil drums

they wait for someone to appear from the fog no one

shredded and soaked in blood is draped like a banner

paul clambers to his feet sees that the van is on a road littered with
dead bodies men women children

the bumps were dead bodies the van has driven over them

a breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet

revealing a carpet of bodies hundreds of them sprawled all along the
road as far as paul can see paul wanders stunned among misshapen
corpses made more ghostly by wisps of fog

finally paul clambers shellshocked back into the van

                        paul

toward xavier and benedict who argue

                        xavier
            they should go one truck at a time when
            the first truck gets through to the
            airport then the others will follow

                        paul

colonel oliver gives the signal

the trucks take off down the driveway

int truck travelling day

paul now at the front of the truck

watches out through a slice in the canvas

sees the convoy pull out of the mille collines

they travel along the road

turn a corner and the truck slows 

paul sees a great mass of hutus fill the road

militia kids soldiers discarding uniforms

no longer a mob but a crush of hutu refugees now fleeing toward them
fleeing the advancing of the rebel army

a crowd of militia men wave their arms shout at the trucks

                        colonel oliver
            dont stop push through

the driver reluctantly speeds up

a break in the mass of hutu refugees

then gun fire ahead

children begin crying it becomes infectious spreading to pauls
children some of the women

then ahead a gang of militia men break from the bushes beside the
road

theyre running fast toward the truck some carry rifles

theres more gunfire behind

the militia are almost upon them now

colonel oliver has his pistol drawn

                        colonel oliver contd
            keep going

the militia are at the truck

but they run straight past

as a platoon of tutsi rebel soldiers in bush camouflage and red and
blue headbands burst from the brush

pursuing careful professional

                        paul
            its the rebels

the crying stops silent disbelief

                        paul contd
            weve made it

cheering breaks out children frightened again by the sudden euphoria
break into cries of joy

a rebel soldier waves his ak 47 in the air
