                         people would mutilate themselves in 
                         order to work in a freak show it 
                         mostly talks about tattooed people 
                         and wild men of borneo and shit like 
                         that but there is one mention of a 
                         single case where a woman was 
                         suspected of having her arms removed 
                         on purpose to become an armless 
                         wonder

                                     denise
                         yeah so how does that fit with the 
                         story of four morons with a flat 
                         tire looking for a dead tree

                                     jerry
                         it says records show that ellie 
                         thompson was born in 1914 of normal 
                         physical stature and lived a life of 
                         normal bearings until such time 
                         that she was placed in the care of 
                         the willows state mental facility

                                     denise
                         so

                                     jerry
                         now she was put in the nuthouse in 
                         1930 at the age of 16

                         but she was released sometime in 
                         1937 only to reappear as ellie 
                         bogdan the armless wonder says 
                         she crisscrossed the united states 
                         constantly in carnivals and freak 
                         shows until her death in 1946

                                     denise

               ext farmhouse  night

               an old gothic farmhouse stands atop a hill at the end of a 
               long sloping dirt road scarecrows with pumpkin heads hang 
               crucified on crosses lining the drive everything is severely 
               overgrown

               bill and baby enter the gates of the farm they walk up the 
               main drive

               baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud 
               puddles then runs up onto the front porch of the old house

               the front of the house is covered with strange junk art 
               hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls

                                     baby
                         these are all my dolls i use to 
                         like to chop their heads off

               broken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird human 
               figures animal skins stretched over bone armatures form a 
               makeshift roof

               glowing down from the upper windows are grinning jacko
               lanterns

                                     baby
                         the doors locked ill gotta go

                         ok

               baby runs off around the side of the house

               bill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate 
               farm grounds the rain continues to hammer down

               from bills pov we see a silhouette of a lone figure walking 
               in the distance the shape of a large dog follows behind 
               him

               bill jumps startled by the sound of the heavy front door 
               opening

                                     bill
                         christ you scared the shit out of 
                         me

                         yeah come on

               baby grabs bill by the arm and pulls him into the house  
               the heavy iron door slams shut

               int car  same

               standing dead center in the road is the giant shape of a man 
               holding a heavy chain with a huge hook on the end

               the brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising 
               it with his truck

               a sign on the side of the truck reads firefly towing

                                                               dissolve to

                         burning about them

               she sets the tray and goes back in the kitchen

               boom the sound of the front door slamming shut is heard 
               followed by the pounding of heavy footsteps

               mothers and babys shouting is heard

                                     baby os

               clothes the walls of her room are covered with bw photos 
               of movie stars

                                     baby

               int house  dining room

               tiny enters and removes his coat

               everyone is speechless

               tiny is over seven feet tall and weighs three hundred pounds 
               he is wearing a black sweater with a big red skull stitched 
               into it a red knit ski mask covers his face black gloves 
               cover his hands

               tiny sits at the table looks down at his plate and says 
               nothing

               mother comes to fetch tiny she relays a message to him with 
               strange hand gestures

               tiny gets up and leaves the room

                                     mother
                         youll have to forgive tiny he cant 
                         hear so much

                                     denise

                         tiny was sleeping in the basement 
                         where the fire started i dont think

                         tiny was badly burnt his ears were 
                         destroyed and most of his skin

                              shrugs
                         tasted pretty good

               int farmhouse  grampas room  night

               in a cramped darkened room we see the huge shape of tiny 
               hovering over a bed containing the hunched fragile old body 
               of grampa

               grampa struggles to sit then slowly slides his legs over 
               the edge of the bed tiny helps him to stand

                                     grampa
                         god damn it i can do it i can do 
                         it myself ya big monkey i aint 
                         dead yet so dont you and your 
                         sister start counting out my money 
                         yet

               grampa steadies himself against tiny they slowly walk out 
               of the room

                                     grampa
                         god damn my dogs are barking

               as they move into the light of the hallway it is clear that 
               grampa is in his late 80s

               grampa quickly grows tired tiny picks him up in his arms 
               and carries him down the stairs to the dining room

               as they move past the camera comes to rest on a strange 
               object sitting on a shelf

               a large glass jar containing a deformed baby the pickled 
               punk looks to have a small second head growing from its 
               temple the label on the jar reads stuffy 1973

               the sound from the tv fades up in the background

               bela lugosis voice can be heard

                                     bela lugosi vo
                         your hands please your left hand

                                                               dissolve to

               tv screen

               bela is seen as a fortune teller holding a womans hands 
               this is a scene from the wolfman

                                     bela lugosi
                         and your right hand shows your 
                         future

               close up

               we see a tight shot of the womans palm a pentagram appears

               int denises fathers house  night

               we pull back from the tv to find donald willis sitting in a 
               old easy chair the room is modest but comfortable

               he reaches over and picks up a small alarm clock notices 
               the time concerned look comes over his face

               the phone rings he quickly answers it

               laying in the trunk her arms and legs are hog tied she is 
               dead the word trick is carved into her side

               int farmhouse basement  tinys room  late afternoon

               water drips down from the leaking pipes above scavenging 
               rats scurry across the concrete floor

               in a far corner a single light burns a childs humpty dumpty 
               lamp illuminating 

               denise is strapped to an old wooden bed she has been stripped 
               of her own clothes and is now wearing a blue checked little 
               girls dress her hair is tied in pigtails

               she is cold and shivering

               boom the basement door opens heavy footsteps lumber down 
               the creaking stairs it is tiny

               tiny is wearing an orange tshirt that reads this is my 
               halloween costume for the first time we see the skin on 
               his arms it is severely deformed from burn scars

               he is holding a small tray on the tray is a box of cereal 
               milk a bowl and a spoon

               tiny goes over to denise sets down the tray and proudly 
               displays his tshirt

                                     denise
                              hoarse and dry
                         please tiny please let me go 
                         help me

               tiny sits down on a stool next to the bed he stares down at 
               denise like a confused dog

                                     denise

                         please god please

               tiny begins preparing her food carefully pouring the cereal 
               and milk into the bowl he stirs it with the spoon

               tiny gently lifts denises head and feeds her like a baby 
               denise swallows the food trying not to choke after a few 
               spoonfuls tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of 
               the room

               he pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light in 
               the light we see a rusty cage inside are three railthin 
               female bodies

               tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage

               one of the bodies moves to eat the scraps the others do 
               not they are dead

               tiny turns off the overhead light

                              lightning crashes
                         the house of frankenstein

               the movie begins and we move off the tv to see

               hundreds of candles are lit illuminating everything with a 
               flickering light music blares from a cheap stereo black 
               and orange paper streamers are draped from ceiling to floor

               dead center is a large object standing seven feet tall it 
               is completely covered in paper halloween decorations a long 
               chain connects the object up into the rafters

               this is the halloween party from hell

               an intoxicated grampa dressed as flash gordon sits in his 
               wheelchair watching the tv drinking moonshine from an 
               unmarked bottle

                                     grampa

               banging on a large oil drum he is dressed like a low budget 
               batman in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape

               a drunk rufus wearing a bloody police uniform stands on a 
               table shouting along to the music through a police megaphone

               mother and baby both dressed as superheroes dance around 
               the covered object both are swigging moonshine from jugs

                                     rufus jr

               mother and baby start tearing away the paper covering from 
               the object in the middle of the room they rip at the paper 
               spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual

               as the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see 
               denise jerry and mary tied back to back hanging from the 
               chain each are dressed in a different animal costume denise 
               is a pig jerry is a donkey and mary is a rabbit they are 
               gagged

               mother and baby laugh at their helpless victims splashing 
               moonshine in their faces

                                     baby

               and around

                                     rufus jr

                         then we tried to remove the tusks 
                         but they were embedded in so firmly 
                         that we couldnt budge em

                                     mother

                         but thats entirely irrelephant

               the room goes silent all eyes are focused on the stairs

               a robed figure otis appears at the top of the stairs he 
               begins to descend

               rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs as otis reaches the 
               last step rufus hands him the megaphone

               denise mary and jerry struggle to watch as they in turn 
               rotate past the scene unfolding

                                     otis
                              through the megaphone

                         candy now tell me

                              his arms
                         whos your daddy

               otis walks closer to the rotating captives

                                     otis

               otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly 
               before denise

               he drops his robe underneath he is wearing a suit of skin 
               sewn together from pieces of denises father

               denise stares in horror tears stream down her cheeks barely 
               able to comprehend the madness around her

               otis moves in close and licks her across the face

                                     otis

                              the face

                         for

               ext field  night

               the rain pounds down a heavy fog hovers over the dense growth 
               of the field in the distance silhouetted by moonlight a 
               gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night

               otis lantern in hand leads the way followed by baby and 
               mother together under a large black umbrella next rufus 
               holds the leash connected to jerry denise and mary

               bringing up the rear tiny shotgun focused on the prisoners 
               and grampa grampa is strapped to tinys back like a child 
               he waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam

               the group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure

                                     otis
                              handing baby the 
                              lantern
                         hold this point it over here

               baby directs the light at otis we see that he is trying to 
               unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in 
               the base of the wooden structure

               otis unlocks the door and swings it open he reaches down 
               into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench 
               attached to the hook is a chain

               otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit 
               to reveal a rusty metal crank he begins to turn the crank 
               slowly from out of the pit rises a coffin hanging from the 
               end of the chain

               otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground 
               he flips open the lid

                                     otis

               baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field 
               after mary

               mary trips and falls over a small gravestone she gets up 
               and stumbles back into a wooden cross she tears the gag 
               from her mouth and gasps for air

                                     baby os
                         there once was a woman who lived 
                         with her daughter in a cabbage garden

               mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden 
               crosses she is in a homemade cemetery

                                     baby os

                         all the cabbages the woman said

               mary turns 360 degrees but finds nothing

               on top of her and sits on her back baby is holding a large 
               hunting knife

                         shoo shoo said the maiden

               mary screams in pain as baby plunges the knife into her 
               baby stabs mary again and again and again mary lets out a 
               long gurgling scream then goes silent

               baby covered in blood licks the knife clean

               ext pit  night

               otis shoves denise into the coffin with jerry and locks the 
               lid shut through a crossshaped opening in the coffin we 
               see them crushed together

               rufus lowers the coffin into the pit once the coffin is 
               inside otis slams the door shut

               otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern 
               and a small tape recorder playing music

               int pit  night

               enter hell the dim light of the lantern shines off the slimy 
               wet filth of the rotted wood walls the stench of death and 
               decay hangs heavy in the thin air

               denise and jerry cold and shivering hang half submerged in 
               thick maggot infested sludge bits of animal and human 
               skeletons float in the muck broken bones lay in piles along 
               the walls

               int coffin  night

               through the dim light we see the tightly packed forms of 
               jerry and denise

                                     denise

               another smashes through the top of the lid the coffin begins 
               to violently shake denise screams

               another reaches through grabbing her feet smash the coffin 
               is ripped apart and jerry is pulled away from the destruction

               he lets out a quick scream before disappearing into the 
               darkness

                                     denise

               face of grampa beside him mother sleeps peacefully

               ext barn  night

               the rain has stopped tiny opens the doors to the barn

               huge wooden stake he sets the stake down carefully and closes 
               the barn doors he then picks up the stake and drags it away

               ext backyard  night

               behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle an intricate 
               system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the 
               many automobiles beneath

               rufus moves through the jungle he stops and begins to remove 
               the netting from a car it is wydells police cruiser he 
               climbs inside the car puts on wydells policemans hat and 
               starts the engine he drives off

               int police car  night

               rufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland he 
               turns on the overhead flashing lights

               ext fields  night

               the police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields

               int pit  night

               denise stands knee deep in the sludge broken bits of the 
               coffins remains are scattered around her

                                     denise
                         jerry please answer me

               a soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of 
               the pit

                                     denise
                         jerry
                              moving slowly forward
                         is that you

               denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of 
               the tunnel as she approaches the moaning sound gets louder 
               she turns the corner to see

               two pale figures in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a 
               shadowy object denise gasps they turn towards denise 
               revealing the partially devoured dead body of jerry

               the two bonewhite ghouls are dripping with jerrys blood 
               they stare at denise then return to their prey

               denise screams in horror and runs turning down another twist 
               in the underground maze she turns the corner and runs 
               straight into several slow moving ghouls the ghouls are of 
               the same deathly white complexion hairless with flaked 
               cracking skin their yellow eyes shine in the darkness

               they reach for her but she breaks free and continues to run 
               into the endless stretch of tunnels before her

               ext graveyard  night

               primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece 
               of land approximately twenty feet in diameter

               laying flat in the center is the large stake marys body is 
               draped across it tiny is securing her to the stake with 
               rope

               int police car  night

               through the windshield we see baby jumping and dancing in 
               the fields with several large dogs she is firing a gun as 
               she dances

               ext field  night

               baby sees the car and raises her gun she aims it at the car 
               driver she waits as the car gets closer she sees the face 
               of rufus behind the wheel she lowers the gun and begins to 
               laugh

               the car stops and baby climbs into the passengers seat the 
               car drives off

               ext graveyard  night

               tiny lifts the stake with mary firmly strapped in place he 
               implants it into the ground her body hangs like a doll 
               tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the 
               stake

               ext field  night

               otis face painted like a skull and wearing a priests robe 
               walks solemnly through the tall grass

               int pit  night

               denise waist high in sludge wanders lost through the endless 
               tunnels of the pit in the distance she hears high pitched 
               animal sounds

               a ghoul rises up from the sludge behind denise it stands

               a beaten denise struggles down a long tunnel she gets to 
               the end to find that it is a deadend behind her five ghouls 
               move silently towards her blocking her only exit

               frantically looks for an escape nailed into the wall next 
               to her are planks of wood forming a ladder

               the ghouls are only a few yards away denise climbs up the 
               ladder they move in clawing at her legs and feet trying 
               to pull her down denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling 
               above her trying to break free

               torn from her legs she digs wildly at the ceiling suddenly 
               a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal

               her fists at the rotted wood planks pulling free another 
               piece

               with all her might denise grabs hold and pulls herself up 
               through the opening

               denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body 
               up into the night air the cool air rushes to her lungs she 
               crawls free of the hole gasping for air

               she is safe suddenly smash a ghoul has broken through 
               the surface he grabs denise by the leg and begins to pull 
               her back into the hole

               denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul 
               she breaks and crawls from the ghouls reach
