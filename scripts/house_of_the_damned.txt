ext road  day

an old foreign car on its last legs winds its way down a sunny road deep in the irish countryside 

roll credits 

ext car  day

two older char women are in the car searching apprehensively for their destination  

ext road  day

the car turns down a forbidding road  we follow the car as it makes its way down the winding
wooded path  

ext glen abbey manor  day

the victorian manor looms on the horizon in the hazy afternoon light  

the car approaches and stops in front of the house  

end credits

the two women get out surveying the dark building  the first char woman opens the trunk
removing a carrying tray of cleaning supplies  

				1st char woman
		welcome to siberia

the second char woman takes some mops out of the back 
seat  
				2nd char woman
		this is the last time i travel 
		so far for a job  we wont get
		back till nightfall

				1st char woman
		well the pay is worth it

the two approach the front door as the first char woman takes a key out of an envelope 

				1st char woman
		not a bad place to live  i
		wonder how much it cost



				2nd char woman
		if you have to ask you probably 
		cant afford it

the first char woman looks at the second then unlocks the front door  

int manor downstairs hallway  day

the two women enter with their supplies  the house is furnished with dusty antiques  

				1st char woman
		looks like we have our work cut 
		out for us

the second char woman heads toward the living room  

int living room  day

the second char woman enters and looks around  suddenly she is startled by something that catches
her eye 

pov the furniture is in disarray chairs and tables on end all in the center of the room  a
circle of books standing upright surrounds the furniture 

the first char woman approaches sees the same thing  

the women approach the furniture  

				2nd char woman
		whats all this

the first char woman shakes her head and heads out   

the second char woman begins to pick up the books 

				1st char woman
		ill start the upstairs

the first char woman exits as the second one picks a chair up out of the pile  




int master bedroom  day

the first char woman enters the bedroom and looks around clearly impressed by the room and its
furnishings  she puts her cleaning supplies on the ground and goes over to the window  

she looks out the window for a beat then opens the window to let in some fresh air  a breeze
blows in  the woman takes in the country scenery outside  

suddenly there is the faint sound of scratching  the char woman listens for a beat then turns
around and gasps  

a large black rat faces her staring up at her with black beady eyes  

the char womans expression turns from shock to concern  

				1st char woman
		oh lord

repulsed by the rodent she stomps her foot in hopes it will scare it away  the rat backs off  

int upstairs hallway  day

the char woman watches as the rat scurries away  

int living room  day

the second char woman continues to straighten up the living room setting a chair in place in the
corner  

she notices a small oval painting on the wall a portrait of a woman from the 1860s  the painting
stares back at her  

the char woman then finishes putting the remaining furniture in the center of the room away 

int master bedroom  day

the char woman sprays window cleaner on the windows  

she wipes the window with a paper towel apparently preoccupied until she suddenly stops wiping
the window  

sensing somethings presence she slowly turns around and looks  

the rat has returned and continues to look up at her  

the char woman stares back at it with dread 

the woman looks around for a blunt object settling on a poker next to the fireplace  


the woman approaches with the poker  the rat does not 
budge  

hoping to avoid the unpleasant task the woman stomps her foot  nothing happens  she stomps
harder  

int living room  day

the second char woman moves some books and listens to the banging upstairs wondering what all the
commotion is  

int master bedroom  day

the char woman continues to stare at the rat  she stomps her foot  the rat does not move  

the woman raises the poker to strike the rodent   it stares back at her  suddenly it runs toward
the woman  

the woman screams and jolts backward hitting an end table and falling to the ground  

she kicks her legs furiously to avoid the rat when suddenly 

dozens of rats emerge from all parts of the room and attack the char woman  she lets out a blood
curdling scream  

int living room  day

the second char woman spins around to hear the horrible screaming and runs toward the stairs  

int master bedroom  day

the char woman is covered by squealing rats as she furiously tries to fight them off all the time
screaming at the top of her lungs  

int upstairs hallway  day

the second char woman runs down the hall with a panicked expression on her face  she approaches
the master bedroom  

int master bedroom  day

the char woman continues to fight off the rats  they are everywhere tails and clawed feet and
black eyes and teeth that rip into her skin 

soon the second char woman appears at the door and freezes in her tracks for a beat before running
into the room  

she runs to embrace the first char woman curled up in a ball in the corner  there are no rats on
the 1st char woman but she hallucinates that there are   

the second char womans presence only agitates the first char woman who fights her off
frantically  

				2nd char woman
		kathleen  for gods sake 
		whats wrong

the first char woman springs to her feet still screaming  
the second char woman embraces her  

				2nd char woman
		its all right its all right 

the first char woman struggles to come to her senses and then begins to cry uncontrollably  


				2nd char woman
		youre ok everythings okwhat 
		happened

				1st char woman
		there were rats
			crying

				2nd char woman
		rats  there are no ratsshhhh

the first char woman looks around the room  

				1st char woman
		rats everywhere

the first char woman inspects her ankle which appears unharmed  

				2nd char woman
		see  everythings okthere arent
		any rats

the first char woman looks around the room fighting to collect herself  

				1st char woman
		my godi need some air


				2nd char woman
		ok okjesus you nearly gave me 
		a  

the first char woman then bolts out of the room  the second char woman watches her  

				2nd char woman
		kathleen  wait

int upstairs hallway  day

the first char woman runs down the hall  

the second char woman comes out and watches her with a look of genuine concern on her face  

int foyer  day

the first char woman yanks the door open and runs outside  

int master bedroom  day

the second char woman looks around the room for a beat then heads out into the hallway  

int foyerstaircase  day

the second char woman heads down the stairs notices the door is open and starts to head in that
direction  something then catches her attention that freezes her in her tracks  she looks on in
horror  

int living room  day

the furnishings have been rearranged to their original state of disarray  

paralyzed with fear the char woman takes a few steps back  

soon there is sound of a detergent bottle rattling on the ground  

the char woman turns and sees it  

the bottle suddenly rattles across the floor as if kicked gently by an invisible man  the woman
gasps the bottle continues to be kicked around gently at first then the top pops off  

the char woman stands frozen as the bottle sits dormant as some of the contents glug glug glugs
out on the floor  

suddenly the bottle is kicked violently  the woman cringes as she is spattered with cleanser  

the bottle slams around and finally rises and  
smasshhh slams against the wall within inches of the womans head  

the woman frantically runs out the front door  leaves blow in from the outside  

the women jump into the car and hastily start it   as they do a strong gust of wind slams the
door shut  we hear the car peel away

seamus looks at all of them with a grave expression  

				seamus
		i said nothing before for fear you
		wouldnt believe me
			beat
		ive been here before to cast evil
		from this house  the amulet is
		a guard against evil blessed in
		countless rituals   it is an

				will

		aubrey  where is she

				seamus
		we must return it if you want

close on a piece of paper  the onyx stone drops to the paper 

seamus proceeds to smash the onyx crushing it as maura hands him some pearl earrings   

will and amy watch as seamus then puts the pearls and onyx on a piece of paper and begins to smash
them up 

				amy
		where does this amulet come from

				seamus
		its origin is unknown  the symbol
		does correspond  to a dagger i
		acquired many years ago

seamus turns and looks at amy and will  

				seamus
		the dagger is used to free those
		possessed if stabbed directly
		into the heart according to 
		ancient beliefs  

				amy
		by killing them

				seamus
		by freeing them

				amy
		i dont understand

				seamus
		the knife destroys the evil
		and saves the soul of the
		possessed

shea watches seamus mix the ingredients  

				amy
		what do these ingredients mean

				seamus
			trancelike	
		pearl is the twilight the divinity
		onyx is the sickle death

seamus takes the amulet and nails it to the wall  

seamus then takes the crushed ingredients and pours them into the top of a large candle filled
with liquid wax

				seamus
		as i said only fragments of ritual
		exist  of what i know this is the
		procedure  it seems to have suppressed
		the forces of evil if not removed
		them altogether 

seamus then looks at amy and maura  

				seamus
		im going to need some blood  it
		must be from a woman

				maura
		why

				seamus
		the blood of a woman is birth life
		it is part of the ceremony
seamus offers up the pin  maura waits a beat then takes 
it  

				will
		how long will it take

				seamus
		it will not take long

maura takes the pin and pricks her finger  she winces as the blood rises 

maura heads over to the candle  lets the blood drip out into the wax  

just then wham  the front door flies open and a strong wind blows the candles out immersing the
group in darkness  

will lights the candle again   

seamus then approaches the amulet on the wall and pours the dripping contents over the amulet  

the house is rattled by loud thumping and screams  seamus puts the candle down and addresses will
and maura  

				seamus
