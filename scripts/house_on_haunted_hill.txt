     fade in

     black screen

     and in the darkness a ticking sound is heard soft and
     steady  soothing  and then a bang

                                                       smash up on

     int hospital  basement nurses station  night

     a hand punching a card into the huge ticking time clock on
     the wall 700 am

     pull back to reveal  a blearyeyed male nurse beginning
     his day alone inside a small wood and glass cubicle he
     rips off yesterdays dayatatime calendar page revealing
     todays date october 11 1931

     goes to the victrola inside the cubicle cranks the turntable
     up to speed puts the huge needle down on a spinning 78 we
     hear the song crackling through the empty halls of the
     hospital  depressionera muzak horace heidt  his musical
     knights keep your sunny side up

     the nurse sharpens the last of a halfdozen pencils to needle
     points sits down at his desk and begins the tedium of
     jotting entries into a tall stack of patient records

     beat and then he hears a soft almost pawlike tapping on
     the glass he looks up a patient with a heavily bandaged
     head is standing there his eyes as dull and lifeless as
     marbles

     the nurse waves the patient away goes back to his work
     beat and then the tapping is heard again the nurse snaps
     his head up about to bark at the man  but the words stop
     dead on his tongue

     standing on the other side of the glass are now two dozen
     patients likewise bandaged staring silent and deadeyed at
     him

     unnerved the nurses finger slowly stretches towards a
     buzzerbutton just below the desktop it never makes it
     because 

     a hand  lashes into frame and grabs the nurses fingers the
     nurse looks up

     in addition to the mass of patients outside the cubicle
     there are now six of them inside it surrounding him the
     nurses eyes shoot to the stilllocked doors of the cubicle
     and he utters one confused word 

                           male nurse
                  how  

       and then someone rams all six of his needlesharp pencils
     eraserdeep into his throat

     the nurse gurgles and staggers  falls back against the
     victrola hitting the turntable crank as he goes down
     causing it to start spinning like a pinwheel

     keep your sunny side up now blares through the halls triple
     time sounding like a thousand manic chipmunks and to the
     beat of that tune the patients smash the control panel
     inside the cubicle until it shortsout and explodes which
     pops open

     int patient cells 

      and sends dozens more wild raving humans rampaging through
     the hospital while every electric light in the place strobes
     maniacally and orderlies  other nurses are chased down like
     rabbits by patients and beaten to pulp and

     int therapy rooms 

      filled with devices that look straight out of the spanish
     inquisition are trashed to toothpicks and some of the staff
     are forced into devices and tortured as patient records are
     spindled and ignited  flaming torches used to set
     everything in the place ablaze and a wolfpack of patients
     kamikaze down

     int corridor  continuous

       fling open a set of double doors marked cerebral
     hygiene shouting vannacutt and we see 

     int cerebral hygiene room  continuous

       two people in surgical scrubs the moustached doctor
     named vannacutt and a female nurse wielding a 16mm camera as
     the two whip around startled by the shouts we see the
     object of their ministrations a patient on a gurney being
     filmed as his internal organs are slowly and methodically
     extracted  while still alive

     and then all hell breaks loose as the wolf pack descends

     dr vannacutt manages to yank down a lever on the wall
     labeled lockdown before hes swallowed by the mob

     from somewhere in the house we hear heavy gear cables and
     doors loudly shutting down the house

     the nurse is clubbed to the floor with her own camera and
     amidst all the vengeful shouts and wails a curious thing
     happens

     as one of the patients picks up the nurses bloodspattered
     camera and puts it to his eye the image on screen abruptly

                                                      smashes to

     int cerebral hygiene room  continued  grainy black  white

       and dead silence  and we find ourselves watching old
     soundless 16mm footage of what happened next a blur of
     scalpels and saws as the patients viciously vivisect
     vannacutt and nurse whove been crammed together on that
     same gurney the bw camera pushes in tight on vannacutts
     screaming maw  and suddenly we hear sound again 

       but for some reason its not a human cry but the
     crowing of a rooster  and when we pull back out we see that
     what were now watching is the crowing rooster and four
     blazing camera lenses that was the logo of the old pathe
     newsreel the stentorian voice of pathe booms over

                some years later the gutted interior
                of the institute was refurbished as a
                private residence it has yet to be
                inhabited many say because the spirits
                of the vile vannacutt and his victims
                still walk the long corridors inside
                this place now known simply as the

     lipped 30something exec who only needs screaming bitch
     stamped on her forehead to complete the picture shes
     sitting staring at the cube the elegant paper it came in
     torn to shreds on her desk

                           jenzen
                so what the fuck is it

     shes addressing her assistant a lovely but harried
     looking young woman of 19 sara wolfe

                           sara
                i dont know ms jenzen

                           jenzen

                no return address

                           jenzen
                you didnt think to ask

                           sara
                i was in the middle of 

                           jenzen
                  being utterly fucking useless
                what else is new

     saras face flushes with anger but she keeps her cool

                           sara
                theres something there on the side 

     shes pointing to a small silver crank jutting out of one of
     the cubes sides a legend is etched beneath itrotate once to operatejenzen
                im aware of that

     well she is now anyway she twists the crank and a tinkling
     music boxlike tune begins to play lennon mccartneys
     birthday but in 34 time like some schizoid viennese
     waltz

                           jenzen
                its not my goddamn birth 

       and she stops herself in midword as suddenly the top
     of the cube pops open like a jackinthebox and slowly
     like its on some minihydraulic lift another cube
     identical to this one starts to inch up into view 

       which has its own tiny silver crank in its side but
     etched beneath this one is a warningdo notrotate underanycircumstanceswithout a nanoseconds hesitation jenzen reaches out her
     hand 

                           sara
                  i wouldnt 

       and turns the smaller crank beat nothing happens

                           jenzen
                  no kidding thats why youre
                making ten bucks an hour and im 

       and bang a skeletal arm comes flashing out from the
     smaller cube and slashes her finger with a razor

                           jenzen
                jesus

       its no more than a paper cut but its bleeding and it
     hurts  and then they both see written on the tiny razorlearn to follow instructionssara cant help herself  lets loose a little snort of
     laughter jenzen goes ballistic smashes the lid shut on the
     cube

                           jenzen
                you think this is fucking funny

                           sara
                no no its just 

                           jenzen

                           jenzen
                and heres your goddamn severance

     she slams the cube hard into saras hands

                                                            cut to

     int saras cubicle  just after we need to rework this
     scene for location

     the cube sits in a wastebasket next to the desk that saras
     angrily cleaning out shes slams her entire blotter into the
     trash  which hits the cubes crank and starts the music
     playing again sara startled looks over  and sees

     an ornate ivorycolored card  begin to ascend from the
     cube it starts with the wordsnowtryand follow theseand then all we see are saras wide growingwider eyes as
     she reads the rest

                           sara
                wowwow hey ms jenzen  

                           jenzen os
                are you still fuckinghere

     sara starts to flush with anger again  and then stops a
     small smile coming to her lips as she continues to stare at
     the card

                           sara
                on my way out thanks for the
                valuable parting gift

     she snatches the ivory card and stuffs it in her purse

                                                          smash to

     int hearse 1  moving  night

     where sara wolfe sits decked out in neardeadringers
     clothes and hairdo as we last saw on jennifer jenzen black
     silk suit stiletco heels and an upsweep  holding that
     same ivorycolored card in her handsteven k pricecommands you to attenda very unique birthday celebration formrs evelyn stockardpriceand then the camera whiplash cranes back from sara and the
     vehicle in which shes sitting to reveal the grand vista of

     ext winding road  night

     which snakes crazily up the pacific palisades the crashing
     waves of the ocean seen in the background we see that the
     vehicle sara is riding in is the lead car of a motorcade
     comprised of four 50s vintage hearses

                           mans voice os
                the mans insane

     and we whip back towards the source of this voice

     int hearse 2  moving  night

     where we see this mans welltanned hand holding the same
     ivory card which continuesterror humiliation perhaps even
                               murder
                      will be the entertainmentwomans voice os

                terrific whats the catch

     int hearse 4  moving  night

     where we see hands of a man barely out of his teens his
     muscular right hand holding that same card as wellinside the walls of
                     the house on haunted hillsuddenly the screech of brakes is heard  hearse 4 jolts to
     a halt the invitation flies from the young mans hand and to
     the floor the rest of its text unread

     ext the house  night

     we see the reason for the sudden stop of the cortege an
     ancient chrysler k car is parked clear across the road
     barring the entrance to the gate of a razorwire security
     fence that encircles the premises beat and then a short
     slight man steps out of the vehicle in the glare of the
     hearses headlights his features look cadaverous between
     that and the fact hes jittering like a hummingbird on speed
     he makes a pretty unsettling presence

     the man walks slowly towards the hearses beckoning the
     riders out

                           man pritchett
                this is the endby car anyway

     the welltanned man from hearse 2 steps out dr donald w
     blackburn  he could be anywhere from 19 to 90 the only
     thing thats clear is all the cosmetic surgery hes had makes
     him look like george hamilton circa 1962 he asks the
     obvious

                           blackburn

     the camcorder woman steps out of hearse 3 a jenny jones
     clone named melissa marr 27

                wheres steven price and his huge
                throbbing checkbook

                hell turn up any second now if

     looking specimen named eddie moses 23

                           eddie
                i wanna know first to what do i

                           sara
                but the million bucks each thats
                for real

                           pritchett
                     a forced chuckle
                it better be  he still owes me
                25 grand for renting the place
                for the night here lets get
                you some illumination so you
                can make your way safely

     he grabs a flashlight from his car and shoves it in saras
     hand

                           pritchett
                just point and walk sis  the
                place is right up 

       and as if on cue a battery of magnesium floods suddenly
     light up the night like high noon revealing the house in all
     its glory

                           pritchett
                     startled
                there

     sitting high atop a bluff over the pacific a sprawling
     greystone structure onethird eames to onethird wright
     to onethird bauhaus

     it might look innocuous in the daylight but right now it
     looks like albert speers playhouse and underscoring the
     creepy ambience is music now blaring from speakers perched
     atop the gate marilyn mansons screeching gothmetal cover
     of sweet dreams are made of these

                           blackburn
                nice touch pritchett subtle

                           eddie
                as a tumor

                           pritchett
                wish i could take the credit but 

                           sara

                now

                           pritchett
                he mustve beaten us all here

                           eddie
                less the place really is haunted

                           pritchett
                nonsense just bad press all the
                deaths that occurred inside 
                my own fathers included  all
                perfectly normal fatal accidents

                           melissa
                you better be wrong i didnt
                come all this way for normal

     she starts making her way up the disaster of a driveway dr
     blackburn and sara look at each other and shrug

     they start likewise walking towards the house the only one
     left is eddie he stares at the little man

                           eddie
                youre totally full of shit arent you

                           pritchett
                     brightly
                youll never know til you walk
                through that door

     eddie dismisses him with a flap of his hand and sprints to
     catch up with the others pritchett yells after him

                           pritchett
                you wouldnt consider getting my check
                and running it back down here

     no response beat pritchett gets out of his car

                           pritchett
                didnt think so asshole

     he starts jittering his way up the drive

     int grand foyer  soon after

     cold flinty two stories high and domed with a stained
     glass skylight topping it despite their varied states of
     confusion the four guests stop in their tracks as they
     enter struck dumb with awe

                           eddie
                jesus h christ

                           melissa
                so wheres the party

                           sara
                looks like were it

                more to the point wheres our host

                           melissa
                more to the point what in the
                name of fuck is that

     shes pointing up at the stained glass skylight it seems to
     depict a man with dozens of hideous creatures hovering round
     his head and above them all looms a huge something with
     wings and flaming claws

                           blackburn
                more of prices spookhouse bullshit

                           pritchett os
                not at all

     they turn to see pritchetts head poking through the doorway
      putting as little of himself as possible inside the house
     proper

                           pritchett
                part of the original structure when it
                was still an asylum guy who ran the
                place  dr vannacutt  found it
                inspirational from some german
                cathedral a million years ago driving
                the demons from the mind

                           blackburn

                the hint of still weirder shit
                to come i can only hope

     she whips the camcorder to her eye and starts recording every
     detail of the skylight dr blackburn rolls his eyes
     pritchett starts calling loudly

                           pritchett
                mr price mrs price somebody hello

                           blackburn

                mr price mrs price

     melissa marr continues to shoot up a storm of tape in the
     room as overexcited as a fiveyearold whos lost her

                where

     she whips her camera up at the stained glass zooms in tense
     beat and then lowers the camera sighing in disappointment

                           melissa
                birds just seagulls or something
                walking on the glass goddammit

     begins raining colored shards in the foyer

     all except evelyn whos staring up at the descending
     projectiles with a profound look of annoyance on her face

     eddie  notices that a huge demonheaded glass shard is

       tackling her to the floor the giant shard missing her
     skull by literally a hair it plunges six inches deep into
     the parquet thwangs like an arrow into a target

     beat of absolute sheer stunned silence and then

     leading to the basement price trots towards another door off

       a flurry of crackling sparks showers watson pritchett as
     he twists the 20s vintage knob light switch he leaps back
     with a frightened yelp

     we see a brief burst of light from the ancient sconces on the
     walls revealing a series of moldy cobwebbed and rubble
     strewn basement gallery and a series of five glass cases
     filled with the mummified remains of human bodies one very
     odd human figure rides upon a mummified horse

     int basement gallery

     an odd multiwalled gallery from which five corridors lead
     out extending like the spokes of a wagon wheel 

       and then every light down there shorts out with one loud
     sizzling pop total darkness beat

                           pritchetts voice
                yknow thisd actually be funny  if i

                           evelyn
                stalking the wild poltergeist

     int hallway  simultaneous

     video image a darkened hallway rife with grainy shadows
     the image cruises down the corridor peering into the
     twisting passageways that intersect our path as we drift
     like some flying dutchman

     int hallway  simultaneous

     and we see that weve been watching from the pov of melissa
     marrs camcorder shes gliding up and down the hallway
     eye glued to the viewfinder taking in every square inch of
     the place

     pov camcorder

     the bumps and pits in the carvedstone corridor walls are
     becoming more vivid

     another angle

     melissa seen taking a left into another hallway

     pov camcorder

     an odd shadow plays in the corner at the end of this new
     hallway the corridor appears to grow smaller more
     claustrophobic

     another angle

     melissa letting loose a halfuneasy halfexhilarated gulp
     she stops walking slowly lowers the camcorder scans the
     end of the hall with her naked eye

     other than having the creepy ambience as the rest of the
     house the hall appears normal again large and long without
     a trace of anything extraordinary she returns her eye to the
     viewfinder

     pov camcorder

     the shifting shadow she saw before disappears into an open
     door at the end of the hall

                           melissa os
                curiouser and curiouser were talking a
                fifty share minimum

       just then a murmur of many voices heard around her

     another angle

     melissa lowers the camcorder eyes darting everywhere
     scared  but she sees nothing camera back up to her eye
     she moves to the doorway as she turns the corner we see
     the pattern on the wall it is really a painting done in
     anamorphosis  it has now become a terrible gothic demon
     ready to strike

     pov camcorder

     we reach the vaultlike door and peer down the steps that
     disappear into a pool of darkness the voices heard again
     indistinct basso emanating from somewhere below we
     descend down the stairs

     int basement  corridor  continuous

     melissa comes to a stop at the bottom of the stairs her eyes
     go wide at the sight before her

     wild images painted by some longdead madman start on the
     floor sweep up across the wall and onto the ceiling

     she peers closer sees that theyre images of torture and
     death painted in blood melissa stares at them wideeyed
     she puts the camera back up to her eye

     pov camcorder

     the images come alive writhing in agony what passes for
     their mouths open wide in silent screams melissa is awe
     struck

                           melissa os
                fuck me bald

     she moves down the corridor to a room at the end a sign
     proclaims cerebral hygiene as she nears the voices grow
     louder and now mixed in with them are terrible moans

     int cerebral hygiene room 

     melissa enters 

     pov camcorder

     a strange room filled with odd devices is laid out before us
     clearly left over from another era quack electric machines
     and bizarre instruments line the walls

     in the middle of the room a small group of people in white
     stand huddling urgently around something their backs to us
     a man in white off to the side is filming whatever it is
     going on with a springwound 16mm camera

                           melissa os
                jesus

     and then the huddled group whips around revealing the
     objects of theiractivity

     two humans  crammed together on one gurney a woman in
     a savaged nurses uniform a man in what little is left of
     his surgical scrubs a name plate pinned right into his
     flesh vannacutt

     both screaming like banshees as theyre being vivisected

     it is the identical image we saw on the bw footage from 1931
     at the beginning of the movie

     another angle

     with a gasp melissa pulls the camera from her eye

     she looks at the room the equipment is all there but the
     room is completely empty of anything living

     she lets out a small sigh of relief and turns to leave 

       and suddenly in front of her is the patient that
     vannacutt and nurse had originally been dissecting hes
     jittering so fast hes a blur and then he lunges at her

     int main salon  simultaneous

     the screams of melissa marr echo wildly in the room  long
     agonized howls that just grow louder and louder everyone
     looks up in alarm  with the exception of evelyn whose sole
     focus is on pouring herself a new drink

                           evelyn
                could be old melissa found what she was
                looking for

     as the screams grow even more hideous price and guests dash
     out of the room pritchett downs the rest of his huge tumbler
     of scotch then proceeds very halfheartedly after them 
     and then the screams stop pritchett sits back down in his
     chair pours another drink

                           pritchett

     something above them a spot on the ceiling directly over
     the operating table where the bloody drag marks resume
     continuing all the way to the point where concrete ceiling
     meets equally solid wall and then vanish altogether

     the room goes silent  on the playback screen on the side of
     the camcorder an erratic wildly rolling image can be seen

     everyone present pritchett included starts gravitating
     towards sara and the desk she hits the stop button on the
     camcorder

     she punches play and we see on the

     camcorders playback

     soundless a vision of free flight  the lens capturing
     what it saw as it dropped to the ground a wild herky
     jerky assoverteakettle melange of 

     wallceilingmarys hair  and finally floor as the
     lens smacks tile fractures into a starburst of cracks
     topples onto its side and through this veil of jagged
     spidery lines we see

     marys hand drop into frame  lie still for a moment 
     and then start violently spasming as a bloodstorm starts
     spattering it from os until the color of her flesh can
     no longer be seen 

     a metal crunch is heard from inside the camcorder and the
     image on the screen goes to black

     int main salon  continuous

     no one moves  theyre all frozen there staring at the dead
     screen beat and then the sound of light applause is heard

     heads turn towards its source and we see

     hands slowly almost angrily clapping she doesnt speak

     a loud crackling electric surge  onagain offagain
     in direct sync with the dimming of the lights what makes

     an animate presence at waist level pale with something
     flowing from its sides almost winglike and its
     squirming undulating like a snake  and then softly
     this time that calflike cry highpitched almost female
     sounding

     price ducks under blackburns arm and starts walking slowly
     into the room towards it no one tries to stop him

     on price as he gets closer and can see that whatever it
     is its perched atop one of the tables

       and for a moment all anyone can do is watch as evelyn
     gets jolted and slammed again and again and again  and

     disappear from the eyes of his bucking jerking wife

     saturation chamber prices face appears in the small
     porthole

     sara twists the wheel that seals tight the castiron capsule
     shaped device asks blackburn

                           sara
                pretty old and rusted out  you sure
                this thingll hold him

     through the single small window on the side we can see a
     furious panicked price slam his full weight against the
     inside of the door it doesnt budge a millimeter

                           blackburn
                dont think itll be a problem

     through the chamber window we see price make another futile
     crash against the door

                or something  just in case

     blackburn pats the gun in his jacket pocket

                           blackburn
                im not worried

     sara nods takes eddies hand and disappears up the stairs

     blackburn and price stare at each other on opposite sides of
     the tiny window price is screeching something at him but we
     cant hear a word through all that iron

                           blackburn
                cant quite make that out  what

     price silently bellows

                           blackburn
                you want to see how this thing
                works weird request but okay

     blackburn leans over and starts twisting dials and flipping
     every switch he can find on the control panel of the capsule

     we see price look up in alarm a circle of pulsing lights is
     dappling down on him it looks almost quaint like a
     victorian carousel at night

                           blackburn
                youve got to let me know how it all
                turns out professional courtesy and all
                that

     and with price seen yelling and pounding through the window
     blackburn walks away and disappears into the dark of the
     basement he passes right by the huge sealed steel door
     where vannacutt stashed his corpses the tendrils of mold on
     the metal have expanded to the length of a mans arm

     int saturation chamber  continuous

     price is down on the floor of the capsule a look both of
     fear and an engineers curiosity on his face as he stares up
     at the circle of light that has begun to spin faster and
     faster 

       and then whatever anxiety he has abruptly drops from his
     face aside from a little eyestrain absolutely nothings
     happening to him he stands and examines the source of the
     light sees on the ceiling of the capsule its nothing more
     than a spinning mirror balllike apparatus flecked with
     colored glass hes unimpressed

     int basement corridor  continuous

     where we view price from outside the capsule through its
     tiny window we see him silently jerk spasm and scream  all
     while standing inside the utterly empty saturation chamber

     over we hear almost bestialsounding grunts

     int basement corridor  simultaneous

     sara and eddie move through the corridor  stopping at
     every junction theyre hopelessly lost

     several doorways eddie glances at the door theyre about
     to pass and stops

     int electroshock room  simultaneous

     dr blackburn opens the door to the room and walks grimly
     into it staring at evelyns dead body still strapped to the
     table

                           blackburn
                the late mrs steven price

     from his medicalbag he removes a scalpel

                           blackburn
                tragic tortured mrs steven price

     with a blur of quick slashes he cuts her limbs and torso
     free of their moldy restraints

                           blackburn
                lovely mrs steven price

     now accessible he parts the top of her nightgown runs a
     finger slowwwwly from the tip of her chin down to her bare
     breasts

                           blackburn
                creamy cooland now very
                cooperative mrs steven price

     his tongue darts from his lips and he begins planting long
     lingering kisses all over her neck 

       flash of a hypodermic being pulled from blackburns bag 

       blackburn kissing everywhere around her breasts 

       flash of the air bubbles in the needle being plunged out
     of the tip squirt 

       bubbles of blackburns saliva dampening her nipples his
     tongue swabbing concentric circles within her aureole 

       flash the needle into the crook of evelyns elbow 

       blackburns mouth dancing down to her belly  hes begun
     to hyperventilate with excitement  and

     a hand comes languidly into frame begins stroking his lush
     dyed locks 

                           voice os
                ive missed you

                           blackburn
                ive missed this

     and dr blackburn tosses the hypo away and hoists himself to
     meet the eager waiting mouth of the now very alive evelyn
     stockardprice  who starts to vigorously respond to
     blackburns touch he reluctantly pulls himself away

                           blackburn
                easy youve got to keep still for a
                bit the last thing we need is a
                coronary

                of time and then will come your
                miraculous resurrection

                  the james dean wannabe with the hair
                trigger

                complications for a very simple plan

                alive or dead

                  price killed her theres no
                other explanation 

                           evelyn
                  theres plenty for all we know
                stevens got her spying on us right
                now 

                           blackburn
                  bullshit 

                           evelyn
                  the whole thing is falling apart

     blackburn starts stroking her trying to calm her

                           blackburn
                its not baby just a matter of
                minutes now before somebody
                pulls the trigger 

                           evelyn
                  but nobody has yet donald they
                just havent been brought to that
                breaking point they have to believe
                proofpositive that their lives
                are in danger

                           blackburn
                how much more do they need than
                your death at his hands

                           evelyn
                but they didnt see it happen they
                still have doubts what we need is
                another body and stevens bloody
                hands right next to it

                           blackburn
                and how the hell are we going
                to do that

                           evelyn
                okay this may sound crazy but 

       and in one savage blur of motion evelyn drives
     blackburns scalpel right into his chest

     blackburn just stands there motionless looking at her
     confused she clears up any gray areas thrusting deep and
     yanking down gutting him like hes a trout

     int main salon  upstairs  continuous

     eddie trots into the room carrying the thick base of a
     wroughtiron floor lamp to sara

                           eddie
                this is the best were gonna do

                           sara
                itll have to do

     they start out of the room watson pritchett remains morosely
     sitting in his chair

                           sara
                you coming or are you waiting
                for blackburn

                           pritchett
                blackburns dead

                           sara
                excuse me

                           pritchett
                he would have been back by now

     beat eddie and sara look at each other nahhhh and then

                           sara
                hey dr blackburn

     nothing in response sara grabs pritchett and they head for
     the basement

     int basement  corridor  simultaneous

       the beautiful bloodcaked feet of evelyn stockardprice
     seen walking across the concrete

     her goresopped hand seen traveling upwards  we follow it 

       as it undoes the lock on the door of the now pitchdark 

     int saturation chamber room

     beat and then the inert body of steven price slumps out
     evelyn walks out of frame beat then a whimper is heard
     it seems to be coming from the throat of steven price

     int basement  corridors  simultaneous

     the lights have begun strobing again sara eddie and
     pritchett move quickly down corridor after corridor 

                           sara
                dr blackburn

       finally stumbling into

     int saturation chamber room  continuous

       where the circle of pulsing lights inside the chamber
     itself are as bold and blinding as looking into the sun
     lighting up the entire room they can barely make out a thing
      except

     a face  frozen in a scream thats pressed against the
     capsules window

                           eddie
                well at least price is still
                under wraps

     sara squints and then her eyes grow wide 

                           sara
                its blackburn

       the face in the window comes into focus

     dr donald w blackburn

     the trio moves to the chamber amidst the blinding lights
     shield their eyes and throw the door open  a body 
     comes tumbling out the door closing shut behind it

     the three of them are in shock blackburns face is still
     pressed against the window and then sara reopens the door

     and they see theres nothing attached to blackburns head
     its just propped in the small sill of the window and the
     body on the floor just happens to be missing same

     and then sara sets her teeth and pulls out her gun

     int basement  corridors  just after

     sara and eddie on a mission glocks in hand and ready
     stalking like cats through the maze of corridors

                           eddie
                price

                           sara
                hes gotta still be down here

     pritchett is less enthused

                           pritchett
                you know that crowbar that window
                maybe we should just call it a 

                           saraeddie
                  pritchett shut the fuck up

                           pritchett

                           sara
                price

                           pritchett

                           eddie
                pritchett  

     and then he sees that pritchetts staring slackjawed into
     the

     int morgue room

       the table where the body of evelyn stockardprice once
     lay is now empty and bloodsoaked

                           eddie
                price what the fuck did you do

     eddie turns enraged to sara shes nowhere to be seen

     int basement corridor  simultaneous

     sara is wending her way down a passage gun now lowered
     slightly for what shes in pursuit of is something that
     seems not only nonthreatening but familiar a soft high
     pitched voice that sounds in pain crying

                           voice os

                if you can stand if you can just
                raise your arm 

       and then from behind a tall pile of stone and mortar
     rubble rises a bloody and absolutely terrified

     steven price  so freakedout his voice is just a squeak

                           price

       and sara squeezes the trigger 

                           price
                  no 

       the first shot splits a brick right next to his ear 
     pieces flying everywhere 

       the next six are all right on torsotarget 45 caliber
     slugs that make a nice round black hole as they hit him 
     huge ragged explosions of blood and meat as they exit
     hideous bonnie and clyde died in their sleep in comparison
     pritchett and eddie enter on the run

                           eddie
                what the hell are you shooting 

       and then he sees the riddled price on the ground

                           eddie
                oh jesus

                           pritchett

     he takes the shaking wildeyed sara in his arms she doesnt
     weep just stands there spasming with shock

                its okay everythings okay now

                           sara

                           eddiesara
                you got yourself a deal

     they exit the room heading for the stairs not looking back
     at prices corpse for a second beat and then emerging from
     the shadows strolls evelyn who walks over to her husbands
     body talking to it

                           evelyn
                steven you poor absolutely clueless
                geek all it wouldve taken was a simple
                divorce  and ripping our prenup to
                little pieces

     she kneels down next to the bioody corpse whispers

                           evelyn
                but no matter how it ended please know
                just one thing from that first moment i
                set eyes on you ive always loved
                your money you personally  well
                frankly just the sight of you has always
                turned my stomach

     a hand suddenly lashes out and grabs her hard by the
     throat

                           voice
                is that a fact princess

     evelyns eyes widen in horror as she chokes out a gasp the
     hand belongs to steven price and he literally picks her up
     by her neck and brings her to her feet

                           price
                well you could have saved us all a
                great deal of time not to mention
                money if youd just let me in on it
                years ago

     with his free hand he rips off his shirt  and the blood
     squibbed kevlar vest underneath it

                           price
                this kind of special effects crap
                doesnt come cheap  and i had to pay
                out of pocket no writeoffs here

     he begins moving toward her she instinctively backs away
     slowly being cornered in an alcove

                           evelyn
                how 

     in the alcove is a door  a very familiar door  the sealed
     steel portal leading to vannacutts body dump the metal is
     so corroded its surface is misshapen with rust

                           price
                  you must be kidding youre talking
                to steven price  every place youve
                gone every person youve seen every
                word you and blackburn ever said to each
                other bugged taped seen and heard as
                it happened

     he squeezes tighter now with both hands she can barely
     breathe

                           evelyn
                steven 

                           price

                  witnesses to what youre already
                dead evelyn happy birthday baby 

       and before evelyn can even let out a gasp hes slams her
     up against a door

     her body smacks against the rusted metal with a rotted crack
     the solid door explodes inward in a shower of rust the
     rest of the door drops with a thud from its moldy hinges
     sending price and evelyn hurtling down with it into the
     room

     int decaying room

     stunned for a moment evelyn and price suddenly become aware
     that there is another presence in the room

     something dark  churning  terrible

     evelyns eyes look across the floorboards the dust on the
     floor stands up on end and starts to move like metal filings
     being pulled by a magnet

                           evelyn
                steven are you doing that

     a dazed price pulls himself to his feet he can only hold the
     cut that the fall has opened on his forehead and stare at the
     movement on the floor

                           price
                no

                           evelyn
                no ohmygod pritchett was right 
                the houseishaunted

     evelyn tries to right herself prices eyes fix on the wall
     behind her trembling

                           price
                evelyn get up now

                           evelyn
                steven

     she turns and follows his gaze

     a creeping darkness is gathering on the wall behind her

                           price
                its the patients  the evil  weve
                released it 

     price tries to move but he cant  just stands there
     paralyzed with the surreal horror of it all

     evelyn scrambles to her feet price backs up in horror

                           evelyn
                no  

     evelyn bolts for the door she doesnt get far because
     suddenly the churning shadowy mass springs forward grabbing
     evelyn and slamming her back against the wall

     she tries to cry out  but the dark shape on the wall has
     begun to engulf her literally corroding her flesh

     black tendrils like acidtipped vines scuttle all over
     her eating every inch of her body her teeth drop from
     their gums her eyes rot out of their sockets her ribs
     sizzle from her chest  until she no longer has solid
     human form 

     shes just a flat silentscreaming image burntetched flush
     into the wall  just like the gruesome images melissa marr
     saw through her camcorder painted on the corridor walls
     outside vannacutts operating room

     price every limb shaking backs out of the room into the 

     int basement  corridor  continuous

       his eyes shooting every which way in fear of godknows
     what new nightmare  it doesnt take long subtle at first
      glimpses caught out of the corner of his eye  of shadows
     in the room seeming to move

       phft  on the ceiling  price whips his head up 

       phft  did he see something on the rear wall  

       phft  motion from a corner of the floor 

     then all the shadows in the room  begin to move together
     toward the center of the room  coalescing into one huge
     mass of darkness

     price doesnt hang around to see what happens next  he
     bolts from the room  only to smack right into an old
     rusted medical cabinet that swings open to reveal inside one
     of its doors a 1920s vintage anatomical chart with all the
     human organs and parts cut up and rearranged so that they
     are displayed alphabetically viewing toptobottom

     and then prices whole face goes frightwhite on the inside
     of the other door are the organs and parts of melissa marr
     likewise cut up and alphabetized  her decapitated head near
     the bottom labeled skull

     price gasps and dashes back down the corridor to find that
     the mass of darkness has evolved into a huge constantly
     morphing threedihensional being that lets out a nailson
     blackboard screech and charges right for him

     int upstairs  hallway

     where sara eddie and pritchett are trying with all their
     might to pry open the slightlyajar window  when they hear

                           price os
                he was right pritchett was right

                           pritchett
                i am

     sara and eddie dash further down the

     int upstairs kallway

      where price staggers into the doorway that leads to the
     basement stairs  frenzied nearly all his strength gone

                           price
                itsthe house

     and then the mass of darkness swirls into sight from below 
     envelops price  and sucks him back downstairs screaming

     the door slams shut

     beat the three of them just stand there speechless then

                           eddie
                what 

                           sara
                  was that

                           pritchett
                somethingthat should probably
                beavoided 

       they turn tail and tear from the room back to

     int hallway

     where they rush toward the partially priedopen window

                           sara
                the openings still too small
                well never get through

                           eddie
                for chrissake give me a hand

     three pairs of hands grab onto the prybar and throw all
     their weight behind it as they strain and the metal shrieks

                           sara
                pritchett what is going on

                           pritchett
                he mustve unsealed the room

                           sara
                how hes supposed to be dead

     a powerful groan reverberates through the house the sound of
     timbers bending and twisting

     eddies head whips right  out of the corner of his eye
     something seen moving

     the door to the basement  its turning black  gangrenous
      its putrefying before their eyes  bowing in and
     collapsing as it rots

                           sara
                i thinkits timeto go

     they whip around and run down the hall toward the living
     room as they near the end they are stopped dead in their
     track

     their pov

     a wall nearby twists and bends into a new and different
     wall  one with doors that now swing open  leading to
     some dark oblivion

     int hallway

     they stare at the sight before them

                           pritchett
                hail mary full of grace  the house is
                growing

                           eddie
                its not going to let us out

                           sara
                     sensing something
                no its just trying to frighten us

                           eddie
                its succeeding

                           sara
                all the plates sealing the windows and
                doors  theres got to be some way of
                raising them manually they didnt just
                appear out of thin air  theres got
                to be pulleys cables or something that
                make them go up and down

                           pritchett
                in the attic

     the wall at the end of the corridor is bending and twisting
     taking on a new hideous shape

                           eddie
                if you know where it is get there

                           pritchett
                me youve gotta be kidding

     the shadow thing rounds the bend at the end of the corridor 
     its enveloped the entire ceiling

     pritchett looks at sara and eddie plaintively 

                           sara
                move

       then bolts reluctantly down the hall just as the thing
     of shadows drops down from the ceiling begins spreading out
     across the floor and sinking into the floorboards
     disappearing and then a terrible silence

                           eddie
                where did it go

                           sara
                run

                           eddie
                what 

       and then the floorboards of the corridor start exploding
     in a path toward sara and eddie

                           sara
                i said run

     they race down the corridor behind them the floor is ripping
     up sending debris into the air

     sara and eddie dash into another corridor shit a culde
     sac terminating with nothing but solid wall they whip back
     around only to see

     the exploding floor banging a hard right and hurtling
     straight down the culdesac right for them

     trapped they just stare terrified and helpless  and then
     eddie looks up and spots

     an ornate chandelier hanging above them

     the exploding floorboards are nearly upon them

     eddie leaps up grabbing the bottom on the fixture he begins
     pulling himself up

     a floorboard next to saras foot detonates  she screams

                           sara
                eddie

     he grabs her and pulls her up  just as every floorboard
     shes standing on erupts and goes flying opening a huge
     chasm below them

     the two of them exchange a glance that is simultaneously im
     okayyoure okayare we both going nuts thats when they
     hear a metallic screech above them

     the chandelier is ripping out of the ceiling ping bam two
     of the three remaining screws pop free and go flying  the
     chandeliers mount takes a 90degree screechnjolt  and
     saras already tenuous grip is lost she crashes helplessly
     down into the chasm disappearing into the black void below

     int decaying room  continuous

     sara lands with a thud buried kneedeep in the rotted floor
     of the room below the room  where evelyn met her demise

     int hallway  continuous

     eddie manages to swing the chandelier over to the side where
     the floor is still intact

     int decaying room  continuous

     saras just about cleared her head from the fall  when her
     eyes go wide looks down shes sinking into the floor

     she cries out  and suddenly everything beneath her just
     lets go and shes hurtling like a rock down into

     int subterranean chamber  continuous

     sara lands on her face in some pitchblack space

     when her eyes adjust she sees shes in a vaultlike room
     that is filled with stalaqmitelike mounds of dirt and rock
     bizarre geological formations each one unique in its own
     skewed way it appears for a moment as though sara has fallen
     across time and space and onto the surface of a planet we
     dont even have a name for yet

     int the house  various rooms  simultaneous

     the full anger of this place is now manifesting

       walls writhe and twist in fury forming

       stairways that shake themselves into splinters of frenzy

       carvings in the wainscotted paneling that become animate
     and turn upon themselves cannibalizing the writhing
     screaming walls that spawned them

     int hallway  simultaneous

     eddie peers into the hole in the floor there is only
     darkness that seems to go on forever

                           eddie
                sara sara

     int subterranean chamber  simultaneous

     as sara tries to pull herself to her feet she sees dirt and
     rock beginning to fall from the strange formations
     surrounding her and then all becomes clear as to where and
     who shes with

     beneath all that effluence are the remains of vannacutts
     victims some are missing body parts some are only body
     parts some are bound with leather straps as if they were
     just dumped there after dying on the electroshock or
     dissection table

     sara lets out the scream of her life

     int hallway  continuous

     eddie hears her and bolts madly down the hall

                           eddie
                sara

     he races toward the stairwell leading to the basement

     int subterranean chamber  continuous

     sara leaps to her feet and tries to reach for the hole in the
     ceiling  its just out of reach

     then she senses something else in there with her
     reluctantly she turns around

     the shadow thing appears festering on the wall it quickly
     splits into parts and disappears into the rotted corpses and
     they start to move

     rising to life foul breath bellowing into them slowly
     starting to come towards her in a dance macabre 

                           voice os
                     a whisper
                sara

     sara looks up to see eddie in the opening above

                           eddie
                grab my hand

     he bends down to grab for her but shes just out of reach

     decaying hands and arms are suddenly grabbing at sara
     tearing at her clothes shredding the flesh beneath them
     bloody with their long postmortem nails

                           sara
                eddie

     eddie takes his jacket off and lowers it down to sara she
     grabs hold and eddie begins pulling her up

     int attic  simultaneous

     pritchett finds himself in the cavernous attic standing
     before the massive pulley and counterweight system thats the
     upper half of the lockdown mechanism

     through the grooved channel that one of the iron plates
     slides up and down on pritchett can look down and see the
     foyer and the plate blocking the front door

     theres a hand crank attached to a series of blockand
     tackles that ultimately connect to the massive counterweight
     to the front doors plate

     with all his effort he turns the crank but can only manage
     a half revolution 

       creakcrunch  but something moved down there you can
     hear it how much how high he cant see but maybe its
     enough

                           pritchett
                if there is a god

     he puts his full weight behind him and grabs the crank again
      pushes down  and the thing breaks off in his hand

                           pritchett
                nonono why me why me you
                sonovabitch

     in hysterical frustration he throws the broken flange of
     metal as hard as he can at the wall he misses the wall
     entirely and the crank just pinballs impotently between
     cables and counterweights with a series of mocking clanks
     and pings

                           pritchett
                whyyyyyyy

     as he tears at his hair screeching suddenly he notices
     light on his hands he turns and the

     dim glow from a soontorise sun falls on his face he sees

     that somehow all that caroming that his errant crank did
     has caused one of the iron plates to raise slightly there is
     now a three foot opening in the attic dormer window

     pritchetts eyes glance nervously upward

                           pritchett
                is it too late to take back a
                couple of things i said

     int decaying room  simultaneous

     eddie pulls sara all the way up and out of the subterranean
     chamber they slump back on the fetid floor exhausted

                           eddie
                you okay

                           sara
                yeah and under other abnormal
                circumstances i think this would be the
                time to seriously jump your bones

                           eddie
                better put it on hold til we find
                pritchett

                           sara
                i dont do groups

     eddie laughs  and then his mouth stays open with no sound
     coming out hes staring as

     the area around the hole in the floor begins to turn a
     familiar black and is creeping fast towards saras shoe

                           sara
                what

                           eddie

     she rips her shoes off

                           eddie
                pritchett

     they both bolt and head for the basement stairs

     int attic  simultaneous

     pritchett moves to the window and freedom he is about to
     make it outside when he stops

                           pritchett
                oh cmon  dont grow a conscience
                now fchrissake

     he continues out the window  stops again looks heavenward
     angry and guilty at the same time yells to his deity

                           pritchett
                alright alright i wont leave em here
                to die

     he crabs himself back into the attic runs over to the
     grooved channel that the front doors iron plate slides on
     shouts down through the slit to the foyer

                           pritchett
                i found the way out

     int main salon  continuous

     sara and eddie hear the voice coming from the foyer

                seconds twofoursixeight

                up here 

     int attic  continuous

     a metallic pop and ping is heard pritchetts eyes dart to
     the machinery a strand of the rusted cable holding the
     window open has snapped free and the rest are in an advanced
     state of fray

                           pritchett
                  i think you better hurry  theres
                something of a time issue here

     int grand foyer  continuous

     sara and eddie start up the stairs  behind them the hallway
     is turning black with decay

                           sara
                move

     they race up the stairs 

     int attic  continuous

       arriving in another part of the attic

     sara looks around trying to get her bearings

                           eddie
                pritchett

     a distant voice

                           pritchett os
                over here

     the attic is a labyrinth of dangling cables counterweights
     and their often neckhigh metal moorings sara moves toward
     the sound of his voice eddie hangs back sensing something

     sara slowly wends her way through all the mishigas

     unseen by her down by her carefully treading feet the
     shadow mass is filtering up through the slits in the attics
     floor

     sara edges her way around a tall iron flyrail 

       and something grabs at her hand shes had enough she
     reaches back to slug it  then stops

     its pritchett

                           pritchett
                please its been a bad enough day 

       and now the shadow mass has reassembled to its new full
     enormity it begins to barrel across the attic towards
     pritchett and sara who dont have a clue  eddie does

                           eddie
                get out ot the way

     sara turns back toward him eddie rushes and pushes her to
     the side as the shadow mass is just about to envelop her

     and eddie is struck fullforce  he instantaneously turns to
     a blackened mass

                           sara
                eddie

     and then the wind from outside kicks up blowing eddie away
     like so much powder and sara just crumples

     at the other end of the attic the shadow mass is turning
     back toward them

     pritchett rushes in  grabs sara  and pulls her towards
     the small dormer window  the cable holding the plate snaps
     three of its last four strands 

       pritchett pushes sara through the window  just as the
     cable holding the plate finally breaks trapping pritchett
     inside

     its now back to near pitchblack again in there pritchett
     turns to see

     the faces of all of vannacutts victims taking form in the
     immense shadow mass  all with that revengeontheliving
     look in their emptysocket eyes

     suddenly from the swirling dark center of the mass the
     flaming head of dr richard vannacutt appears blasting a
     hot breath at pritchett who is freaking out

                           pritchett
                im just the contractors son i
                had nothing to do with your current
                condition

     the words seem to have little impact on the steadily
     approaching mass of faces

       and then suddenly sunlight pours in behind him sara has
     pried the plate up with a lightning rod  one thats in the
     process of bending in two under all the weigh

                           sara
                i think if youre coming mr
                pritchett its now or never

     the mass of faces starts to creep up pritchetts shoe with a
     screech he flings himself backwards literally diving
     through the open window 

                                                            cut to

     ext house  continuous

       as the lightning rod snaps  and the iron plate comes
     guillotineslamming back down  right onto pritchetts foot

     he screams and hysterically yanks at his ankle 

       his foot emerging safeandsound and whole the shredded
     remnants of a white sock blowing in the morning seabreeze

     sara and pritchett exchange looks theyre both missing
     shoes they shrug the sunliqht warms their faces

                                                      fade to black

     and in the darkness we hear a familiar voice

                           christopher lee vo
                the police and coroner arrived at
                the house on haunted hill at 730
                am pacific standard time

                                                   fade back up on

     ext house  morning

     a fleet of milling cops paramedics fire officials
     ambulances the works sara seen getting her legs treated a
     blankfaced pritchett being grilled by la sheriffs

     gurneys toting very full body bags from the house one gurney
     carrying a half dozen vary small bags melissa marr most
     likely

                           christopher lee vo
                watson pritchett told the police
                that they need a sherman tank to
                get into the house but when the
                first officer on the scene tried
                the front door knob it opened
                without so much as a squeak

                                                            cut to

     int house  newsreel footage  various shots

       grand foyer

       main salon

       basement

       corridors

                           christopher lee vo
                and for all the horror that pritchett
                described the house was found to be
                utterly unexceptional and undisturbed
                 even the dust still in place

     we see that what hes saying is true theres no evidence
     that anything ever happened here even the basement  the
     electroshock and saturation chamber  appear exactly as
     when we first saw them even the restraints that were cut
     have been made whole aqain

     int limbo set  night

     slow pull back to christopher lee on the terrifying but
     true set talking to us as the footage continues to play
     on a screen behind him

                           christopher lee
                and not one sign of the partys
                hosts steven and evelyn price
                the only person not surprised
                by this was watson pritchett

     on the screen behind him

     ext house  morning

     a closeup of pritchett seen talking

                           pritchett
                theyre part ot the house now
                thats the way it works

     back to scene

                           christopher lee
                the truth will likely be never
                known unless on some strange
                whim you decide to spend the
                evening inside the house on
                haunted hill
                     he smiles
                good night

     and walks os the tv camera pans back to the projection
     screen

     as the terrifying but true credits crawl underneath them
     we see the old silent black  white footage weve seen
     before

     int cerebral hygiene room bw

     1931 the cerebral hygiene room the rampaging patients
     huddling around an operating table a blur of scalpels and
     saws as they viciously vivisect dr vannacutt and his nurse
     crammed together on the same gurney

     the image freezes

     as the tv show credits end

     but before it fades out we see that something has changed in
     this footage

     the two humans being vivisected on that gurney are different

     the doctor in surgical scrubs has steven prices face

     his nurse is evelyn

     pritchetts voice heard as the image starts to fade

                           pritchett vo
                it wont stop until its got
                every one
