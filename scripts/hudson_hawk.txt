     fade in

     ext vinci countryside  renaissance  day

     beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle a small
     renaissance fair with florid awnings demented acrobats
     and roaring puppets is unfolding

     rustic farmers and their families rumble with enjoyment
     at the sabbath afternoon entertainment

     encircled by children a juggler with an unforgettably
     etched face elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
     on his mule  as he begins to juggle a loud explosion
     is heard causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
     and collapse in a heap

     everyone at the fair including the puppets looks up

                             unforgettable juggler
               leonardo che pazzo

     the juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle

     int room of the gold machine

     where the charismatic leonardo da vinci laughs down at
     him  da vinci wears a pair of very early very cool sun
     glasses with his trademark beard

     he turns and loses his smile something extraordinary
     reflecting off his glasses  removing his shades da
     vinci moves to the something a gloriously incredible
     machine  the opening credits reveal its dazzling idio
     syncrasies

     two coughing apprentices haplessly try to disperse smoke
     from the still billowing mysteriously spectacular
     machine  mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
     of light which cut through the smoke like a renaissance
     laser show

                             da vinci
                       silencing authority
               basta vapore

     the apprentice throws a lever  a shunt near the furnace
     turns  steam escapes upwards  the machine immediately
     slows down  da vinci ohsogently coughs and moves for
     ward with tongs

     a little trough  in the machines innards

     comes to a trembling mystical halt  right behind this
     trough is a conplex polyhedron crystal as intricately
     modulated as any rubik stocking stuffer but much more
     dazzling in beauty  it gleams like a jewel in the yellow
     glow which pours from a pleasantly grinning demonhead into
     a trougha glow of heatand something more than heat

     the tongs enter the frame

     da vinci brings the object closer to his face  a murmur
     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the master
     peers at the smoking yellow bar

                             apprentice two
               maestro che meraviglia

                             apprentice three
               lei e proprio fantastico

     da vincis pride goes dead as the implications hit

                             da vinci
               lasciatemi solo  solo

     the apprentices scurry out  mind reeling da vinci turns
     his back to the viewer before a wall of frescoes

                             da vinci
               lho fatto

     spinning back around using the edge of his cloak da
     vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop

     int da vincis workshop

     with an accompanying blast of smoke da vinci bursts
     through some double doors into his workshop sadly
     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
     bar in the other

     his workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
     laboratory and studio on a table in the foreground is
     a fresh clay equestrian statue a large volume of
     sketches the inkwell nearby a model of what looks like
     a helicopter da vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
     among these goodies

     pocketing the crystal da vinci meanders through his work
     shop casually tinkering with various experiments  he
     snaps his fingers at a bathing suited apprentice wearing
     a diving helmet prototype  the apprentice jumps into a
     pool of water

     leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished
     exceptforthemouth portrait of mona lisa who happens
     to be seated in a stool before the easel  she broadly
     smiles revealing the worst dental work of her epoch
     da vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a

     ext castle terrace

     a flying apprentice sails past leonardo in a bat winged
     glider enthusiastically shouting  da vinci grins back
     until he touches his pocket  he pulls out the crystal
     and after a beat angrily twists it apart into two
     separate geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
     mirror  he quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
     geometric pieces

     calming down da vinci looks from the three components of
     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
     table in his workshop  he ponders then looks back out to
     the vinci vista

     the bat winged glider dissolves into

     a hawk

     who is revealed to be flying over sing sing prison

     int a sing sing prison cell

     the shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window over
     the face of eddie hudson hawkins causing him to break out
     of an eyeclosed trance

     before the viewer can get a good look at him hudson
     hawk turns to an oddball version of the mona lisa that
     has his face and tears it off the cell backwall

     int prison block walkway

     two prison guards one wise and black the other young
     and green march down a cell block  the former is smoking
     a pipe which the young guard lights with a lighter

                             wise guard
               were losing our biggest celebrity
               today

               great cat burglars

     int prison cell wall

     a hand tears down a picture of a happy hudson hawk and
     a little monkey identically dressed in black cat
     burglar gear

     the block

     the wise guard and the young guard rumble forward

                             wise guard
               as a thief hawk was a poem
               iambic fucking pentameter  you

                             hawk

     the wise guard chuckles as the young guard fumbles with
     his keyring

                             young guard
               darn these are for lblock

     hawks hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe
     cleaner from the wise guards pocket  then the lighter
     from the young guards pocketburns off the fabric fuzz
     with the lighter beside itbends the now blackened
     wireand with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to
     unlock the door

                             young guard
                go back down to security and

     he stops dumbfounded as the door clunks open  the
     guards doubletake as hawk finally in full view struts
     past them down the hall  the guards hustle to catch
     up  the wise guard puts his finger in the air and
     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating
     from hawk

                             wise guard
               guess this means hawk youll
               be able to let yourself back in

               this  i think you picked a good
               day to get out

     the trio comes to the final checkpoint  hawk takes a
     deep breath

                             gates os

     hawk makes eye contact up to a crude coarse and
     cackling island of a man officer gates amid the sea
     of oblivious and selfobsessed yuppitude standing by
     a table

     back of the bar

     with concern alex watches hawk sit at gates table

     gates table

     gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with
     terrifying precision  hawk tosses the badge onto the
     food  gates eats around it

                             gates

     gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer
     down at hawk  behind gates on the tv screens are
     analogous images of disgusting animals and monsters

                             gates

     gates simmers into his seat with a selfcontrol smile

                             gates
               remember that guy in the cell
               next to you who hung himself

     gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table

                             gates
               one phone call and your shoe
               will become a piece of evidence
               and that suicidell become a
               murder

     hawk bobs under the table and up

                             hawk

               and your coat shiny

     gates grabs the shoes and races off gagging  hawk gets
     up to laugh next to alex  their laughter dies as they
     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table
     between them

     int back roomdawn

     hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a
     monkeysized chalkoutline on a city street  behind him
     alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag  sinatras

     hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old
     true bar  round lamps tacky mirrors pictures of hawk
     and the regs at the bar  managing a weary smile hawk
     lifts a ship steering wheel while alex puts on a pair of
     granny classes and pulls out blueprints

     behind his back  he brings it back around completed
     sighing hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp  alex
     starts rubbing his stomach  they pace in prejob
     syncopation and speak rapidfire

     alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of
     drawings of different kinds of vaults  he sets himself
     up for an insulin injection

                             hawk

     hawk collapses next to alex resigned to his fate

                             hawk
               im a bum

     ext nice business neighborhoodnight

     two grubby derelicts one pushing a shopping cart the
     other inside it situated atop the usual two glad bags
     they are drunkenly warbling witchcraft  impeccably
     dressed nightlifers give them a wide berth

     our derelicts pass beneath a massive red canopy of a
     distinguished eight story edifice upon which is written
     rutherfords auction house  a doorman shoos them away

     a newspaper truck pulls up in front of the auction house
     the driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
     a dispenser on the corner  the bums wheel around the
     truck  the driver loads the papers and bounds back

     the truck pulls away from the corner  the shopping cart
     rolls offthe bums nowhere to be seen

     the truck turns the corner revealing the derelicts
     climbing up the back of it with glad bags around their
     necks  the truck moves toward an enclosed walkway bridge
     that connects the auction house with another building

     launching lowtech grapples the vagrants latch them
     selves onto the walkway window as the truck passes
     beneath

     at the window

     the viewers viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
     dangling derelicts revealing them to of course be hawk
     and alex  getting a footing on the small window ledge
     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
     plunger

                             hawk
               whoa you better cut a bigger hole
               than that

               there

     alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where
     laughter and shadows emerge  hawk tries to flee but a
     grinning alex pulls him toward it

     hawk and alex slide across the wall to a closed room
     marked power which is right next to the open guards
     station  the viewers viewpoint moves past hawk and
     alex lockpicking into the power room to

     int the guards station

     two security guards sit before a console of seven
     security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke
     wires coming out of the security console run across the
     floor and through the wall into

     int the power room

     the wires go up to a row of seven humming record button
     flashing vcrs  hawk and alex stand before them
     sharing a cig

                             alex
               they record everything their
               video surveillance takes in

                             hawk
               yes masterthief i can see that
               you said something about a plan

     alex presses the rewind buttons on the vcrs

               am i boring you smartass  watch
               a little rewind and rewire action
               and the guards are going to be
               watching a rerun and miss out on
               our exciting episode

     hanging horse mobiles a heavyset guard big stan moseys
     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium  the
     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
     turbo floor washer

     next to a painting of happy children riding horses at the
     back of the auditorium stage big stan hefts himself upon
     a comparatively tiny blue chair and begins to tip back
     and snooze

     int guards station

     the security guards look to the seventh floor screen to
     see an unfolding shot of big stan midsnooze

     little chair crunching it to the ground

     the laughing security guards see the crunch

     int the power room

     alex puts the last of the monday tapes into a vcr

                             alex

     of swinging on the star kicks in on the soundtrack

               a mule is an animal with long
               funny ears

                             alex
               he kicks up at anything he
               hears

     hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his
     glad bag  strenuously upbeat ray conniffesque singers
     continue to sing the song orchestrally accompanied when
     hawk isnt

     int the freight elevator

     hawk takes over the song sardined in the elevator

                             hawk
               or would you rather swing on a
               star carry moonbeams home in a

     alex goes up to a circuit box and pulls down two large
     switches  the soundtrack singers continue to warble

     the guards station

     the lights of the floor wobble and die  the console
     screens blink off  the security guards stop laughing

     inside the power room

     alex briskly slams back up the switches

     outside the power room

     the singers go louder as the lights come back on
     security guard one harrumphs and heads back to the
     guards station

     the auction auditorium

     hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left
     wall of the auditorium glancing to the clock

                             hawk
               or would you rather be a fish

     he pulls out the black canvas bag from his glad bag and
     takes out the blueprints  hawk follows them toward the
     painting onstage

     the guards station

     big stan comes up from behind his fellow guards dumping
     the remains of the chair on the floor

                             big stan
                       moving back off
               very funny

     the seventh floor screen shows a peaceful auction
     auditorium  and the blue chair

     the auction auditoriumcamera pov

     from the exact angle the viewer sees the current state
     of the room with hawk flinging off the painting of the
     horseback children revealing a safe  but no blue chair

     hawk

     spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor plugged
     into a walkman and affixes it to the safe above the
     dial

                             hawk

                             alex
               he cant write his name or read
               a book  to fool people is his
               only thought

     the auction auditorium

                             hawk
                       remembering
               and though hes slippery he
               still gets caught

     wearing headphones hawk cranks up the walkman and spins
     the dial  the clicks from the dial are so loud he winces
     and turns down the volume  then theres a clunk

     the guards station

     with the soundtrack singers taking over guard two sips
     a cup of coffee  he doesnt swallow

     his sights zero in on the blue chair on the seventh
     screen  he looks to the chair remains then back again

                             security guard two

     auction auditorium

     hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door
     open

     inside the safe along with the holy da vinci music
     cue is the clay equestrian model from leonardos
     worktable

     hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag

                             hawk
               and all the monkeys arent in

               so you see its all up to you
               you can be better than you are
               you could be swinging on a star

     the auction room

     big stan reconnects the wires of the seventh vcr

     the guards station

     suddenly on the seventh screen the image and voices
     of hawk and alex inprocess comes on

                             security guard one
               shit lets roll

     the auction auditorium

     hawk puts the painting back up but stops to stare at the
     playful children

                             alex
               the songs over  come on
               you could be swinging on a star

                             hawk

                       more frantically
               you could be swinging on a star

                             hawk
               paint a woman in a lighthoui
               dont want to steal a horse
               life is

     hawks soliloquy is cut short as security guards one and
     two crash into the auction auditorium

                             alex
                       deadpan
               you could be swinging on a star
               you couldnt have waited to see
               a psychiatrist  no you had

     alex whips his chair at the floor washer tipping it
     forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and
     trip the guards into a bellyflop

     hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them
     into alexs thumbcuffs  he then limbos under their
     connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer
     cord  the security guards clumsily turn and retrip
     themselves

                             hawk
               lets go down the freight elevator

     big stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator

                             alex
               keep those ideas coming

     hawk and alex run toward an office located at the right
     wall  they both do a genekellyesquechairtipover
     before simultaneously bashing through the office door

     int darkened auction auditorium office

     hawk and alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and
     rub their funny bones  alex stops laughing

                             alex
               im not as unpleasantly plump as
               that guard am i

     big stan fires off a warning shot  hawk and alex quickly
     tear up a window

     moving out on to a ledge hawk and alex look down to the
     huge auction house awning and trade gulps

     big stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door

                             hawk and alex
               i got a bad feeling

                             hawk
               i cant even swim

                             alex
               hell the fallll probably kill
               ya

     big stan raises his gun

     hawk and alex jump and aaagh down the face of the
     building

     closer and closer to the awning

     the viewer focuses upon hawk as he freefalls

                                                cut to

     right into a lazyboy chair

     hawk continues his fall into a ridiculously huge
     reclining chair  the foot stand swooshes out with a
     thump  a hand pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle

     int gates apartmentlate night

     hawks weirdly reclining viewpoint makes gates and his
     pad more grotesque than they are no small feat
     a subradio shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch
     bowl of red margaritalike substance beneath the
     instantly recognizable framed picture of those dogs
     playing poker all atop a jungle shag

     gates in shorts and a hawaiian shirtoverakeep on
     truckintshirt raises a loud tumbler with one hand
     the black canvas bag in the other

                             gates
               hudson hawkins gets the chair of
               honor  how about a gatesarita

               i used real hot dogs

               werent you the bartender at
               jonestown

     suddenly a light is turned on in the corner revealing a
     seated cesar and antony mario the latter taking a painful
     gatesirita sip

                             cesar
               good job not pretty but good

                             hawk
               ah the mafia the cops do i know
               how to party or what

     gates pulls out the horse and looks at it

                             gates
               all this trouble for a horsey
               i may not know art but i know
               what i like

               you certainly do

                             gates

                             alfred
               any minute now dear mr gates

     a malevolently snobbish british butler alfred enters in
     distaste  he makes a stressful glance to three vanity
     fairs on a coffeetable that has a photo of a magnetic
     husbandwifedog combo with the caption mayflower power
     hawk notices this

                             gates
               oh sorry jeeves  gatesarita

                             alfred
               ill pass  may i

     alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jewelers
     loupe studies it carefully

                             alfred
               ah such craftsmanship  leonardo
               da vincis last commission for the
               duke of milan  irreplaceable

                             gates
               hey mr french im delirious
               for you  now wheres my cut

     with dignity alfred smashes the ancient horse over
     gatess head  alfred rummages through the debris
     revealing a perversely labyrinthine crystal piece
     recognizable from da vincis workshop

                             gates
               you sonofai dont believe
               this  you come into my house

     alfred pockets the goodies but not before hawk can give
     them a confused peruse

                             gates
               i ought to take big ben and shove
               it up your limey blimey bunghole

     a blade slides down alfreds arm  halfyawning he

     alfreds 180 degree pov

     spins before gates and the bystanders behind him
     the blade goes back up alfreds arm

     the rooms only sound is the stereos inappropriate
     music  gates shrugs but his voice is off

                             gates
               like i said  wheres my cuu

     suddenly a line across gatess neck turns red and blood
     begins to gush like a tourist attraction  gates crashes
     down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo
     sending it to the ground cutting off the music  the dog
     poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid

     blown away hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
     recliner  alfred pats some stain remover on the blood
     on his shirt

                             alfred
               so much for his cut
                       postchortle
               excuse my dry british humor

               lovely work alfred taking the

               lovebirds

                             antony
               you know i think gates promised
               hawk a cut too

     the mario brothers cackle out  hawk tries to flail out
     of his chair  alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm
     hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes
     alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair

                             alfred
               ta ta hudson hawk

                             hawk

               send the thank you note to
         
     hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle
     with the cappuccino machine

                             hawk
               the butler did it  guy was a cross

               constipated than others

     hawk uneasily laughs as anna makes her way up the stage
     and pulls out a large magnifying glass  a look of
     distress passes over her face  hawk closes his eyes in
     anticipation

                             hawk

     hawk opens his eyes in confusion  he scans anna coming
     off the stage gliding toward the phone table  hawk
     floats into the aisle curling toward her as she picks
     up a phone and murmurs into it

     hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure
     anna looks up from the phone to do the same  she
     swerves her attention to the backturned hawk

     darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his
     wife minerva makes her entrance par excellahnce  she is
     outrageously dressed with a mammoth tiffany watch that
     extends from her wrist down to acting as a leash

     commencing a slow motion sequence big stan comes out
     of the nearby office zipping up his fly  he immedi
     ately scopes hawk in the space before the stage

     the mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with
     devoured canary smiles

                             eccentric bald auctioneer
               going

     big stan pulls out his gun untheatrically as not to
     cause a scene  anna sees this and follows big stans
     eyeline to hawk

     hawk turns to repursue but stops dead at the sight of
     the gloating big stan

                             eccentric bald auctioneer
               going

     big stan launches a gallop toward hawk who spins and
     veers back round up the aisle

     the mayflowers zero their sights on the activity

                             eccentric bald auctioneer
               gone

     the gavel comes down in super slowmotion

     annas leg pokes out of the aisle tripping the guard

     hawk brakes at the end of the mayflowers row and smiles
     in relief casually turning to darwin and minerva

     the gavel continues to come down in super slowmotion

     both darwin and minerva mayflower suddenly duck down

     smile vanishing hawk spins toward the stage

     the gavel hits

     breaking out of slowmotion into wideangle the entire
     podium explodes sending debris equestrian pieces and
     eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming
     battered crowd

     knocked off his feet hawk gropes into a standing
     position  he sees the mayflowers make a smooth exit
     he starts to give chase until he sees a battered anna
     rising from the ground

     a hanging white tristar pegasus cracks from the
     damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards anna

     hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying
     leap  he slams anna out of the pegasuss pulverizing
     path  they weary up off the ground and move down the
     aisle calm in a storm of packed art patrons

                             anna
               my god that was bold of you
               you didnt have to do that

               no i meant you didnt have to
               tackle me and rip my dress  a
               polite push perhaps  a clear
               shout of watch out anna
               would have done nicely

                             hawk
               excuse me milady  i would have
               flown over and carried you up to
               a pink cloud but i left my cape
               at the cleaners

     anna touches hawks lips and laughs

                             anna
                       hey i was kidding

     hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a
     howling cesar sidestepping his vibratingonthefloor
     brother latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches
     it backward

     outside back of ambulance

     the elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now
     unstrapped but terrified hawk whoaaing atop it

     the gurney wheels hit the road sparking

     a sheet from the gurney caught on the door yanks taught
     hawk is water skiing on his stomach atop the elevated
     gurney

     screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the
     road

     battered by wind and fear hawk clutches to the gurney
     and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface

     the sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing
     off to the side on its own crazed volition

     hawk skis toward a toll booth with a large gatearm

     whizzing wildly forward on the gurney hawk scrambles
     into his pocket and wiggles out some change  he fran
     tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally
     flings the change from twenty feet away

     lit by the flames of the ambulance crash a sneering
     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness
     carrying a steel suitcase  he kneels before hawk and
     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara
     tus  he begins mumbling into a cellular phone

     a malevolent silent deadpan wraith passes him and
     approaches hawk  both men are dressed in outfits that
     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
     couture

     on the fingers of one wraith hand is carved the word
     hate  on the other hand is the word frog  the frog hand
     hands a befuddled hawk a card  it reads my name is kit
     kat and this is not a dream

     hawk looks up with a huh expression as kit kat chops
     his neck knocking him off the gurney

     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus

     bounds back up until he sees the biggest member of the

     giant clumsily trips over snickers suitcase apparatus
     and ramcollapses into hawk and the gurney  laying atop

     annual reporttype booklet in front of them that reads
     the da vincialchemy project

     minerva leans over in front of him

     finger

     int vaticanesque map room

     mentally casing the joint hawk gets some distance
     between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room
     that has a glorious ancient map of the world mural

     int another vatican room

     hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a
     vatican guard standing before a painting of a pope
     performing a coronation

     sees a line of international phone boothettes  checking
     for flunkies he rips one up

     off

     int hallway leading to codex room

     hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a
     room at the end bustling with excitement  coming to the
     mouth of the room he looks to two gold framed mirrors on
     either side of the opening rubs his head and scribbles

     inside the codex room

     hawk takes in the majestic beauty and practical details
     of the roomwindows statues a massive ornate lighting
     fixtureas he moves down one of the twin winding stair
     cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and
     the object of their gaze

     the da vinci codex

     an old book enclosed in a glass case propped open to
     the familiar beautiful drawing of a man inside a circle

     the case is located between two informational tablets
     enclosed in glass columns  enter holy da vinci theme

                             anna vo
               but it is his gift as an inventor
               who drew together science and art
               that is most incredible

     hawk brightens to the return of anna carrying a portfolio
     bag striding down the stairs with a group of investors
     and families  she brightens back giving him a quick
     verbal breath and a hand squeeze

                             anna
               tough guy  what are youhows

     she laughs going into her public voice

                             anna
               as you know the da vinci codex
               has lived in the vatican for
               centuries and will continue to
               live here for centuries more

                             hawk
                       under his breath
               thats what you theenk

                             anna
               question sir   his untiring pen
               predicted the airplane the
               submarine the bicycle the
               helicopter and even the tank
         
     a little brat trailing the group moves next to hawk
     bitching away to her stuffed elephant pokey

                             little brat
               this is so boring  do you hate
               italy as much as i do pokey

               one  why cant we go to the epcot
               center

     the little brat stops and lets pokey the elephant dangle
     from her side  hawk eyes the elephant strangely

                             anna
               these more dangerous designs
               inspired him to develop a secret
               code that 

     the stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over annas
     head

     the alarm goes off  the massive ornate lighting fixture
     swoops down from the ceiling inverting in air and slams
     down over the codex transformed into a makeshift cage

     strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents
     needless to say everyone goes crazy

     coughing gas hawk peeks to see that a line of light
     sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the
     alarm off

     two gas masks drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the
     entranceway and two racingin guards wrangle them on

     the little brat sees that pokey the stuffed elephant has
     been beheaded by the cagelamp  she is pulled away and
     spanked

                             little brat
               pokey come back

     anna yanks a notetaking hawk away as the gas blusters in
     around him  the two flunkies eyes on hawk are hap
     lessly making their way up the opposite staircase

                             anna
               come on this stuff will knock you
               out  have you ever had the feeling

                             hawk
               never why do you ask

     reaching the top of the stairs just outside the door
     anna briskly pulls hawk into a piece of wall that is
     really a door  the wall closes as the flunkies come
     flying out baffled

     int circular staircase

     hawk mucho impressed and anna move down a tight dark
     circular staircase

     the evil hawk clumsily strides around a fountain looking
     off in all directions softshoes past some sedate
     painters and swings into

     int a big quirky phone booth

     hawk grabs up the phone and dials

                             hawk
               hello operator  id like to
               make a collect call to new york
               number

     the mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza
     behind an oblivious hawk

                             hawk
               thank you operator thank you

     hawk turns putting a finger in his ear  seeing the
     limo he freaks and balls himself into a corner

     int alexs restaurantnight

     it is late night in new york  a phone rings atop the
     bar of alexs restaurant with no one in sight

     int piazzaday

     hawk pokes his head to see a darwin and minerva holding
     bunny emerge from the limousine  as he turns his con
     centration back to the phone alex himself flows out from
     a building to cheerfully speak with darwin and minerva
     and get licked by bunny before they all pile into the
     limo

                             hawk
               alex alex come on alex

     hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
     pull off

     hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully
     clotheslined by agent butterfinger who is dressed as
     a mailman

     crumpled on the ground hawk kicks out with his foot
     into butterfingers stomach doubling him hawk then
     grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the
     booth

     hawk rotates off for an escapebut the rest of the
     cia crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns
     snickers dressed as a maitre d almond joy as a bermuda

               a mafia hit  did it for fun
               ciao

     kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different
     directions as hawk howls in frustration  kit kat moves
     behind hawk and perfectly mimics him

                             hawk
               what did you have against little
               eddie motherfucker  he was just
               a monkey who liked to laugh

               space shuttle eatingshit

     without looking hawk elbows the mimic kit kat in the
     face  kit kat gives hawk a strange smile and hands him
     a card that reads  beware the odd steps

     hawk looks up from the card  kit kat is gone but
     butterfinger scampers in his place

                             butterfinger
               hey mr hawk i got those 72
               stamps

     sighing hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps

     ext indoor train track

     one of the small vatican mail trains bullets across an
     indoor track  the viewers viewpoint whooshes to catch
     up focusing on a very large package addressed to the
     pope that has hawks sheath of stamps slapped onto it
     the train zips into a tunnel

     int the vatican underground subway

     the train rumbles into the vatican ministation  two
     harried workers heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting
     table

     a bell rings as a clock hits 10  the workers do a sigh
     of relief  shucking off their uniforms they head out

     a hand rips out of the huge package

     int outside the codex roomnight

     hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to
     the mouth of the doorless codex room  he pauses to
     handcomb his hair in the two large framed mirrors at
     the sides

     the codex room

     carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand hawk
     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops

                             hawk
               beware the odd steps

     hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a
     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized
     alarm button

                             hawk
               why kit kat arent you a
               gentleman

     hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to
     where the codex is bathed in a holy light

     he hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
     across the top  the parallel mirrors now face out from
     each other  hawk sprays a blast of clairol to reveal the
     light sensor beams and then with a deep breath he
     thrusts the mirrors into the beams

     the light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and hawk
     exhales  he balances the connected mirrors then crawls
     through his tentlike passageway

     hawk squirts acid from a bikers bottle on the cracks of
     the rectangular glass case that holds the codex  the
     acid sizzles

     int vatican library hallwaynight

     a burly guard thoughtfully stares at a painting fingers
     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling
     on

     the codex room

     rubbing his head hawk gives an excited smile as the glass
     cracks of the rectangular case loosen  hawk pulls out a
     pocket fisherman

     the viewers viewpoint moves upward to reveal through
     the mouth of the room the burly guard is coming down
     the hall

     outside the codex room

     burly guard approaches the outskirts of the codex room
     he combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now
     empty mirrorframe then realizes

     muttering italian into his walkietalkie burly guard
     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor
     deflecting mirrors

     he passes a statue behind which hawk is revealed to
     be standing

     burly guard approaches the codex and sees the dripping
     acid  he also notices a fishing hook attached to the
     binding of the codex  the fishing wire leads out of
     the glass case  the guard reaches to touch it when
     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a
     movingoutfrombehindthestatue hawk

     the codex flies off its perch setting off the alarm and
     sending the bizarre cagelamp crashing down and around
     the hapless burly guard  the green gas commences its
     noxious billowing as the codex swooshes into hawks
     hands  he then hurls a softball smashing a window
     on the other side of the room

     the familiar vatican guard and a guard three barrel
     down into the mouth of the codex room  only one
     gas mask drops from the doorway  the vatican guard
     pulls it on and gives a thats life shrug of
     shoulders to the fainting guard three

     hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple
     around the ceiling cord of the dropped ornate lighting
     fixture  hawk then tarzans from one staircase to
     another  he then ungrapples and heads toward the
     shattered window

     the vatican guard waits a stunned moment before giving
     chase

     ext the roof

     hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical
     skippingacrosstherooftop jaunt  suddenly a brick
     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and hawk falls
     his canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof
     landing against the antennae

     int the popes bedroom

     a tv showing mr ed speaking to wilbur in italian
     goes fuzzy  the pope wearing his famous hat and a notre
     dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it

     ext the roof

     hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
     and slides down toward the danglingofftheantennae bag

     the vatican guard pops out of the window and fires a
     warning shot

     hawk stretches to the bag  his fingers touch as the
     guard continues to bound forward

                             hawk
               please god please godlet
               the guard shoot me

     hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see vatican
     guard hovering over him on the roof

                             vatican guard
               the worms on the other foot
               yankee noodle candy

     hawk sees the vatican guards foot move toward the
     grapple  hawk ferociously tugs ripping the guard
     offbalance and knocking down a side of the roof

     ext top of a nearby wall

     hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
     across a road around a tree branch  hawk ties the end of
     grapple line tosses on a friction belt takes a breath
     and jumps off the wall  the viewer follows him on his
     breathtaking ride

     the brused vatican guard flops back atop the roof  he
     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down

     hawk

     is alnost to the other side when the guards bullet hits
     the friction belt  hawk drops with a wild scream
     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost
     his eyes bug out with the thought of a life without
     children  he slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
     down upon

     ext a bus

     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it  hawk
     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling
     baggage but the bus makes a quick turn and hawk goes
     flying off

     ext right into a cafe chairnight

     panting and discombobulated hawk looks across the table
     to the female hands holding open a menu  the menu comes
     down  it is anna  hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
     bag

                             anna
               oh hudson i was worried you

               i never break a date  scouts
               honor

     hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
     then quickly rips it off as a waiter comes to the
     table

     anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
     the waiters entire body sinks in disappointment  other
     table occupants sadly shake their heads

       the viewers viewpoint pulls back past the black canvas
       bag on a table to reveal a barefoot anna is straddling
       a barebacked hawk demurely and tentatively studying his
       bruises

                             anna
               what have you been doing

     anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise  she stops
     herself and opts for tickling

                             hawk
               tickles tickles tickles

                             anna
                       not stopping
               oh im so sorry

     roaring with laughter they capsize onto the floor
     hawk slithers around to devour her toes  anna closes
     her eyes and arches her back

     she opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring
     right at her  with a gasp she rolls away from hawk
     and stands up trying to brush off her sins

                             anna
               im sorry  i cant  i

                             hawk

     their heads fuse for a semiclassic screen kiss until
     the crucifix lights up and begins shouting in italian

               catholic girls are scary

                            hawk
               oh  no

     anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat
     she bumps into the canvas bag  the codex slides out
     they both catch it in midair  annas eyes pop  she
     wrenches the codex away and kicks  hawk pulls her into
     a compassionate backagainsthisstomach hug  the codex
     falls to the floor unharmed

                             hawk

               maybe it is

               planning you did it  nobody
               does it better hudson  you
               started the week stealing the
               sforza and you ended it swiping
               the codex

                             hawk
               wha

     ext a car outside of annas placenight

     crammed together in the front seat snickers almond
     joy and butterfinger are watching the shadows of
     hawk and anna up in the window  snickers snaps a
     cartridge into a gun while butterfinger attacks a
     gooey pastry

                              snickers
               whats going on in there

                              snickers
               just read butterfinger

     butterfinger pulls up the book on da vinci that anna
     wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy

                             butterfinger
               da vinci had fears about his
               more dangerous designs so he
               created a shorthand code in
               reverse script

                             almond joy
               to yourselfwhat are they

     int annas place

     foam shoots out over the coffee  hawk smiles down at
     it as anna works a cappuccino machine

                             anna
               for two years ive been tracking
               the mayflowers peculiar interest
               in three da vinci pieces  their
               sforza replica was as fake as
               the gas leak that supposedly
               destroyed it

                             hawk
               does everyone in the world know
               more than me  jesus im just

               cappuccino

                             anna
               oh i must have put too much
               ethylchloride in it

     anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her
     hand  hawk collapses  his coffee cup lands perfectly in
     annas outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly
     on the pillow

     the candy bars bash the door open guns raised

                             anna

     opening da vinci sequence

     anna pets the head of hawk on her lap  she is pondering

     int a mysterious dark roomnight

     a sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing
     kaplan

     snickers and butterfinger flop hawk onto the lit chair

     kit kat is dressed exactly like anna  she reacts as she
     comes into the light  kaplan takes the codex from her

                             kaplan
               way to go anna

                             anna
               when the mayflowers find out we

               i happen to know the mayflowers
               bought this castle last year when
               they found out da vinci used to
               do

     the lights in the room come on to the sound of holy da
     vinci theme revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of
     the exact same workshop da vinci toiled in in the
     opening

                             kaplan
                       trying to be solemn
               its the site of their new museum
               and were taking it over  operation
               deflower mayflower is going full

                             anna
                       taking it in
               oh lord the only reason i ask is
               that hudson uh mr hawk hawkins
               had some neat things to say about
               darwin minerva and you
               basically that youre part of the
               same car pool

                             kaplan
               anna  anna  anna  if that were
               true almond joy would have
               handed you your heart right
               after you handed me the codex
               now get some sleep  kit kat

     kit kat in drag spookily moves inches away from anna

                              anna
               cat got his tongue

                              kaplan
               actually he never told us what it
               was

     kit kat smiles revealing the fact he has no tongue

                             anna
               how sweet  i trust you will see
               hudson hawk is given to the proper
               authorities  i recommend
               leniency

                             snickers
                       holding in a laugh
               oh i think we all do

     hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes
     anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking
     kit kat

                             snickers
               do you think she has any idea that
               operation deflower mayflower is as
               bogus as kit kats tits

                             kaplan
               i dont think so although bringing
               her to the castle gave her a big
               juicy hint

                             almond joy
               with all due respect to that great
               blouse why didnt i cut out her
               heart

                             kaplan
               close call but shes our only way
               of keeping tabs on that damn
               mysterious vatican organization
               hawk its time to go to the
               principals office

     ext outside the castlenight

     moving into the chopper anna glimpses bunny the
     obnoxious dog in a mayflower logo dog tag taking a leak
     on some bushes  she fakes a yawn to the like dressed kit
     kat who fakes one back

     int the g machine roomnight

     kaplan hawk and the other agents march into the mammoth
     room of the opening scene  in the place of where one
     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets beneath
     which are unassembled parts of the machine

     inside a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
     machine  in tennis gear and goggles darwin mayflower
     thwacks it against the wall of now faded frescos

     also in tennis threads minerva is laying on a chaise
     lounge holding a gadget in her hand

                             darwin
               seven

     minerva turns the gadget up to seven and presses a
     button  another tennis ball shoots out a little faster
     darwin batters it  the ball ricochets into the forehead
     of an amused alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat
     pants

                             alfred
               jolly  good  shot  sir

                             minerva
               ooh its hudson hawk you cease
               to amaze me convict  you are aterriblecat burglar

                             darwin
               havent you ever seen like david
               niven  you know tiptoe in tiptoe
               out

                             minerva
               like a cat one could say

                             hawk
               shucks ill just take it back

     hawk reaches for the codex  kaplan pulls it over to
     darwin who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient
     binding  taking a knife from kaplan he begins to slit
     it open

                             minerva
                       bouncing up
               no let me

                             darwin
                       pout
               i dont care

     hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange
     machine parts behind them

     minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri
     cally perverted crystal

                             hawk
               another piece of the puzzle for
               the da vinci alchemy project

     kaplan darwin and minerva look up to hawk then to each
     other all start to speak then all stop

     this quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin
     flunkies

                             darwin
               oh you  theres nothing more i
               hate than failure  all you had to
               do was follow the hawk its not
               like i said teach our nations
               children how to read

     hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets

                             darwin
               i guess were just going to have
               to kill em

     shockingly swift minerva pulls a small gun from beneath
     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each
     set of flunky eyes splattering them to the ground

                             darwin
               god minerva i waskidding

     a shocked hawk

     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a
     sheet  he reveals the familiar gold machine demonhead

     the mayflowers

     reverberate off each other with laughter  bloodstained
     kaplan and almond joy exchange an eye bulge  minervas
     smile disappears as she sees hawk by the sheets

                             minerva
               get away from there convict

                             hawk
               just browsing  dont touch me

     snickers touches him  hawk smashes him in the jaw
     snickers rears back to reciprocate

                             darwin
               dont hurt him  we need him for
               the final job

     snickers stops himself snarling in frustration  hawk is
     suddenly the happiest man hes been in italy

                             hawk
               oh weeeeelly dont hurt me  even
               if i do this

     hawk pulls snickers glasses off and stamps them

                             hawk
               and this

     hawk knees butterfinger in the stomach

     playfully lifting his shirt hawk grabs minerva and
     manually swivels her hips to the beat of his

     blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
     for alex standing at the other end in an incongruous
     italian leather coat

     the locals give off a slightly dazed aah and move off

     int the conference roomday

     wind blows through the shattered conference room window
     snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the
     table with the mayflowers and the other agents

                             kaplan

                             snickers
               were going to whack this place
               so fast well have time to shop
               for american imports

     darwin and minerva politely smile and then turn away to
     each other with knowing looks  the computer screen shows
     the familiar image of the kremlin building that turns
     into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later
     see

                             almond joy
               lucky for us the da vinci is
               located in a wing of the kremlin
               that they used to throw the miss
               ukraine pageant and stuff  itll
               have the least number of guards

               anybodyd be insane to go in
               from the ground floor

     int a vanbusnight

     a headrubbing hawk and a stomach rubbing alex kneel on
     the floor of a moving van over a barely legible drawing
     of what was so neatly delineated on the cia computer
     both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum

                             alex
               were going in from the ground

     hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat  anna
     is revealed to be driving in her habit  hawk gives her
     a kiss

                             hawk

               kremlin youll end up in a
               siberian gulag eating your own
               fingernails

     hawk takes in some views of moscow that remind one of
     budapest

     kaplan snickers almond joy and butterfinger slam down
     upon the roof of the kremlin and discard their
     parachutes

     snickers opens up his computer screen upon which is the
     imagemap of the kremlin with a flashing blue light at
     the top of the building and a flashing green one inside

                             snickers

     the trio rush for the door

     the kremlin roof

     soviet guard one comes out on the roof to light a cig
     arette  he looks in the distance to the motivating cia
     team  suddenly a card floats down into his hand

     it reads   william tell  adams apple  get it

     the notgettingit guard looks up from the card as a
     grinning kit kat parachutes behind him  the guard
     swerves around and kit kat savagely skewers him with a
     crossbow shot to his adams apple

     the delivery entrance

     hawk anna and alex race to the door the latter
     bashes it

     int grungy white foyer

     ball of usedgum pulled from his bag between the
     hammer and the bell cutting off the sound  they rush
     ahead

     ext the kremlin roof

     the agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
     snickers apparatus rings  kaplan answers it

                             kaplan
               everythings going fine minerva
               thanks for asking

     int nondescript hallway

     minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway with
     darwin who is holding in his laughter as if this was a
     great crank

                             minerva
               i say who needs this hudson hawk
               anyway

     int a grand ballroom

     the good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic
     and gorgeous ballroom  two lush staircases lead up from
     the floor  from behind a pillar the gang checks out
     the activity below

     a tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at
     the opposite end of the ballroom by servants  threaten
     ing soviet soldiers maneuver on the floor

                             hawk
                       wizard of oz
               oheeeohawhoaoh

     they then make a mad scuffle across their side of the
     second level hunkering down by the level railing

     as they move into another wing hallway the viewers
     viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see
     a gloating darwin and minerva enter the latter still
     on the phone

                             minerva
               everybody here in rome wishes
               you tinsel boxes of love

     the servants move away from the tablecloth and the
     table revealing that it is shaped like an m  a group
     of serious soviet vips come out to join the
     mayflowers at the table

     the roof

     kaplan hangs up the phone

                             kaplan
               lazy rich condescending bitch

     the team moves up to the rooftop doorway where kit kat
     is  he holds up an about time card  the agents laugh
     and greet them

     int a very long enigmatic hallway

     hawk alex and anna pass through a set of windowed
     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a
     pitch darkness  a mural of a happy armstretched lenin
     looms above the doors  they give it a a quick glance
     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers

                             alex
               eighth room down babe

                             anna
               guards come exactly every three
               minutes

                             hawk
               three  oh  oh  side by side

     our trio charges down the hallway

                             hawk
               oh we aint got a barrel of
               money

                             alex
               maybe were ragged and funny

     they reach a massive spooky door with an odd ancient
     lock  they go to work on it  not losing the beat

                             hawk and alex
               but well travel along singing
               a song  side by side

     int top floor hallway

     with a gust of wind kaplan and the candy bars bluster
     through the rooftop door into another hallway where
     soviet guards two and three are taking it easy

                             kaplan
               create a diversion

     snickers and butterfinger calmly blow away both guards
     with silenced miniuzis

     soviet guard four rushes out a door before the agents
     zipping up his fly  almond joy twists his neck with an
     agonizing snap

     the long hallway

     hawk anna and alex retreat beneath the lenin mural
     through the windowed double doors

     behind the doors they poke up to see a bespectacled
     guard emerge from the darkness to check out the door

                             alex
               now thats a lock

                             hawk

               can i sing this time too
               please

     hawk and alex are not thrilled about the idea but annas
     eye flutter does it

                             hawk
               uh i guess so

     the bespectacled guard moves back into the darkness

     the ballroom

     the soviet vips open up presents of pink la gear
     tennis shoes silly tshirts and nintendo joysticks
     as a standing darwin hypnotizes them

                             darwin
               i look at you soviet people and i
               feel pity superiority  most
               of your life your government has
               told you that capitalism turns
               people into robots whod rather
               eat microwave sushi naked in the
               back of a cadillac than hear the
               laughter of children

                             minerva
                       smiling
               were here to say your government
               was right

                             darwin
               so lets get busy  have some fun
               and make some deals

     at the lock

     alex holds a lit match into the lock while hawk
     does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver
     they are improvising

                             hawk
               oh this lock is a pain in the buutt

                             alex
               howd we ever get such in a ruutt

     anna suddenly booms out the chorus in a way that hawk and
     alex can barely concentrate

                             anna
               but well travel the road sharing
               the load  side by side

     the hallway above

     the cia team saunters through corpses up to a door
     similar in lock and design to the one hawk and alex
     are working on

     snickerss computer screen shows the blue light directly
     above the green light

                             snickers
               this is the room above the art
               treasures room  the lock is a
               natalya zz first created

               snickers baby i love you like a
               brother but really who cares
               silencer bomb

     butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange
     rifle  he attaches to the front of it a glass encased
     suctioning timebomb from a waist satchel  he fires
     the bomb against the door and it starts ticking

     behind the windowed double doors

     come hawk alex and anna panting

                             hawk
               that was close

               alexs gun

     alex hands anna his gun who glumly takes it like a little
     sister not allowed to play  hawk and alex go back through
     the doors

     the hallway above

     the cia bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer
     sound  kaplan and the candy bars giddily whoop as they
     rush through the smoking door

     the ballroomsecond level

     anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself
     in italian and amusingly imitating hawks condescension

                             anna
               you can be the lookout

     anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the mayflowers
     and the vips  she gasps and hurls herself behind the
     second level railing

     the ballroom floor

     a very dignified soviet leader in a shit happens baseball
     cap addresses darwin

                             soviet leader

     hawk and alex more frantically toil on the lock

                             hawk
               we all had our quarrels and
               parted

                             alex
               but well be the same as we started

     the lock clunks open  they race through the doors into

     int the art treasure room

     hawk and alex weave through the room which is crammed
     with little nuance to the gills with great art treasures
     including an impressive array of faberge eggs  a solid
     gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall

                             hawk and alex
               just traveling along singing a
               song  side

                             hawk

                             alex
               voila

     they rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room
     covered by a small curtain that has the da vinci man in
     the circle drawing emblazoned across it  hawk reaches
     for the curtain  alex puts his arm around him and speaks
     not sings

                             alex
               side by side man

     suddenly the roof above them explodes  kaplan and the
     candy bars drop down behind them

                             almond joy
               what the hell

                             snickers

                             kaplan

               quips the way you can hawk but
               i cant so ill just shoot alex

     kaplan point blank shoots alex in the chest  alex
     crumples backward moaning  butterfinger casually but
     with incredible strength holds hawks arms behind his
     back

                             hawk
               no

                             almond joy

               me of little eddie  but i digress
               ah victory is so sweet

     kaplan pulls back the da vinci curtain  nothing is there

     the ballroom banquet

     a soviet chef lifts up a silver domed serving tray
     revealing the da vinci helicopter model

                             minerva
               yum  this is the best meal i
               ever had

     anna

     bulges her eyes at the revelation  she pulls out alexs
     gun and bangs herself in the head  what to do

     the art treasures room

     kaplan is bugging out

                             kaplan
               damnit this isnt the plan

     they thunder out  hawk still in butterfingers
     oblivious clutches shouts

                             hawk
               cant you see the mayflowers
               doublecrossed you

     minerva and some various soviet vips spew their vodka to
     look up to anna pointing a gun down at them from the
     second level  she is shivering shaking the gun

                              anna

     hawk bounces up to savagely headbutt butterfinger
     butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the gold
     sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the
     ground pinning his head to the floor  the gold hammer
     next trembles off the wall and crushes butterfingers
     skull

                             hawk
               you want immature how bout an
               egg fight

     hawk flings a faberge egg smashing the gun out of kaplans
     hand  hawk pelts a batch more at him  kaplan sloppily
     whips some eggs back  hawk finally smashes one in half
     and beans the jagged piece into kaplans eye  he squeals
     to the ground geysering blood

     hawk swoops down to a wheezing breath controlling alex

                             hawk
               alex are you

                             alex

     the ballroom

     bullets stop splintering around anna at the railing as
     the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload

     snickers almond joy and kit kat race out of the hall
     way area into the ballroom area  they stop at the sight
     of anna

                             almond joy
               annabannanafofanna i guess i

     anna feebly raises her gun  almond joy laughs and
     pulls out a knife

                             almond joy
               you wont shoot  i read your
               dossier sister

     the soviet soldiers snap in new cartridges as almond joy
     moves out from behind the pillar towards anna  the
     soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure

     almond joy ruptures and vibrates in a sonny corleone
     ballet

                             almond joy
               i gotta get a new job

     snickers and kit kat militarily roll on either side of
     anna as their partner wilts to the ground  the men
     snickers with his miniuzi kit kat with his cross
     bow rifle briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers
     with some graphic success

     anna watches darwin and minerva head up the stairs to
     her level  she bolts off

     ballroom floor

     the last of the soviet vips flee as the soldiers tip
     over the m shaped table on its side using it for
     cover firing upward

     kit kat

     breaks off and scurries around the second level to get
     a position behind the m

     he fires down an arrow for a successful kill  another
     guard tries to fire up but kit kat impales him to the
     back of the table with a quality shot

     kit kat grins and reloads as alfred the butler regally
     creeps behind him

     hawk

     comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where
     anna is bustling  they hug

                             anna
               the mayflowers got

     hawk and anna turn to see the mayflowers hastening in
     their direction  noticing them back the modeltoting
     mayflowers halt

     kit kat

     turns to alfred and fires his crossbow  alfred effort
     lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues
     to move forward  still smiling kit kat tries to reload

     minerva

     breaks the standstill

                             darwin
               what a pleasant surprise  youre
               probably wondering

                             hawk
               but youre going to tell us
               anyway

                             minerva
               i hate a man with a sense of
               humor  while you corn dogs were
               comparing the lengths of your
               masculinity we obtained the
               helicopter the new fashioned
               way a thoroughly corrupt business
               deal

                             hawk
               if you think youre getting past
               me

     grunting behind them snickers gunbutts hawk to the
     ground

                             hawk
               dont be stupidthey

               american

                             hawk
               just shut up and hit me

     snickers swings a punch  hawk blocks it then whomps
     him in the chest

     as they battle darwin grabs annas hair slams her
     into a pillar and watches her crumple

     kit kat

     gets in an arrow but its too late  alfred stabs
     him deep deep deeply and lifts him from the ground

     a shower of cards reading ouch pain and this really
     hurts rain from out of kit kats coat

     alfred discards him over the edge

     kit kat sails down upon the m

     the lone card of fuck plops from his open eyed corpse

     hawk

     and snickers trades fierce blows stumbling down a
     staircase

     darwin

     and minerva watch the fight with amusement  alfred
     approaches

                             darwin
               alfred the getaway car

     snickers

     slashes hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade

                             hawk
               damnit i hate this  im a cat
               burglar  nobody said anything

                             snickers
               too bad

     snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the
     silencer time bombs suctions to his head

     hawk turns to see alex barely standing at the top of
     the stairs holding the strange rifle

     darwin and minerva turn to this dramatic entrance  they
     start to trot off

                             minerva
               i knew it  i told you it was a
               fake

     hawk

     boots snickers down the stairs  snickers somersaults
     up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb

     snickers wails to the soldiers who have lowered their
     guns and are poking their heads out of the m to watch

                             snickers
               help me you democratic reform

     the soldiers hightail it out  snickers plugs his ears
     nothing happens

                             snickers
               maybe it was just a

     snickers blows up gloriously before the m

     the staircase

     hawk bounds up to alex who puffs down onto the steps

                             alex
               get em  they went down the
               hallway

                             hawk

                             alex
               get em

     hawk rushes up the stairs gives a what can i do glance
     to the unconscious anna and then continues rushing past
     a pillar  minerva emerges from behind the pillar and
     moves forward

     the long enigmatic hallway

     hawk chugs beneath the lenin mural and down the hall
     way  he sees darwin breezing in front of him  darwin
     looks back to hawk then runs forward into the darkness

     the ballroom

     minera sits down next to the pained alex

                             minerva
               alex  hows it going

                             alex
               go go to hell to hell

     minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open

                             minerva
               wheres your insulinno  well
               bon appetite

     minerva savagely slams alexs head down and shoves the
     candy bar in his mouth

     the hallway

     hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the
     hallway when a oneeyed and bleeding george kaplan dives
     out of the art treasures room and tackles him  hawk
     kicks him off

                             hawk
               oh come on

     the ballroom

     alex gulps down the last of the candy bar shivering

                             minerva
               very good alex but you re
               still alive

     she pulls out another candy bar  alex with a last
     burst of strength punches her across the face

                             minerva
               thats fair

     the long hallway

     hawk and kaplan lock onto each others throats

                             hawk
               why does this have to be so hard

                             kaplan
               tell me about it

     suddenly of all things a car is heard rumbling in the
     darkness

     hawk and kaplan stop fighting and turn to see the may
     flower limousine screeching out of the darkness with
     darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun

     bullets fly around them  from his back pocket hawk
     slaps the nice picture of him and little eddie into
     kaplans hands

                             hawk
               take this to hell with you

     hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp

     deranged with confusion kaplan turns from the picture
     to the charging limousine

                             kaplan
               my pension

     the driving alfred smiles through the windshield

     kaplans body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash
     into the windshield

     hawks hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp

     passing beneath darwin raises up his gun

     hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on darwin
     locking his legs around his neck and crushing him
     down into

     the backseat of the limousine

     hawk and darwin grapple on the floor of the limo  the
     da vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat  darwins
     gun goes off

     right through alfreds throat  he slumps over pressing
     down on the accelerator

     the limousine

     blasts down the hallway sparking off the wall and
     bashing off paintings and mirrors

     the backseat

     darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side
     of hawks hand into its teeth

     outside the limousine

     a mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes
     a weird bloody line across the wall

     int backseat

     hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg
     lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the
     arm rest  hawk turns on the piercing siren and darwins
     eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream
     darwins entire body bucks wildly

     darwin backelbows hawk and moves down for his gun
     hawk pulls him back by his hair grabs him by the balls
     and pushes him upward through the sunroof

                             darwin
               goddamnit i only wanted to
               destroy the world in my own image
               im a regular joe

     darwin pounds his fists on hawks head as hawk hits the
     sunroof switch sliding it shut on darwin pinning
     his arms below the roof but leaving his torso twisting
     in the wind

     the mural of a happy lenin with his arms outstretched
     looms ahead waiting to greet darwin

     putting two and two together darwin loses it

                             darwin
               not lenin anybody but lenin  god
               lets talk abut this

     the limousine charges through the double doors and darwins
     body connects with the mural

     inside the limo

     hearing the crunch hawk flips into the front seat and
     brakes the vehicle  alfreds head bounces against the
     steering wheel  hawk reaches over with a grin and picks
     up the da vinci model  he looks to alfred kaplan
     crunched in the windshield and darwins dangling legs

                             hawk
               wow this is really gonna hurt the
               resale value

     the ballroom

     hawk runs up to a woozy anna and helps her up  she has
     a crossshaped blood stain on her forehead

                             hawk
               oh honey

     hawk looks to alex sitting on the stairs the same way
     he left him  hawk rushes to him

                             hawk
               we did it man we

     hawk grabs alexs shoulder  alex falls back  written
     over his face in red lipstick is really dead

     engaging a slow motion sequence minerva saunters behind
     anna putting on red lipstick  minerva slams her back
     to the ground

     hawk howls then turns to see stiffupperlip alfred
     bleeding from the neck  hawk tries to throw a punch
     but alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face

     the da vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs
     in slow motion and cracks open revealing the intricate
     mirror of the opening scene

     int dark room atop mayflower museumday

     a damaged hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles
     to some shutters  o solo mio returns on the sound
     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of vinci

     hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music  a
     slightly more composed anna touches his shoulder causing
     him to jump slightly  they melt into a kiss

                             anna
               oh hudson

                             hawk
               i told you not to call me hudson
               the only people who called me that
               were the nuns at

                             anna
               oh hudson im a sister of the
               catholic church as well as an
               agent

                             hawk
                       cutoff laugh
               this is too bad to be false

     alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a
     bandage around his neck  his voice is strange but still
     polite

                             alfred
               welcome back to vinci

                             hawk
               last rites sister

                             anna
               please no nun jokestheyre a
               bad habit to get intoget it

     hawk and anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause

                              hawk
               she killed alex

     alfred gives them a push

     int the da vinci workshop

     alfred leads them through the da vinci workshop past the
     bat winged glider and incongruously crammedin tennis ball
     machine

     int the room of the gold machineday

     alfred grandly opens doubledoors to reveal that da
     vincis gold machine has been majestically recreated
     piece by piece  in the periphery the 90s rears its
     head in the form of three technicians wearing headsets
     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals

                              minerva os
               goldfiinger

     hawk and anna turn to see minerva splashily enter in
     sexy funeralwear

                              minerva
               sorry i couldnt resist  youre
               probably wondering why youre
               still alive  anna

     as minerva speaks technician one forcibly escorts anna
     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly
     handcuffs her to it

                              minerva
               i want you to monitor the da
               vincis directions from the
               apprentice diary  and hawk i
               didnt want you to go to hell
               without knowing that darwin and
               is dream came true
                       suddenly sheepish
               beside that none of us can seem
               to put that damn crystal together
               alfie and i were up all night with
               the thing

     technician two commences a forcible escort of hawk to the
     gold machine  hawk coldcocks him to the ground

                              hawk
               you killed a friend  why should i

     anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her  she pulls
     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror
     over the scribblings  reading off the reflection her
     eyes widen

                              anna
               do it  theres no reason to fight
               anymore  shes a force of nature

     trying to get a grip on annas words hawk lets himself
     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that
     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror

                              minerva
               if you pull this off i cant
               promise i wont kill you  i mean
               who we trying to kid  but i will
               spare the flying nun here

                              hawk
               and to think i thought you were
               evil incarnate in pumps

                              minerva
               i killed some lovable working
               class italiandiabetic but you
               killed the most significant male
               figure of the decade and a kind
               gentle lover  so dont play with
               me

     minerva flicks a switch on the stand annas handcuffed
     to  anna vibrates being electrocuted

                              hawk
               okay fine

     minerva switches it off  giving himself a head rub hawk
     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects  he
     tangles and bends and with a loud snap puts them
     together forming the crystal from the opening scene
     minerva snatches it from him and puts on a headset

                              minerva
               oh hawk dont ever change  go
               team go

     minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as da
     vinci had it in his machine

     using a long steel pole technician one adjusts a myriad
     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series
     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine

     technicians two blackeyed and three pour various
     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart
     ments on the machine beautifully decorated by the
     chemicals zodiac sign

     alfred places a lead bar in its proper place

     hawk glides to anna and undoes her handcuff

                              hawk
               i hope you know what

                              anna
               trust leonardo

                              hawk
               wha

     anna puts her fingers on his lips

     minerva throws a lever  steam begins to percolate from
     the furnace towards the machine

                              minerva
                       into the headset
               were for real

     the machine

     begins to rotate at first clunkily then faster
     the crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment

     the machine throws out its folding arms each with an
     element  the arms click higher

     the goggled technicians stand before a timecoded video
     monitor taking notes

     the chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to
     spill and drop through brass tubes

     anna

     murmurs to hawk

                              anna
               da vinci made the real directions
               in a secret script that i decoded
               the way the machine is running
               now the gold will produce too
               quickly clog and the machine
               will shut itself down  isnt it
               wonderful

                              hawk
               yeah but what would happen if that
               little mirror came out of the
               crystal

                              anna
               wha  you dont want to know

     hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket

                              hawk
               i wanna know

                              anna
               holy shhthings are going to
               get very interesting very fast
               da vinci would be proud of you

     in the machine

     the chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
     lead bar spinning its trough  theres a flash and a
     controlled but jarring explosion

     everyone

     doubletakes  hawk reaches down to the six foot steel
     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three
     deep in concentration technicians to the ground

     oblivious to the violence behind her minerva pulling
     on goggles over her headset moves closer with a
     religious purr

     the machine

     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around
     the mirrors faster and faster circling the room

     outside the machine

     hawk and anna squint blinded  flinging off her goggles
     a literally beaming minerva giggles forward

     the machine

     beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into
     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar

     minerva

     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and
     molten  she moves closer shouting into her headset

                              minerva
               eureka motherfuckers

     the machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive
     pace

     hawks voice suddenly comes on minervas headset

                              hawks voice headset
               minnie hate to interrupt your
               orgasm but

     hawk and anna

     stand above the unconscious technicians  hawk is on
     headset

                              hawk
               me anna and leonardo just wanna
               say you got the midas touch baby

     machine

     minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion

     the center of the machine blows  the pool of molten gold
     rockets at the viewer

     mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls

     minerva tumbles from the machine screaming that is to
     say trying to scream because molten gold covers her
     face  it bubbles and cascades turning her into a
     bizarrely beautiful echo of nefertiti

     hawk and anna

     turn to retreat and see standing in the mouth of the
     open double doors in an open shirt wearing indian war
     paint on his face and the words rule britannia painted
     on his chest alfred

                              alfred
               how

                              hawk
               youre unemployed alfie  boss
               is dead  her plan is over

                              alfred
                       strange voiced
               my plan is just beginning  ill
               forgive you for denying me the
               pleasure of slaughtering my
               boorish employers but im afraid
               the birth of the new british
               empire can have no witnesses

                              hawk
               oohkay

     alfred rushes forward with a howl  hawk meets him
     halfway  they trade savage punches and then lock onto
     each others throats

     anna pulls a gun from a technicians holster and prays
     for forgiveness  she aims steadily and fires

     right into hawks arm  this allows alfred to knock him
     back with a strong punch

                              anna
               sorry

     she fires again  the bullet pings off hawks belt buckle

                              hawk
               stop helping me  thou shalt not
               kill

     hawks turning to chastize anna allows alfred to kick
     hawk back against a wall  alfred lunges out with his
     blade hitting the wall offangle  hawk yanks the shaft
     alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on hawks
     throat

     gasping hawk looks to a rip in alfreds shirt and sees
     a hinge and lever on the shaft  with an all or nothing
     jerk hawk flicks the lever  the shaft clicks on the
     hinge

     alfreds greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
     away from hawk and suddenly it isalfredsthroat which
     is caught in the vshaped trap  the momentum of the
     sudden change makes alfred stumble towards the wall until
     the point of the v hits it

                              hawk
               dont lose your head over this

     hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a babe ruth
     swing right onto the v  the blades slam together and
     pop alfreds head off sending it screaming disembodied
     high in the air

     alfreds screaming head pov

     hawk and anna are seen waving up to the viewer alfies
     head

                              hawk
               excuse my crass american humor

     the machine thunders with another explosion

     the da vinci workshop

     hawk and anna rush into the da vinci workshop  she
     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm  he
     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he
     sees

     bunny the dog standing in the open mouth of the
     workshop  anna turns to hawk

                              anna
               allow me

     anna confidently moves toward the dog until bunny leaps
     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
     her crashing to the ground

     hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun

     bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
     anna blood gently starts to emerge

     hawk cant get off a shot  he throws down the gun in
     exasperation  it lands next to the gadget that is
     connected to the tennis ball machine  hawk rushes
     forward picks up the gadget turns the dial to ten and
     then smiles sweetly toward the dog

                              hawk
               oh bunny ballball

     bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up
     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth

     hawk slams down on the gadget

     a tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine

     bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
     of it sends him flying and crashing out a window

     hawk pulls up anna as the machine completely explodes

     a huge chunk of the roof thuds before the workshop door

     hawk suddenly looks offcamera and smiles  anna shakes
     her head vigorously  he pulls her out of the frame

     ext a vinci countryside tree

     a man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat  it is the
     traveling juggler with the unforgettably etched face

     he pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule
     he begins a stoic juggle when another loud boom sends him
     to the ground

     ext outside the grand castleday

     an explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows
     debris frisbees toward the camera along with

     anna hanging on hawks waist and hawk hanging from
     the bar on da vincis bat winged glider

     the glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle 
     through the glorious vista

     ext the road to the castle

     the glider floats to a perfect landing before the
     unforgettable juggler

                             juggler
                         che pazzo

     hawk and anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
     billowing castle  they smile and gush in relief  they
     wrap arms around the confused but warming up juggler and
     laugh again

     a small piazza

     the mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
     of dawn  hawk anna and the unforgettable juggler ride
     atop it

     a woman with an unforgettably etched face moves to a cafe
     table with a luminous smile  she unfolds a table cloth
     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos

     hawk and anna dismount thank the juggler then cozy into
     the table

                             hawk
               have i ever told you the world is

               hudson im afraid im sticking
               with god
                       smiling
               but youre a close second tough
               guy  what is that smile

                             hawk
                       broadly grinning
               i got my planet back

     hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
     the ones da vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup

                             hawk
               the first ones for alex  cheers

     the viewers viewpoint moves into hawks lips having a
     sip of that damn unmasculine european coffee

                                                fade outthe end
