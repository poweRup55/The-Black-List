               through a break in the trees we catch an occasional glimpse 
               of a prostrate form on the ground as the circling camera 
               gets closer we see that the form is a human body

                                                                    cut to

               a bead of sweat trickles down her cheek then a blinding 
               flash of light obliterates her face

                         until quite recently i believed myself

                         where i got the idea that maybe the

                         about killing myself with a razor 
                         blade

               on the shelf next to the tub a little gray mouse watches her 
               intently at first she is startled but then she and the 
               creature seem to be communing his little black beady eyes 
               reflect the light lila starts to cry she puts down the

                         its my thesis that if table manners 
                         can be taught to mice they can be 
                         taught to humans

                         going out on a limb arent you 
                         nathan

                                     nathan
                              speech
                         the truth is most people dont have 
                         table manners today and when the 
                         foundations of civilized society 
                         crumble and disappear civilized 
                         society in its entirely follows 
                         closely at its heels

                                     lila
                         im not sure

                                     nathan
                              stridently
                         courtesy decorum manners are all 
                         sadly lacking from our daily 
                         intercourse rudeness vulgarity 
                         meanness are the norm

                         ergo if i can teach table manners to 
                         mice i can teach them to humans if 
                         i can teach table manners to humans 
                         i can save the world

                         i began going to a therapist when i 
                         was in my thirties because i felt

                         and do you think maybe this early 
                         childhood indoctrination has something 
                         to do with your interest in table 
                         manners in the present

               nathan thinks long and hard about this he seems to be really

               nathan also in a lab coat is hovering over a lucite 
               encasement inside we see two white mice both attached to 
               electrodes they sit in little chairs at a little table in 
               front of each of them is a little plate of salad and three 
               forks of varying size under lucite domes

               nathan nods to his pretty french assistant gabrielle who 
               presses a button the lucite domes over the salads lift

               tentatively both mice reach for a fork there is a tiny piece 
               of velcro on each mouses paw and a tiny piece of velcro on 
               each of the forks the first mouse picks the correct fork 
               and stabs it into the salad and eats happily relieved the 
               second mouse picks the wrong fork nathan presses a button 
               which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric 
               shock the correct mouse keeps eating unconcerned nathan 
               makes a note in his notebook

               gabrielle watches nathan as he writes enchanted

                         to be gibberish later i learned it 
                         was english now i wonder if perhaps

                         live in the woods because theyre 
                         antisocial lila we have to respect 
                         that

               lila trudges through the brush nathan follows better than 
               being left behind

               she is tracking she sniffs the breeze cocks her head moves 
               stealthily then she sheds her clothes almost shaking them 
               off like a dog shaking off some cute costume his owner had 
               dressed him in

               lila turns her head and glares at nathan there is an animal 
               fierceness in her eye that shuts him up instantly

               she turns back to pursue her prey

               we are with lila she creeps along when suddenly a tan 
               muscular figure tears out from behind a tree and runs 
               practically on all fours through the dense underbrush

               lila follows almost as agile as the forest creature

               nathan just stands there the chase continues there is a 
               great deal of heaving and panting puff shimmies up a large 
               tree lila follows puff leaps from branch to branch

               lila follows easily puff swings from a vine so does lila 
               finally they come to the end of the trees a clearing there 
               is no nowhere for puff to leap lila is with him in the tree 
               they are crouched bloody heaving on separate branches 
               staring at each other after a long moment lila speaks

                                     lila
                         who are you

               puff cocks his head the high timbre of her voice surprises 
               him pleases him but he doesnt understand the words

               puff looks at his crotch apparently there is some activity 
               down there lila following his eyes glances down there 
               also

                                     lila

                         language

               puff grabs for his crotch and begins to play with himself 
               distractedly looking at her all the while he falls out of 
               the tree lila gasps branches crack and snap as he passes 
               through them and then there is an unpleasant thud when he 
               hits the forest floor lila shimmies down the tree and kneels 
               by puff he is unconscious

                                     lila

                         belonging to something a person or

                         we are communal creatures this poor 
                         soul has no one nothing

                         say isnt that a beautiful sunset 
                         to it becomes meaningless just 
                         another stupid sunset they happen 
                         everyday so what

               lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both 
               mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating nathan

               his own clothing the wires after surveying the scene for a 
               moment puff becomes frightened and agitated

               into it again and again he tears at his diaper nathan 
               gives a nod to gabrielle who presses a button on a panel

               an electric shock sends puff flying he lies on the floor 
               confused and dazed after a moment he gets up and again 
               crashes into the lucite nathan gives the signal to gabrielle 
               and once again she shocks puff he once again gets up and 
               crashes against the lucite again he is shocked he gets up 
               again and is about to crash against the lucite but he thinks 
               better of it and squats in place immobilized

                         and i think i understood from that 
                         moment that in order to get some i 
                         would have to do what they said in 
                         order to experience this primal 
                         basic animal thing i would first 
                         have to become a civilized prissy

               a distance puff pulls himself out of the hug but still 
               rests his hands on nathans shoulders and looks him in the 
               eye almost like a lover then he parts with nathan and goes
