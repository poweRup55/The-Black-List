		research in berkeley california made a significant 
		stride forward by manipulating the genetic 
		information in a common blood cell and infusing it 
		with the characteristics of a potent virus they were 
		able to create a biological warrior cellthe viragene 
		once introduced into a host the viragene could hunt 
		and obliterate the bodys natural enemiestumors

the video image turns to static


int  nevilles house  day

robert neville switches off the video camera pointed at him  he collapses 
the tripod and rests the apparatus in a corner  he wears shorts a tshirt 
tennis shoes  he slices a cd into an impressive music system and mahlers 
resurrection symphony blasts from speakers throughout the house


int  nevilles house  exercise room  day

a serious workout facility  weights boxers heavy bag rowing machine etc  
neville pushes himself through a series of strenuous exercises  his body is 
in fantastic shape  taught muscle  lean not bulky  his movements are 
lithe almost graceful  more track athlete than body builder


int  nevilles house  shower  day

neville washes his body and we notice the scars  on his ankles wrists 
neck stomach back  a few are the results of crude stitches the others  
bite marks   scratches 


int  nevilles house  library  day

neville passes shelves filled with compact discs audio cassettes and 
videotapes  another section filled with books and paintings  only a 
carefully selected few hang on the wallsdegas klee rothko van gogh  the 
rest are stacked like pallets  they must be copies  mustnt they

a television gives us the today show a radio nprs morning edition 
resurrection in the background  a wall of sound  the sound of everyday 
life  normal life neville descends a spiral staircase leading to the ground 
floor


int  nevilles house  greenhouse  day

neville strolls the aisles of a hothouse  vegetables fruit herbs 
potatoes  all in carefully compartmentalized lots  panes of glass on the 
roof allow in sunlight

neville notices a loose screw on a shutter and pulls a square of metal from 
his pocket  its an allinonetoolsomething neville is never without  
only two inchesbytwo inches it has a screwdriver tip a serrated saw 
edge a knife edge magnifying glass etc

neville tightens the screw holds the tool in his teetha habitand makes 
sure the window is shut tight  neville picks a few strawberries checks the 
condition of a tomato plant and trims a vine with the knife side of the 
tool


int  nevilles house  kitchen  day

neville sits at a table eating a bowl of oatmeal with fresh sstrawberries 
sipping a cup of coffee  on a wall mounted television katie couric and 
bryant gumbel  neville watches 
with an almost disturbing gaze  he mouths along with them somehow 
anticipating the live 
dialogue

				neville  katie
		and for those of us whod like to lose a 
		few pounds dr art ulene will be here to 
		tell us about his new weight loss plan

if we paid attention wed notice the information contained in the tv show 
and radio broadcast is old and familiar  we know these stories  theres 
nothing new about the news

outside we hear a dog barking

neville enters a room adjacent to the kitchena stateoftheart medical 
facility operating table pharmacy ivs ekg surgical equipment you name 
it  he uses a hypodermic to withdraw blood from his arm  he fills two 
plastic vials and tosses the syringe into a biohazard waste bin


int  nevilles house  bedroom  day

spartan  bed reading lamp a few books  a photo of his wife and child on 
the wall an historical painting showing napoleons surrender at waterloo  
nearby within a seconds grasp from bedside are a shotgun and a 44 magnum

at a closet filled with very few clothesall the same typeneville loses 
the robe and steps into a black tightfitting bodysuit  similar to a divers 
wetsuit but the material is more flexible  its some type of protective 
undergarment composed of a kevlarlike mesh

he dons a kevlar vest a work shirt and durable pants  he slips on combat 
boots tucks the pants into them and tapes them  he adds a utility belt 
and fits the blood vials into a secure pouch  he straps on two wristwatches 
and chains an electronic pocket watch to his belt  again the dog barks 
outside

				neville
		all right all right  keep your fur on

he picks up a remote control and switches off the tv radio and music  its 
replaced by an eerie silence


int  nevilles house  garage  day

a nofrills underground garage  a land rover sports car and motorcycle 
now shut off the walls are lined with halogen lamps neville walks to an 
electronic control panel and hits a button  the garage door opens but it 
doesnt open vertically  instead a horizontal panel slides back parallel 
with the earths surface revealing a slanted cement ramp leading to the 
garage below

sunlight pours in from above  the dog barks  a muscular canine silhouetted 
at the top  neville whistles  the dog bounds down the ramp delighted to 
see its master  neville reacts coldly  no hi boy how ya doin 
nothing  we know the dog wants a reaction but neville is firm  he opens a 
cabinet grabs a bag and pours some chow  the dog hungrily devours his 
breakfast and neville sees the bag is empty  he opens another and finds its 
crawling with ants

				neville
		terrific

he dumps the infested bag into a trash container  neville whistles and 
points to the land rover  the dog leaps into the vehicle  neville shuts the 
passenger door and we see the rover has been customized  the roof hood 
doors and trunk are crisscrossed with barbed wire  all windowssave the 
windshield and that is protected by chicken wirehave been replaced by 
thick metal plates  slits are cut into the steel but visibility is limited


int  land rover  day

neville climbs behind the wheel  the interior of the vehicle is outfitted 
with emergency medical supplies flares heavyduty flashlights lamps rope 
wire tools  the dog settles an a blanket an the floor  neville hits a few 
switches and closedcircuit monitors flicker to life  via video they show 
the side and rear views from the land rover  neville starts her up and the 
soupedup engine roars to life  we stay within the land rover as it ascends 
the ramp

				neville
			donning sunglasses
		another beautiful day


ext  city street  day

the land rover speeds along  we vaguely recognize the road as one of streets 
of san francisco but somethings wrong  the road is in great disrepair and 
littered with debris  the trees are barren the area deathly silent and 
there is absolutely no other traffic


int  land rover  day

neville continues to listen to resurrection an the rovers cd player  he 
spots a driveway and turns into it


ext  radio station  day

high on a hill sits an abandoned broadcasting facility and tower  this too 
is in utter disrepair  the land rover is parked outside the dog an guard  
a desolate wind whistles


int  radio station  basement  day

very familiar with the equipment neville connects wires throws switches 
and powers up the emergency generator


int  radio station  dj booth  control room  day

neville adjusts the mixing panel and takes a seat behind a microphone 
throughout this scene we will notice that the radio station looks like a 
tornado blew through it

				neville
		good morning san francisco  big bob neville 
		here with you this morning as i am every morning  
		monday through sunday seven days a week three 
		hundred and sixty five fucking days a year  traffic  
		there is none  weather  who cares  news  im still 
		alive  what about you san francisco  how bout 
		giving me a call  1800fuckyou

he glances to his right  the telephone switchboard panel is shattered dead 
covered with dust

				neville
		wow  the boards lit up like a christmas tree  
		too bad our time is up  if you would like to see 
		me in the flesh however ill be doing a personal 
		appearance this afternoon at golden gate park  
		today and every day  12 noon  all you have to do 
		is show up dead air  please  more silence then 
		pops a tape cart into a player  i leave you today 
		with one of my favorites  i know youre sick of the 
		fact that i only play classical music but frankly i dont 
		care  i like it  and right now thats all that matters

an eric satie piano concerto  melancholy and haunting


ext  downtown streets various  day

music continues as the land rover cruises through the heart of the city  we 
dont spend much time here and its frustrating because we cant fully 
comprehend the visual makeup of downtown  the streets are deserted litter 
and dust blow freely with the wind and the buildings look ravaged  looted  
burned  destroyed by earthquake


ext  pet store  day

neville and the dog exit the rover and for the first time we notice neville 
wears a shoulder holster containing a 45 automatic and carries an m16 
machine gun  a highintensity flashlight is attached to the machine gun 
barrel and extra ammo clips taped to its handle


int  pet store  day

merchandise is scattered on the floorchew toys plastic bones etcand 
the dog is drawn to it  neville whistles and the dog obeys disappointed  
neville switches on the flashlight and heads for a storage room


int  pet store  storage room  day

neville kicks in the door  the flashlight beam dances to all corners  
nothing but old supplies  the dog prances in and leads neville to the bags 
of chow  he hefts them onto his shoulder  whistles  the dog doesnt 
follow  his vision is locked on a thick piece of rawhide  he turns his sad 
eyes to neville who gives in nods  the dog happily grabs it between his 
teeth


ext  golden gate park  day

the monuments still remain but the grass is scorched tall and dry  
neville eats a sandwich he made at home and the dog chews the rawhide  
neville checks his watch 1245  scans the area  absolutely no one in 
sight  forlornly he stares at the ground the cracks in the pavement 
alone


ext  downtown street  day

the streets are abandoned buildings deserted  the land rover parked at an 
intersection the dog on lookout  neville stands beneath a lamp post a coil 
of wire over his shoulder  he measures a length tosses it over the arm of 
the post and creates an oldfashioned snape out of the cable  he adjusts 
tightens and pulls one of the vials of blood from his utility belt  he 
takes a rag douses it with the blood and positions it as bait in the 
snare  satisfied with the trap he whistles for the dog and returns to the 
land rover


ext  another street  day

neville sets another snare


ext  department store  day

the land rover pulls to a stop in front of what used to be niemanmarcus  
right now it looks like a ghetto tenement


int  land rover  day

nevilles eyes are glued to something across the street 


ext  street  day

a body dangles from one of nevilles trapsone he must have set a previous 
day  it hangs limply ankle ensnared by the cable its head hanging a few 
feet above the ground


ext  land rover  street  day

with the dog at his heels neville chambers a round in the 45 and approaches 
the body

another angle

quite abruptly we are watching neville from across the street high above 
from a sixth or seventh story window  we hear movement and labored 
breathing

back on the street

neville reaches the body and spins it around  as soon as he sees the face of 
a mannequin he knows hes fucked

the high angle

we hear a bolt slide on a rifle and we realize were watching neville through 
a snipers scope  nevilles chest dead in our sights  we fire

back on the street

neville hits the dirt  the first bullet explodes in asphalt  neville rolls  
the second bullet just misses him  he dashes behind an abandoned car 
escaping yet another shot from the sniper  the dog stands in the middle of 
the street barking at an upper story window in niemanmarcus  neville 
shouts

				neville
		get out of the street

the dog continues to  its eyes on a specific section of the building  
neville steals a glance and sees a rifle barrel poking out of a shattered 
window frame  another shot whistles past the dogs fur  the beast flinches 
afraid

				neville
		get over here

he waves his arm and the dog comes running to his side  he pulls the dog 
close to him sheltering him from the gunfire

				neville
		dumbest goddamm dog i ever had

blam  a bullet hits the car  neville is pinned down

				neville
		great bob just great

he looks at the pistol in his hand  its useless against a rifle  and 
unfortunately the machine gun is in the land rover  he cant make a move  
unless

along the curb hidden from the snipers view is a storm drain  neville 
inches his way toward it and slithers inside  the dog tries to follow but 
neville motions for him to stay and speak  the dog understands and barks at 
the sniper


int  storm drain tunnel  day

crouching down neville is able to scurry to the other side of the street  
he inches his way through a crevice


int  department store  day

neville crawls into a dilapidated bathroom in the stores first basement  
the plumbing  has been backed up for god knows how long and neville can 
barely tolerate the stench


int  department store  first basement  day

what used to be housewares neville spies the nolongerfunctioning 
escalators and strides upwards


int  department store  escalators  various  day

neville reaches the fourth floor  we catch glimpses of bizarre graffiti but 
mostly were taken aback by the sheer emptiness of the store


int  department store  seventh floor  day

neville creeps up the escalator  he hears the sniper but its difficult to 
see anything because the windows in this section have been covered with 
sheets of cardboard blankets and plywood  the only light is a tiny shaft 
coming through the cracked pane the shooter is using for his rifle

the shooter himself is bundled in rags  gloves cover his hands a parka hood 
hides his head and a scarf shields his face  we see no details only a 
shape in a corner is a sort of tent made from bedsheets and blankets

the sniper watches the street  faintly we hear the dog barking  the sniper 
shoots  a distant pingthe bullet hits the abandoned car  neville gauges 
his surroundings his enemy  thinks  positions himself about twenty feet 
behind the sniper  locks target with the 45

				neville
		hey

the sniper jumps turns around and shakes in his shoes at the sight of 
neville  he fumbles with the rifle

				neville
		ahahah

the sniper stops  its no usehed never be quick enough

				neville
		slide the gun over here

the sniper has no choice  he sets the rifle on the floor and shoves it at 
neville who quickly examines it

				neville
		a hunters gun  whered you find it

no reply  neville points the 45 shoots and blasts the window behind the 
shooter  glass explodes and sunlight pours into the room  the sniper 
screams with fright and scurries for darkness  neville aims his pistol at 
another window

				neville
			a threat
		where

				sniper
			his voice a raspy hiss
		up north  in the mountains a cabin

				neville
		youre not part of cortmans bunch

				sniper
		who

				neville
		never mind  in the mountains 
		were there people  like me

				sniper
		if there were we wouldnt have had to 
		come to the city now would we

				neville
		youre a smart one

				sniper
		thank you

				neville
		you said we

the sniper realizes his error  goes tightlipped

				neville
		how many

no answer  neville flips back the top of the tent and sees three sleeping 
areas

				neville
		where are they

the sniper refuses to respond  neville blasts another window  more light  
like a snake escaping a predator the sniper slithers away but neville 
pounces on him and jams the 45 into the center of his back  he pins one arm 
and extends the shooters other arm into the path of the light

				sniper
		no

the sniper is in agony

				neville
		tell me

frustrated neville pulls off the mans glove  first we see that the flesh 
is pale white  so pale its almost translucent  second we see the effect 
of sunlightthe skin blisters and blackens

				neville
		where are they

the sniper screams  neville releases him and he hides in the shadows 
caressing his tortured limb  the sniper decides to pull off his hood and 
remove the scarf revealing

a demonic visage  ghostly white flesh so devoid of pigment we can see the 
blue and purple veins beneath the surface  his eyes are an unearthly cold 
bluegrey and white  he is completely hairlessnothing on his pate no 
brows no facial hair  his lips a deep ruby red  this thing was once human 
but now now

				sniper
			somewhat awed
		youre him arent you  youre neville

neville reaches into his belt and takes out a vial of blood  the snipers 
eyes light up

				neville
		where are they

the sniper is mesmerized by the blood

				sniper
			cant help himself
		the bay        the basement

				neville
		i was in the basement

				sniper
		down   below   by the   subway

				neville
		do they have guns

he wont answer  neville pours a few drops of blood and steps back  
thirstily the sniper laps it up with his tongue like a cat to some spilled 
cream  neville looks away  the sniper falls back onto a pile of rags and 
lets his fix kick in  his body spasms and his face contorts  the snipers 
arm jerks and he lets out a satisfied breath  a junkie feeling the high

				sniper
		we heard about you  way up in the hills
		we heard about you


miraculously the snipers charred hand begins to heal

				neville
		your friends  guns

				sniper
		no  we found only the rifle

his hand forms a fist  a sinister unearthly hiss emerges from his gullet  
he looks at the vial in nevilles hand

				sniper
		more

				neville
		youll get more if you tell me the truth

				sniper
		more

and something dark something terrible fills the snipers eyes  he lunges at 
neville  blam  blam  blam  neville pounds him with three bullets  two in 
the stomach  one in the shoulder  blood spatters  the sniper teeters but 
does not fall  neville aims at the heart and fires but his weapon is empty  
he mutters shit hastily loads a clip  the sniper clutches at his wounds 
kneels and touches the floor with his finger  he takes a deep breath and 
enters into some kind of meditative trance  he summons

the scattered drops of his blood heed his call  like droplets of mercury 
drawn to a common source the blood moves across the floor and flows up his 
finger into the open bullet wounds  and heals them

				neville
		that was clever the mannequin  that
		took some thought  you nearly had me

click  neville jams in the clip  the sniper moves  pow  pow  pow  pow 
only this time neville aims at the windows  glass shatters and a wall of 
light pours in hitting the sniper like a freight train

				sniper
		noooooooooo

the skin on the snipers face blisters  smoke rises from beneath his 
protective clothes he howls  neville with intense calm holsters his 45 
and raises the rifle

				neville
		you know i can understand me but why 
		shoot at the dog  what did that dog ever do 
		to you

the sniper staggers toward neville one last attack  neville shoots hits 
the sniper square in the chest  the force of the blast propels him backward 
to the open windows  the sniper slips on the broken glass and falls

 out the window  seven stories to the street below

neville moves to the window locks at the snipers body on the concrete  the 
dog emerges from behind the abandoned car sniffs in the direction of the 
corpse and looks up at neville in the window  neville shouts down

				neville
		stay away from him  you stay away

the dog sits

				neville
		good boy


ext  department store  day

a bandana acting as a mask on his face neville pulls a spare gas can from 
the rear of the land rover and douses the snipers corpse blackening in the 
sun with fuel  he ignites a book of matches tosses them at the body and 
whooshinstant funeral pyre

neville reaches into a supply chest in the rear of the land rover  he pulls 
out a mean looking more powerful machine gun two ammo clips a portable 
highintensity halogen lamp a combat knife three small electronic devices 
and a customized remote control  he hangs a pair of nightvision goggles 
around his neck and instructs the dog

				neville
		come


int  department store  subbasement  day

neville walks past rusting generators to a collapsed wall which connects the 
store to an old subway tunnel  the flashlight on the barrel of the machine 
gun illuminates the path  the halogen lamp is strapped to his shoulder but 
for now its switched off  neville allows the dog to sniff a rag taken from 
the snipers tent having the scent the dog proceeds into the tunnel 
prior to following neville fixes one of the small electronic devices to the 
to the wall


int  subway tunnel  day

a dank dark creepy place  no more electricity to feed the lights or 
tracks  neville paces himself behind the dog flashlight illuminating old 
cigarette ads a 49ers billboard a pile of cat and rat skeletons the rails 
more graffiti

which we now see more clearly  this isnt the creation of homeboy 
gangbangers it is fierce and savage in its beauty  wild symbols patterns 
and colors  majestic  tribal  neville has seen it many times before and 
doesnt like it  it spells trouble  he stops and attaches another 
electronic device to an overhead pipe

the dog stops and utters a soft bark in the direction of a wrecked subway car 
spilled on the tracks ahead  neville shuts off the flashlight and dons the 
nightvision goggles  he raises his finger to his lips and the dog knows to 
proceed quietly  neville attaches the final electronic device to the door 
leading to the car and silently enters


int  subway car  day

through the greenish tint of the goggles we scan the interior  ripped 
seats trash and in one corner a human form  an emaciated corpse  
stripped naked every ounce of blood drained  a festering bullet wound in 
the chest the skin punctured by teeth marks on its chest an elaborate 
tribal design much like the graffiti somehow raised from the skin similar 
to a cattle brand

neville checks out the opposite end  sleeping there are two forms  
breathing  he removes the goggles and motions for the dog to move back  he 
readies his weapon with one hand and reaches back with the other 
igniting

the halogen lamp  instantly bright white light floods the compartment  the 
two figures stir awake and screech

				neville
		dont move

but they do not listen  instead they reach into their bedding pull out two 
handguns and fire

not what neville expected  as bullets whiz past he unleashes the machine 
gun firing a spray across the car  one of the sleepers bullets takes out 
the halogen  it shatters burning nevilles cheek  more gunfire  is he 
hit

neville falls back  a firefight in close quarters is not what he wants  he 
maneuvers back into the tunnel  takes cover behind a pile of rubble and 
finds the dog already there

				neville
		never believe them robert never

blam  blam  bullets explode in the wall near his head  he sneaks a peek 
and sees the two sleepers firing at him from inside the train  neville 
reaches into his belt and pulls out the customized remote  he presses one of 
the buttons and kablam  the car is rocked with a small explosion  the door 
is torn from its mooring and one of the sleepers is ripped apart the wounded 
sleeper howls with pain and falls to the
tunnel floor barely able to keep his body from splitting in half  
amazingly hes still alive

blam  the other ones still shooting  neville takes cover  the second 
sleeper exits the car and tends to its wounded comrade  both are the same 
type of creature as the sniper but this one the living one is female  her 
dying partner a male is finished  she caresses his face then buries her 
mouth in an open wound infusing herself  dark blood covers her chin and 
chest but as she walks the liquid crawls across her skin into her mouth  
it seems to give mass and power to her body and rich color to her translucent 
skin

she raises her gun  neville ducks just as she fires  beep beep beep  his 
electronic stopwatch sounds an alarm  he switches it off and looks at the 
sunlight pouring into the tunnel  its quality slowly starting to shift

movement both neville and the female react to sounds behind them past the 
wrecked subway car  neville knows whats coming  far in the distance we 
see more forms  what could be an army  he and the dog race to the crumbled 
wall of the department store  the female screeches and gives chase  shes 
very fast like a panther  neville glances up runs presses the remote

the second device explodes collapsing the roof of the tunnel  pipes 
concrete dirtit all cascades down  a shaft of light be in from the street 
above stopping the female dead in her tracks  the light separates her from 
neville and she does not like it  frustrated she snarls


int  department store  sub basement  day

neville helps the dog through the hole and heads for the
escalator presses the remote  the third device explodes
sealing shut the connection from the store to the tunnel


ext  department store  day

neville and the dog hurriedly enter the land rover haphazardly tossing 
supplies and weapons into the rear  neville starts the vehicle and checks 
the sky  must be about an hour before sunset


ext  san francisco  day

the land rover zips down california street and we pull back far back 
revealing the scope and breadth of the city

san francisco has been raped mutilated and murdered  buildings burned 
streets littered with rusting cars trees and grass dry dead  no bombs were 
droppedtoo  y of the structures are intactinstead it feels as though 
something sinister and insidious rotted the place from the inside out

most startling is the golden gate bridge  barricades barbed wire empty 
national guard tanksall scattered about like a childs toys it looks like 
a war zone  the bridge itself is charred and torn unstable swaying in the 
wind


ext  chinatown  day

this area too has been ravaged  wind kicks up leaflets  the
land rover speeds through kicking up the old papers  close
on a leaflet as it sails to the ground  it reads

you are not alone i am a survivor just like you i will help you 				can trust me  there is hope

				my name is robert

meet me in golden gate park  portals of the past  12 noon
midday  every day  when the sun is highest in the sky

					please

the leaflet is yellowed and dirty  these things have been floating around 
for a long time


ext  hill district day

land that once held the beautiful homes of pacific heights nob hill and 
russian hill now looks like terrain in bosnia or the surface of the moon  
atop one of the hills still stands one edificenevilles house  the land 
rover climbs


int  land rover  day

neville presses a remote garage door opener


ext  nevilles house  day

the vehicle slows outside a massive gate fashioned out of wrought iron 
corrugated steel and barbed wire  it wheels open allows entry then clangs 
shut once the rovers inside

pull back to reveal the rest of the house

a turnofthecentury house  the kind you cant find in other cities  from 
a distance it almost locks normal but normal it is not  every window and 
door has been bricked and cemented shut  small slits have been cut into the 
walls at strategic points to provide some vantage  these portals are covered 
with chicken wire and are outlined by sharp nails pointing outward at jagged 
angles

the exterior walls are covered with a hodgepodge of metal platingsteel 
sheets corrugated iron  the gables bounded by coils of barbed wire  high
intensity lamps now shut off and security cameras jut out at odd angles 
pointing at every corner of the surrounding landscape

and what a terrifying landscape it is  in the immediate vicinity every 
other houseto the north south east and westhas been burned and razed 
to provide neville with an unobstructed view and to prevent his enemies from 
using other structures as bases of attack

outlining the perimeter of nevilles house are two fences  the interior 
fence only fifty feet from the house itself is seven feet high and 
constructed of wooden beams and ribbons of barbed wire crisscrossed and 
interlaced  from within the house once could see through but no one could 
get past

the outer fence much higher and foreboding forms an impenetrable square it 
is composed of railroad ties telephone poles metal sheets iron staffs 
barbed wired and massive amounts of razor wire outside and in it is 
bordered by row upon row of sharp wooden pikes pointed out

between the two fences within the compound is a three foot deep ditch 
filled with muddy water  a crude moat  its circle broken only by a thin 
land bridge over which now comes the land rover  we an electronic whirring 
and a steel door level with the ground slides back revealing the slanted 
driveway into the underground garage


int  underground garage  day

neville and the dog climb from the stopped rover  he looks up the ramp and 
sees the sun begin its descent  he hits a button and the upper door slides 
closed  he winces with pain as he pulls off the shattered halogen


int  nevilles house  basement

he bolts and locks the door to the garage ignites three big

neville checks and loads a series of weapons


int  nevilles house  various  night

he places guns around the house and heads upstairs


ext  nevilles house  roof  night

a hatch opens onto a protected decka makeshift crows nest it screws 
with the aesthetics of the old homes architecture but it serves a purpose 
providing neville with a high secure vantage point  he rests his marksmans 
rifle in a crook climbs up a small lookout post and raises a pair of 
night vision binoculars to his eyes

in the distance through the foggy green light of the glasses we see forms 
beyond
the outside fence  right now there are a dozen perhaps twenty  however 
to the left to the
right more many more are journeying up the hill toward the house  hiding 
in the
shadows creeping behind rubble crawling through trenches

on the roof neville slides down the pole into the house


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville opens a door revealing a small room withina converted closet  he 
moves inside and we see its walls are lined with numerous holy texts and 
figures of worship
a crucifix the buddha a celtic cross rosary beeds hindu gods a menorah 
norse rune stones you name it

neville lights a candle and incense silently prays  the dog rests outside 
the door  he becomes alert hearing the sound before his master  an eerie 
moan  low resonant  a c far in the distance  beyond the walls beyond the 
fence  the moaning intensifies  the dog whimpers

				neville
		i know

the moaning subsides it is replaced by a deep rhythmic drumming  there is 
something powerful and dangerous to the beat  and it affects neville


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville plays a cd  cranks up the volume  the music is loud angry and 
disturbing  krzystof penderecki  neville moves to the computer station 
presses a co


ext  nevilles house  night

music blares from speakers mounted on the roof  outside the fence the 
drumming intensifies  combined with nevilles music an odd discordant 
symphony is created


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville sits on the floor hands covering his ears  the dog whimpers his 
concern  finally neville screams

				neville 
		stop

he shuts off the music  outside the drumming continues  neville grabs the 
dog by the collar and jerks him to a small hatch cut into the kitchen door  
he slides back a bolt and pushes the dog outside  the dog looks back at 
neville with sad frightened eyes  neville angrily instructs

				neville
		its your job  go

he slides the hatch back in place locking the dog outside


ext  nevilles house  night

the dog begins his patrol of the inner perimeter it is his job to alert 
neville to anyone who makes it this far out here the drumming is much 
louder


ext  nevilles house  roof  night

neville emerges from the hatchway grabs the marksmans rifle adjusts the 
sight with the screwdriver tip of the allinonetool and positions himself 
in the crows nest  he arms the weapon and raises the infrared scope to his 
eye

				neville
		all right cortman  im ready


ext  barren landscape  night

we shift our pointofview to the area far beyond the outer fence to the 
source of the drumming  and what we see should be terrifying

an army  a horde of awesome frightening creatures

close to three hundred in number  male and female  all have the pale 
translucent skin of the creatures neville encountered in the department store 
and subway the same lack of hair the same disturbingly blue greywhite 
eyes  but this group this tribe has something different about it  
something strong  something imperious  something savage

they wear very little clothing an their magnificently shaped bodies  most of 
the men and many of the women are topless proud of their muscular torsos and 
ghostly flesh

unique tribal markings and jewelry adorn their bodies  however all each 
and every one of them bear one identical mark an their chests  the brand 
neville saw an the drained corpse in the subway car it is their mark

there is a hierarchy to the assembled

lowest are caretakers who nurse and tend to the wounded  above them are the 
drummers they intone frightening chants and beat out powerful rhythms an 
large decorated drums  next are the clericsa somber serious bunch whose 
markings are very ornate very significant very holy

the greatest in number are the warriors  the strongest the fiercest the 
most savageappearing  hate fills their eyes  hate fuels them  a pure hate 
for one manneville

very near the top are two lieutenants one leader of the clerics the other 
leader of the warriors  the cleric lieutenant is christopher  an intense 
almost sensitive looking fellow whose body is the most decorated the most 
artistic in its impression  the warrior lieutenant is eva  a fantastically 
strong vicious woman whose body bears the scars of warfare  she possesses a 
manic ferocious energy

and the leader  the leader is cortman

he exudes the confidence and power of a king  his body is chiseled his 
visage haunting  he commands this group with the calm of a head of state 
the drive and focus of a field marshall and the brute force of a tribal 
warlord

he stands an a promontory a big jagged hunk of concrete jutting from the 
earths surface  it provides protection and perspectivebeyond the range of 
nevilles guns but close enough to observe his activity  there is constant 
movement in the ranks but all await and heed the word of cortman

 notealthough these creatures consume blood are allergic to light and 
bear other similarities to vampires they are not  they are something new 
something we have never seen before something strikingly different  there 
is nothing but their existence or behavior that is based in the occult or 
supernatural  they are real  and we will learn how and why soon enough  
for the purposes of this screenplay we will call these creatures hemocytes 


cortman raises his arm and the drummers cease

				cortman
		bring her to me

two warriors shove forward the female hemocyte neville encountered in the 
subway  eva forces her to bow in submission  cortman gently strokes the 
females cheek

				cortman
		you wish to join us

she nods in the direction of nevilles house

				female
		he killed my love

				cortman
		neville has slaughtered so many we loved 
		you want to see him dead  see him punished 
		for this injustice

				female 
		yes

				cortman
		you want to feed on him

				female
		yes

				cortman
		why should we grant you that privilege

				female
		why

she reaches into the small of her back and pulls forth the pistol she used 
against neville

				female
		ill give you this

cortman and others laugh  he takes it examines it

				cortman
		i havent played with toys since i was a
		child  what about you eva

he tosses it to her  she looks at it with disdain

				cortman
		do you really think i need these relics of the past  
		i have every weapon i need my body my mind  
		my soul re the gun such toys are pointless more

				cortman contd
		neville he needs them  take them away
		and he is naked

to prove a point cortman nods to eva and she shoots him twice in the 
stomach  he laughs and we watch his body heal itself blood refusing to 
flow flesh sealing the holes  eva throws the gun into the night

				cortman
		remind her of what she has done

christopher turns to his clerics and they bring forth the drained corpse the 
female and her love fed upon in the subway car  there is real anger in the 
eyes of the clerics

				cortman
		you recognize him

the female realizes she is in trouble  cortman shows her the distinctive 
brand on the chest  cortman touches his own brand  others in the tribe 
touch theirs

				cortman
		it is our mark it distinguishes us and unites us  
		without it we mean nothing without it we are 
		no better than you and you disgust me

				female
		please

				cortman
		please re the corpse did he beg
		whimper and plea  if so what was your 
		response  how did you react  with 
		understanding  compassion  
		or with hunger  and brutality

cortman extends his arm  he concentrates and the muscles and tendons of the 
forearm thicken  elegantly his nails grow creeping forth from the flesh 
forming razorlike talons

				cortman
		life is eternal

he slashes her throat  slashes her chest once twice  her body spasms and 
twitches at the massive blood loss but theres clearly still life in her 
eyes  her flesh tries to heal itself to heal the wounds  cortman looks to 
eva

				cortman
		who goes forth tonight

she motions toward ten hemocyte warriors their faces and bodies painted 
differently than the others

				cortman
		feast on her  let the blood give you strength  
		your brothers spirit will live within you  go  drink

the ten move on the female like vultures to carrion  she screams and within 
moments she is drained  the other hemocytes link hands and surround the 
warriors  cortman approaches the body of the female a last glimmer of life 
in her eyes  he whispers

				cortman
		this is not a punishment  it is a gift

his talons puncture her heart  the talons recede and her blood forms a pool 
in the cup of cortmans hand

				cortman
		you have been chosen on this night of 
		glorious darkness to do battle with an 
		anachronism our nemesis  say his name

together the warriors chant neville

				cortman
		allow the blood to flow through you allow 
		its power to strengthen your limbs 
		your flesh your soul  feel its beauty 
		feel its immense force

fueled by the fresh blood the bodies of the ten men and women seem to grow 
in mass and muscle  their skin thickens forming a kind of flesh armor  
they open their eyes and they are red with ferocity cortman raises his own 
hand to his mouth drinks and kisses each warrior on the mouth

				cortman
		feel the power

he repeats this down the line and when finished the warriors are 
frighteningly pumped up their bodies and spirits now adrenalized with 
terrible dark energy

everyone chants neville again and again  neville  cortman signals 
the drummers who begin an accelerated beat an accompaniment to combat  like 
magnificent predatory beasts the ten warriors move across the barren 
landscape and gather at the outside fence  cortman stands atop the 
promontory and points at the house

				cortman
		destroy the devil

the warriors scream


ext  nevilles house  roof  night

a dark intensity in his eyes neville watches the perimeter  the howling and 
drumming of the hemocytes echoes through the night sky  he does his best to 
block it out block it out

in the distance long poles are raised against the outer fence  the ten 
climb reaching the razorwired crest

neville looks through his infrared sight finds the chest of one warrior and 
fires three roundstwo find the heart  the warrior drops  neville searches 
for another target

atop the fence the warriors struggle to avoid lacerating themselves with the 
razor wire  three strong hemocytes leap over the wire and land in the 
compound avoiding the row of pikes before the moat

on the roof neville switches on super bright lights aimed at the outer 
fence we notice a considerable dimming of other lights in and around the 
housethese lamps draw power

atop the fence six hemocytes are blinded by the light  one loses his 
footing and falls back onto the exterior pikes horribly impaled  another 
badly cuts himself on the razor wire  the blood loss is too great and the 
warrior nearest hima beautiful femalewills it to her drawing the fuel 
into her mouth into her system and leaps into the compound

in the crows nest neville removes the sight and uses the highintensity 
lamps to seek out the three remaining hemocytes on the fence  he shoots  
hits one square in the chest dropping him  shoots  bullets tear into the 
flesh of another but theyre offcenter and the wounds heal  this hemocyte 
leaps joining the others inside the compound

the last of the three jumps down but neville fires catching her in mid
flight spinning her offbalance  she tries to correct her fall but lands 
on the interior pikes  her body is speared in three different places but 
shes still alive

on the roof neville shuts off the highintensity lamps returning power to 
the other utilities  inside the inner perimeter the dog barks alerting 
neville to the five hemocytes who made it into the compound

				neville
		i know i know

he climbs through the hatch into the house


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville propels himself down the spiral staircase and moves to the monitoring 
station on the closedcircuit screens we can see foggy images of cortman 
and his followers outside the compound images of the five hemocytes just 
inside the compound and the dog patrolling the inner perimeter

he checks the computer and we see an electronic graphican overview layout 
of the compound  neville checks the video of the five within the compound 
near the moat

				neville
		you like surprises


ext  the compound  night

the five hemocytes gather around the warrior impaled on the inner pikes  she 
struggles to pull herself off the sharp poles but the blood continues to 
seep out of her
warrior onea muscular malegently leans in

he kisses her  the others congregate and drink her blood  the impaled 
warrior dies  again we see the bodies of the hemocytes grow stronger  they 
turn hiss at nevilles house hiss at the dog move through the pikes and 
toward the moat


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville bounds upstairs to a second story slitwindow  he punches out the 
protective chicken wire with his fist and reaches for something on a table  
a flare gun

				neville
		i like surprises


ext  compound  night

warrior two and warrior three try to leap across the ditch but dont make 
it  they slide into the watery mud  warrior one succeeds in jumping across  
warrior four and the beautiful female warrior approach the edge of the moat  
four is about to slide into the muck when beautiful recognizes odor inhales 
deeply and realizes something terrible


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night
neville aims the flare pistol at the moat and fires

				neville
		happy birthday bobby


ext  compound  night

the flare sails from the bedroom window into the moat it takes only a split 
second for the hemocytes to realize the ditch is filled with gasoline  
warrior one is blasted back by the eruption of flame  two and three howl 
with despair as they are roasted alive  fire spirals into the black sky  
the beautiful female pulls warrior four to safety


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville watches as the flames spread around the moat forming a circle of 
fire  as the flames grow higher the drumming and chanting of the hemocytes 
abruptly ceases

				neville
		get your attention cortman


ext  surrounding area  night

cortman and his followers watch in horror  eva is furious

				eva
		we go  now  all of us

				christopher
		when we send more it simply means more
		dead our dead

				eva
		he cant kill us all

				cortman
		he can  he would  even if it meant
		killing himself in the bargain

				eva
		cowards  were cowards

cortman grabs her by the throat and lifts her into the air

				cortman
		you call me coward 
		you question my judgement

he heaves her away like a rag doll  eva lands hard  cortman intimidates the 
hell out of her out of everyone

				cortman
		who else challenges me  
		who among you


int  nevilles house  living room

neville checks the screens but smoke obscures the view  he looks at the 
computer  moves his mouse to an area labeled motion detectors  sensors and 
creates an electronic x on the screen for each of the hemocytes in the 
compound  neville presses a button and an overlay grid appears


ext  compound  night

warrior onethrough the flames licking the moatencourages warrior four and 
the beautiful female to press on  warrior one looks to the inner fence  
beyond it is the dog barking fiercely  when the warrior approaches the dog 
runs


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville observes the computer as one of the xs steps onto a red quadrant of 
the grid  neville presses a button


ext  compound  night

we hear an electronic beep before warrior one steps on a remotecontrolled 
mine  the concussive blast propels him up and back into the fiery ditch  
across the moat warrior four and the beautiful female look on in horror  
frightened warrior four slinks back in the direction of the outer fence

				warrior four
		well never get inside

the beautiful female looks at him with disgust  she notices the blast has 
torn a hole in the fence creating easy access to the house itself  she 
turns to her cowardly comrade

				beautiful female
		i have a better idea

she extends her razor sharp talons


int nevilles house  living room  night

nevilles eyes watch the monitors he can barely make out two hazy figures 
beyond the moat  suddenly one drops from view  he checks the computer 
screen  the sensors only show the area between the outer fence and inner 
fence the area between the house and inner fence is unmonitored to allow 
for the dogs patrols there is still one x outside the moat


ext  compound  night

the beautiful female stands over the corpse of warrior four his throat 
slashed body pale and drained  rich crimson drips from her lips and her 
body grows in strength and energy  she sets her sights on the house

in a magnificent leap she hurdles over the moat through the flames and 
lands on the other side  the dog growls  she hisses and moves toward him 
talons ready


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville reacts with surprise as the final x disappears from the screen  he 
adjusts the grid fiddles with the mouse checks the video screens nothing  
outside the dog wildly then manically scratches at the dog door neville 
rushes to it but cant open itits stuck  the dog yelps in fear  neville 
tries to force open the hatch but it wont budge  the dog barks a warning  
then silence

he rushes to the monitors but cant see anything  just smoke and dead 
hemocytes  he frantically paces  then grabs a flashlight and heads to the 
basement


int  nevilles house  basement  night

near the garage entrance neville removes a steel plate from the wall 
revealing a tunnelabout two feet high three feet wideleading from the 
house below the compound  he grabs two 45 automatics from the arsenal 
tucks them in his belt and slithers into the tunnel flashlight showing the 
way


int  tunnel  night

neville reaches a specific section of the crawlspace  directly above him is 
another hatchway  he undoes a bolt slides it back shuts off the flashlight 
and sits for a few moments in darkness listening for movement above  when 
hes satisfied with the level of quiet he reaches for the hatch


ext  compound  night

the hatch camouflaged by dirt and dry grass flies up from the ground  in a 
flash neville springs up 45s at the ready  silhouetted against the 
gasoline flames in the moat he surveys the area between the inner fence and 
the house

nothing  he silently moves to the hole in the barbed wire inspects it  he 
follows footprints around the house eyes moving side to side behind above  
he rounds a corner  movement  raises his weapons  and finds

nothing  movement  he spins ready to shoot the dog on the opposite 
side of the barbed wire fence near the moat  neville scolds the dog

				neville
		what are you doing over there

neville points to the hole

				neville
		get inside

the dog heads for the hole then stops  he barks wildly  neville spins but 
the warning comes too late

the beautiful female hemocyte stands a few feet away from him  completely 
nude  her talons are sheathed the blood wiped clean from her mouth and 
chin  although her pallor is ghostly there is no denying her body is 
comely seductive and magnificently shaped  proud and calm she extends her 
hand toward neville as if welcoming him

he raises one of the weapons and aims at her heart  she pouts  and takes a 
step toward him  nevilles hand shakes  his face sweats  his finger cannot 
pull the trigger  the dog senses his masters dilemma and runs for the hole

				beautiful female
		please dont hurt me i want to

the beautiful female steps within inches of him  neville
hates himself for being unable to act

				beautiful female
		 touch you

her hands caress his face and she kisses his neck  her hands move down his 
body along his arms pull the guns from his fingers and drop them to the 
ground  she pulls nevilles hands to her breasts

				beautiful female 
		touch me

as neville becomes lost in her flesh the beautiful female extends an arm  
talons emerge from her fingers  her eyes glow with hate with blood lust

				beautiful female
		so easy

as her razorsharp fingers move to his throat the dog tackles them both  
neville snaps out of his sexual reverie and pushes her away  she lashes out 
slashing his forearm  neville scrambles for the guns  the dog jumps at the 
hemocyte but she bats him away knocking him unconscious

neville aims the 45s fires  threefourfivesix shots from each gun  
protecting herself the beautiful female turns sideways and covers her chest 
with her arms  the skin
thickens an command forming a protective shield  the bullets penetrate but 
do not cause damage

neville drops the spent smoking weapons to the ground  the
beautiful female stands and commands her skin to return to normal she 
looks the helpless neville up and down and laughs  a superior cruel laugh  
she bares her teeth hisses and moves in for the kill

like lightning neville reaches into a boot sheath pulls his combat knife 
and drives it into his attackers heart  the beautiful female screeches with 
shock  neville twists the blade  she falls to her knees and tries to summon 
her body to heal but the damage is too great the loss of blood immense  
she hisses and dies

as life drains from her her eyes become soft almost human neville is 
haunted by the transformation  and cannot bear to watch  a whimper  the 
dog is regaining consciousness  neville lifts him in his arms and heads for 
the tunnel

disinfects bandages then looks to the dog who lies on an exam table

lines the hemocyte corpses along the edge of the pit douses them with 
gasoline and pushes them over the side  the beautiful female is the last to 
go  he lights a molotov cocktail and lobs it into the pit  a burst of flame 
rises into the air

camera cranes to reveal the expanse and awful nature of this place  three 
deep craters filled with the bones and ashes of human beings  it is a 
disturbing unforgettable image

		this is really something

				ellen
		would you tell me already

				neville
		wow  in theory this could cure aids

				ellen
		what are you talking about

				neville
		krippens viragene laughs sounds like 
		something youd buy from an infomercial

neville reads to her from the article

				neville
		a simple hemocyte

				ellen
		whats a hemocyte

				neville
		a blood cell continues   which has been 
		genetically altered and adhered to a virus 
		explains  they started with lung cells a couple 
		years ago but krippens working with blood
		on leukemia reads  the altered cellthe
		virageneis injected into the bloodstream where 
		it destroys all cancerous cells and by utilizing 
		the properties of a virus replaces them with 
		healthy cells  it eats disease and makes you 
		healthy  dr krippen states that in theory use 
		of viragenes could be applied to hiv other 
		forms of cancer damaged nerves blindness
		virtually any ailment

				ellen
		let me get this straight  genetic engineering 
		and viruses

				neville
		the properties of a virusi guess so it can 
		multiply and grow throughout the bloodstream  
		but they disable it more

				neville contd
		somehow so its not harmful  this is
		amazing and its buried on page 12

				ellen
		it sounds dangerous bob

				neville
		ellie

				ellen
		all these socalled scientific breakthroughs  
		playing with the building blocks of life  
		as a race do you think we can catch up  
		i mean were back here and theyre twenty 
		miles down the road

				neville
			significantly
		it could cure cancer  all forms of cancer

				ellen
			sadly
		maybe theres supposed to be cancer  
		does anyone think about that  what if 
		theres a reason  what if  all this goes 
		against gods plan

				neville
		i thought gods plan was simple

she waits

				neville
		to love each other ellie  to lend a 
		helping hand to someone in need to care 
		for one another  compassion

				ellen
		bobby youre an idealist  you always
		have been

int  nevilles house  living room  night

the suns last rays shine through the window slits  neville washes dishes  
the dog glances at the doggie door leading outside  neville tells him

				neville
		not tonight  you can stay in tonight

the happy dog follows him to the video monitorcomputer station  neville 
checks the screensno activity yet  he sits behind the computer and looks 
at a chess programa game already in play  he analyzes the board but is 
distracted


int nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville goes through his archives of video tapes


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville sits up in bed the dog at the foot on the floor watching tv  guns 
in close proximity  a videotape plays john fords the lost patrol  a small 
group of british soldiers cracking under the pressure of attack by a superior 
force of arabs

nevilles seen it many times  hes seen all his favorites too many times  
he gets bored with it stops the tape returns to the archives and moves to 
another  he hesitates  wanting to play certain tapes and desperately not 
wanting to play them  he gives in selects one and moves to the vcr

typical home movie shenanigans  he refocuses on his wife  she looks quite 
lovely in her bikini

reveal neville  sitting on the edge of his bed haunted by the images  
haunted by his vibrant little girl mesmerized by his wifes vitality her 
beauty

and then we hear  mournful chanting slow rhythmic drumming 
the ghostly cries

				voices outside
		neville  neville

neville shuts his eyes  covers his ears  the dog goes to the balcony 
demurely barks a reminder  neville looks out  in the distance in the 
darkness the hemocytes continue to mournfully wail  neville slams shut the 
steel shutters


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville moves to an alcove containing a ham radio setup dons headphones and 
juices up the system  he scans and listens  nothing  the static and dead 
air however blocks out the cries of the hemocytes  neville switches to the 
emergency frequency and leans into his microphone

neville indiscriminately fires the pistol

				neville
		leave me alone 

he futilely empties the clip  the hemocytes collectively hiss  he throws 
the gun into the compound and falls to his knees  he cradles his head in his 
hands

				neville
		dear jesus why  please  why

softening greatly neville lays his hand on the dog  his eyes move to the 
photo of his wife

ext  nevilles house  next morning

neville drives the land rover out of the compound


int  land rover  day

eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses a quiet solemn neville cruises the 
deserted city streets


ext  civic center  day

city hall is in ruins  the federal building blown to bits  the library has 
suffered damage but the structure is intact neville loop of wire in hand 
sets another snare on a lamp post and keeps a watchful eye on the surrounding 
buildings
what was that  did something move  nothing  nothing bob


ext  embarcadero  day

the land rover stops near the bay bridge  neville looks
around cars are overturned burned rusting  boats in the
harbor are ravaged sunken


ext  embarcadero  day  an hour later

neville has strung a series of five traps along the street  hes working on 
his sixth when he realizes he wont have enough wire  he returns to the land 
rover pets the dog and sets his machine gun on the roof of the vehicle  he 
removes the kevlar vest and his shirt  its hot today  he drinks from a 
bottle of water grabs a fresh spool of wire and returns to the post  he 
arranges and sets the wire and prepares to bait it when he stops  absolutely 
dead stops

movement about half a block away  he locates the source of the sound and 
sees something in one of the abandoned buildings  neville reaches for his 
machine gun

but its not there  its on the fucking roof of the land rover  the dog is 
hyperalert  he heard it too  keeping his eyes glued on the abandoned 
building neville moves toward the vehicle

the dog barks a warning but its too late

neville has stepped into the snare of his own trap

snap  the wire whips taught jerking neville off his feet  he smacks his 
head on the asphalt as the wire pulls up  the snare locks into place and 
neville hangs above the street upsidedown his head about three feet from 
the surface  the allinonetool falls from his pocket  he reaches for it 
but its already on the street

the dog barks and barks  panicked afraid scolding  neville is so pissed 
at himself  the wire cuts deep into his ankle  blood drips to the street  
hes a little dazed but nevilles desperately trying to maintain clarity  
the dog circles below barking and whimpering  neville breathes deeply 
gauges his surroundings  what to do  and then he realizes why the dog is 
so frantic

the sun is setting

as if on cue his electronic pocket watch sounds its alarm  beepbeepbeep  
the color drains from nevilles face  beepbeepbeep  neville angrily 
throws the watch down the street  the dog continues to bark his warnings

				neville
		shut up  dont you think i know

the dog backs off circles the area sniffs  whimpers and growls  
transforms into defensive posture

sounds of movement in a nearby building  neville hears it  looks at the 
sky  about thirty forty minutes before sunset  damn  he calms himself  
cant panic absolutely cannot panic  he tries reaching for the wire to 
pull himself up but its just beyond his reach the strain too great  he 
remembers his knife in the ankle sheath  pulls it and hacks at the wire  no 
good  it would never cut through  he tucks the knife back into the sheath 
thinks

crash  something falls and breaks in one of the shops  more movement the 
dog reacts barks and runs to check it out

				neville
		no  stay

neville can do nothing  the dogs gone  must act quickly  although it 
makes the wire cut deeper into his ankle neville swings back and forth 
making his body a pendulum  reaches for the post  misses  swings back  
forth  grabs it holds on for dear life  in an impressive feat of strength 
and dexterity he twists and pulls himself up the post to the overhang bar 
and crawls along it even though the tension it creates on the wire is 
shredding his ankle

neville desperately tries to untangle the snare  his fingers cant quite do 
the trick so he pulls the knife and uses it to saw into the cable

a howl from within a building

neville glances in the direction of the sound  just as the blade succeeds in 
slicing through enough of the wire it weakens and snaps  releasing an 
unprepared neville  he falls and lands hard on the asphalt  a bone breaks 
in nevilles wrist but thats the least of his worries

he landed on the knife  its sticking straight through the meat of his 
thigh

he screams in pain  reaches for it but that arm has a broken wristand 
thats agony  he rolls to his side feels for the handle with his good hand 
and psychs himself up for what must be done  he pulls the blade screams 
and passes out
the image loses focus  fades  to black  silence

fade in to grey  unfocused gaining sharpness  a sound  a wet sound  
the dog licks nevilles face and pokes him urging him to consciousness  
when neville awakens

it is night

the look of terror on his face is unmistakable  the dog whimpers prods him 
begging him to move  a small pool of blood has collected around nevilles 
thigh and ankle  his broken wrist is swollen and he has a bad bump on his 
forehead  he coughs spits raises his head

the atmosphere of the embarcadero has changed  gone is the deadness and 
silencereplaced by sounds  some far off some closeby  activity  there 
is life  some kind of life  the dogs defenses are way up  he sniffs and 
growls

the land rover is about fifty feet away  such a short distance but now for 
neville in this condition it is more like fifty miles  he examines his 
wrist his ankle  the blood has coagulated and he looks to the thigh  he 
rips part of his shirt into a tourniquet  its difficult to work with the 
broken wrist but he manages to stop the bleeding  he tries to stand but 
that is a joke  the ankle is bad enough but the thigh wound is just too 
deepit cant take the pressure  he falls back to the asphalt and catches 
his breath  he finds the knife clutches it in his fistjust in caseand 
begins to drag himself toward the land rover

sounds  movement  all around him  somethingfootstepscircling the 
area  neville accelerates his pace  the dog viciously growls barks and 
then neville hears it too snarling  howls  not footsteps  paws on 
pavement

neville knows whats coming and it terrifies him  again he tries to stand 
but falls hard onto the street  he drags himself toward the vehicle and his 
dog begins to circle barking urging him to move faster  neville stops when 
he sees the first one

a black dog  a hemocvte dog  standing on top of a pile of rubble  watching 
him with icy grey eyes  the beasts fangs are baredlong sharp vicious 
things it assesses neville and his dog  it barks and howls

nevilles about twenty feet from the rover  he remembers the machine gun on 
the roof and yells at his dog

				neville
		the gun  get the gun

but this isnt rintintin the poor thing has no idea what neville means

				neville
		get the fucking gun

no use  neville presses on dragging his wounded body toward the land rover  
holds tightly to the knife when he sees

five more dogs  dane brown boxer white and grey  all muscular sharp
fanged and icyeyed  they snarl and sniff calmly waiting gauging their 
best attack

the dog moves in close to neville guarding  neville fears the worst  hits 
the dog with his arm instructing him

				neville
		go run  get the hell out of here

the dog doesnt move

				neville
		go you stupid thing  go

but the dog will not leave him  and the attack begins

black barks and three rush in  nevilles dog meets brown immediately 
engaging in combat  neville knows his dog is doomed but cant think about 
that now  the other two are upon him  he lashes out with the knife ripping 
white open along the ribcage  the beast yelps and retaliates and bites into 
nevilles thigh  neville screams and knees white with the opposite leg  
grey bites into nevilles broken wrist  the pain is unimaginable but 
neville stabs grey in the chest  again and again  blood bursts from greys 
heart and the dog dies  neville spins to see white in the air pouncing 
eyes on nevilles jugular

but the beast is broadsided by nevilles dog  battered and bleeding he 
fights with a proud ferocity  neville sees the badly wounded brown coming 
licking blood from grey to gain strength  as his dog engages in struggle 
with white neville sees boxer and dane move in

and neville knows there is only one chance  summoning every ounce of 
strength and adrenaline in his body he rises to his feet and emits a 
guttural primordial scream  grimacing denying the pain he moves to the 
land rover forcing his fragile limbs forward

as nevilles dog and white engage in a brutal dance brownrushing on the 
fresh bloodsets his sights on human prey  neville makes it to the land 
rover  he rests against itjust for a momentthen reaches up and grabs the 
machine gun  he turns  just in time to see brown coming at him

neville opens fire and brown is ripped in half  neville whistles and his dog 
breaks away from white  neville shoots white then sprays bullets at the 
oncoming boxer and dane  the automatic weapon fire has the desired effect 
and the two beastssufficiently intimidatedrun away

neville and his dog relax for a moment then almost simultaneously realize 
they have forgotten about the leader the black  who erupts from behind 
knocking neville to the ground  the black is about to devour human neck when 
nevilles dog bites into blacks hindquarters  the black yelps spins and 
locks its jaws onto the dogs neck

				neville
		no

neville smacks the black with the butt of the machine kicks him away and 
opens fire emptying the clip into the hellish thing  until it falls  dead

neville checks his dog  the poor thing is bleeding badly  fueled by 
desperation and conviction neville lifts the dog and deposits him in the 
rover  now well beyond paintranscendent reallyneville shuts the doors 
climbs behind the wheel and gets the hell away

the barren landscape toward the outer fence

vehicle and turns to the dog

		im going to get us home

loaded automatics and grabs two more clips for the machine gun  he takes a 
jerry can of gasoline a rag and quickly manufactures a kingsize molotov 
cocktail

violently accelerates

neville hits a series of switches


ext  area surrounding compound  night

a burst of light  not only from the lamps but from a rack of lights on the 
roof two highbeam lamps mounted near the side mirrors and four lights 
rigged near the trunk

the hemocytes screech and retreat  a few react like deer frozen and the 
land rover just plows through them  near the fence cortman reacts  he sees 
the rover roaring toward him and realizes neville is outside the compound  
he stands at the gatethe only way into the compoundand bellows

				cortman
		stop him

neville maintains focus  his eyes stay fixed ahead  he sees the warriors 
forming a wall in front of the gate  takes a deep breath  and stops the 
land rover


ext  area surrounding compound  night

hemocytes form a circle around the vehicle  the light blinds them and 
scorches their skin but they must take advantage of this opportunity they 
must get neville


int  land rover  night

neville readies the machine gun undoes a ceiling bolt


ext  area surrounding compound  night

a hatch opens on the roof of the rover and neville pops up  he sprays 
machine gun fire in a circle keeping the hemocytes at bay  intensely fires 
at the warriors barring the gate  neville crawls out farther rests the 
machine gun and pulls out the jerry can  two brave hemocytes rush the land 
rover smash a side lamp and headlamp and crawl toward neville

he pulls a sidearm and shoots  dead shots in their hearts takes a lighter 
from his utility belt  more hemocytes move toward the rover  neville spots 
them  lifts the machine gun  fires keeping them backmomentarily  he 
tries to light the rag in the jerry can but his hand isnt working well and 
the lighter slips down the windshield  neville curses crawls out reaches 
for the lighter

his arm is grabbed by a hemocyte eva  they lock eyes  she smiles and 
talons emerge from her fingertips

nevilles weak hand fumbles for a sidearm and pulls the trigger  a bullet 
rips through evas shoulder sending her back spinning off the vehicle  
neville snatches the lighter ignites the rag and throws the jerry can at 
the gate  it lands with a thud  neville fires the machine gun  bullets rip 
into the can and blam  a fireball  at least a dozen warriors are roasted  
they stumble away screeching

cortman knows what neville has in mind and hurriedly leads a charge at the 
land rover


int land rover  night

neville drops into the drivers seat  he reaches up to close the hatch and 
sees the face of a hemocyte  he fires  the shattered hemocyte face 
disappears from view and neville shuts the hatch  presses the remote 
control


ext  area surrounding compound  night

the gate slides open  halfway to the land rover cortman realizes hes made 
an error

				cortman
		back  inside  inside

he changes the direction of the charge just as the rover roars through the 
fire  six hemocytes manage to jump on the vehicle as it speeds into the 
compound and abruptly stops  its rear lamps shine on the open gate

ext  area surrounding compound  night

the gate starts to shut  cortman and his warriors run to it  the hatch on 
the roof of the land rover flips open  neville emerges machine gun in hand  
first he blasts three of the hemocytes clinging to the rover the other 
three are smarter and hang onto the sides of the vehicle out of nevilles 
field of vision  next neville sprays the gate with machine gun fire 
keeping cortman and the hemocytes at bay  neville can only urge the gate to 
move faster

				neville
		come on  come on

then relaxes when the gate is shut

on the garage floor  they look to each other and devilishly smile

he flicks a switch on another remote


int  underground garage  night

the three hemocytes barely have time to notice the halogen lamps lining the 
walls of the room before they burst on  the creatures screech with pain

sunglasses covering his eyes neville calmly opens his door steps out and 
proceeds to exterminate the three pests

quick machine gun bursts to the hearts of one and two  when the clip runs 
out a pistol for the third

				neville
		be prepared

as they lay dying neville shuts off the wall lamps opens the passenger 
door and gently carries out the wounded dog


int  nevilles house  medical facility  night

neville deposits the dog on an exam table  how can he stand the pain  his 
body shinners with sweat from exertion his eyes barely open barely 
conscious  after making sure the dog is stable he tends to his own wounds 
cant help the dog til you help yourself  he goes to a cabinet and injects 
himself with a small dose of morphine to eliminate the pain  to keep himself 
alert he sniffs a capsule of amyl nitrate then injects himself with an 
antibiotic

he takes a scalpel and cuts open his pants leg  the thigh is damn bad  he 
cleans itwhich stings like a motherbandages it then releases the 
tourniquet  god it hurts  he thinks about another shot of morphine but he 
must stay conscious  he painfully removes his boots and cleans and bandages 
the ankle  now the wrist  swollen throbbing  he feels the tendons the 
bones locates the affected section  he readies a splint some tape and 
more amyl nitrate

and then amazingly neville sets his own broken bone  the pain is intense  
he nearly passes out but manages to crack open another capsule of amyl 
nitrate  he applies the splint and tape  its sloppy but it does the job

neville turns to the dog  he injects the poor thing with a strong dose of 
morphine knocking him out  he cleans and bandages making sure bleeding has 
stopped but he knows and we know that these wounds are deep and serious  
neville watches the dogs sad eyes as the morphine kicks in  he leans in and 
pets his faithful companion

are completely drained of blood  there were three  wheres the third  
neville turns  and sees the third hemocyte standing before him mouth red  
body gorged on blood  death lust in his evil eyes

neville is so tired  and doesnt have a gun  thank god for the sun  as the 
hemocyte makes his move the overhead door slides open  neville backs up the 
ramp into the light as it cuts into the room and descends upon the horrified 
hemocyte  the creatures skin blackens and blisters  with a disturbing 
intensity neville grabs the hemocyte by the throat and drags him up the 
ramp into the harsh sunlight  tosses him into the compound like a bag of 
trash

we recognize it as the mark of cortman and his followers 


int  krippen center  day

the lobby once saw awful carnage  dried blood cakes the walls as do scorch 
marks from fires  bullet holes are so plentiful they create an odd mural 
more significantly there is something ominous about this place  the 
serpents lair in the garden of eden
or satans throne room in hell

neville wheels the generator to a thick metal door  impenetrable  he 
removes a panel from the floor and accesses a bundle of electrical wires  he 
fires up the generator and attaches feed connections to the bundle  attaches 
a bypass circuit and punches in his own code

grace

the mammoth door hisses groans and opens as if responding to an occult 
charm


int krippen center  day

neville steps into the first room of a large genetics lab  there are 
numerous rooms each color and number coded ie dna storage  orange 7 the 
colors and ratings correspond to germfree environments biohazard 
conditions etc  amazingly much of the interior of the krippen center is 
clean and in working order  but there are hints of disaster and violencea 
bullet hole here a blood spatter there

neville deposits the dog cage outside a room labeled animal research lab  
red 9 and walks to a lower level roomelectrical  blue 5 he opens a panel 
and finds circuit breakers labeled emergency generators  switches them on

throughout the facility overhead lights flicker to life  the empty sterile 
rooms gleam with an antiseptic sense of dread  we see a few of the rooms  
blood lab  red 9 audio visual  green 2 virus storage  red 10

shelves filled with videotapes  neville finds the animal testing section and 
selects a handful of cassettes

in the corner  neville pops in a cassette labeled test resultsdomestic 
animalskrippen 51298  sits in a chair elevates his legs and watches as 
the tv plays

on the tv screen we see the face of dr john krippen  an intelligent 
passionate face now panicked and deadened  his eyes have seen great 
disappointments  and even greater horrors he speaks to a camera which he 
runs himself

		 and rodent hosts  all accepted the viragene all mutated  
		the mice and rats exhibited no hostility when infected 
		nor did the cats not really  their predatory instincts were 
		elevated yes but they maintained a more calculated

		the viragene seems to bring out a savage instinct 
		a primal brutality that goes beyond mere survival beat

blood  he places a drop on a glass slide and examines it under a microscope

int  krippen center  office  day

dr krippen escorts a visitor into his office  offered a chair neville sits 
opposite krippen  looking every bit the professor in tweed jacket and 
corduroys neville smiles

				neville
		thanks for seeing me dr krippen

				neville
		listen i know youre busy so ill get 
		right to it  the work youre doing with 
		leukemiafrom what i read in the paper 
		it seems to me the same principles could 
		apply to other forms of cancer

				krippen
		absolutely  we chose leukemia because 
		well if we can do it with blood we can do 
		it with just about anything in the body 
		once we tackle blood the rest

				neville
		the lymph system

				krippen
		down the line yes

				neville
		how far down the line

				krippen
		whats the problem professor 

				neville
		six months ago my daughter grace was

neville sort of nods  krippen scribbles a name and number on a piece of 
paper gives it to neville

int  krippen center  main corridor  day

the piece of paper in his fist  through a glass partition we catch sight of 
a patient  as if he senses nevilles stare the man turns

it is cortman  healthy  human

int  nevilles house  medical center  day

neville offers a bowl of food to the dog but it is uninterested  neville 
tries a dish of water  no reaction  the dog sadly curls up in a corner of 
the cage

									dissolve 
to

neville examines a recent blood sample from the dog under the microscope  
his reaction tells us things are getting worse

									dissolve 
to

neville sits in the corner on the floor watching the dog slowly die  the 
poor thing is withering away to flesh and bone  neville cant stand it  he 
rises reaches for a gun and aims at the dogs heart  his arm hangs there 
waiting

the dogs pained eyes look to him  why  neville cannot do it lowers the 
gun  and makes the decision  he takes a syringe and begins to withdraw 
blood from his own arm  he allows a catheter to pour the red liquid into a 
pan when hes lost about half a pint he stops the process opens the cage 
door places the dish inside locks it

he cannot watch as the animal hungrily laps up the blood

									dissolve

ext  nevilles house  rooftop  night

neville stands in the crows nest rifle nearby  he raises the nightvision 
binoculars to his eyes  nothing  no sign

the dog  forever changed  rejuvenated by the blood  possessing a new 
strength it paces gnaws on the bars and growls at neville  the icy grey
blue eyes of the dog do not see a friend a master  they see food  
howwwwwwwwllllllllll  the beasts appetite is great  the hunger painful  
neville curses himself for what he has done  slams shut the door


int  nevilles house  media center  night

neville cranks musictchaikovskys 1812 overture  loud  neville sits  
thinks  nervous  concerned  he lurches to the stereo and shuts it off  is 
drawn to a stack of
videotapes  most labeled krippen  another handful cortman

a tv screen flickers to life nightline with ted koppel  neville stares  
painful memories

				ted koppel
		 and this is nightline the world of medicine 
		has seen its share of miracle cures from polio 
		vaccine to heart transplants  however all past 
		achievements may pale in comparison to the 
		work of dr john krippen

the tape fastforwards  dr krippen engages with koppel

				krippen
		the process is simple  a blood cell is 
		genetically engineered to incorporate the 
		properties of a virus  when this viragene is 
		introduced into a diseased circulatory system 
		the new cells seek out the cancerous cells 
		destroy them and replace them with healthy 
		cells

				ted koppel
		there is some concern though doctor
		because of the viral element

				krippen
		we need to use a powerful virus yes 
		but the virus itself is made impotent 
		we simply utilize its essential characteristics 
		its benefitsrapid duplication molecular strength  
		this isnt really a virus  its not contagious 
		its not destructive

neville laughs  he fastforwards  the video image now includes cortman  he 
and krippen are seated in the lab  cortman is the picture of vitality and 
health  although a bit pale hes muscular and charismatic

				ted koppel
		joining us from berkeley is patient one 
		mr benjamin cortman

				cortman
		hello

				ted koppel
		mr cortman one year ago you were 
		diagnosed with terminal cancer  leukemia

				cortman
		thats correct

				ted koppel

		and today

				cortman
		im cured  thanks to dr krippen  
		every blood cell in my body is 100 healthy  
		better than ever before

				ted koppel
		indeed  there have been rumors dr krippen 
		that your viragene not only eliminates disease 
		but revitalizes the system as well

				krippen
		that is a positive side effect yes

				ted koppel
		what other side effects are there

				cortman
		none really that

				krippen
		 photosensitivity

				cortman
		 oh yeah  the sun  my skin is really 
		sensitive to light

				krippen
		which has to do with blood supply

				koppel
		yes and that brings up the harshest 
		criticism of your work dr krippen  
		the tremendous amount of donated blood 
		needed to pursue these experiments

				ellens voice
		hes very handsome

neville turns

reveal we are now in his old bedroom  watching tv with his wife  their 
daughter grace fast asleep in nevilles arns nightline continues in the 
background

				neville
		krippen
	
				ellen
		no silly the other one  the patient

				neville
		he was there today  i saw him  
		he had scary eyes

				ellen
		scary is attractive  dont you know
		anything bobby

close on cortmans face  video static  the nightline tape has been 
replaced  we are now watching an inhouse interview with cortman inside the 
krippen center

he is inside a padded cell  the camera recording this must have been behind 
a thick wall of plexiglass  cortman stares at the lens  he is naked save a 
pair of boxer shorts  his body is muscular his extremely pale skin drenched 
in sweat  hes lost most of his hair and his eyes are ice

hes in a very agitated state  he paces no stalks around the cell 
occasionally pounding his fists against or headbutting the plexiglass wall  
krippens disembodied voice is piped into the cell

				krippens voice
		ben

cortman slams his body into a wall

				krippens voice
		ben  why dont you try to calm down

cortman rushes to the plexiglass and sneers

				cortman
		calm  calm  you want me to 
		fucking calm down  
		you go to hell krippen 
		you go there and meet your 
		maker

				krippens voice
		ben

				cortman
		give it to me   

we hear krippen push something through a sliding tray into the padded cell  
inside cortman lunges for the contents of the drawera plastic packet of 
blood and a syringe

				krippens voice
		please use the syringe this time ben

cortman throws the needle  rips open the blood packet and drinks  every 
drop  licks the plastic clean  mouth smeared with crimson he placidly 
approaches the plexiglass

				cortman
		you dont understand doctor   
		its the taste  the flavor   
		lost in reverie  i can feel it  
		feel it inside me laughs 
		god  its so beautiful

the blood races through his veins apparent to us due to the translucence of 
cortmans flesh  his muscles growpectorals biceps  a transformation from 
man to superman

				cortman
		you did this  you made me i am the
		future dr krippen  live with that

video static  a new tape  krippen  a shell of a man  a wreck  in the 
bg a 
blaring alarm and flashing emergency strobe lights  from head to toe he is 
soaked with water  he clutches computer printouts  clears his throat and 
tries to muster up his former pride and dignity

				krippen
		the latest estimates have it spreading to the 
		rest of the country in six days  by the time 
		it hits new york ninetyfive percent of the 
		population of california will be infected  
		the fighting in the streets the bloodshed 
		i fear is nothing but a harbinger of the real 
		battle yet to come fights back nausea  we 
		have determined that exposure to sunlight 
		plasma starvation oxygen depravation massive 
		blood loss and severe damage to the heart are 
		the only lethal means of stopping those  infected 
		even so cremation is the sole guarantee that 
		reanimation will not occur

he wipes moisture from his eyes  the alarm stops  somewhere beyond the 
thick walls of the center we hear the cries of the hemocytes

				voices outside
		krippen  krippen

				krippen
		yes  well  my latest blood test reveals 
		i am in stage two of the disease  already 
		my mind is beginning to deteriorate into 
		fantasies of savagery i feel the desire to 
		feed but i cannot bear the thought of it  
		nor can i bear the thought of 
		of cortman ripping me open  gutting me  
		feasting

he pulls something from his pocket  a lighter  we finally notice an object 
in the background  an empty gasoline can

thats not water hes covered with

				krippen
		god forgive me

he ignites the lighter  his body bursts into flames

neville shuts off the tv  why  why did i watch it again  why torture 
myself  he presses his fists against his temples  closes his eyes  
howwwwwwwwwllllllllll  the dog again  it barks and moans

				neville
		stop it  stop

neville watches the security monitors  where are they  hoooowwwwllll 
damn dog  neville storms to the medical center  he looks like he could 
strangle the beast
but he stops and leans against the door

				neville
		im sorry

									
	dissolve to

morning  neville asleep  slumped against the med center door  all is 
quiet  but the silence is broken by a horrific cry of pain  neville bolts 
awake  he flings open the door


int  nevilles house  medical center  morning

a shaft of sunlight slices through the room to the cage  the dog desperately 
tries to stay away but the light touches its tail and sizzles  the dog 
cries  neville shoves the cage aside and covers the window with a blanket  
he moves to tend to the dog hut it snarls at him as he approaches

the dogs body is thin and weak  its eyes are blank the tongue a sick 
pasty white  neville draws blood from himself but places the packets in a 
refrigerator  the dog sees them and it drives him mad with thirst

he yelps and whines begging for the blood but neville betrays no emotion
how could he torture the poor thing like this

the land rover drives over rough terrain through an unpopulated thickly 
wooded park area and stops at lands end overlooking the pacific ocean

neville climbs out machine gun in hand and surveys the area  the dirt 
reveals small animal tracks and up above in the sky are a few seagulls  
neville cant believe it  he hasnt seen a bird in quite awhile  when they 
see him however they take flight soaring out to the ocean

neville steps down to the beach  to his right a lighthouse and pier  to 
his left built into a hillside is a thick iron door  a weatherbeaten sign 
reads san francisco underground transitmaintenance tunnel

		he  he was a good dog  he seemed to 
		gracie wouldve liked him  it was my fault  
		my own stupid fault


ext  golden gate park  day

dishevelled and depressed neville wanders around the park and finds himself 
at portals of the past  somewhat dazed he sits on his usual bench  one of 
his old leaflets at his feet  he 
smirks at his desperate plea for contact then realizes something is written 
on the other side

where are you robert

for a moment he thinks hes going crazy  but no its there right in front 
of him  and then he notices the entire bench is covered with leaflets  
crudely quickly taped down  all bear variations of the same message

where are you

he stands  disbelieving  exhilarated  terrified  suspicious  he rips the 
flyers from the bench frantically gathering them  one which conveys a more 
detailed message

i have tried for days to meet you where are you
robert i am alone and need help  are you for real

neville feels a shiver run through his body  he searches his
pockets for something to write with and scrawls a reply

im sorry  im sorry im sorry     i should have been here every  day i 
will be 
here tomorrow i will 12 noon  when the sun is highest in the sky     i am 
real
i will help   i am here

he signs his name and tapes it to the bench

				neville
		im here shouts  im here at the
		top of his lungs  i am here

his voice echoes throughout the city


ext  nevilles house  night

again the area is devoid of hemocyte activity


int  nevilles house  various  night

like a housewife preparing for company neville cleans the house from top to 
bottom  changes bedding washes clothes tends to the garden  theres a 
manic energy to his activity  hes not entirely all there

and then when everything is clean when the house sparkles he turns to 
himself  he showers shaves clips his nails washes his hair  stares at 
himself in the mirror smiling

and the smile fades as a moment of clarity prevails


int  nevilles house  basement  night

near the firing range neville dismantles a thick wire door used for storage  
he gathers some lumber some metal plating and his tools


int  nevilles house  medical center  night

neville dumps everything from the basement into the room  clears out a 
corner and gets to work


ext  nevilles house  day

wearing a fresh outfit bulletproof padding and heavily armed neville 
climbs into the land rover


ext  golden gate park  day

neville stakes out the surrounding area  checks any place where someone 
might hide  places motion detectors in a circle about two hundred feet 
surrounding the bench  doublechecks his weapons  looks at his watch

1145  he waits  not sure what to expect  he rests an electronic device 
next to himself on the bench it will alert him to anything that moves past 
the sensors

1155  the area surrounding the bench is relatively free of clutter  a 
waste basket rotting garbage newspapers etc

1201  neville looks around  already anxious  clutches his machine gun  
he does not hear or see the pile of rotting garbage move  he does not see a 
hand  he does not see a human figure emerge from a hole dug into the ground 
behind the bench a gun in its hand

however neville does feel the barrel press into his neck

				womans voice 
		dont move

neville does not panic  simply does as he is told

				womans voice
		now  real slow  put the gun down

neville follows orders  the gun barrel fits snugly into the base of his 
skull

				womans voice
		well well well  i was beginning to think 
		you were a fairy tale

she starts to move around him  the gun moves with her

				neville
		oh no  im real

and with the quickness of a cat neville ducks and backhands her hard  she 
fires a wild shot  neville punches  squeezes her wrist until she releases 
her gun  neville grabs it and pistol butts her in the forehead knocking her 
out

he stands  finally able to look at his attacker  shes covered in filthy 
rags from head to toe  neville pulls back the cloth covering her face  
although sheathed in dirt and grime she is beautiful  her flesh doesnt 
boil and blister in the sunlight  he brushes away her long dark hair  she 
cant be over twenty  shes still a kid

neville checks the area the sensors  no shes alone all right  he checks 
the hole and finds a full backpack  grabs it tosses it over his shoulder 
lifts her in his arms and carries her to the land rover


int  nevilles house  medical center  day

the girl lies on an exam table unconscious  neville removes the filthy 
clothing stripping her down to tshirt and leggings  cant let his eyes 
dwell on her breasts her

he washes her face and tends to her forehead  he prepares a syringe and when 
he looks for a vein he sees track marks running up and down each arm  he 
moves to her backpack and dumps its contents  a few cans of food rounds of 
ammunition a flashlight batteries syringes and ampules of red cross 
morphine  neville shakes his head

he takes the syringe and carefully withdraws a blood sample from a vein in 
her hand  despite the long dirtencrusted fingernails they are beautiful 
hands  exquisite  he looks away  takes the blood sample injects it into a 
test tube and places it in the centrifuge


ext  nevilles house  night

all is quiet  again the hemocytes fail to appear


int  nevilles house  medical center  night

neville sits at the table eating dinner and looking at bloodwork through a 
portable microscope  from the medical center we hear a rattling  then a 
terrible scream  neville expected this  he takes a plate of food from the 
stove


int  nevilles house  medical center  night

neville opens the door and we see the girl is trapped inside a cage  
constructed last night by neville specifically for this purpose  she is not 
happy  like a rabid feral animal she rattles her cage and screams he sets 
the plate of food on the counter and sits in a chair a few feet away from 
her  calm  cool  waits for her to blow off steam

				neville
		you hungry

				the girl
		let me out

				neville
		whats your name

neville changes his shirt  for a brief moment hes drawn to the photo of 
his wife  the girls screams have become pathetic whimpers  shes crying  
in desperate need of a fix  neville sits on the edge of his bed  composes 
himself


int  nevilles house  medical center  night

				anna
		then how do you explain me

he approaches with the syringe

				anna

she sticks her arm out of the cage

				neville
		cant find a vein

				anna
		yes you can yes you can

neville finally locates one and injects  once the syringe is emptied into 
her arm he steps back  anna smiles and leans against the walls of the cage  
her eyes open wide with fear  her body shakes  she looks nauseous

				anna
		this isnt morphine

				neville
		no  no its sticelezine  they developed 
		it for rapid heroin detox but itll work for 
		morphine addiction too

				anna

she lunges at him but her stomach cramps and she falls

				neville
		its a severe shock to the system but the 
		treatment only lasts twentyfour hours

				anna
		i swear ill kill you

she collapses  losing consciousness

				neville
		you wont go through withdrawalits not 
		a painful process at all  youll be asleep 
		most of the time  theres risk of heart attack 
		but ill be monitoring you

annas eyes roll back into her head  her body goes limp  neville unlocks 
the cage door and lifts her into his arms


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville rests anna on his bed  shes still filthy so he makes the decision 
to wash her  he cuts away her tshirt and leggings with surgical safety 
scissors and throws them away  he tries very hard not to be entranced by her 
young thin body  he simply does a job or tries to

he fills a basin with warm water soaps a sponge and gently washes her body  
up her legs her buttocks around her stomach her breasts  shampoos and 
rinses her hair  softly caresses her face with a washcloth

its an undeniably sensual experience but neville does not cross the line  
he is respectful  we see he has the heart of a caretaker  there is a 
gentleness to his actions which inform us that he must have been a wonderful 
husband  and a caring father  neville opens a trunk and finds a nightgown 
among his wifes things  carefully fits anna into it  he steps back and 
observes her  peaceful  beautiful  angelic

just like ellen

he kneels almost in prayer then hooks her up to an iv and adjusts the 
flow of the medication  neville takes towels and blankets rips them into 
strips and secures annas wrists and ankles to the bed frame  shes 
comfortable but secure


int  nevilles house  greenhouse  dawn

neville selects the best fruit from his garden


int  nevilles house  kitchen  dawn

neville places the fruit in a blender with some protein powder and water  
boils some oatmeal on the stove


int  nevilles house  bedroom  morning

anna is somewhat conscious  neville undoes her wrist ties and sits her up  
like a father with a newborn he attempts to feed her  she spits up and he 
wipes her face

				neville
		weve got to get something into you

he lifts a glass of the protein shake to her lips and she manages to drink 
some down

				neville
		good girl

he lowers her onto the bed and gives her a series of three injections  
carefully following procedure in a medical manual  when complete he 
reattaches the wrist ties and sits in a chair opposite anna  watches her 
sleep


int  nevilles house  bedroom  a few hours later

annas body convulses  neville expected this  he prepares a syringe 
injects her and she relaxes


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville stands on the balcony sipping a cup of coffee  the sun sets beyond 
the hills over the ocean  he hears anna stir and moan  he checks her blood 
pressure temperature pulse and pupil dilation  is satisfied with her 
vitals and removes the iv he gives her a final injection removes one
of the wrist ties and sits her up as she gains consciousness  neville sits 
beside her with a bowl of rice and a spoon  tries to get her to eat but she 
shoves it away

				neville
		i know youre hungry

she is starving  but she wont allow him to feed her  with her one free 
hand she takes the bowl and spoon from him and feeds herself  big gulps of 
rice

				neville
		slow down  youll get sick

she listens  after a few bites she realizes that she is clean and in 
someone elses clothes

				anna
		what did you do

				neville
		you were filthy

				anna
			angry
		did you enjoy it  giving me a little
		bubble bath  did you like my body

				neville

				anna
		did it turn you on  did i get you hard

				neville

				anna
			re the nightgown

		sly  mrs neville

				anna

		the dear departed  then what wait til i 
		pass out and have a quick fuck for old times 
		sake  was i any good  id like to know

				neville
		stop it

he explodes  she laughs  he secures her free wrist to the bed  she 
continues laughing

				anna
		bondage  im into it  was she

neville closes the shutters to the balcony  gathers up medical supplies and 
the food heads downstairs

				anna
		whats the matter  cant get it up


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville sits at the bottom of the spiral staircase face buried in his hands 
determined not to let her see him hurt  he moves to the surveillance center 
and checks the monitors  still no sign of cortman and the hemocytes  he 
adjusts a few knobs a joystick controller changing angles

something is out there  he zooms in  dogs  half a dozen contaminated dogs  
scavenging  he zooms in closer trying to get a better look  no hes not 
with them  a crash from upstairs  thumping  neville bolts up the spiral 
staircase


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

anna is convulsing  the iv is on the floor the needle detached  neville 
loosens the restraints and cradles her body until her limbs cease flailing  
she vomits and he carries her into the bathroom  she heaves into the toilet 
and breaks into a cold sweat  he washes her face and wraps her in a 
blanket  she looks at him with terrified eyes

				anna
		im scared

she leans into him and he holds her

				anna
		im really scared

				neville
		its okay  im here

she begins to cry and he softly caresses her face

				neville
		i know

she buries her face into his shoulder sobbing  he looks at the blank walls 
of the bathroom stroking her hair

				neville
		i know

									
	dissolve to

int  nevilles house  kitchen  morning

anna sits at the kitchen table wearing the nightgown and nevilles robe 
gently rocking  neville places a bowl of oatmeal and a cup of tea in front 
of her  the same for himself  he eats she doesnt

				neville
		itll help with the nausea

she takes a few bites  sips her tea  they eat in silence for awhile until 
anna decides to make conversation

		hearts and eat them raw  they say you rape

pair of binoculars

				anna

		so pissed off at what people were doing 
		he decided to end it  once and for all

int  nevilles house  kitchen  dusk

anna and neville sit down to dinner  neville whispers a blessing then 
serves the food

				anna
		robert

first time shes called him that  he looks up

				anna
		can i stay here

he analyzes her beautiful youthful face  her tough exterior has vanished 
like so much vapor

				neville
		if you want

				anna
		i do  thank you

he nods and shyly returns to his plate  they sneak glances at each other as 
they share the rest of dinner in silence


ext  nevilles house  roof  night

neville shows anna how to switch on the powerful exterior lights  he lifts a 
pair of binoculars to his eyes and surveys the area  again no hemocytes

				neville
		have you gone  have you

he retreats inside  anna hesitates on the roof  looks at the barren area 
beyond the compound fences  she waits for a moment apparently deeply torn 
then follows


int  nevilles house  surveillance center  night

he shows her the various closedcircuit screens and computer

				neville
		for movement outside the far fence your 
		best vantage point is the roof  beyond that 
		youre better off down here re the monitors 
		visual checks here re the computer sensor 
		checks here  the area surrounding the house is 
		monitored for changes in heat sound movement  
		if one gets inside the fence youll know

the computer displays the electronic mines

				neville
		if you cant take them out with a shot from the 
		roof or one of the windows use these  each 
		spot on the screen corresponds to a keyboard 
		command  press it and it ignites a mine  
		just make sure you have the right one

				anna
		kind of coldblooded isnt it

				neville
		there are hundreds of them and just one of me 
		rethinks  two of us  its just the way it has to 
		be

anna thinks she sees the systems fatal flaw a weakness

				anna
		what happens if they all comeover the
		fence  all at once

				neville
		they wont

neville hits a button on the computer keyboard  all the mine symbols start 
blinking red  he throws a switch and an alarm sounds  a red light flashes  
anna panics

				neville
		in thirty seconds the whole thing goes up 
		the house the yard the hill  all of it

				anna
		turn it off

neville enjoys her discomfort

				anna
		turn it off

he pushed it too far  shuts the system down

				neville
		two years ago i captured one of them  
		brought him inside and showed him just 
		what i showed you  then i let him go  
		they know remembering do you remember 
		the old cold war  no you were too young

				anna
		i read about it

				neville
		well then  during the cold war there was 
		an unspoken understanding  if any of the 
		major powers launched an allout assault 
		the target country would retaliate in equal force  
		it would mean total destruction  the attack 
		would be rendered meaningless  so peace was 
		maintained  i guess you could call it peace 
		even what i have with cortmanmore

				neville contd
		its a sort of peace  we have our border
		clashes skirmishes  but we both know

				anna
		where are they now

				neville
		i have no idea  it could be a trick  
		they might be gone  once and for all  
		most of themwhen things began to 
		settle downbecame nomadic  when a food 
		supply became depleted it became necessary 
		for them to move on to find new sources  
		but he remained  laying his claim  
		establishing a power base

				anna
		who

				neville
		cortman

				anna
		whos cortman

neville almost laughs  cant believe she doesnt know

				neville
		whos cortman

perfect assortment of videotapes  anna sits in a chair like a moviegoer 
waiting for the show

				neville
		how old were you  sixteen

anna nods

				neville
		where were you living  portland

				anna
		no  we lived in the mountains  
		about two hundred miles east

		not until after  not ti1 it was all over  
		when they came our way  from the cities  
		my father thought cities were sodom and 
		gomorrah  and they were the offspring  
		the damned

he inserts the first cassette

		they can see  see for themselves what

blood drips from his forehead

				sanchez on tape
		dr krippen  dr krippen  
		can you tell us why the cdc was alerted  
		is there a public danger

krippen looks shellshocked  he hides his face and slinks into the rear of a 
police car

neville shuts off the tape  presses play on another deck another tv 
springing to life  video footage of the san francisco chief of police at a 
press conference filled with angry reporters  blownup photos of the 
krippen ten rest on easels behind him  most prominent is a photo of 
cortman  neville points to it for anna

neville shuts off the tape

		the fear  the panic

he starts another  video footage of the governor of california reading a 
statement  the poor man looks absolutely distraught

neville switches off the tape  turns to anna

				neville
		in six daysless than a weekthe world turned 
		upside down  san francisco became a war zone  
		do you know what people do when you tell them 
		they no longer have rights  that an individual is 
		powerless  they fight  it was ludicrous to think 
		mankind would just roll on its back and comply  
		i saw my neighborspeople ive known for years
		become bloodthirsty savages  infected uninfected 
		it didnt matter  we were all driven mad  the survival 
		instinct went ballistic  food guns medicine blood
		it all became priceless  worth killing for  those 
		who had became the targets of the had nots  
		a city of five million people  within a month more 
		than half were dead  six weeks later about ten thousand 
		like me  ab negatives  we were all determined to 
		more

				neville contd
		live  but we didnt gather together  there was no 
		unity  it was every man for himself  trust had 
		been abolished  by the end of the year it was me  
		just me

				anna
		how  how did you do it

				neville
		i remained calm  its the great secret of survival  
		when all around is chaos when everyone is driven
		to the brink of insanity  relax

				anna
			a confession
		dont you  dont you wish sometimes
		that you died too  with everybody else

				neville
		every day

beepbeepbeep  a sensor alarm  neville bolts to the surveillance center  
scans the monitors for signs of activity but finds nothing

				neville
		im going to the roof  stay here

he grabs a rifle and heads up the staircase  anna moves to the videotapes  
curious to find a certain something


ext  nevilles house  rooftop  night

neville surveys the area with binoculars  for a brief moment he thinks he 
sees someone going over the far fence  he raises the rifle scope but finds 
nothing

dark glassy eyes  emaciated clearly infected  she just looks at themas 
if their fighting was her fault

neville feels an overwhelming sadness  he moves to her just as she faints

the image distorts  a few days later  we move with neville into a darkened 
bedroom

he sees his wife sitting on the edge of the bed  her wrist is bleeding and 
the weak grace is drinking from the wound  a guilty ellen explains to her 
horrified husband

				ellen

biohazardsuited national guardsman stands watch  the cdc men see graces 
dead form  neville stands in a corner very near the edge of shock  one of 
the cdc men turns to him his voice electronically distorted

				neville
		yes  my wife died last week

they load grace into a body bag and carry her to the door  outside a 
garbage truck waits  more guardsmen  more garbage trucks on every street

				neville
		im ab negative  besides you cant stop
		me  i still have that right

the image distorts  nevilles rover stops outside the army golf coursethe 
mass burial site  the garbage truck unceremoniously dumps its cargo  the 
body bags fall  a biohazardsuited worker carrying a large hose sprays the 
corpses with gasoline  another worker tosses a torch over the side and the 
pit erupts in flames  neville watches in horror the crimson fire reflected 
against his skin

the image distorts  neville in his house  he unlocks the door to the master 
bedroom  knocks a warning

				neville
		ellen  its me

he pushes into the room and we see a terrified ellen huddled in the corner 
clutching the machine gun  she is pale and emaciated  sweating paranoid  
infected

				ellen
		are they gone

				neville
			tenderly
		theyre gone sweetie

he kneels beside her  eases the gun out of her tight grip

				neville
		its okay

				ellen
		is she

				neville
		shes gone honey  its over for her
		shes at peace

ellen begins to sob  desperately hugs him

				ellen
		oh god bob  just kill me  please

it would probably be best but the idea is anathema to him

				neville
		i cant do that

the image distorts  the cemetery  working quietly and in darkness neville 
slips past security and carries ellens dead body to the tomb  inside the 
crypt he lays her to rest  shes dressed in her wedding gown  neville 
places her within the stone coffin and kneels in prayer

				neville
		i love you ellen i will love you forever

close on her face as the stone coffin lid slides into place

the image distorts  san francisco in ruins  buildings and cars on fire 
crashed helicopters smoldering in the streets  horrible cries of pain and 
thirst

nevilles house  the first crude barricades up

inside neville sits in a chair in the center of the room empty bottles of 
liquor at his feet a cigarette dangling from his lips  dirty unshaven  
the machine gun resting in his lap  he just stares  waiting  fists pound 
against the door  glass breaks  arms reach inside

he waits  a small band of hemocytes breaks through the front door  neville 
readies the machine gun stands calm  the terrifying creatures move toward 
him  six maybe eight  and he sees the leaders face

ellen

skin translucent body muscular almost nakedthe wedding gown stripped 
away  her eyes are icy dead  long claws extend from her fingertips  she 
smiles at her husband

				ellen
		robert

neville raises the gun to his eye  takes aim  ellen and the hemocytes are 
upon him  he looks into her lifeless eyes hungry for him i knew you would 
come ellen  i knew

				neville
		god forgive me

and he opens fire

flashback


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville screams as he comes awake from his nightmare  he lashes out at 
imaginary attackers  utterly terrified anna jumps from her bed and tries to 
calm him

				anna
		robert  its okay

he flails but she holds him  he leans into her sobbing

				anna
		its okay

they both receive something from the embrace  a connection  a necessary 
thing  a simple human need for touch for understanding  he looks into her 
eyes  she gently touches his face  they kiss  deeply passionately

they make love with deep emotion sensitivity and passion  as if they were 
proving to each other and to themselves that they are still human that they 
can steel feel

neville prepares breakfast for anna 


int  nevilles house  bedroom  morning

carrying a tray neville quietly enters and delivers breakfastinbed to her  
sunlight streams in through the windowslits  she leans against him and he 
holds her


ext  nevilles house  day

neville and anna walk the perimeter  hesitantly she reaches out and takes 
his hand

				anna
		would you ever leave here

neville doesnt answer  he spots something entwined in the barbed wire over 
the main gate  he lets go her hand and climbs up a series of ladder steps 
nailed into the wood on the interior of the gate posts  he reaches the top 
and pulls out a piece of clothing 
a little boys blue parka

				neville
		howd this get up here

unseen by neville anna is frozen  her eyes fixed on the parka  color 
drains from her face  neville drops to the ground and examines the dirty 
tattered coat

				neville
		mustve been a bad wind last night

he turns to anna who is still fixed on the parka

				neville
		whats wrong

				anna
		nothing

she smiles and kisses him

				anna
		lets go inside


int  nevilles house  bedroom  day

in a series of dissolves they make love all afternoon

									
	dissolve to


ext  nevilles house  rooftop  dusk

neville stands in the crows nest eyes on the horizon  a vibrant redand
purple sky  massive clouds  breathtaking  neville exudes a sense of peace  
a beguiling tranquility

				annas voice
		robert

he turns and sees her  she wears a simple pretty dress and a scarf around 
her neck  very feminine ellens

				neville
		you look beautiful

				anna
		dinners ready

she goes to him and he holds her  has she been crying

				neville
		are you sad

				anna
		no no

she kisses him  looks at his dirty hands and clothes

				anna
		you should wash up

her smile seems genuine he obeys and heads downstairs

				neville
		yes maam

anna hesitates

				anna
		ill be right down  
		i just want to look at the sunset

neville smiles and descends when he is out of sight annas smile fades  
she appears distraught torn  she undoes the scarf and ties it high on the 
crows nest like a flag

a signal


int  nevilles house  kitchen  night

the table is beautifully set and anna has made dinner  romantic music in the 
background  she stands near the table waiting as neville comes from 
upstairs  he approaches the tender domestic setting

				anna
		i hope its okay i havent actually
		cooked anything in god knows how long

				neville
		looks wonderful

he kisses her  it takes her a moment to fall into the embrace the warmth  
just as soon as she gives in she breaks off  smiles and instructs 
neville

				anna
		sit  before it gets cold

anna returns to the kitchen and carries a pitcherthe blender reallyto 
the table  she pours him a wineglass full of what looks like a fresh fruit 
shake

				anna
		i looked for wine

				neville
		not here

				anna
		right so i made a sort of virgin fruity thing

he takes a sip

				neville
		its good

she smiles and takes her seat  they start to eat both a little nervous  
like a first date  anna watches as neville takes another drink tries the 
mealchicken and pasta

				neville
		this is great anna  thank you

she picks at her food  he takes her hand

				neville
		im sorry about what i did  when i 
		brought you here  i felt i was doing 
		what was right  i want you to know anna

		i would do anything for you

				anna
		dont say that  please

				neville
		why  i mean it  i would

				anna
		please robert please

beepbeepbeep  a sensor alarm  beepbeepbeep  neville rises from the 
table and heads to the surveillance station  as he walks his stomach cramps 
up but he presses on  when he looks into the monitors what he sees shocks 
him

on the monitors the hemocytes  hundreds of them  cortman and his entire 
tribe

				neville
		my god  anna

he winces in pain when his stomach cramps again  anna doesnt move from the 
table  she just sits and watches him

				neville
		anna

hes very confused by her behavior  his vision blurs and for a moment hes 
dizzy and then he remembers

				neville
		the lights

he switches on the exterior compound lights but nothing happens  outside 
remains dark

				neville
		anna  downstairs  the generators
		something must be wrong with

he takes a step and falls to his knees  the pain is intolerable  he braces 
himself from falling over  his vision is cloudy his speech starting to 
slur

				neville
		whats happening

anna slowly rises and comes to him  he reaches out for her but she passes 
and moves to the surveillance center where she unplugs the computers and 
security monitors

				neville
		oh jesus no  you cant do that

he glances at the kitchen table  his nearlyempty glass  sees hers was 
never filled  he looks to anna  she stands in the middle of the room 
shivering with fear and shame  tears in her eyes  neville feels completely 
betrayed

				neville
		why

anna cannot look at him

				anna
		im sorry  im so sorry

and then he hears  neville   he crawls across the floor makes it to 
his feet and pulls himself up to one of the windowslits  a nightmare is 
what he sees


ext  compound  night

numerous poles are placed against the fence  hemocytesall mouths red with 
fresh bloodprepare for a massive assault
cortman climbs the first pole stands atop the gate to the compound and 
addresses the troops

				cortman
		we have waited long enough the hour is 
		nigh  let us pay a visit to the devil

christopher signals the drummers who beat out the charge  eva howls to her 
warriors who in turn emit a fierce battle cry  and cortman leads them over 
the side


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville falls to the floor  eyes wide with fear  again he manages to get 
to his feet stumbles to the staircase and heads upstairs  anna follows

				anna
		robert  its over


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

fighting exhaustion from whatever drug hes been given neville forces 
himself to move  he stumbles and slips but succeeds in opening a cabinet 
near the balcony  he grabs the flare gun a case of flares and opens the 
steel shutters

				annas voice
		no robert

he sees her standing at the stairs a gun pointed at him  her hand is 
trembling her face stained with tears

				neville
		i assume if they wanted you to kill me
		id be dead already

he loads the first flare  she waves the gun

				anna
		please

neville steps onto the balcony and fires into the air  anna cant bring 
herself to do any more  she lowers the gun and covers her face in shame  on 
the balcony neville loads and fires flare after flare  the night sky 
becomes filled with phosphorescent orange light  he aims a few at the fence 
and the final flare at the moat


ext  compound  night

the moat erupts in flames catching a few but most have moved beyond the 
moat to the inner fence  cortman hisses and sneers his gaze fixed on his 
nemesis on the balcony

				cortman
		neville

the two antagonists lock eyes  neville above cortman below  heaven and 
hell  the gasoline fire burns black smoke spiraling into the sky  the mass 
of hemocyte bodies swarm toward the house  the flares slowly sink to the 
earth leaving glowing trails behind them  a surreal hallucinatory 
horrifying scene


int  nevilles house  bedroom  night

neville stumbles inside and from the cabinet grabs a shotgun machine gun 
and all the ammo he can carry he loads the shotgun and turns to anna  for a 
brief very brief moment he ponders the act of killing her  then simply 
states

				neville
		get out of my way

she steps aside and falls to her knees as he heads downstairs


int  nevilles house  living room  night

neville falls down the last few steps  for a moment he lies there  sounds 
of the hemocytes pounding scratching scraping at the outer shell of the 
house  nevilles eyelids are heavy  sleep  just let it come

				neville
		no

using the machine gun as a crutch he defiantly gets to his feet and stands 
eyes shifting from one spot to the next as the sounds direct him  the sounds 
are intolerable

fingers  hands  arms  forcefully tearing apart the house reaching inside 
neville hefts the machine gun in one hand the shotgun in the other

				neville
		come on

and they come  the bloodfueled ragefilled faces of the hemocytes poke 
through the crumbling walls their sharp talons ripping open the house like a 
birthday gift

neville opens fire  merciless and unfeeling  the last acts of a desperate 
man  blood sprays but the hemocytes press on most of their wounds non
lethal they crawl into the room like a swarm of insects  neville manages to 
drop a few but the onslaught is endless limitless  he pushes back heading 
downstairs


int  nevilles house  basement  night

neville shuts a trap door sealing off the upstairs  he makes it to the 
electrical control panels  theyve been irrevocably sabotaged  why anna  
why  breathing heavily he goes to the door to the garage  hes about to 
unbolt it stops  listens scratching  scraping  voices on the other 
side  neville  theyre in the garage

neville is trapped  hemocytes to all sides  the outcome is inevitable  he 
drops the machine gun  loads one last round in the shotgun  kneels  puts 
the barrel under his chin  reaches for the trigger  and stops  
remembers  maybe theres a way out

he moves to the small door leading to the crawlspaces under the compoundthe 
series of tunnels  he has difficulty opening it so takes the familiar all
inone tool from his pocket and uses it to jimmy open the latch  he manages 
to open it and sticks the tool in his mouth to get it out of the way  he 
climbs in and shuts the hatch just as the hemocytes crash through from the 
garage


int  crawlspace  night

pitch black  neville cannot see his hand in front of his face  he slithers 
toward a sliver of orange light at the end of the tunnel  he grasps the 
shotgun tight  he listens to the footsteps of the hemocytes on the surface 
above him  their howls screeches and cries  the incessant drumming in the 
distance  dear god make it stop

his eyes grows weary his fingers lose their grip on the gun  passing out  
like a protagonist in poe he is virtually buried alive  just as he succumbs 
to the effects of the drug darkness turns to light  orange light from the 
flares in the sky  neville senses what is coming  someone has opened the 
trap door  someone has found his hiding place  nevilles eyes open to see 
the face of his discoverer

cortman

									fade out

									fade in

the following images have a distorted hallucinatory feel

neville pulled from his grave by dozens of clawed hands  the shotgun ripped 
from his hands his clothes torn from his body spitefilled faces  
shouting cursing spitting screeching with glee  barbed wire pulled from 
the fences cutting into his flesh  cortmans talons teasing his throat  
anna  surrounded by hemocytes  they pay her no heed  she walks among them 
untouched unharmed  nevilles face  a tight grimace  clearly he is in 
pain

									fade out

									fade in


ext  compound  night

we follow nevilles face first surrounded by earth then hemocytes then 
sky  its a disorienting effect  were not sure whats happening to him 
and then we reveal

neville lashed to a thick long wooden pole  bound with rope straps of 
leather  and barbed wire  he is virtually naked his shorts affording him a 
minor degree of dignity  his entire body is laced with scratches  his face 
is battered and bruised  they ve been having fun with him

the hemocytes gathered at the base of the pole secure it to the ground  
cortman and his lieutenants stand before the tribe displaying their prey  
showcasing the defeat and capture of the devil  neville opens his eyes  
orange red and yellow  the colors flicker and dance across his face  
sweat beads on his forehead from intense heat

				cortman
		everything you held so dear

reveal nevilles house  in flames  a black shell roaring like a furnace  
the hemocytes watch it with awe  they lustily dance and scream with joy  
cortman climbs the pole until he can whisper into nevilles ear

				cortman
		what does it mean now  anything

neville turns away  cortman holds his head in place forcing him to watch  
cortman touches nevilles neck with a talon

				cortman
		your lifeas you know itis over

cortman scratches nevilles neck with his talon  a thin line of blood begins 
to flow  cortman drinks  neville tolerates the savage actno more no less  
he stares at his home as it crumbles into a fiery heap


ext  surrounding area  night

the long pole with neville at the end in the dirt is dragged through the 
street  the object of public humiliation  the hemocytes crowd around him 
kicking laughing spitting occasionally scratching him with a claw  its a 
celebration for them  a time to rejoice

each bump on the terrain causes the barbed wire to scrape across nevilles 
skin  hes in agony but his face remains tight unemotional betraying 
nothing  giving nothing  they move down the hill onto the main roada 
brutal parade


ext  subway entrance  night

the pole is moved handbyhand along a staircase leading into the subway 
tunnels  as neville is passed along he sees dozens of hemocyte faces  some 
laughing some screeching with anger others terrified to look at it at 
the devil


int  subway tunnel  night

its dark down here but moonlight filters in through crumbled streets open 
sewers and transoms casting this netherworld in an odd purple glow  alien  
cortman leads the parade down the tracks to a roundabout a large open area 
where many tracks meet  it is multilevelled the ground having been 
excavated to reveal old layers of the city dormant relics of san franciscos 
past  it is here where cortmans tribe lives  this is home  their 
village

as neville is pulled dragged and thrown into it he sees more hemocytes 
here than ever came to his house  they huddle en masse fearful of the 
captive demon

there is a decor to the underground hemocyte village a style a sense of 
culture  the graffiti is more than tribal markings  it exhibits a passion 
a unique sensibility  art  the dwelling spaces the clothing the makeshift 
architecturethere is something developing here  not human not what we 
once regarded as human but something cultural  a new development  
artistically aesthetically  revolutionary  evolutionary

in the center of the roundabout in a circular forum the town square 
neville and the pole are raised and presented to the people of the village  
the hemocytes gather around neville hundreds of them  chanting drumming 
screeching hissing  all eyes on the demon before them

cortman takes his place at what must be the leaders post a pedestalthrone 
on which he stands and addresses the assembled  he raises his arms and the 
hemocytes give him quiet  cortman raises a finger and points at neville

				cortman
		behold the beast  no longer mighty  
		no longer unconquerable no longer an 
		icon of fear  no longer a spirit to haunt 
		the minds and souls of our children 
		to the women bring them  
		let them see this neville now

the crowd parts and the women bring forth something neville never imagined

hemocyte children  offspring

dozens of them  two and three years old  the mothers hold the newborns and 
toddlers in their arms  high atop the pole neville cannot believe it  his 
expression is a mixture of sadness terror and guilt  children

				cortman
		look at them neville  how many of their 
		fathers have you killed  their mothers  
		how many families did you destroy

the children look at him with fear and revulsion

				cortman
		how arrogant you were  arrogant in your 
		righteousness  to be so convinced that you 
		were doing gods work that you were his 
		avenging angel  the defender of faith  a faith 
		in humanity  but what became of humanity neville 
		it was struck down  smote by god but you 
		you cling to the belief that we are the abomination  
		did it ever enter your mind did you ever consider 
		that we are the chosen  that we are the future

cortman lifts one of the children into his arms

				cortman
		you are an illusion neville  
		you mean nothing

cortman raises his hand  a talon emerges from his fingertip  he makes a 
delicate cut in nevilles ankle and catches the flowing blood in the palm of 
his hand  forming a cup he brings his hand to the lips of the child in 
his arms

				cortman
		drink son

the childs lips touch the blood  cortman lowers the boy to the ground and 
he scampers off to join his friends

				cortman
		dont be frightened of them neville 
		look beyond your own ideas and see 
		their beauty  their souls

the hemocyte children stare at the monster  neville finds himself drawn to 
their faces odd and ghoulish yes but possessing the innocence of all 
children

cortman signals to a group of warriors who throw long ropes into the rafters 
of the roundabout  near the ceiling other warriors catch the lines loop 
them over steel beams and slip them back to their counterparts at ground 
level  these warriors tie one end of the ropes to the top of the pole

as they work eva shoves anna into the circle  kicks her until shes 
kneeling at cortmans feet  he cups her chin in his hand and as if to kiss 
her lifts her to his face

				cortman
		such a pretty thing
			to neville
		did she played the temptress well  
		did she neville  were you seduced

anna violently breaks away from him

				anna
			spitefully
		wheres ethan

				cortman 
		ethan

				anna
		where is he

cortman signals to a hemocyte nurse who enters a dwelling space and returns 
carrying a small boy in her arms  he is pale and thin but not from 
infection  the boyethanis barely conscious needle marks line his bony 
arms and legs

anna runs to the nurse and takes the boy into her arms clutching him to her 
breast with love and desperation

				anna
		hey baby brother

he musters a smile for her then drifts back to slumber  anna examines the 
marks on his arms turns to cortman

				anna
		you said youd stop

				cortman
		when you returned yes re neville
		when he was defeated yes

atop the pole neville watches the scene play in front of him  his eyes stay 
fixed on anna on ethan

				anna
		well there he is  i did what you asked

				cortman
		and now you wish to go

				anna
		that was the bargain

				cortman
		where will you go anna  what will 
		you find re neville more like him  
		pathetic reminders of the past  leading 
		paranoid delusional lives  stay  
		you serve a purpose here  
		youve been treated well

				anna
		well  treated well

she attempts to exit the circle but every way she turns her path is blocked 
by hemocytes  she pulls ethan tight tries to force her way past them but 
the hemocytes sneer and laugh  the nurse grabs ethan from her and she 
screams

				anna
		noooooo

she lunges for him but eva comes up from behind and stops anna with an 
immobilizing hold  anna bellows at cortman

				anna
		you promised

				cortman
		silly thing  we need you here  
		we need you to breed

anna screams as eva forces her to the ground and binds her arms and ankles 
with leather straps  anna fights her with fury but eva is too strong an 
opponent  once anna is bound eva hefts her and carries up a staircase to a 
higher level of the multitiered village  the nurse follows with ethan

simultaneously neville is lifted into the air as the hemocyte warriors pull 
on the ropes  their purpose is to raise him above the village for all to 
view  a living totem  as neville ascends he can see the cavernous room 
into which the hemocytes take anna and her little brother

reveal the room

it is filled with filthy beds  lit by candles  inside the hemocyte nurses 
tend to the rooms inhabitants

dozens of humans  the elderly and infirm on one side youngsters on the 
other  the children invoke the most empathy  anywhere from three to twelve 
in years they lie bound  ivs of morphine or sedatives feed into their 
arms  some of the nurses feed the captives a horrible gruel while others 
draw blood collecting it from open wounds pouring it into large bowls and 
dishes

nevilles eyes are filled with shock anger and sadness  food  he locks at 
cortman with disgust  ascending a staircase as neville is lifted higher into 
the air cortman explains to his prize

				cortman
		savagery gives way to civilization  
		its a necessary step for us  fewer of 
		your kind remain and if we feast on each 
		other or others like uswe cannot survive  
		for a race to thrive it must not cannibalize 
		itself  therefore we raise our sustenance  
		nurture it let it grow  allow it to multiply

neville wants to berate cortman but his lips are sealed  his mouth remains 
tight

				cortman
		no harsh words neville  
		no condemnations  im disappointed

in the cavernous room anna is bound to a rusty cot  ethan to a small bed  
both are quickly narcotized  subdued

neville hangs his head in despair as his body is lifted into the rafters  
the hemocytes below secure the ropes to the ground  neville hangs above the 
village  for all to see  no possible means of escape

cortman stands on a ledge high above the village addresses the throng and 
points to neville

				cortman
		here he is and here he will stay

cortman leaps into the air and grabs hold of a pipe near the pole  hanging 
with one hand he extends the other allows his talons to extend and slashes 
the soles of nevilles feet  neville grimaces in pain but wont allow 
cortman the pleasure of a scream  blood begins to flow and drip from 
nevilles soles  the crimson drops fall

onto the tongues into the mouths of the hemocytes below  like children 
catching the first snowflakes of winter

				cortman
		drink children  
		drink the blood of the fallen

eva leads the hemocytes in a screech of support  far below not joining in 
the bacchanalia is the leader of the hemocyte clerics christopher  his 
eyes are on neville  does he betray a note of sympathy  he looks away and 
signals the drummers to take up a victorious rhythm

dangling above his enemiesnow his captorsnevilles chin drops to his 
chest  from the battle the beating the humiliation the defeathe is 
beyond weary  his eyelids droop his jaw relaxes  he catches himself and 
grinds his teeth together keeping his mouth closed tight why

he has not said a word since the fight at the house 
why

int  subterranean village morning

well yes it is morning but theres no way to tell down here aside from 
a few pinholes of early morning light peeping through a crack or crevice on 
the surface

on the various layers of the community we find the hemocytes exhausted  
from fighting from celebration from feasting  they prepare for sleep 
huddled together like pups

high above them strapped to the pole neville gently swings the ropes 
creaking  hes fighting to stay awake  above him on the catwalk of pipes 
ventilation ducts steel girders and old electrical cables appears 
christopher  he appears calm and serenenot a threat  he approaches 
neville until hes only a few feet away eyetoeye

				christopher
		you dont remember me do you

neville doesnt know what the hell hes talking about

				christopher
		i was a student of yours  at the university

neville is stunned  assesses the mans face  tries to imagine what he 
looked like before infection

				christopher
		christopher collier i was a theology major 
		i minored in historyi took your class on 
		ancient conflicts  as a seminarian i appreciated 
		your focus on moral issues in war  
		what will they make of this professor
		 the historians of the future  how will they 
		see the events of today  a victory or defeat  
		you dont care to comment  you were always 
		quite eloquent in your opinions

neville looks in the direction of the room containing the humans  
christopher follows his gaze comments

				christopher
		in every war in every great struggle we see 
		the sacrifice of innocents  are their lives worth it  
		if thousands will live should we allow a handful 
		to die  your words professor not mine  
		your questions  if i recall you never provided 
		us an answer

he turns back to neville

				christopher
		i was never ordained  as a priest  but i have 
		a flock  a barbaric one yes but we are unified 
		we are strong  does it surprise you to see us as 
		such  as something more than monsters

neville remains quiet  christopher reaches into his clothes and uses a damp 
rag to wash nevilles wounds

				christopher
		some of us are not without compassion 
		some of us saw cortmans pursuit of your defeat 
		a pointless selfish obsession  he wants you kept alive
		he always wanted you like this dont you see
		he wants a trophy  a living symbol of his strength
		hell bleed you feed from you have you father more 
		like yourself

he lifts a container of gruel  brings a spoonful to his lips but neville 
refuses to eat

				christopher
		youre behaving like a child

christopher tries to force feed him but neville spits out the food and 
snarls at christopher

				christopher
		fine  have it your way  soon youll be 
		begging for my kindness

he departs down a staircase to the village

close on nevilles face

he waits until christopher is gone  looks below and sees the hemocytes 
sleeping  and he opens his mouth revealing

the allinone tool

his tongue and inner cheeks are scratched and bleeding but he managed to 
keep it safe  all this time  very carefully he pushes it out onto his lips 
with his tongue then clenches it tight in his teeth  he maneuvers his hand 
through his bonds and extends his fingers

he only has one chance  takes a deep breath and spits out the tool it 
falls  nearly slips from his fingers but he snares it between his second 
and third fingers  twists it around until its safe in his palm  by touch 
he finds the serrated edge and goes to work on his bonds


int  subterranean village  two hours later  day

the hemocytes are fast asleep  communal slumber appears to be part of their 
regimen

the rafters

sweat dripping from his brow neville works diligently  his right hand 
already free he releases the left  using the bonds around his waist as a 
fulcrum he leans over stretching his back as far as it can go and cuts 
through the ropes around his legs and ankles  the serrated edge of the all
inone tool is almost smooth from wear  neville clenches it between his 
teeth and proceeds to wriggle out of the remaining bonds and barbed wire 
causing the pole to sway

below where the pole is secured to the ground the ropes start to creak a 
dozing hemocyte sniffs the air then returns to sleep

above neville grips an overhead pipe and pulls himself up out of bondage  
the ropes burn his skin and the barbed wire bites but he makes it up into 
the rafters  lying atop a ventilation duct he relaxes and breathes deeply  
he peers over the side and looks below  everyone asleep  his eyes stop on 
the cavernous chamber where the humans are kept  where anna is kept

he rolls away and slithers along the duct away from the village  must be 
quiet  absolutely quiet  he moves onto a thick roll of electrical cables 
and  almost falls  he grabs a cable and pulls himself up to safety  
crawling on his hands and knees he moves toward an entrance to a subway 
tunnel  almost there

and he slips  neville braces himself but must use one of his wounded feet 
to do so  he howls in silent pain

and the tool falls from his mouth

it sails down  we follow it as it lands inches away from the face of a 
hemocyte child  the little creatures eyes open and find the odd piece of 
metal

in the rafters neville knows he must move quickly  he follows the cables 
then drops to a concrete ledge  although the souls of his feet are tender 
from the cuts he must stand he must walk  he takes a few genteel steps 
then overcomes the pain and heads for the tunnel

he stops when he sees the hemocyte child before him  just staring at him  
she is afraid yes but her curiosity supersedes fear  the little hemocyte 
girl cocks her head and her eyes find an open cut on nevilles torso  the 
blood  like a father with a glass of warm milk he dips a finger into the 
blood and offers it to the girl  she cautiously hesitantly licks it up and 
of all things smiles at neville

he looks at the girls face  the innocence in her smile the simplicity the 
naturalness of her act  shes hungry  neville gently touches her head

				neville
			whispers
		go back to sleep sweetheart

she obeys  neville watches as she returns to her flock


int  subway tunnel  day

weak battered filthy and barely clothed neville forces himself down the 
tunnel  a few rays of light poke through from the surface but they are grey 
and misty  water drips through the ceiling of the tunnelit must be 
raining


ext  city street  day

a torrential downpour  in the middle of the waterslicked street the 
ventilation grating to a subway shaft is punched up and out  neville crawls 
out to the surface and lies on his back allowing the rain to wash over him  
freedom


ext  compound  day

the sky is filled with thunderclouds  rain turns the earth into a blanket of 
mud  neville plods through the muck cold and wet until he arrives at the 
site of his house  stops when he sees what little remains

a black shell  foundation and framework  charred and crumbling  debris 
ash and cinders litter the area  the rain creates a hissing cloud of steam 
and smoke

neville sloshes through the mud and shifts through debris finding charred 
reminders of the past three yearsthe books his paintings cds the 
exhaustive videotapes  now all a melted mass of paper plastic and metal

he finds a pair of shoes and joyously covers his scarred throbbing feet  
nearby in a pile of cinders is the frame for the photo of his wife and 
child  the glass cracked the frame scorched the picture itself burned 
away

he moves down into the foundation into the basement  most of the weapons 
are twisted and burned a few are functional  he takes essentialstwo 
handguns and a mini machine gun
searches for usable ammunition and thankfully finds a locker full untouched 
by fire  in a pile of ash he discovers the combat knife and ankle sheath

in the garage he finds shelter from the rain  the land rover is a junk 
heap horribly wrecked by fallen timbers  he finds a long pipe and uses it 
as a crowbar to open the trunk  inside is a pair of coveralls and 
unscathed an emergency kit  he slips into the coveralls opens the kit and 
checks his suppliesfreezedried food a tool kit medical supplies a 
flashlight and batteries  its enough  enough to start over

he checks the sports carwrecked  next the motorcycle  thanks to the 
lucky placement of a fallen sheet of corrugated steel it survived  he 
tosses off the metal and pulls out the bike  its smokedamaged scorched 
and a few of the hoses are melted but it will work  he can get it to work


ext  compound  day  an hour later

the rain still batters the earths surface  thunder and lightning coming in 
from the pacific  neville has fashioned a pair off makeshift saddlebags and 
a gun rack on the bike  he climbs aboard the motorcycle and tries to start 
it  no go the first time but the second

the bikes engine roars to life  he checks the gas gaugea full tank  
enough to get 
him  where  where bob  who knows  he plows through the mud

straight ahead  
no looking back

neville reaches the entrance to the bridge and pulls off onto a promontory
where tourists used to stop and take pictures  he comes to a stop but keep 
the engine running  he looks down the length of the bridge at the ocean 
back at the city  his eyes find the lighthouse where he set free the dog  
the tugboat at the end of the pier

the ocean is rough waves break on the shoreline  storm clouds gather in 
number and force  rain pounds down on him  neville assesses it all  
everything  past present future

and knows what he must do

comes to a stop


int switching yard  control room  dusk

like a kid with his first model train set neville checks the maps and plots 
a course on the big board detailing the lines throughout the city  he 
throws a series of switches and the sound of rails and tracks being put in 
place reverberates throughout the tunnels and yard


int  subway train

in the lead car neville mixes the chemicals into the pipes and attaches the 
blasting caps  once a half dozen pine bombs are complete he checks and 
loads each of his guns

remembering the rhythm of the rails

bellows orders to eva and her warriors

the train bursts through a pile of debris flattening a few hemocyte warriors 
and screeches to a stop  thirty fifty descend upon the lead car

a passenger door hisses open and out steps neville  and his machine gun  he 
opens fire cutting through the attackers  he heaves the first pipe bomb

it explodes with white light  not a damaging blast but the chemicals burn 
with a white hot intensity  he throws another and another and another  
soon the center area is bathed in a brilliant glow

the light blinds the hemocytes  they screech and run for cover  more 
significantly the sight of neville terrifies them  for many of them its 
as if the devil has been resurrected and hes come for retribution  mothers 
lead children into the rafters nurses and clerics pray and flee

		no  no

eva and the warriors will fight  if they could only see  blindly they move 
toward the train  neville tosses a bomb at the base of the stairs clearing 
a path  he grabs two bombs and runs firing the machine gun only when 
necessary  he throws a tackle into a hemocyte warrior uses the butt of the 
gun on another and makes it up the stairs


int  cavernous room  night

neville bursts into the space brandishing his weapon  its nurses and 
clerics in here and theyre petrified  they hiss and screech but theyre 
not the fighting type

neville searches bed after bed  children old men wrinkled women  glassy
eyed empty faces  and then he finds anna  he kneels beside her bed and 
rips out the iv 
not completely drugged her sad eyes find his and search for compassion for 
understanding

neville pulls out the combat knife

 and hurriedly cuts through her bonds

another child  neville lowers the gun

				christopher

hemocyte warriors appear at the door

neville sees them and rolls a pipe bomb right at them  it explodes sending 
them flying and flaming into the air  the room catches fire  neville lifts 
a weak child into his arms and heads for the stairs  anna urges the children 
to follow


int  hemocyte village  night

bomb again clearing a path  he and anna usher the children past blinded 
hemocytes into the train


int  subway train  night

cars  when neville opens the door to the third he comes facetoface with a 
hemocyte warrior
although unable to see the creature fiercely latches onto neville  the 
children shriek  the machine gun falls from nevilles grasp and he struggles 
to reach a handgun in his belt  the hemocyte raises his talons

blam  anna fells him with a single shot to the heart  neville pushes the 
body out of the train and seals the doors  as anna secures the children

hemocytes storm the train  as their angry fists pound against the windows 
neville gets the train the hell out of there

react he grabs the machine gun loads a fresh clip and positions anna at the 
controls

warrior  the children huddle in fear in a far corner  the muscular hemocyte 
runs toward neville  neville shoots but this guy is big and rushing on

grins and moves in for the kill  neville pulls out the last pipe bomb and 
lobs it at the hemocyte

				neville
		say goodbye

neville dives  the bomb explodes inches in front of the muscular hemocyte 
igniting him and the car in bright white fire  in the second car neville 
attempts to calm and quiet the distraught children but when he hears glass 
crash and anna scream he tells them

				neville
		stay here  dont move

in the lead car neville finds eva cradling ethan in her arms  cortman holds 
a struggling anna from behind his talons at her throat  although still 
moving damn fast with no one at the controls the train is losing speed  
neville raises the machine gun but cortman can only sneer

				cortman
		put that wretched thing down

cortmans talon presses into annas flesh  neville lowers the weapon  
cortman gestures to the smashed open window

				cortman

neville complies and throws the machine gun away

				cortman
		on your knees

				neville 
		no

				cortman
		on your knees neville and beg for her life  
		do it or shell watch her brother die quite 
		painfully

				cortman

neville drops to the other

				neville
		cortman  do you pray

		if you dont i would start

neville goes to floor and braces himself  cortman turns  through the 
front window he sees  a thick metal door

aisle into the water  he reaches but shes gone  using the seats as a 
ladder anna pulls herself out of the water  shes nearly clear when  
cortman grabs her ankle  anna screams  cortman emerges from the water and

it and finds ethan cowering in a fetal position  he cautiously kneels 
gently extends his hand

				neville

moving around the circular catwalk

				cortman
		youre very resilient ill give you that

neville continues to back off cortman closing in

				cortman
		shouldnt you simply give in join the 
		rest of them die

side into the sea  cortman laughs  pulls in his talons and proceeds to 
pummel neville with his fists  neville can barely defend himself  he falls 
and pulls himself up  neville appears hopelessly doomed to defeat  cortman 
extends his talons and moves in  like a cat neville scurries up the 
lighthouse dome  its slippery but he makes it to the very top clinging to 
the lightning rod

				cortman
		please robert  where do you think
		youre going

				neville
		i dont know ben

neville stands and leans against the rod using his weight to snap it free 
from its mooring

				neville
		but you can go to hell

with the lightning rod extended like a spear neville slides down the dome 
and drives it straight into cortmans heart cortman howls with pain  his 
chest bursts with crimson blood gurgles from his throat and all he can 
mutter is

				cortman
		no

hatch  like the hand of god a bolt of lightning slashes across the night 
sky and touches the spike of metal in cortmans chest  the top of the 
lighthouseand cortman
explodes in a burst of white sparks  cortmans scream echoes  his scorched 
body falls into the ocean

climbs atop a large rock  the leader
