				   inez wallacethe rko trademark fades out to reveal a road lined with palm
	trees spectrally long and straight like a vista in a dali
	painting  along this road and from a far distance two tiny
	figures advance toward the camera  over this scene the title
	and credits are superimposed  the two figures continue to
	advance growing more discernible all the time

	as the credits fade the two human figures advancing along
	the road are more clearly discernible  although they are not
	close enough to distinguish their faces it can be seen that
	one of them is an enormously tall cadaverous negro clothed
	only by ragged tightfitting trousers and that the other is
	nurse dressed in crisp white uniform and cap with a dark
	cloak over her shoulders

		had anyone said that to me a year
		ago im not at all sure i would
		have known what a zombie was i
		might have had some notion  that
		they were strange and frightening
		and perhaps a little funny  but i
		have walked with a zombie

	closer

	through the wroughtiron gate into the garden 
  
	fort holland is a onestory house built around the garden
	with low covered porches to give shade and breezeway  at the
	open end of the u is a great gate much like the wroughtiron
	gates of new orleans  through this betsy can see the garden
	and its profusion of verdure azalea bougainvillea roses 
	much like california planting no exotic orchids or man
	eating venus jugs  just ordinary pretty semitropic
	flowers and shrubs

	the separate rooms are open to the garden but have jalousies
	of thin wood to give privacy when needed  at one corner
	stands a big stone tower obviously a relic of some previous
	building  the walls of the house have been built right up to
	and around the tower so that it has become part of the
	building itself  on the garden side of the tower is the
	fountain the most outstanding feature of this spring or
	fountain which flows from a crevice in the stones of the
	tower is that instead of falling directly into the cistern
	it falls first onto the shoulders of the enormous teakwood
	figurehead of st sebastian from the shoulders of the saint
	it drips down in two runnels over his breast  the wooden
	breast of the statue is pierced with six long iron arrows

	paint still cling to the halo above his head  betsy and the
	coachman come up to the grillwork of the gate  betsy looks

	pulls a bell rope suspended from the gate  as the bell
	begins to ring he pushes the gate open  betsy walks

	as in the rest of the house the furniture is not the usual
	tropical porch furniture but is neat serviceable
	furnishings such as an welltodo family established for a

	ornaments  a woven grass rug lies on the floor  betsy is
	seated before the dressing table putting the last touches to
	her hair  she has changed her clothes and is wearing a
	simple linen dress  there is a discreet rap on the
	jalousied door which separates the room from the garden 
	betsy crosses the room and opens the door  a colored man in
	a butlers white jacket stands there  this is clement

	moves it down the table nearer to betsy

	for some doorway or an ascending flight of stairs

				holland
		yes  but it was once the
		figurehead of a slave ship  thats
		where our people came from  from
		the misery and pain of slavery for
		generations they found life a
		burden thats why they still weep
		when a child is born  and make
		merry at a burial

	clement the lantern still in his hand passes close behind
	them  for a moment they turn and look at his black still
	face underlit by the rays of the lantern  it reflects all
	the sadness of slave people and slave ways  he goes by the

	the path

	and holds betsys big toe between thumb and forefinger  she
	shakes it gently  betsy wakes

				alma
		good morning miss

	betsy starts to get up and alma protests

				alma contd
		dont get up miss  i brought your
		breakfast  just like i do for miss

	she turns to reveal right and lefthanded coffee pots behind
	her on a tray  also on the tray is an enormous puffedup
	brioche

				betsy
		but im miss jessicas nurse alma 
		you dont have to do that for me

				alma
		i know miss  but i like to do it 
		i like to tend for miss jessica and
		i want to tend for you  you settle
		right back now and ill mix you
		your coffee

				betsy
			pulling the pillow up
			behind her to make

		thank you alma

	alma takes a cup and places it on the little table near the
	bed  she takes up the two coffee pots and simultaneously
	with a deft movement pours the hot milk and the hot coffee
	into the cup  she sweetens it and creams it and passes it to
	betsy questioning betsy with upraised sugar tongs and cream
	pitcher before each move

				alma
			while shes pouring the
			coffee
		miss jessica used to say this is
		the only way for a lady to break
		her fast  in bed with a lacy
		cushion to bank her head up if
		youd only seen her miss connell
		she looked so pretty

				betsy
		she must have been beautiful  what
		happened to her alma

				alma
		she was very sick and then she went
		mindless miss

				betsy
			reassuringly
		well see if we cant make her
		well alma you and i

				alma
		i do my best  every day i dress
		her just as beautifully as if she
		was well  its just like dressing
		a great big doll 

	as she talks alma picks up the plate with the brioche and
	places it at the bedside  she puts a knife and fork on the
	plate  betsy sets down her coffee cup and picks up the
	plate

				betsy
		whats this

				alma
		a puffup i call it  but miss
		jessica always says brioche

				betsy
		looks like an awful lot of
		breakfast  i dont know whether
		ill be able to get away with it

	she puts her fork into it and the whole enormous structure
	of the pastry falls into tiny bits  both she and alma burst
	into peals of laughter

							dissolveint fort holland living room and office  daythis room is fairly long with jalousied doors and windows
	like the other rooms in the house  it is tastefully
	furnished and there is a large square rosewood piano in one
	corner of the room  the rather formal elegant furniture
	shows up nicely against the whitewashed plaster walls  at
	one end is a raised portion with a low railing surrounding
	it  here holland has his office

	there is a trestle table with a straight chair behind it
	typewriter on a stand and a small wooden filing cabinet with
	an oldfashioned letterpress on top of it  there is a
	surveyors map of the plantation on one wall and on the
	other a geodetic survey chart of the island of st sebastian 
	for 75c we can purchase the us geodetic chart of anacapa
	island engraved by whistler possibly the most beautiful map
	ever drawn  we can use this for the map of our fictitious
	island  holland is seated at the table with a ledger open
	before him  he has obviously been working  betsy sits in a
	chair drawn up to one corner of the table  she is in her
	nurses uniform

				holland
		i made it clear in my letter to the
		company  this is not a position
		for a frightened girl

				betsy
			quietly but on the
			defensive
		i am not a frightened girl

				holland
		thats hard to believe after what
		happened last night

				betsy
			before he can continue
		if i were as timid as you seem to
		think mr holland i wouldnt have
		gone into the tower in the first
		place

				holland
		and what is so alarming about the
		tower miss connell

				betsy
			not so sure of herself
		nothing  really  but you must
		admit its an eerie sort of place  
		so dark 

				holland
			smiling faintly
		surely nurses arent afraid of the
		dark

				betsy
			indignantly
		of course not  

	holland waits  looking at her a little quizzically

				betsy contd
		but frankly it was something of a
		shock to see my patient that way
		for the first time  no one had
		told me mrs holland was a mental
		case

				holland
		a mental case

				betsy
		im sorry

				holland
			again the impersonal
			employer
		why should you be  my wife is a
		mental case  please keep that in
		mind miss connell  particularly
		when some of the foolish people of
		this island start talking to you
		about zombies

	paul rises and walks around the desk  betsy also stands

				holland contd
		you will find slave superstition a
		contagious thing  some people let
		it get the better of them
			breaks off and looks at
			her intently
		i dont think you will

				betsy
		no

	holland gets up and crosses to the jalousied door  he holds
	it open for betsy to precede him into the garden

				holland
		come along  ill introduce you to
		dr maxwell and your patientint jessicas bedroom  dayit is a beautiful womans bedroom feminine but with no
	suggestion of the bagnic elegant rather than seductive and
	reflecting a playful yet sophisticated taste  the furniture
	is biedermeier  there is a large bed a trim chaise lounge
	a little slipper chair and in one corner of the room that
	hallmark of great vanity a triplescreen fulllength
	mirror also a biedermeier style  before it is a tabouret
	the surface of which is literally covered with expensive
	looking perfume bottles and cosmetic jars  mrs holland had
	evidently taken the tasks of beauty seriously enough to stand
	up to them  there is one picture in the room  it is
	boecklins the isle of the dead framed in a narrow frame
	of dark wood  near the open window stands a beautiful gilt
	parlour harp size 22  behind it arranged conveniently for
	playing is a small empire chair  there is no other
	furniture near this arrangement and the harp the empty
	chair and windstirred glass curtains give a dual effect of
	elegance and loneliness

	the camera is focused on this harp as the scene opens  the
	glass curtains blown by the wind steal across the strings
	bringing forth tinkling notes

	the camera pans right to reveal betsy and dr maxwell at mrs
	hollands bedside  dr maxwell is a small neat man with a
	charming voice and a pleasant but somewhat professional
	personality  he is dressed in tropical whites and wears a
	cummerbund  alma is removing the breakfast tray and as she
	passes betsy on her way to the door she makes a little
	curtsey  mrs holland is lying back against the pillows on
	her bed in a semireclining position 
	
	in the daylight her emaciated pale face and great empty
	eyes are pitiful but no longer frightening

				dr maxwell
		im afraid it wont be easy for me
		to explain mrs hollands illness
		miss connell  we have our own
		diseases here  but if youll sit
		down 
			indicates a chair

	betsy seats herself  dr maxwell takes a cigarette case from
	his pocket  he takes a cigarette holds it up

				dr maxwell contd
		to put it simply  mrs holland had
		one of those high fevers often found
		with our tropical maladies  we might
		say that portions of the spinal cord
		and certain lobes of the mind were
		burned out by this fever  the result
		is what you see  a woman bereft of
		will power unable to speak or even
		to act by herself  she will obey
		simple commands

				betsy
		does she suffer

				dr maxwell
		i dont know  i prefer to think of
		her as a sleepwalker who can never
		be awakened  feeling nothing
		knowing nothing  

	betsy looks to jessica

				dr maxwell contd
		theres very little we can do
		except keep her physically
		comfortable  light diet  some
		exercise 

				betsy
		she can never be cured

				dr maxwell
		ive never heard of a cure

				betsy
		is this disease common in the
		tropics

				dr maxwell
		fortunately not  this is my first
		experience with it as a physician 
		but i have seen halfwitted field
		hands  whom the other peasants
		call zombies  i am sure they
		suffer from a similar destruction
		of spinal nerves as the result of
		high fever

	he crosses the room and clasps shut the black leather bag in
	which he carries his medicine kit  betsy rises and walks
	over to him

				betsy
		could you give me the details of
		treatment and diet

	dr maxwell picks up a couple of sheets of typewritten paper
	which have been lying beside the bed  he hands them to
	betsy

				dr maxwell
		i prepared these for you last
		night miss connell

				betsy
			taking the papers
		thank you

	he picks up his bag and walks toward the door  betsy walks
	with him  at the door he half turns and says

				dr maxwell
		ill be by in a day or so miss
		connell and see how you are
		getting on

	betsy nods and then turns back into the room  she walks up
	to the bed and stands looking at jessica then down at the
	list of typewritten instructions  evidently the list calls
	for her to carry out some detail of the regime for she puts
	it down and starts out of the room in a businesslike fashion

							dissolveext fountain  dayholland is standing by the fountain as betsy comes out of the
	door of the tower and starts to cross the garden  he turns
	toward her  she stops and smiles

				holland
		you didnt find your patient so
		frightening in the daylight did
		you

				betsy
		mrs holland must have been
		beautiful 

				holland
			coldly
		many people thought her beautiful 

	betsy is about to pass on when he asks abruptly

				holland contd
		tell me miss connell do you
		consider yourself pretty

	betsy is a little taken aback by this but she recovers
	herself

				betsy
		i suppose so  yes

				holland
		and charming

				betsy
		ive never given it much thought

				holland
		dont  it will save you a great
		deal of trouble and other people a
		great  unhappiness

	betsy is puzzled and interested  she stands a moment and
	then starts off

							fade out

	slowly and a little aimlessly down one of the village
	streets

				rands voice
		betsy

	betsy turns as she hears her name and sees rand mounted on
	a white saddle mule  the mule is one of those delicate
	single footed saddle animals which they breed in central
	america and the west indies very smartlooking and with good
	furniture  the saddle should be particularly wellchosen 
	most west indian planters use an english saddle with long
	stirrups  sometimes a machete in a leather scabbard hangs
	from the near side of the saddle  he maneuvers the mule
	between a cart and a vendor balancing two baskets on a pole
	over his shoulders then brings the animal to a halt beside
	her

				rand
		where do you think youre going

				betsy
		its my day off

				rand
		but what in the world can you do
		with a day off in st sebastian

				betsy
			a little ruefully
		i was just beginning to wonder 
		arent there shops restaurants and
		things

				rand
		well  and things  might be a
		better description of what youll
		find  id better come along and
		show you the town

		ounces

	to distract her

	brings the drink that rand ordered  rand gulps thirstily at

			sincerely
		i wish i hadnt heard

	lighting one of the crude kerosene street lamps of st

	finally lights up he lowers the glass chimney with another
	stick he carries

	from the beach comes the sound of a guitar and a man singing 
	it is very faint at first but as it comes closer we can
	recognize the voice of the calypso singer and the melody he
	was singing when rand interrupted him

	sings

	he waves bayard on and stops for a moment to speak with
	betsy

				holland
		i heard about your little
		misadventure yesterday miss
		connell  
			with a smile
		on your first day off too

				betsy
		well i had a good time up to a
		point

				holland
			sincerely
		wesley can be very entertaining

				betsy
			encouraged by his tone
		yes he can  but ive been
		wondering  you know if you could
		leave the whisky decanter off the
		table 

				holland
		its always stood there miss
		connell  i can remember it in my
		grandfathers time and my fathers 
		im afraid it will have to remain

				betsy
		but for wes  it must be a
		temptation to him  

				holland
		ive no sympathy with people who
		cant resist temptation

				betsy
		still i feel you should remove the
		decanter  wes is not an alcoholic
		yet mr holland but as a nurse i can 
		tell you that it wont be long before he is

				holland
			coldly
		im afraid the decanter will have
		to stay where it is  i engaged
		you miss connell to take care of
		my wife not my brother  

	they look at each other for a moment then betsy turns and
	walks off without a word  holland turns to rejoin bayard at
	the gate

							dissolveext terrace  dining table  nightit is a hot windy night  the bushes in the garden move
	violently with the gusts of wind  even protected as they are
	by the great glass hurricane lamps the candle flames that
	light the table are agitated and stir restlessly  tonight
	there are four people at dinner holland rand betsy in a
	simple print dress and jessica in a lovely evening gown
	that leaves her shoulders and arms bare  they have finished
	the first portion of their meal and clement is taking off the
	soup plates  somewhere off in the hills there is the
	ululating sounds of a great sea conch being blown

				betsy
		you dont seem very disturbed by
		it  ive always thought voodoo was
		something to be scared of the
		drums sounded in the hills and
		everybody was frightened

				holland
		im afraid its not very
		frightening  they have their songs
		and dances and carry on and
		finally as i understand it one of
		the gods comes down and speaks
		through one of the people

				rand
		for some reason they always seem
		to pick a night like this  this
		wind even sets me on edge

	he reaches out with his hand and then looks around the table 
	it is obvious something is missing  both betsy and holland
	notice his halfgesture  betsy glances at holland  he
	smiles and nods  

				rand contd
		clement 

	clement busy at the sideboard looks around toward him

				rand contd
		youve forgotten the decanter

				holland
		i think from now on wes well try
		serving dinner without it

				rand
		oh i see  the lord of the manor
		has decided to abolish one of the
		tribal customs

	holland makes no answer  the conches blow wildly in the
	hills and a flurry of wind sweeps the garden

				rand contd
		an economy move i suppose  or
		perhaps paul you decided on a
		finer moral standard for our happy
		little household now that miss
		connell is with us

	holland still keeps his silence although the muscles in his
	jaw twitch

				rand contd
		what are you trying to do impress
		her

				holland
		lets drop it now wes  we can
		talk about it later if you want

	rand glowers at him and makes no immediate answer  a great
	gust of wind blows across the garden  the candle flames
	level out in one direction and then the other

				rand
		but i want to talk now  why have
		you decided to take the whiskey off
		the table  whats behind it  what
		nice sadistic little plot is
		brewing this time paul

				holland
			with a glance at betsy
		lets not discuss it wes

	the conches sound again in the hills wildly and yet
	monotonously

				rand
			with great sarcasm
		lets not quarrel before the
		ladies  lets be reserved and
		gentlemanly
			jumping to his feet
		you were so gentlemanly when you
		drove jessica insane  so polite
		when you made her into that

	he subsides in his chair shaken entirely out of control 
	he doesnt look at holland nor at betsy but at jessica 
	they sit there for a moment in complete silence  then
	holland obviously holding in his temper rises and says

				holland
		miss connell i think it would be
		best if i had clement bring the
		rest of your dinner to your room

	he turns and goes into the living room  betsy also starts to
	rise  rand still stares at jessica

							dissolveint betsys bedroom  nightthe room is in darkness  betsy stands leaning against one of
	the jalousies looking out through the slit between two
	panels  over the scene comes the sad masculine sorrow of
	the liebestod  it is being played well and forcefully on the
	piano in the living roomint living room  nightfrom her window betsy can see holland playing the pianoint betsys bedroom  nightbetsy stands watching him  then suddenly as if compelled
	she leaves the window opens the jalousied door and goes
	quickly out into the gardenint living room  nightholland is still playing  the sound of the door opening is
	heard  it startles him and he turns toward the sound  he
	sees betsy and rises to face her as she steps into the room

				betsy
		i heard you playing 

				holland
			trying to hide behind
			brittleness
		i often do

				betsy
			disregarding his remark
		i know what you went through
		tonight  i kept thinking of what
		you said that all good things died
		here violently 

				holland
		why did you come in here

				betsy
		i dont know  i wanted to help
		you and now that im here i dont
		know how

	holland comes close to her and looks down into her eyes

				holland
			with unexpected
			sincerity
		you have helped me  i want you to
		know im sorry i brought you here
		when i thought of a nurse i
		thought of someone hard and
		impersonal

				betsy
			looking past him into the
			garden
		i love fort holland

				holland
		what you saw tonight  two
		brothers at each others throat and
		a woman driven mad by her own
		husband  do you love that

				betsy
		you didnt drive her mad

				holland
		didnt i  i dont know  thats
		the simple truth of it  i dont
		know

	betsy shakes her head and moves closer to him  her face
	upturned to his is filled with pity

				holland contd
		before jessica was taken ill there
		was a scene  an ugly scene  i
		told her i wouldnt let her go
		that id hold her by force if
		necessary

	betsy puts her hand on his arm in an instinctive gesture of
	sympathy and comfort  holland looks down at her hand and
	then searchingly into her face

				holland contd
		you wouldnt understand that kind
		of love  you never knew jessica as
		she was  beautiful restless
		willful  living in a world with
		room for nothing but her own image
		and her own desires

	betsy gently draws her hand away  she watches his face lost
	in remembering

				holland contd
		she promised so much  warmth and
		sweetnessshe promised 

	in the hills the conches blow wildly echoing and answering
	each other from every direction  for a brief moment the
	noise is so loud holland could not speak if he wanted to and
	then when he can and does his voice has changed entirely 
	it is cold  it cuts between him and betsy like a sword

				holland contd
		i think it may be best for all of
		us not to discuss this again 
		thank you  i know you meant to be
		kind

							dissolveext fountain  nightbetsy stands looking into the dark cistern  the wind still
	blows and the conches are sounding from the hills  but the
	noise of the water flowing over the shoulders of st
	sebastian can be heard above these other sounds  the iron
	arrows in his breast glisten

				betsy
			narrating
		i dont know how their own love is
		revealed to other women  maybe in
		their sweethearts arms  i dont
		know  to me it came that night
		after paul holland almost thrust me
		from the room and certainly thrust
		me from his life i said to myself
		i love him  and even as i said
		it i knew he still loved his wife 
		then because i loved him i felt i
		had to restore her to him  to
		make her what she had been before 
		to make him happy

	as the narrators voice ceases the camera holds on that
	small silent figure before the fountain

							fade out

	fade inint mrs hollands bedroom  dayjessica is seated before the triptych mirror facing it
	blankly  at the other end of the room stand betsy and dr
	maxwell  paul his back to the window faces them

				holland
		all that you say comes down to the
		same thing  you are asking me to
		pass a sentence of life or death on
		my own wife

				dr maxwell
		insulin shock treatment is an
		extreme measure mr holland   
		but  as miss connell pointed out
		when she suggested it  this is an
		extreme case

				holland
			to betsy
		you admit that it is terribly
		dangerous why do you advise it

				betsy
		ive worked with it  ive seen
		cures it is at least a hope

				dr maxwell
		its the very danger itself that
		makes the cure possible mr
		holland  the insulin produces a
		state of coma a stupor  the
		patient is revived from the coma by
		a violent overwhelming nerve shock
		that nerve shock can kill  but it
		can also restore the damaged mind

				holland
		i dont know  i dont know

				dr maxwell
			sympathetically
		it is a hard decision to make 
		but yours is only a technical
		responsibility

				holland
		technical responsibility real
		responsibility  what difference
		does it make
			turns back to face them
		 jessica lives  or she dies 
		thats what were talking about 

	betsy turns and looks across the room to where jessica sits
	motionless before the mirror

				betsy
		you are wrong mr holland

	she turns back to face him

				betsy contd
		it is not a question of life or
		death  your wife is not living 
		she is in a world that is empty of
		joy or meaning  we have a chance
		to give her life back to her 

	holland stares at her  he turns to the window and stands for
	a moment with his back to the room

							dissolve 

	omittedint arched doorway of mrs hollands bedroom  nightthrough the doorway we see the enormous shadows of betsy and
	dr maxwell on the wall as they work over their patient 
	we hear the murmur of their voices although we cannot hear
	what they are saying  in the doorway itself leaning against
	the wall looking toward the room expectantly anxiously is
	holland half hidden in the shadows of the arch  the shadows
	on the wall straighten up  we see betsy in shadow drawing
	her hand wearily across her forehead  still in shadow she
	turns toward the door her shadow grows enormous as she comes
	toward the source of light

	as betsy comes under the arch holland moves to meet her 
	she turns to him

				holland
			tensely
		well

				betsy
		she is alive mr holland  thats
		all

	there is a little pause  then betsy looks at holland her
	eyes glistening with tears  betsy turns away slightly
	closing her eyes for a moment to steady herself  holland
	puts his hands on her shoulders and turns her back to face
	him

				holland
			gently
		dont take it to heart betsy

				betsy
		i imagined this so differently

	holland takes his hand from her shoulders

				holland
		ive been waiting here for hours
		trying to imagine jessica well
		again  wondering what id feel 
		i could see jessica as she used to
		be i could hear her say in that
		sweet mocking voice paul
		darling  the whole thing
		beginning all over again

				betsy
			dully
		and instead  i came  bringing
		you nothing

				holland
			slowly looking down at
			her
		instead  you come with sympathy
		betsy and a generous heart 
		dont forget that  dont call it
		nothing

	betsy turns wearily and returns to the sick room  holland is
	about to follow her when he hears a low chuckle and turns to
	see who it isint the passage to the tower door as seen from jessicasroom  daya few feet from holland leaning against the wall is rand 
	he has evidently been there some time  he is not drunk but
	it is obvious he has been drinking  holland walks down the
	short corridor toward him

				rand
		very sad very sweet  the noble
		husband and the noble nurse
		comforting each other  because
		the patient still lives  ive been
		imagining too paul  you didnt
		think of that did you  i saw
		jessica coming across the garden i
		heard her voicethere are two pages missing at this point where paul and
	wesley end their conversation  the script picks up in the
	middle of the next scene just after almas sister has visited
	with her babybetsy
		i suppose not

		not even doctor maxwell

				betsy
		doctors and nurses can only do so
		much alma  they cant cure

		thats nonsense alma

				alma
		they even cure nonsense miss
		betsy  mama rose was mindless  i
		was at the houmfort when the
		houngan brought her mind back 

				betsy
		you mean mama rose was like mrs
		holland

				alma
		no  she was mindless but not like
		miss jessica  but the houngan
		cured her

				betsy
		are you trying to tell me that the
		houngan  the voodoo priest 
		could cure mrs holland

				alma
		yes miss betsy  i mean that  the
		houngan will speak to the rada
		drums and the drums will speak to
		shango and damballa 

	the camera moves in to a close two shot of both womens
	faces  betsy looking thoughtfully at alma and alma returning
	the gaze with equal intensity

							dissolveint the dispensary  daythis is a small plainly furnished room with a plain table a
	few bentwood chairs and a medicine cabinet and a few

	rubbing ointment on a sore on his chest  betsy in street
	clothes watcher her  mrs rand finishes her work on the
	little boys chest and begins to put his little shirt back on
	him  an obeah bag tied around his neck on a string gets in

	that the little boy can see it

				mrs rand
		tipeter how do you ever expect to
		get to heaven with one foot in the
		voodoo houmfort and the other in
		the baptist church  

	the little black boy looks at her with rolling eyes but does
	not answer  she gives him a playful pat on the behind
	starting him on his way to the door

				mrs rand contd
			to betsy cheerfully
		some of this native nonsense the
		houngan has his prescription and
		dr maxwell and i have ours

				betsy
		youve never said anything about
		voodoo before mrs rand

				mrs rand
		havent i  i suppose i take it for
		granted its just part of everyday
		life here

				betsy
		you dont believe in it

				mrs rand
		a missionarys widow  it isnt

				betsy
		i dont mean believe like
		believing in a religion  i mean
		do you believe it has power  do
		you think it could heal a sick
		person

				mrs rand
			looking hard at betsy for
			a moment
		frankly my dear i didnt expect
		anything like this from a nice
		levelheaded girl  what are you
		driving at

				betsy
		i heard the servants talking about
		someone called mama rose they said
		she had been mindless

				mrs rand
		her son drowned  she brooded until
		her mind was affected all the
		houngan did was coax her out of it
		with a little practical psychologypages are missing at this point as betsy and
	jessica leave fort holland and travel across the sugar cane
	fields to the houmfortext the houmfort  nightlong shot  the camera is behind betsy and jessica as they go
	toward the houmfort through the sugar cane  we see this
	voodoo temple as they go toward it  it is a rickety
	structure of poles and laths roofed over with a thin thatch
	of sugar cane and straw  it forms a sort of rude pergola 
	in the center of this structure is a small cubicle hut made
	of rough boards but neatly whitewashed  from the rafters of
	the main structure hang crude chandeliers of tin which give
	light to the ceremonies

	please see pages 28 to 31 life magazine december 13 1937 
	all the details mentioned above are graphically illustrated

	near the little hut in the center of the houmfort stands an
	altar covered with a lace tablecloth and littered with a
	childish jumble of plates candles little colored stones and
	bottles  before this altar stands the houngan the high
	priest of the voodoo ceremonies a small stoopshouldered
	man in a worn white coat and trousers with ragged cuffs 
	several mildlooking negroes in white trousers and shirts sit
	in kitchen chairs on one side of the altar with rada drums
	between their knees  grouped around this altar in a loose
	semicircle are the worshippers a group of mildmannered
	poorlybutneatlydressed negroes  they seem to have made an
	effort to dress in their best and their best is very poor
	indeed    as betsy approaches she can see familiar faces 
	as she comes up they turn and look at her  they are not
	hostile nor greatly surprised just mildly curious  leading
	jessica by the hand betsy takes her place at one end of the
	semicircle around the altar  her arrival has in no way
	interrupted the ceremonies  the houngan continues to chant
	before the altar the rada drums beat and the crowd sings the
	chorus of the shango song at the proper intervals  it is all
	very decorous and decidedly religious in tone  no sooner has
	betsy taken her place with the others than the shango ritual
	approaches its climax  the sabreur a colored man dressed in
	white shirt and trousers with a neat dark tie knotted under
	his collar comes in bearing a sabre in his right hand
	holding it in stately almost processional manner  he
	advances to the altar strikes it three times and at this
	signal two colored women dressed in white beguine dresses
	with square cut necks an essential part of this religious
	costume come forward  one holds a white leghorn chicken and
	the other carries a white rooster they come together to the
	altar and for a moment the figures of the houngan the
	sabreur and the two mamlois hide the actual blood sacrifice
	from us  only the fact that the drumming and the singing
	reach a climactic pitch reveal that some important portion of
	the ceremony has taken place  instantly the drumming and the
	singing stops  a young colored girl jumps up from her seat
	among the worshippers and begins shivering and quaking
	crying out wordlessly  there is a cry from the people

				the people
		put the god in her put the god in
		her

	the houngan prances forward followed by the sabreur the
	houngan holds a little saucer in his hand with some dark
	liquid at the bottom of it  he dips four fingers into this
	liquid while the girl quivers and writhes before him in
	religious ecstasy  he marks her forehead with four strange
	marks one with each finger  the sabreur crying out the
	name of shango four times points his sabre to the four
	directions of the compass there is an immediate
	transformation in the girl  her frenzy ceases  she seems to
	be filled with a jubilant calm and dances into the cleared
	space before the altar her words are no longer meaningless 
	they have taken shape and form and when she speaks she
	speaks with great resonance as if her voice came from
	somewhere other than her own throat  she is possessed by the
	god shango

	one by one people from among the group of devotees dance
	into the circle go up to her and beg for favors one woman
	leads a little boy up to her  we hear her words as she calls
	out to the possessed girl

				woman
		make him rich shango  make him
		rich

	the girl lays her fingers on the boys eyes and then takes
	his shoulders and turns him around three times evidently
	this is absolute guarantee of an enormous income tax to be
	paid at st sebastian  the woman and her son retire happily
	pleased and grinning  finally exhausted the girl possessed
	of the god shango sinks to her knees and then falls
	fainting to the floor two colored men come in carry her
	away  a great cry rises from the voodoo worshippers

				worshippers
		damballa  damballa  damballa
		damballa

	the drums find a new rhythm  the houngan retires to one
	corner of the altar the sabreur to the other  two young
	girls their beguine dresses slashed and torn dance in from
	either side  this is a wild and an impassioned dance a
	dance to damballa  there is no singing only an occasional
	call from the crowd come to us damballa the dancers
	reach the climax of their dance and strike a plastic pose
	before the altar each kneeling on one knee their arms held
	to their breasts their foreheads butted together  although
	not a muscle moves one can almost feel the tension of these
	two bodies  one of the rada drummers comes up and crouches
	down holding a small drum almost under the chins of the two
	girls

	the other drummers stop playing and he begins to beat a quick
	staccato rhythm that grows faster and faster  in this
	playing as in the pose of the girls there is tremendous
	tension  by now all cries have ceased everyone is silent
	waiting  then suddenly from behind the closed and curiously
	painted door of the inner houmfort a voice speaks  a voice
	that is light pleasant and authoritative

				voice
			muffled by the door
		where are my people  let them
		bring me the rice cakes  let them
		dance and be happy 

	there is a great ecstatic shout from the voodoo worshippers

				voodoo worshippers
			shouting
		damballa  damballa

	the sabreur dances forward sword in his left hand and a
	little plate with rice cakes in his right  he kneels down
	and places the plate near the door jamb  a line forms at the
	door  betsy leading jessica by the hand takes her place with
	the rest  she is third in the line of suppliants  she can
	see the whole procedure  the suppliant places his forehead
	against the forehead of the god painted on the door and
	speaks  the first suppliant is a wearylooking field hand
	who shuffles to the door and speaks in such a low tone that
	his words cannot be heard  the second suppliant is an old
	woman thin and workworn  she speaks sincerely and humbly
	and betsy directly behind her hears her words

				old woman
		damballa  my son dont take care
		of me

				voice of damballa
		tell him his own little son will
		grow big  he himself will grow
		old  the son learns from the
		father one day your son may stand
		here to complain that his boy does
		not take care of him

	the old woman turns away comforted  hopeful  betsy looks
	at her  she can see tears in the old womans eyes with
	jessicas hand in hers betsy takes her place at the door 
	she puts her forehead against the crudely painted forehead of
	the god  she talks to the door

				betsy
		damballa this woman is sick

	the door swings open slowly the feeble light of the outer
	houmfort does not penetrate the darkness of the inner temple
	a hand reaches out from the darkness and takes betsys hand
	and draws her in the houngan follows betsy into the temple
	the door shuts behind him jessica remains outside standing
	before the doorint inner houmfort  nighta match flares and a hand brings it forward to light an oil
	lamp which flares brightly revealing a little room of
	whitewashed boards bare except for a table on which stands a
	small iron tripod from which an iron pot is suspended
	although there is no fire under the pot the steam rises from
	this receptacle and water boils and bubbles in it
	it is the houngan who has lit the lamp and on the other side
	of the table is mrs rand her face is serious and unsmiling

				betsy
			starting forward around

				mrs rand
		wait dont draw any conclusions
		let me explain

				mrs rand
		i knew youd come and i knew id

	sabreur and two mamlois stand near her looking at her and
	talking we cannot hear what they say the drumming and the
	song of joy for the coming of damballa continue over the
	scene suddenly as if he had arrived at some decision the
	sabreur holding his sword stiffly in front of him starts
	toward jessica with little mincing stepsint inner houmfort  nightmrs rand as if continuing with something she has been
	talking about for a long time

		helpless they disobeyed me 
		things went from bad to worse all
		my husbands dreams of good health
		good sanitation good morals for
		these sweet and gentle people
		seemed to die with him
			pauses
		then almost accidentally i
		discovered the secret of how to
		deal with them there was a girl
		with a baby  again and again i
		begged her to boil the drinking
		water she never would then i told
		her the god shango would be
		pleased and kill the evil spirits
		in the water if she boiled it she
		boiled the water from then on

				betsy
		but you didnt have to come up
		here

				mrs rand
		perhaps not  but i did come here
		and i found it was so simple to let
		the gods speak through me once
		started it seemed such an easy way
		to do good  i should have known
		there was no easy way to do good

	another angle  shooting toward the inner houmfort betsy
	runs out from the doorway takes hold of jessicas arm and

	she lifts her face with a smile of complete love and trust 
	holland studies her face longingly but does not kiss her

				holland contd

		i may prefer it that way

	they stand looking at each other  the garden is still with
	the dead heavy stillness of their hopelessness  then from

	service  she is engaged in pouring tea  betsy is beside her
	helping her  rand in working clothes is in an armchair
	near the sofa with a highball in his hand  also seated and
	facing mrs rand and betsy is dr maxwell and commissioner
	jeffries  the latter is a dignified man of early middleage 
	he is dressed in a light business suit  at the window at
	the rear of the room stands holland talking with a priest 
	as the scene opens mrs rand fills a teacup and holds it up
	toward holland  he comes toward her to pick up the cup the
	priest walking with him  as they walk holland speaks

				holland
		but i assure you father walters
		miss connell had no idea of the
		consequences when she went there

				dr maxwell
		paul were not trying to blame
		miss connell  it isnt a question
		of blame  its a question of what
		we are to do with jessica  the
		commissioner is very concerned

				jeffries
		it has become a serious problem 
		theres so much gossip rumor and
		agitation about the whole thing

				holland
		i know  weve felt it at the mill 
		the men could hardly keep their
		minds on their work

				rand
		well jeffries why come to us
		about it  why dont you go up to
		the houmfort and put a stop to the
		drumming and dancing  thats what
		causes all the trouble

				jeffries
			shaking his head
		no  youre quite wrong  right
		heres the seat of the trouble 
		mrs holland has become an object
		of speculation and religious
		interest to these people  its
		revived all their old superstitions
		 zombies  and that sort of
		nonsense

				mrs rand
		i wouldnt worry too much
		commissioner  itll pass  weve
		had this sort of thing before

				dr maxwell
		this is something else  theyre
		curious  curiosity and religious
		fervor make a strange and explosive
		mixture

				mrs rand
		im quite sure nothing will happen
		doctor

				jeffries
		if i were as sure as you mrs
		rand we wouldnt be here  ill
		tell you quite bluntly for the
		peace of the island and possibly
		for her own safety weve come to
		ask you to send mrs holland away
		to st thomas

				rand
		to the asylum

				jeffries
		i believe theres a kinder name for
		it wesley at st thomas its called the
		institute for mental therapy

				rand
			getting up
		it doesnt matter what you call it 
		i can tell you right now jessica
		isnt going

	dr maxwell looks first at him then at holland then back to
	rand

				dr maxwell
		fortunately wesley this isnt a
		matter for your decision

				rand
		you mean to say paul can send her
		away  that he can hand her over
		to strangers  wholl shut her up 
		 maybe mistreat her  he hasnt
		that right

				mrs rand
			trying to calm him
		wesley

				dr maxwell
		i am afraid wesley he has that
		right  and i will have to urge him
		to use it

				rand
		i tell you he hasnt and he
		wouldnt dare use it if he had

				jeffries
		why

				rand
		because he drove jessica insane 
		deliberately  coldly

	they all look at holland  there is a long and awkward pause 
	holland makes no move to deny by word or gesture his
	brothers accusation  finally however he breaks the pause
	by bringing the teacup to his lips

				jeffries
		that could be a serious accusation
		rand if it werent a foolish one

				rand
		foolish  tell them how foolish it
		is paul  tell them

				holland
			very calmly but with a
			little uncertainty
		my guilt in this matter if any
		wesley is not the subject of this
		discussion

				rand
		but it is paul  because thats
		why you wont dare send jessica
		away

				mrs rand
		betsy tell them about the

				betsy

		mrs rand

				mrs rand
		you must betsy theyll have to

				betsy
			reluctantly
		mrs rand was at the houmfort that
		night  but theres nothing wrong
		with that  shes gone there for
		years  trying to take care of
		those people  to help them

				rand
		what do you mean

				holland
		i dont understand

				dr maxwell
		i think i do  
			smiling
		ive often talked a little voodoo
		to get medicine down a patients
		throat

				mrs rand
		its more than that doctor  ive
		entered into their ceremonies 
		pretended to be possessed by their
		gods

	they stare at her dumbfounded

				mrs rand contd
		but what i did to jessica was worse
		than that  it was when she going
		away with wesley  there was that
		horrible scene

	she turns to rand

				mrs rand contd
		you thought she loved you didnt
		you  she didnt  she didnt love
		anyone except herself   her
		reflection in the mirror the look
		she could bring into a mans eyes

				rand
		that isnt true  you never
		understood her

				mrs rand
			disregarding his protest
		that night i went to the houmfort 
		i kept seeing jessicas face 
		smiling  smiling because two men
		hated each other  because she was
		beautiful enough to take my family
		in her hands and break it apart 
		the drums seemed to be beating in
		my head  the chanting  the
		lights   everything blurred
		together  and then i heard a
		voice speaking in a sudden
		silence  my voice  i was
		possessed  i said that the woman
		at fort holland was evil and that
		the houngan must maker her a
		zombie

	dr maxwell has been studying mrs rand with a curious
	intent expression

				dr maxwell
		and what happened then mrs rand

				mrs rand
			unsteadily
		i hated myself  i kept saying to
		myself over and over again that
		these people had no power they had
		no strange drugs that there is no
		such thing as a zombie

				dr maxwell
		ah  thats where reason took
		hold

				mrs rand
		yes i said it and i made myself
		believe it but when i got here
		jessica was already raging with
		fever

				dr maxwell
		two things had happened mrs rand 
		one was that your daughterinlaw
		had been taken ill with a fever 
		the other thing  completely
		disconnected  was that you had
		wished her ill because she had
		hurt your sons

				mrs rand
			protesting
		but i had no thought of harming
		her  it wasnt i

				dr maxwell
		you were possessed  that is true 
		possessed by your subconscious
		mind  you were in the houmfort
		surrounded by their symbols  to
		them nothing worse can happen to a
		person than to be made into a
		zombie  your subconscious mind
		used their own words for evil

				holland
		dr maxwell is right mother

				dr maxwell
			gently and kindly
		emotion tricks all of us mrs
		rand  and you are a woman with a
		very strong conscience  that
		conscience has been tormenting you 
		the rest is coincidence  there is
		no such thing as a zombie  the
		dead do not come back to life 
		death is final

	stares toward the bamboo  she sees nothing

			with realization
		you could set her free 
		you could give her rest  you could
