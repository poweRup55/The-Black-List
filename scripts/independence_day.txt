               an enormous shadow creeps towards us blotting out the horizon 
               a loud rumble is heard

               suddenly we are covered in darkness as the shadow engulfs 
               us

               only the lonely image of our earth hangs in the air until a 
               huge silhouetted object suddenly blocks our view

               from the space craft suddenly with a loud screeching noise 
               the white light spills out as the huge opening unfolds at 
               the side of the craft

               the four helicopters have to flight to hold their positions 
               as something powerful emits from the schism in the ship

               then like a gigantic bugzapper the four pesky little apache 
               helicopters are blown out of the sky one by one they leave

               it quickly spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar

               with all his might steve yanks the door open

               an alien

               for the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens an 
               odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure

               the reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment 
               it turns woozily towards us steve rears back and slugs him 
               in the face knocking the alien totally unconscious

               his anger finally subsiding exhaustion taking over steve

               from the fireworks bag the rocket blasts into the redneck 
               his shirt igniting on fire

               the redneck drops the rifle attempting to put out the flames 
               his cronies rush to his aid jasmine picks up the gun moves 
               in on them

               an enormous elevator

               dr okun is an odd hyperenergetic man whos spent too much 
               time in isolation

               the group steps inside and nearly gasps at

               just like the one that chased steve the entourage stares in 
               horror and wonder we can see the patchwork repairs theyve

                         the nearest stuff has only happened 
                         in the last few days

               the president slowly walks around the ship as okun talks

               david mouth agape just stares at it

                                     okun
                         see we cant duplicate their type 
                         of power so weve never been able to 
                         experiment but since these guys 
                         started showing up all the gizmos 
                         inside turned on the last twenty 
                         four hours have been really exciting

                         think exciting is the word id 
                         choose to describe it

               the room goes silent letting the president blow off steam

                                     president
                              calming

                         were facing

                         interested in our planet

               the lights slowly turn on illuminated the vault okun leads 
               the group to a sealed partition

                                     okun
                         this is vault or as some of us have 
                         come to call it the freak show

               okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing

               formaldehyde tanks  aliens

               three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks the 
               murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view what we do 
               see is not pretty

                         when we found them they were wearing 
                         biomechanical suits once we got 
                         them off we were able to learn a 
                         great deal about their anatomy eyes 
                         ears bipolar digestive system no 
                         vocal cords though were assuming 
                         they communicate with each other 
                         through other means

               david cannot contain his fascination he steps forward

                                     david
                         what kind of other means hand

                         some kind of extra sensory perception  
                         telepathy

                                     president
                         can they be killed

                                     okun
                         these three died in the crash their 
                         bodies are as frail as our own you 
                         just have to get past their 
                         technology which is im sorry to 
                         say far more advanced

               the president turns to david

                                     president
                         you unlocked a part of that 
                         technology you cracked their code

                         work together weve got to find a

               ext security gate  same

               four armed guards watch the gate an armada of trucks and 
               trailers heads right for them they move into position to 
               block their entrance as a blue pickup skids to a halt before 
               them  steve stands up from the back of the pick up

                                     guard
                         sorry lt colonel i cant open the 
                         gates without clearance

                                     steve
                         you want to see my clearance

               impatiently steve grabs the guard by the collar pulling him 
               over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the 
               bundled parachute in the flatbed steve rips the fabric aside 
               revealing

               the alien creature

               still unconscious the alien stirs the guard jumps back 
               shitting in his pants quickly he signals for the other to 
               open the gate

               the armada quickly drives past

               blackness

               total darkness suddenly light pours in as a door is open

               we see the faces of okun david and three technicians all 
               peering at us with inquisitive expressions

                                     okun
                         see the gizmos flashing

               reverse  inside alien craft

               sure enough tons of gizmos with lights flashing high tech 
               meets organic organisms this alien ship looks familiar to 
               our own technology and completely different at the same time

                                     okun
                         weve been working around the clock 
                         trying to get a fix on all this crap 
                         some stuff we figured out right away

               david climbs in fascinated he touches everything okun 
               points to everything as he describes it

                                     okun
                         this thing were pretty sure is the 
                         life support for the cabin this do
                         hickey over here is connected with 
                         the engines this crap we have no 
                         idea what that stuff is for

               david is transfixed by it he stares at the small screens 
               with flashing light patterns on them

                                     okun
                         but this over here is clearly what 
                         they use to navigate and guide the 
                         craft

               but david still stares at the small screens

                                     david
                         someone grab my laptop for me

               one of the technicians rushes off as okun leans close

                                     okun
                         find something interesting

                                     david

                         it certainly does

               when the president enters a technician rushes over and knocks 
               on the hatch door on the alien attacker the door swings 
               open and david climbs down

               grabbing a coke can from the recycle trash bin david places 
               the empty can on top of the alien attacker david turns and

               they do and david nods to a technician inside the craft the 
               technician disappears inside closing the door behind him  
               a loud hum emits from the craft david has to yell over it

                                     david
                         from where youre standing do you 
                         think you could shoot that can off 
                         the alien craft

               mitchell shrugs affirmatively david gestures for him to 
               try

               taking aim mitchell shoots

               the bullet ricochets off the attackers protective shield

               several people in the crowd duck afraid of being hit by the 
               errant bullet

                                     david
                         sorry bout that you see its 
                         protected by the crafts shields we 
                         cant penetrate their defenses

               david walks over to his laptop now connected directly to 
               the craft by cables and starts typing furiously

                                     david
                         my point is if we cant beat their 
                         defenses then we must get around 
                         them

               david stops typing and stares at his wrist watch silently 
               counting down

                                     david
                         lt mitchell would you please try 
                         to shoot it again

               reluctantly mitchell obliges this time the can is blown off 
               the craft everyone in the room is shocked the technician 
               reopens the crafts door and the loud hum disappears

               proudly at his smart son constance is amazed

                         more accurately i gave it a virus 
                         a computer virus

               david turns his laptop around for the president to see

                                     general grey
                         are you telling us you can send out 
                         a signal that will disable all their 
                         shields

                                     david
                         just as they used our satellites 
                         against us we can use their own 
                         signal against them

               david walks over to a diagram hes made showing the 
               relationship between the mother ship the space crafts and 
               the smaller alien attackers

                                     david
                         if we plant the virus directly into 
                         the mother ship it would then filter 
                         down into all the corresponding ships 
                         below

                                     nimziki
                         and just how do we infect the mother 
                         ship with a virus

               david gestures to the alien attacker behind him

                                     david
                         well have to fly their craft out of 
                         our atmosphere and dock with the 
                         mother ship

               intrigued steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker 
               sizing it up david points to a satellite photo of the 
               underbelly of the mother ship

                                     david
                         we can enter here upload the virus 
                         and set off an explosion that could 
                         disable it this would disorient the 
                         smaller ship below and buy you some 
                         time to take them out

               constance reacts realizing davids participation in the 
               plan

                                     nimziki
                         this is ridiculous

                         how long would their shields be down

                                     david
                         once they discover the virus it could 
                         be a matter of minutes

                                     nimziki
                         you want us to coordinate a massive 
                         world wide counter strike with a 
                         window of only a few minutes

                         of this nonsense are you we dont 
                         have the manpower or the resources 
                         to launch that kind of a campaign
                              gesturing to the 
                              alien ship
                         not to mention that this whole 
                         cockamamie plan is dependent on a 
                         machine that no one in the world is 
                         qualified to operate

               technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side 
               of the craft with a loud clank the clamps are pulled away

               for a moment the hulking craft teeters unevenly but quickly 
               stabilizes floating above them

                                     david
                         any other questions

                         the only mistake i made was appointing 
                         a sniveling little weasel like you 
                         chief of staff

               constance is about to intervene when general grey stops her

                         mr nimziki youre fired

               the president releases him and turns to general grey

                         and get some goddamned pilots to fly

                         additional reenforcement in hiding 
                         near the golan straights

               suddenly the flap to the tent opens all the pilots draw 
               their pistols frightening the arab pilot who stands in the 
               doorway the arab pilot speaks quickly in arabic

                                     reginald

               as they step out of the tent we see more than a hundred 
               fighters planes from different nations parked around them

               theyve all gone into hiding out here in the desert divided 
               into many smaller camps

               reginald and thomson follow their arab cohort walking through 
               the many other campsites thomson gets some stares from the
