first draft


a strange landscape

like the surface of some alien planet celestial forms spin
 in the distance  drop down over a topography of rolling hills

alvin 5  the pod

a titanium alloy sphere the strongest form to withstand
great pressures a streamlined mantle houses propellers
batteries articulated arms  one containing a carbondioxide
laser maneuvering thrusters protrude next to antennae

weird submarine forms

glow in artificial light we float over undulating undersea
hills tendrils of beautiful growths wave in the currents

                al vo
one small schlep for mankind

int  alvin 5

the man inside is al viola 35 exmarine exastronaut
he holds a doctorate in medieval languages from the sorbonne
he is worldly highly trained right now hes elated as well

                al
but it means money in
the bank to me

a voice cuts in  the mission control officer  colin

                colin  vo
could you to stop counting
your profits long enough for
a systems check

                al
this is a small breakthrough
ive a right to make a statement

a lab somewhere

technicians cluster around video screens showing
feeds from lvins multiple cameras one shot from the housing
faces forward another is of al at the controls exotic equipment
surrounds him a clock is prominent it reads elapsed
mission time  1 hour 14 minutes a third camera fixed to
a long extension arm articulates 360 and shoots back to
show the pod

                colin
what a pain in thewhere did we
get this prima donnainto mike
then do try to keep it dignified
puns are a sign of oxygen
deprivation of the brain now give
us bank three if you would

                al
alright alright air filtration
88 battery load 76

reception is perfect al reports full success he reads off
instrument readings rapidly his voice is clipped
and precisea test pilot behind him packed into every corner
of the tiny cockpit are computers and scientific instruments

the lab technicians are taut organized and highly
disciplined there is a sense of purpose of very important business

the submersible swoops through valleys lined with
stranger growths the craft is perfectly balanced responsive
to the pilots lightest touch

end titles

silicon valley  dawn

a peaceful setting flowers on low rolling hills a hightech
building complex  united synergistic technologies

two men on a hill overlooking ust

they are fooling with something it goes off a rocket flares out in the
direction of the building the rocketeer guides the flight of
the remotely piloted vehicle on a video monitor

above the building retro jets slow the craft a small braking
chute blooms it settles braking jets fire briefly as it lands
softly on the rooftop air duct

the rocketeer hits a button blue flame shoots out
the underside of the vehicle it burns a tiny pinpoint through
the duct

int united synergistic technologies  a hightech lab

 the same one same time  a tech turns from the video
monitors and looks through a window into the main experimental
areaa maze of equipment some bizarre tensionfilled procedure
is going on  techs in the control room smoke like fiends others
in the cleanroom are enclosed head to foot in sterile coveralls

control room

engineers note and dismiss a reading

                eng 1
air temp just went up

                eng 2
were drawing lots of power


int ust front office

lobby one applicant joe doakes 30 has a air of
desperation his tie is too tight his hair wont behave hes

the roof

the landing craft withdraws its torch
deploys a nozzlearm pssssccchhht a colorless gas is emitted
 a hallucinogen debilitating but not fatalnot even
unpleasant t makes people highly suggestible pliable complacent

int lab and control room

 slowly almost imperceptibly
the hubbub and chatter die off people stand and sit
as before but slowly slow downcigarettes slow halfway to the
mouthcoffee cups stop in midsip in the lab procedures justslow
a man at a control board looks down as if suddenly its
all greekthe lights and buttons suddenly foreign to him others
seem bemused daydreamingthey smile at each other and
try to think of something to say some of them giggle

ext the valley

a chopper glides through the pass
and settles on the ust landing pad five figures exit the chopper
all dressed alike dark coveralls and boots motorcycle
helmets with reflectored visorsa precision attack

the intruders  walk to the access door they are
armed disciplined well drilled movement is unhurried
but efficient they carry submachine guns a guard eyes them placidly
their leader speaks through a radio directly into the ust
intercom he is assured and calm the guard is bemused drugged

                leader
hello
                guard
hello
                leader
wed like to come in

the guard is lethargic the gas has sapped his will
one part of his brain cannot accept what he is about to do he
giggles softly at the thought of it even as he is compelled to
obey

                guard
                giggling
youd liketo come in

                leader
open the door please

                guard
                still giggling
open the door certainly

the door pops open they enter and pass the bemused
guard

                leader
thank you

                guard
my pleasure

int lab area

 everyone is smilingstoned the
leader speaks to them like children not to be funny but because
lowkey orders are the most efficient they are completely
suggestible

                leader
hello

                tech
hello

                leader
weve come for the pem114
where is it

                tech 2
right there

                leader
thank you

the intruders step up to the lab equipment another
techsteps forwardhe is struggling against the effects of
the drug

                tech 3
wait

                leader
why

                tech 3
you cant take that

                leader
why not

                tech 3
the experiment the danger

the voice is soothing calming hypnotic but the
submachine guns are always in position

                leader
its alright

                tech 3
it is

                leader

                tech 3
just one the back up

                leader

                tech 3
i cant get it out it would take hours

                leader
thats alright just tear it apart

                tech 3
tear it apart

                leader
yes

                tech 3
ahhhokay

he tears into a complex web of electronic circuitry
ripping wires and circuit boards apart with a pop the circuits
go out

the lights dip the overhead video screens go out
as the tech comes up with the main circuit board

the shriek of an alarm siren suddenly a door swings
open the leaders gun swings on the figure in the doorwayjoe
doakes joe stands in shock looks at the gun swings the
door shut behind him the alarm cuts out everyone in the room
stares at him he stands there rumpled and bemused blinking
at them dustin hoffman on drugs finally the leader sees
hes no threat relaxes his grip on the gun the leader snaps out

                leader
what do you want

                joe stoned innocent
drink of water

a beat then the leader relaxeshe waves joe away

                leader
go get a drink

this has the force of suggestionjoe turns and
walks through and out of the roomlooking for a drink the leader
motions to intruder 2 to continue

                intruder 2
the pem114

                tech 2
yes thats it

                leader
give it to me

he does another tech offers the leader the spare
he holds the tiny circuit board in his palm removes one chip

                leader
this the only spare

                tech 2
yes

                leader
the other working

                tech 2
perfectly

the leader has something in his hand a click a
whoosh a butane lighter melts the circuit board to microscopic
slag the tech looks at his scorched hand the destroyed
silicon bead is voice is still slightly amused

                tech 2
ow

                leader
itl be alright

                tech 2
it will

                leader
it doesnt hurt

                tech 2
no

the leader pauses for a moment amused by their sheeplike
acquiescence his next suggestion is droll

                leader
it tickles

the tech looks at his smoking hand in dismaythen
incredibly finds something amusing in his second degree burn
he starts to laughit ticklesthe other techs look confused
then its contagious they start to laugh too

intruder 5 steps into the room full of laughing
idiots he moves to the leader they speak quickly and both
leave

int high tech experiment area

the leader is surprised

                leader
whats this

                int 5
theyre further along
than we thought

cu  an empty beaker on a pad surrounded by exotic
equipment

                int 5
looks almost ready to go

a walkietalkie squawks

                wt vo
response to door alarm

                leader
time to golooks at the
beaker it doesnt matter
we have the pem

they turn and exit the room as they do the leader
notices joe aimlessly examining the wall of equipment nearby
joe is really stonedhes fooling with a control panel flicking
switches on and off he notices the intruders caught he tries
to make the best of it he smooths his hair spins and comes
to a halfassed kind of attention as he turns he knocks some wildly
expensive piece of equipment to the floor joe grimaces and
straightens his tie making it much worse the leader comes close
to him stares at him thoughtfully joe blinks back trying to
clear his head in case speaking is requiredthe leader looks at
the smashed equipment joe looks at it guiltily the radio squawks

the leader decides abruptly he kicks the equipment
out of his way it smashes against the back wall joe wincesthe
leader turns and stalks out of the room joe holds his attention
position for a moment like a good scout then seems
to find himself lost and alone in a room full of strange
equipment

main room

other intruders finish taking apart the equipment
the leader addresses the crowd a james masonish
air about him
                leader
we must be off goodbye

                techs
goodbyegoodbye

they all wish them goodbyesmiles and laughter
all around the one who struggled steps forward
he struggles again

                tech 3
whoareyou

intruder 5 just laughs but the leader turns back to tech 3

                leader
im your mother

close up  tech 3

stunned and confusedhe shakes his head and blinks rapidly
he rubs his eyes

tech 3s pov

before his eyes the image of the leader shrinks down
 and transforms itself into that of a grey haired old lady

tech 3  cant believe it

                tech 3
momwhat are you doing here

                leader
leaving now go to sleep
all of you

some of them do the intruders step back through
the door the techs look at each other blankly then they look
at the ceiling the wallstheir shoes anything in the video
monitoring section others watch the intruders leave on screenstheir
faces register nothing the leader pausesa final
command

                leader
give me the surveillance
camera videotapes

the video tech does

int lab  hours later

frantic  crawling with security people
the scene of the crime no clues no leads a security
man finnegan interrogates the techs

                finnegan
well who did it look like

tech 3 squirms in his seatembarrassedhumiliated
he doesnt answerthe interrogator stands over him
intimidating finally defiantly the tech states the ludicrous

                tech 2
my mother

int control room

colin walks up to the chief detective he shrugs in bg
through a glass partitionand on tv monitors other security
men question other techs

                finnegan
whod it look like to you

                tech 1
my dog

colin turns to the detective

                finnegan
mass hypnosis short term memory loss
some kind of hallucinogenic gas

                myer
kind of stuff the armys been working on

                colin
        surveillance cameras

                finnegan
        they took the tapes

                colin
        you have nothing

                finnegan
        we dont even know where
        to start what about these people
        what do we do with them

he indicates glass wall through which they can see the
bystanders including joe being questioned one at a time
joe looks a little queasy he burpsan uneasy stomach

                colin
        well have to let them go

                finnegan
        surveilliance on them all

colin looks uncomfortable at the thought tech 2 steps through a
door and catches his eye he excuses himself as the finnegan
turns back to study his suspects in the window

int lab  tech 2 is panicked he speaks quietly intensely

                tech 2
        the pem its gone
        they must have it

                colin
        how did they know no one knew

                tech 2
        whoever has it can leapfrog
        generations of technology
        we gotta get it back

                tech 3
        screw the pemwhat about al

                tech 2
        poor bastard

al  in the pod

fighting for his life the pod is slammed and buffeted al
struggles with the controls as the pod tumbles

                al
        come in controldo you read me
        come indamn

he flips frantically through the controls

                al
        okay guys whats going on
        who turned out the lights

he tries one system then the other

                al
        this wasnt in the plan

then it dawns on him he may be in big trouble

                al resigned professional

pod seems to drop through an enormous tunnellike a marble in a

san francisco ext street  a workingclass neighborhood 
a united systems technology van pulls up

                finnegan
        take the card

                joe
        oh yeah thanks

the van pulls away joe turns looks up at his apartment house
seems to forget what hes doingand wanders off down the
street he acts strangely theres an odd whistling in his ear

int al in the pod  infrared imaging  shows where he isa
vast submarine cavern he moves forward swinging the pod in an
arc through the churning waters he turns to his computers and
sensors for an answer

monitors  a diagram appears a wireframe representation of
als envirnment

                al
        what the hell is this

he programs the computer to manipulate the image the computer
program turns it inside out gives it an external omniscient pov
and we understand its a man the pinpoint representing the pod
is in the stomach

al  almost  shocked into silence

                al
        alright guys the jokes
        gone far enough

molloys bar  a neighborhood hangout dazed joe enters and
sits at the bar hes greeted like a regular

                molloy
        joe hows it going
        howd it go with that job

                joe
        what job

                molloy a beat
        heylookthis ones on me

he sets a beer in front of joe moves off down the bar on the
tv at the end of the bara news report joe stares at the tv

tv  a reporter does a standup in front of ust main gate

                reporter
        all we know is that something has gone
        wrong here but so farno one is talking
        about it ron golloway with the actioncam

inside  int the pod  al checks his envirnmental analysers

                al
        stomach acid this stuffs caustic

suddenly the stomach churnsa new wave of foamy liquid roars
down the esophagus and engulfs the pod

inside  al  on the analysers  a readout alcohol

                al
        you guys aredrunk furious
        okay buster i dont know who you
        are but if i ever get out of you
        youre in big trouble

inside the stomach  the pod speeds toward the stomach
wallthe carbondioxide laser fires opening a hole in the
stomach wall the pod blasts through

inside a capillary  the pod breaks through the wall and is
carried away in the blood flow

int pod 

 a wireframe representation of the body
guides al as he powers the pod ahead the capillary branches
into larger and larger vesselsthe pressure and speed builds
with every branchal has to fly like crazy to avoid collision
with solid particles on the monitors he watchs the sonar
computer imaging to guide his navigation

ext pod

 he enters a main artery the walls bulge with each
pump of the heartthen up ahead the heart he tries to back
down reverse his thrust but its no good he is being sucked in
nowhere to turnno way to escapehe decides and thrusts full
forward into the heart

whoosh he is pulled into a ventrical spunthe world blurrs
as he is expelled in a surge of blood and pushed up the artery
spinning wildly he fights for control swings into a vein

the tunnel gets smaller he checks his navigation aidsit
branchesal cuts into the  artery and up the neck into the
base of the headbefore hima barriera membrane appears
inside  int the pod

al pulls up in an eddy and aims the laser at the membrane
it slices a neat hole through it the flow bursts through
the breach and carries the pod with it

other side of the membrane  al swings the pod aroundhe is in
anotherregionwhere the water is still he swings the laser
around again and spot welds the tear in the membranebefore he
can complete the joba treelike thing is swept into the hole by
the flood other debris collect behind it until the hole is
sealed shutslowly the current dies

inside  ext the pod

 al has just slipped through the bloodbrain barrier and has taken up
 residence in the left ventricle  a fluid filled cavity in the brain

inside  int the pod

al stations himself near a nerve bundle

                al
        youll wish you never
        thought of this

he sets a contact arm of the pod for highvoltage electrical
chargepicks a nerve at randoman hits the trigger
zzzzaaappp a charge hits the nerve

outside  int the bar

joe flies off the barstool and hits the floor with a thud
he looks around dazedthen slowly climbs back up

inside  the pod  al

                al
        okay now the photon echo memory
        chipyouve heard of that

outside  int apartment 

 joe just sits theregun in hand staring ahead in disbelief
 he nods slightly in response

inside  the pod

 al lays it all on him the experiment

                al
        the photon echo memory chip  the pem114
        its the key its magical it focuses
        massive computing power on one event the
        creation of a mathematically induced real
        life simulacrum encoded and synthesized on
        the molecular level with properties of the
        real modeland the transfer of a certain
        imponderable which might be called the life
        force between the two in direct symbiosis
        the effect is that man and machine are living
        on the molecular levelnow thats where we
        were when things went wrong you understand
        no response are you listening

outside joe exhausted mesmerized has dozed off gun in hand

inside  the pod  al

                al
        i am real goddamn it hello

no response frustrated he hits the charge buttonan electric
pulse from a pod arm shoots to a nearby nerve bundle

joes apartment

joes limbs shudder his muscles spasm
enormous roar  the gun goes off
the shell tears through the window raining glass and plaster
from outside the windowa startled yellsomeone falls
away from the porch

inside  the pod 

 al  is buffetted by the roar

inside  ext the pod 

it pulls into the bloodstream
is whisked at high speed through the arteries
the trip is not farhe pulls into an area
of great activity a battlefield

the wound  white blood cells and antibodies rush past invading
viral agents are hunted down and destroyed

microscopic bits of matter  dirt carried into the wound  now
relatively enormous  loom over him as he powers through a
fantastic innerspace of organic and inorganic matter

massive mountainous boulder  scene of a raging battle between
invading viruses and antibodies it writhes with the ebb and flow
of the battle as al comes in closer

inside  int the pod

al takes videos of the virus he records
the structure of the rock he hits the rock with his laser and
does a spectrum analysis he analyses on the computers

whawmmm he is slammed and jostledas the pod is caught in an
ebb he looks out the windows things are rushing madly past

inside  ext the pod

 antibodies are trapping the last of the
viruses as they try to make a getawaysuddenly one of the
antibodies slowsturnsswings back at the pod

int al

 he drops everything and turns to escape

inside  ext the pod

al tries to outrundodging getting
other particles between himself and his huntersbut its no
good theres no escape other killers bunch to cut the pod off
al swirls away swings round a bit of matter there it is

giant antibody  coming right for him a rushing soundlike
being run down by the queen mary this is it

he closes his eyes and braces nothing happens he looks

it has rushed past ignoring him it hits a mass of toxins and
shatters them it breaks apart small components attach to the
germs and kill them

                al
        under the threshold im too
        small to do damageto the body
        or theyll get to me later

he looks up looming over him like a vast tentis something

near the skin surface

 diffused light sparkles off of blue veins and red capillaries
 a sparkling field of motion
the thing is a deep green with purple highlightsit once was alive
and maybe still istendrils of waving streamers trail out
behind itas antibodies attach to itslowly it changes dies
becomes absorbed it seems familiar to him

lane forces them off the roadonly great skill and luck enables
them to swerve back on they round a blind corner the porsche
dead in their track both cars slam together careen off the
road hit a bank separate the porsche rolls destroying itself
prangs into a tree the m2 goes through a bush comes to rest
upright

rene  covered with dirt and debris looks at him stunned

int lab

a black coveralled figure appears as he moves we recognize him
as the leader of the intruders he turns to them its dieter
he glances at grunerjoe surprised he speaks to joe in rapid

another technician in cantonese

dieter joe goes berserk he goes for the chip but they tackle
him they slam him against the console immobilizing him one
guard reaches for restraints

wires make contact a blast of sparks the wire grounds out

side border police rush up but can do nothing to help them

joe breaks into laughterthe tickleresponse

inside

the paroxysm of laughter spoils dieters aimhis pod is drawn
into the throat by the convulsions where it is battered
desperate al brings his dying pod alongside pops the hatch
swims to dieters pod just as dieters pod is swept away out of
control  a vortex tries to tear his grip away he hangs tough
against the violent wrenches of the current as the pod swoops
out from under him and spins away hand over hand he reaches a
hatch and enters dieter panicked at the controls turns on
him they fight the pod tumbles they tumble dieter grabs a
wrench raises it to slug al when the pod hits something solid
dieter is slammed against the bulkhead knocked out  al gains
control of the pod wedges it into a crevice and waits for the
paroxyms to die away

outside

joes on the wire laughing at something terribly funny rene
thinks hes finally gone mad he may have the pursuers think so
they are so amazed by his attitudehis couragehis heart in
the face of death that when he tumbles off the fence into the
free zone they dont even fire

the fence

the border police come up and cover them they are safe and
free incredibly burr shouts through the fence

                burr

                joe

he hawks and spits through the wire onto the mans shoe the
guards lock their weapons expecting a firefight at this insult

burrs assistant leans down scrapes the lunger off burrs foot
burr realizing scrapes the slime from the others hand and cups
it in hishe turns away looking for a vessel the border
guards are flabbergasted

they look at joe joe shrugs at them as he and rene walk away
toward a familiar oriental man who waits for them in front of an
idling helicopter
