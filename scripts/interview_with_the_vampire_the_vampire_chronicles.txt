interview with the vampire
adapted by neil jordan
from the novel by anne rice




int room night san francisco
a small bare room illuminated only by the streetlight coming through 
the window 

a hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles with a small 
microphone 

malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape he is young half
shaven dressed in t shirt and jeans he looks too  

louis who stands by the window looking out on the streeet with his 
back to mallowy louis is dressed in an oldfashioned suit 

louis 
so you want me to tell you the story of my life 

malloy
thats what i do i interview people i collect lives fm radio 
ffrc i just interviewed a genuine hero a cop who  

louis
quietly interrupting 
youd have to have a lot of tape for my story ive had a very unusual 
life 

malloy
so much the better ive got a pocket full of tapes 

louis 
you followed me here didnt you 

malloy 
saw you in the street outside you seemed interesting is this where 
you live 

louis 
its just a room 

malloy 
so shall we begin 
playfully almost teasing 
what do yo do 

louis 
im a vampire 

malloy laughs 

malloy 
see i knew you were interesting you mean this literally i take it 

louis 
absolutely i was watching you watching me i was waiting for you in 
that alleyway and then you began to speak 

malloy 
well what a lucky break for me 

louis 
perhaps lucky for both of us 

still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches the table 

louis 
ill tell you my story all of it id like to do that very much 

malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure fascinated but 
afraid 

malloy 
you were going to kill me drink my blood 

louis 
yes but you neednt worry about that now things change 

louis stands opposite hand on the chair malloy is riveted 

malloy 
you believe this dont you that youre a vampire you really think 

louis 
we cant begin this way let me turn on the light 

malloy 
but i thought vampires didnt like the light 

louis 
we love it i only wanted to prepare you 

louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb 

louis face 
appears inhumanly white eyes glittering inhuman or not alive the 
effect is subtle beautiful and ghastly 

malloy 
good god 

he struggles to suppress fear and understand 

louis 
dont be frightened i want this opportunity 

the light appears to go out by itself and suddenly louis is in the 
chair dimly lit by the streetlight from the window the cassette is 
turning 

malloy 
how did you do that 

louis 
the same way you do it a series of simple gestures only i moved too 
fast for you to see im flesh and blood you see but not human i 
havent been human for two hundred years 

malloy is speechless frightened yet enthralled 

louis 
what can i do to put you at ease shall we begin like david 
copperfield i am born i grow up or shall we begin when i was born to 
darkness as i call it thats really where we should start dont you 
think 

malloy 
youre not lying to me are you 

louis 
why should i lie 1791 was the year it happened i was twentyfour  
younger than you are now 

malloy 
yes 

louis 
but times were different then i was a man at that age the master of a 
large plantation just south of new orleans 

dissolve to 

ext louisiana day 1791 

a dishevelled louis hair in pigtail in deep pocket frock coat rides 
his horse through the fields of indigo passing an overseer and slaves 
at work 

he passes slave quarters and the distant colonial mansion of pointe du 
lac 

he comes to a small parish church and a graveyard he dismounts and 
walks through the tombs to an elaborate one in greek style 

louis vo 
i had just lost my wife in childbirth she and the infant had been 
buried less than half a year 

there is a marble angel above the tomb feminine with a tiny cherub 
angel in her arms louis looks from the angel down to the inscriptions 
on the tomb 

dianne de pointe du lac 1763  1791 
infant jean marie  1791 


louis rps away the vines already covering the inscription then drinks 
from a pocketflask his face is ashen 

louis vo 
i was twentyfour and life seemed finished i couldnt bear the pain of 
thier loss i longed for a release from it 

int waterfront tavern night 

louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between two whores at a 
gaming table drinking absinthe all around him flatboatmen whores 
gamblers black african freedmen 

louis vo 
i wanted to lose everything my wealth my estate my sanity but lady 
luck didnt oblige 

louis dsiplays a hand of four aces a gambler at the table stands in 
fury over turning money cards drinks 

louis 
youre calling me a cheat 

gambler im calling you a piece of shit  

the gambler pulls out a pearlhandled pistol and points it at louis 
the crowd hushes and draws back louis smiles drunkenly and stands he 
rips open his lace shirt exposing his chest 

louis 
then do me a favour get rid of this piece of shit 

the gamblers finger on the trigger his hand shakes 

louis 
you lack the courage of your convictions sir do it 

lestat a hooded figure in the corner smiles from beneath the shadow 
of his hood gleaming blue eyes 

louis vo 
most of all i longed for death i know that now i invited it a 
release from the pain of living 

the gambler lowers his gun scowling louis pockets the fistfulls of 
coins he has won 

ext waterfront night 

loud crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians louis staggers down 
an arm around a whore drinking from a bottle a pockmarked pimp 
follows behind 

louis 
my invitation was open to anyone sailors thieves whores and 
slaves 

ext wharf night 

louis quite insensible being propped up against a wall by the whore 
in a dank wharf over the water the pimp rifles his pockets then pulss 
a knife about to slice his throat when a shadow falls over him he 
turns and we see the face of lestat who lifts him into the air by his 
throat breaking his neck the whore screams and lestats other hand 
clamps over her mouth lestat drags her towards him louis falls to the 
ground supported no more insensible close on his face as we hear 
the last breaths of life of the whore off 

louis vo 
but it was a vampire that accepted 

in the water  

the bodies of the thief and whore float by above on the wharf louis 
now awake stares down at them he turns to see lestat towering above 
him 

lestat 
they would have killed you  

louis 
then my luck would have changed 

lestat 
you want death is it death you want 

louis 
yes 

lestat floats down on top of him then lifts him in the air draws his 
head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck 

on louis face  every muscle rigid teeth clenched as the blood is 
drained from him 

on thier feet  hovering above the ground like two quivering dancers 

the wind  billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the 
boats around the wharf 

lestat  floats higher with louis in his arms draining his blood one 
hand reaches out and grips a rope hanging from a shipmast the other 
holds louis he withdraws his teeth and looks into louis drained 
face 

lestat 
you still want death or have you tasted it enough 

louis can barely get the words out 

louis 
enough 

lestat smiles and lets him go louis falls and plummets into the water 
below 

louis face  coming to the surface in the water lapping by the wharf 
the bodies of the whore and thief float beside him he looks up and 
sees lestat way above him dangling from the rope of the shipmast 

int room san francisco 

on malloys face 
captivated terrified enthralled 

malloy 
thats how it happened 

louis 
no the gift of darkness requires more than that as youll see 

ext waterfront day 

louis floating by mudflats surrounded by dead fish the carcases of 
animals eighteenth century rubbish he gets to his feet and walks 
weakly through the mudflats the sun is coming up over the sea behind 
him 

louis vo 
he left me half dead that morning he wanted something from me he came 
back the following night 

int lavish frenchfurnished bedroom at point du lac

louis is delerious in a fourposter bed shrouded with mosquito 
netting a female slave yvette bathes his face with a rag she is 
crying other slave women hover in the shadows yvette puts out all 
candles save one by the bed and withdraws with the others 

candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin 

louis tosses and turns dreaming murmuring incoherently then he opens 
his eyes 

lestat exquisitely dressed in french clothing stands by the bed 
smiling in the light of the candle we see that he is not human skin 
too white eyes too bright lestat looks amiable even mischevious but 
impossible  and angel or monster 

louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it 

louis 
who the hell are you what are you doing in my house 

lestat 
and a beautiful house it is too yours is a good life isnt it 

louis takes aim lestat puts his hand over the barrel louis fires the 
bullet tears a hole in lestats hand lestat is unfazed he takes the 
gun from louis hand and throws it away his hand begins to heal 

lestat 
youre not afraid of anything are you 

louis 
why should i be 

louis reaches for his sword hanging by the bed and point it lestat 
laughs indulgently he draws closer 

lestat 
are you going to put that through me too ruin my beautiful clothes 

he comes closer to louis right up to his face so the sword passes 
through his waistcoat 

lestat 
were all last nights promises for nothing 

he reaches out with his nowhealed hand and plucks out the sword 

louis 
what do you want from me 

lestat 
ive come to answer your prayers you want to die dont you life has 
no meaning anymore does it 

lestat sits down on the bed drawing up one knee louis is becoming 
spellbound 

lestat 
the wine has no taste the food sickens you there seems no reason for 
any of it does there but what if i could give it back to you pluck 
out the pain and give you another life and it would be for all time 
and sickeness and death could never touch you again 

the vampire theme rises with the sound of a heartbeat dissolve to 

ext graveyard night 

the camera drifts through the graveyard where louis wife is buring 
everything is lit with an eery glow as if seen through some unearthly 
eye 

lestat 
vampires thats what we are creatures of darkness only we see it 
that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen 

louis and lestat drifting dreamlike through the overhanging vines 
comes to the grave of his wife and child above the crypt the statue 
of angel mother and child 

lestat 
wouldnt it be sweet to bid pain goodbye to wave away anguish and 
grief to embrace the peace of the unending night 

the marble fingers of the child on the statue move the angel raises 
her head and has the face of louis wife diane she raises her hand and 
touches louis tearstreamed face the child speaks 

marble child 
papa 

louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself touching cold 
marble he cries out in anguish 

louis 
diane 

lestat 
they are gone louis death took them death which you can now 
destroy 

louis 
no 

int louis bedroom night 

louis thrashing on the bed in a delerium lestat places a hand on his 
forehead and soothes him 

lestat 
you have to ask me for this you have to want it do you hear me 

louis 
give it to me 

lestat 
vampires we thrive on blood 

louis 
i want it 

lestat bends close as if to drink louis blood louis does not shrink 
back but stares into his eyes lestat draws back then stands up and 
goes to the french doors 

lestat 
tomorrow night you must prove yourself i will give you the choice i 
never had 

he looks outside 

lestat 
the suns coming up watch it carefully if you come with me tomorrow 
youll never see it again 

he leaves louis sits dazed staring at the empty french window the 
sun rises with unnatural beauty over the swamplands and the 
plantation filling the room striking waterpitcher glass mirror 
and the picture of his dead wife 

louis vo 
my last sunrise that morning i was not yet a vampire and i saw my 
last sunrise i remember it completely yet i dont remember any 
sunrise before it i watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the 
last time as if it were the first and the i said goodbye to sunlight 
and went out to become what i became 

ext plantation night 

lestat and louis walk through the slave quarters huddles groups around 
fires music singing the sound of whipping is heard 

lestat 
your grief has unhinged you youve let your estate rot 

in the woods beyond the quarters the white overseer is whipping a 
black slave with horrifying savagery 

lestat 
you let your overseer run riot work your slaves to the bone well 
start with him 

louis 
how do you mean start 

lestat 
call him 

louis calls 

louis 
carlos 

the overseer turns and comes towards them with the bloodied whip 

lestat 
why the bloody whip carlos 

the overseer looks into his eyes shivers with terror drops the whip 
and runs for the trees lestat is on him in an instant he sinks is 
teeth in his neck louis runs to him tries to pull him off but lestat 
turns to louis and smiles with his bloodied mouth 

lestat 
lets call that a start 

louis 
i cant do it 

lestat 
youve just done it  

louis 
kill me if you will but i cant do this 

he flees as lestat ends to finish off the overseer 

ext pointe du lac night 

louis running up the steps leading to the gallery he is crazed with 
guilt he looks up and sees  

lestat  

sitting collected at the head of the steps 

louis 

backs away as lestat rises and descends the steps so fluidly he hardly 
seems to move 

lestat 
dont worry he was white trash they come at two a penny i dumped him 
in the swamp and untied the slave licked his wounds clean 

louis 
youre the devil arent you thats who you are 

lestat gently 
i wish i were but if i were what would i want with you 

louis 
i cant go through with it i tell you 

lestat 
your perfect your bitter and youre strong 

louis 
but why do you want me 

lestat 
because youre as strong as i was when i was alive 

louis takes out his flask and drinks drunkely he turns and heads for 
a nearby swamp 

ext cemetery night 

louis stops again in front of the crypt drinks from the flask leans 
his forehead against the stone 

lestat appears beside him radiant beautiful 

lestat 
you really want to be with them 

louis 
yes kill me kill me like you promised  

lestat 
you asked for death i didnt promise it  

in a quiet rage lestat raise his fist and shatters the marble face 
stone revealing a coffin below his fist shatters that in turn 
revealing the halfrotted body of a women holding an infant no longer 
recognisable as individuals a tangle of gruesome rotted hair flesh 
eaten away lace insects and worms crawling over it 

louis gasps 

lestat 
its not your wife and child my friend its death just that simple 
think and choose it happens to everyone except us 

lestat stares at him smiling becoming a hazy dreamlike vision then 
hyperclear louis again is spellbound he drops the flask which 
shatters on the stones 

lestat appears angelic in his radiance 

lestat 
we shall be this way always my friend young as we are now im lonely 
for a companion lonely for your strength but im not that lonely do 
you want to come or not 

louis capitulates in one long sigh 

louis 
yes 

lestat comes closer smiling 

lestat 
did i hear a yes 

louis 
yes 

lestat embraces louis obscuring his face he drinks his blood we hear 
two heartbeats out of sync coming together we see louis face 
growing paler paler as his blood is drained his eyes stare upwards 
losing thier focus 

louis pov 
the moon through hanging vines the marble statue of his wife and 
child smile at him as if come alive her hair blows in the breeze 
wonderful gold tresses the childs fingers reach out 

back to scene 
lestat lets louis fall down beside the broken crypt louis looks from 
the rotting bodies to lestat above him radiant lestat speaks gently 

lestat 
ive drained you to the point of death if you drink from me you live 
for ever if i leave you here you die 

lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows louis a kiss 

louis 
no dont leave me here give it to me 

lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth fangs slash his own 
flesh blood falls 

lestat 
youre sure 

louis 
sure 

louis rises to accept the first drops with his open mouth lestat 
gathers him up as louis clamps his hand on lestats arm and drinks 
from the wrist 

the vampire theme swells 

lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement louis finishes 
staggers away from him as if drunk 

louis pov  

vampire vision the world is transformed the swamp the moon the 
clouds the cry of the night birds all come to him with unnatural 
clarity he looks down with pity at the corpses of his wife and child 
who appear beautiful in death now rather than repulsive he closes the 
lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground astonished at the ease 
of it 

he turns and stares at lestat whom he sees now with vampires vision 
lestats eyes are brighter his buttons are glimmering in the light 
everything is clearer brighter containing more facets of light and 
colour 

lestat 
stop staring at my buttons didnt i tell you it was going to be fun 

lestat leads him into the swamp everything astonished louis as if 
hes never seen it before louis is suddenly racked by shudders of 
pain 

lestat 
youre bodys dying pay no attention it will take twenty minutes at 
most 

louis 
dying 

louis dryretches 

lestat 
it happens to us all 

lestat wipes louis brow 

lestat

louis

lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in louis ears 

lestat 
that doesnt matter anymore louis youll see come 

louis vampire pov  swamp 

small high ground camp of runaway slaves several share a bottle of 
rum around the fire a male slave rises a gorgeous hunk of flesh in 
the moonlight and goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder 

lestat 
theyre all beautiful now men women the old the youngsimply 
because they are alive  

the slave walks towards them in the darkness a crucifix gleams round 
his neck 

lestat 
take him 

louis 
the crucifix  

lestat 
forget the crucifix take him 

louis hesitates 

lestat 
resist no more louis feed 

the slave looks up and sees them two gleaming white beings standing 
before him with devils eyes the he runs 

louis can resist him no more he swoops on him with a vampires rapid 
movement brings him to the ground and sinks his teeth in his neck 

close on louis feeding on the slave the magnificent body shuddering in 
its deaththroes lestat stands above laughing 

the slave dies louis rises from him drunkenly engorged with blood 

louis 
what have i done 

lestat

louis looks down at the body of the slave lestats laughter echoes 
around him 

louis 
dear god what have i done 

lestat

lestat laughs harder louis runs from him screaming in anguish 

ext graveyard night 

louis reaches his wifes grave he falls to his knees throws back his 
head and bares his new fangs to the moon 

louis

int room san francisco night 

malloy stares at louis terrified and enthralled 

malloy

louis 
oh that rumour about crosses 

malloy

louis

particularly fond of looking on crucifixes 

malloy 
the story about stakes through the heart 

louis 
the same as you would say today bull shit 

malloy 
what about coffins 

louis 
coffins coffins unfortunately are a necessity 

ext mansion night 

louis walks up the steps to the mansion he looks now like a fully
fledged vampire yvette the slave girl stares at him from the open 
doorway cascades of harpsichord music come from the interior 

louis vo 
killing is no ordinary act it is the experience of anothers life for 
certain that night i had lost my own life and taken anothers i was 
drowning in a sea of human guilt and regret with all the heightened 
senses of a vampire 

louis enters the mansion following the harpsichord music as if in a 
dream yvette draws back as he approaches 

int mansion night 

louis wanders into the parlour where lestat is playing the harpsichord 
rapidly and exuberantly louis goes to a fulllength mirror and sees 
his own reflection there  quite the perfect vampire 

lestat 
yes thats you my handsome friend and youll look that way till the 
stars fall from heaven 

louis 
it cant be 

lestat 
give it time youre like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he 
feels pain it will pass and we must sleep now i can feel the sun 
approaching 

ext pointe du lac 

dawn spreading over the plantation 

int basement pointe du lac 

a brick walled storage room two coffins stand on the floor lestat 
enters with a lantern louis behind lestat is apprehensive and 
protective of louis he pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior 

lestat 
you must get into it its the only safe place for you when the light 
comes 

louis 
and if i dont 

lestat 
the sun will destroy the blood ive given you every tissue every 
vein the fire in this lantern could do that too 

louis approaches the coffin hands trembling as he peers into it 

lestat 
dont be afraid in moments youll be sleeping as soundly as you ever 
slept and when you awake ill be waiting for you and so will all the 
world 

louis crawls into the coffin fearful yet fascinated 

louis 
you told me something earlier you said you didnt have a choice was 
that true 

lestat smiles bitterly and nods 

lestat 
someday ill tell you we have a lot of time to talk to each other you 
might say we have all the time we shall ever need 

he closes the lid 

total darkness sounds of louis panicked breathing of his prayer 
again 

louis 
dear god what have i done 

int dining room night 

louis and lestat sitting at a sumptuous table piled with uneaten food 
lestat is going through sheafs of documents 

louis vo 
i awoke the next evening to a different world and i realized there are 
as profound differences between vampires as between human beings 

lestat totting up figures on a piece of paper 

lestat 
your wealth dear louis is inestimable your income from cotton alone 
will keep us in comfort for a century 

louis just stares at him 

louis vo 
i sat there staring at him with contempt he had the soul of a 
shopkeeper he was the sows ear out of which nothing fine could be 
made i felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher 

lestat looks up at him and grins 

lestat 
youll get used to killing just forget about that mortal coil youll 
become accustomed to things all too quickly 

louis 
do you think so 

yvette enters stands behind him staring at lestat with loathing 

yvette 
you are not hungry sir 

lestat 
au contraire my dear he could eat a horse 

lestat laughs loudly louis turns and looks at yvette her beautiful 
forehead in the candlelight the veins pulsing on her neck and her 
hands 

louis vo 
i looked at anything mortal and saw all life as precious condemning 
all fruitless guilt and passion that would let it slip through the 
fingers like sand 

yvette returns his stare troubled 

louis vo 
it was only as a vampire that i could see yvettes beauty her fear of 
me increased my desire 

yvette reaches for his uneaten plate louis stops her hand holds it 
for a beat too long looking at the veins in her wrist 

louis 
i will finish it yvette now leave us 

she turns and runs from the table lestat leans towards him 

lestat 
cant you pretend you fool dont give the game away were lucky to 
have such a home 

his hand snakes out under the table it comes up holding a large grey 
rat 

lestat 
pretend to drink at least 

he bares his fangs and slices the rats throat he pours the blood into 
a crystal glass 

lestat 
such fine crystal shouldnt go to waste 

he hands the glass to louis louis drinks the blood and stares at it in 
surprise then at the dead rat on the fine lace tablecloth 

lestat 
i know it gets cold so fast 

louis 
we can live like this off the blood of animals 

lestat shrugs 

lestat 
i wouldnt call it living id call it surviving a useful trick if 
youre caught for a month on a ship at sea 

lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat studying it sadly 

lestat 
theres nothing in the world now that doesnt hold some 

louis 
fascination 

lestat 
yes and im bored with this prattle  

he throws the rat away 

louis 
but we can live without taking human life its possible 

lestat 
anything is possible but just try it for a week come into new orleans 
and let me show you some real sport 

he rises louis follows 

ext new orleans night 

a big lavish drinking place with a raised stage 

italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude commedia dellarte on 
the stage 

plantation owners in soiled brocade lace crooked wigs watch the show 
as tavern wenches move about 

louis vo 
this was new orleans a magical and magnificent place to live in which 
a vampire richly dressed might attract no more notice in the evening 
than hundreds of other exotic creatures 

louis and lestat by a table in the shadow of a tree teresa a tavern 
wench sits on lestats lap pouring drinks for the two of them she 
lifts a fresh glass to lestats lips as he flirts with her 

teresa 
come on mon cher the best in the colony once you touch this youll 
never go to any other tavern again 

lestat 
you think so cherie but what if id rather taste your lips 

teresa 
my lips are even sweeter still 

she kisses him he lets his tongue play with hers then runs it down 
her neck she swoons with pleasure then he sinks his teeth gently in 
her neck looking playfully behind at louis who if apalled and 
fascinated 

antics on the stage 

laughter rocks the tavern 

lestat slips the pale and dead teresa into a chair beside him and folds 
her hands on the table no one notices he lays gold coins on the table 
and touches louis knee 

lestat 
lets get out of here 

lestat rushes out thrilled with himself 

ext tavern night 

a crowded street louis and lestat emerge from the tavern louis looks 
up at the moon 

louis 
have you ever been caught 

lestat 
of course not its so easy you almost feel sorry for them 

they walk down the crowded night street full of ladies in their 
finery freed slaves whores sailors etc 

louis vo 
lestat killed two sometimes three a night a fresh young girl that 
was his favourite for the first of the evening 

int french quarter mansion  ballroom 

small orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig and garb 
prancing to a french minuet young women sit in chairs along the walls 
with their chaperones young men stand opposite 

louis vo 
but the triumphant kill of lestat was a young man they represented the 
greatest loss to lestat because they stood on the threshold of the 
maximum possibility of life 

a youth of preternatural beauty sillhouetted against french windows 
he is talking to an elegan widow seated holding two manicured 
poodles lestat stares at the youth with longing 

lestat 
the trick is not to think about it see that one the widow st clair 
she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband shes perfect for 
you go ahead 

louis 
but how do you know 

lestat 
read her thoughts 

louis 
i cant 

lestat 
the dark gift is different for each of us but one thing is true of 
everyone we grow stronger as we go along 

he leads louis closer to them 

lestat 
take my word for it she blamed a slave for his murder and do you know 
what they did to him 

he smiles at the young man who smiles in return 

lestat 
the evildoers are easier and they taste better 

ext lawns night 

lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees he looks back at 
louis who holds both poodles on a delicate leash walking with the 
widow the minuet spills from the french windows 

widow st clair 
now young man you really amaze me im old enough to be your 
grandmother 

she leans towards him concquettishly louis crazed with hunger sees 
her as beautiful in the moonlight he allows her lips reach his he 
takes her in his arms gently romantically and sinks in his teeth 
she swoons 

widow st clair 
yes thats the melody i remember it oh yes 

louis draws his lips away she is weak in his arms but still alive he 
cant do it the poodles growl he shotts out an arm and grabs one 
then the other 

ext trees night 

lestat bending over the body of the dead youth a scream pierces the 
night 

widow st clair 
murder murderer 

ext lawns night 

the widow on the grass her poodles dead beside her louis is trying to 
quiet her 

widow st clair 
my little papillions my butterflies he killed them 

lestat comes from nowhere claps a hand over her mouth and breaks her 
neck he spits in fury at louis 

lestat 
you whining coward of a vampire who prowls the night killing rats and 
poodles you could have finished us both 

louis throws himself on lestat with extraordinary force pummelling him 
towards the trees 

louis 
what have you done to me youve condemned me to hell 

lestat 
i dont know any hell  

louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength he never knew 
he had 

louis 
you want to see me kill watch me kill you then  

he drags him to the ground an throttles him lestat looks up at him 
amazed and amused at the same time 

lestat 
what strength my friend what strength i remember why i chose you 
now 

lestat squirms from his grip seemingly effortlessly 

lestat 
but you cant kill me louis nor i you 

he ruffles louis hair with wry affection

blesses or cursed with a certain detachment though whether angels 
take as long to learn it as i i will never know

lestat in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked whores one 
runs her finger down his chest the other seems out of it 

whore 1

into her neck after a time she falls to the bed dead he turns to the 
other

fit of pique puts his teeth to her neck she dies at last 

a terrible silence descends lestat looks at louis 

louis 
my god to think you are all i have to learn from 

lestat 
in the old world they called it the dark gift louis and i gave it to 
you 

louis leaves without a word 

ext dank new orleans back streets night 

a rat scurried down a gutter then another and another louis hand 
graps the rat we see him from behind walking down the street 
gripping one then another 

louis vo 
am i damned am i from the devil is my very nature that of a devil 
and all the while as these dreaded questions caused me to neglect my 
thirst my thirst grew hotter my veins were threads of pain in my 
flesh my temples throbbed 

a smaller side street in which every house is marked with an x the 
street is crawling with rats and louis is following them a man passes 
with a lantern 

man 
dont go that way monsieur its the plague go back the way you came 

louis smiles bitterly at these words repeating them to himself 

louis 
the way i came 

he walks on following the rats 

louis vo 
and finally when i could stand it no longer i stood in an empty 
desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying 

a house the door slightly open marked with an x the sound of a child 
crying inside louis walks towards it 

int house night 

a little girl pulling at a figure in a rocking chair 

claudia 
mama please wake up mama im frightened please wake up 

as louis enters he sees the woman is dead her eyes are being eaten 
away by rats 

louis gasps in horror claudia turns she is a radiant doll or angel as 
she stretches out her hand to louis 

claudia 
monsieur please help us papas waiting for us at the ship please 
wake mama monsieur 

she runs to him instinctively he gathers her in his arms he looks 
down pitying on her beautiful face 

louis vo 
and if i am damned why do i fell such pity for her gaunt face why do 
i wish to warm her tiny arms comfort her beating heart 

she snuggles into him suddenly utterly secure she tugs at his hair 
brings his head down towards her and we see louis shiver as his lips 
go to her neck 

her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon gradually 
another sound replaces it 

lestats laughter growing louder and louder 

suddenly louis backs away caught redhanded the child in his arms he 
sees lestat slapping his knee and laughing in the doorway 

lestat 
ah my philospher my martyr never take a human life well you must 
admit it is funny or is it merely touching im not sure 

louis stares at hte unconscious claudia in horror then lets her slip 
gently into a chair shamefully he wipes his mouth sees the tiny 
wounds on her throat 

lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and begins to dance 
with her in great circles humming and talking her head falls back 
black water flows from her mouth 

lestat 
lets make some party of it shall we maybe theres some life in the 
old lady yet 

louis flees into the street 

lestat 
come back louis you are what you are the plague would have got her 
within hours anyway merciful death how you love your precious guilt 

ext streets night 

louis running through an assortment of streets all the night life of 
new orleans flows by him 

louis vo 
for years i had not savoured a human and when i had lestats words 
made sense to me i knew peace only when i killed and when i heard her 
heart in that terrible rhythm i knew again what peace could be yet 
even then i could not contenance it 

ext waterfront dawn 

fingers of light in the sky louis pale and shivering walks splashing 
through the water he comes to a huge sewerpipe crowded with rats he 
crawls inside 

ext waterfront some evenings later 

the same sewerpipe now the bodies of dead rats lie all around a pire 
of fine leather boots splash through the water  lestats 

int sewerpipe evening 

louis huddled there so pale and shivering he seems close to death 
lestat comes through 

lestat 
all i need to find you louis is follow the corpses of rats 

he bends down to him suprisingly gently and puts his own coat around 
him 

lestat 
pain is terrible for you you feel it like no other creature because 
you are a vampire you dont want it to go on 

louis 
no 

they emerge from the sewer and walk along the waterfront 

lestat 
do what it is in your nature to do and you will feel as you felt with 
that child in your arms 

louis 
oh god lestat i felt peace i felt an end to the craving 

lestat 
that and more 

he puts his arm around louis to stop his shivering 

lestat 
evil is a point of view god kills indiscriminately and so shall we 
for no creatures under god are as we are none so like him as 
ourselves 

louis 
is god merciless greedy and cruel 

lestat 
ah but we have even more in common with our creator come i am like a

louis runs at him but lestat brushes him aside efforlessly so he 
falls to the floor lestat bites his wrist and presses the bledding 
wound to the childs mouth he winces in pain 

lestat 
thats it dear more you must drink it to get well 

claudia sucks on the wound reviving making little noises like a 
person waking from sleep 

louis rises to his feet as claudia clutches lestats arm sucking the 
blood fiercely lestat moans 

lestat

he pulls her losse and she growls and stares at him with big clear 
astonished eyes 

claudia

obviously in pain 

claudia

close on claudia 

being transformed becoming white yet robust brighteyed yet crazed 
she shakes her beautiful curls and the dust falls from them they are 
shining in the candlelight 

louis cannot stop looking at her he does not notices as  

the maid enters

ah quelle belle enfant 

the maid comes near the bed kneels in front of claudia lestat lays 
his hand on the maids throat and claudia watches keenly 

lestat 
gently cherie they are so innocent they must not be made to suffer 

claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck locking on to the 
flowing blood 

the maid is transfixed 

close on louis his anguish his fascinated horror 

louis

lestat

world but there was more to it than that perhaps in the end he did it 
 to show me that he could for he lavished affection on her there 
was no doubt about that life was very different with madame claudia

contours of the streets i found my way there aware that id always 
known where it was and avoided it not wanting to pass the doorway 
where id first heard claudia cry 

louis back in the same street outside the same house he stands with 
claudia at the window there is a family inside a picture of domestic 
tranquility 

louis 
i heard you crying you were there in a room with your mother you were 
hugging her for warmth crying pitifully as you had been for days 
because your mother was dead 

claudia stares at him suddenly very cold very alert 

louis 
i opened the shutters i came into the room i felt pity for you 
pity but something else 

he cant go on claudias eyes are remoreseless 

claudia

louis 
and he found me with you i ran sickened at what id done then he cut 
his wrist and fed you from him i tried to stop him but you were a 
vampire then and have been every night hereafter

ext streets night 

louis walking the streets shivering 

louis 
i walked all night i walked as i walked years before when my mind swam 
with guilt at the thought of killing i found myself at the cathedral 

a cathedral rising out of the mist the doors open 

louis 
i thought of all the things i had done and couldnt undo and i longed 
for one seconds peace 

louis walks towards the doors inside 

int cathedral night 

louis enters the dim lights of candles a sacristan tending the altar 
an old woman praying  otherwise empty 

louis 
i had no fear if anything i longed for something to happen for the 
stones to tremble as i entered the foyer 

louis walking down the nave of the church he stops by the alter 

louis 
i almost genuflected from old habit i almost prayed 

louis sits in a pew 

louis 
and then it struck me 

louis pov  the cross the statues the tabernacle 

louis 
what if the statues gave an image to nothing what if i was the 
supernatural in this cathedral the only immortal under this roof and 
i felt nothing but loneliness loneliness to the point of madness 

suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder louis almost jumps he turns 
and sees the face of a greyhaired priest 

priest 
you wish to go to confession i was about to lock up the church 

louis stares at him tears in his eyes 

priest 
you are troubled arent you can i help 

louis 
its too late too late  

preist

the priest gestures to the confessional louis rises slowly 

int confessional 

louis kneeling in the darkness the hatch slides back 

louis

how to change nor beg for forgiveness 

priest

heart

in jackson square i killed her and thousands of others before her i 
have walked the streets of new orleans like the grim reaper and fed on 
human life for my own i am a vampire father and have turned the one 
i love most of all into on too  

the hatch slams down louis rises confused and the door is flung 
open the priest stands there 

priest

louis rises walks out 

louis 
then there is no mercy 

his face comes into the light the priest steps back openmouthed 

louis 
you talk of sacrilege why if god exists does he suffer me to exist 

he bares his fangs the priest runs screaming gets to the bellrope 
begins to ring the bell louis swoops on him 

louis 
why does he suffer me to live 

louis takes him lifting him from the floor till his feet stop 
kicking

as if hed been a bag of blood his skin is shrivelling against his 
bones like parchment his eyes are slipping back into his skulllike 
face his lush beautiful hair remains unchanged but his clothes are 
virtually being emptied of the body it is no more than bones wrapped 
in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered 
skull 

louis 
lestat oh god forgive us 

claudia 
dont mock me louis help me 

she stares at the shrivelled skeleton in its skin wrapping she is 
fascinated she sees the vampiric blood flow all over the floor she 
touches it and brings her finger to her lips 

claudia 
goodnight sweet prince may flights of devils wing you to your rest 

louis walks forward touches the skeleton the blonde hair 

louis

she stands up all business suddenly 

claudia

she drags the coverlet from the table knocking the crockery over the 
dead youths and wraps lestats skeleton in it she takes a bunch of 
chrysanthemums and places them in his skeleton hands 

claudia 
should we burn him bury him what would he have liked louis 

louis 
dont mock claudia 

claudia 
the swamp 

ext carriage night 

louis whipping the horses claudia beside him lestats skeleton in the 
back with the bodies of the two dead youths 

claudia 
in europe louis we shall meet our own kind find the one who made 
him learn what it means 

louis 
and suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made 
him knows nothing and it goes back nothing proceeding from nothing 
until there is nothing and we must live with the knowledge that there 
is no knowledge 

the carriage pulls up by a swamp mist everywhere overhanging 
creepers 

louis 
and if we find the one who made him do we tell him we destroyed his 
own creation the vampire lestat 

louis drags out the bodies of the boys he slides them into the waters 
of the swamp we see ripples in the water and the churning of 
alligators as they attack the corpses louis takes lestats skeleton 
in his arms he slides it into the waters the alligators speed towards 
it 

claudia 
he belongs with those reptiles louis he deserved to die 

louis 
then maybe so do we every night of our lives he was my brother my 
maker he gave me this life whatever it is 

claudia 
i did it for us louis so we could be free 

he stands there saying nothing 

claudia 
louis look at me 

louis bitterly 
i cant go away from me 

claudia is shocked to her core she steps back louis stares at the 
rippling waters gradually the movement of alligators stops then he 
hears a sound he hasnt heard in years soft chocking he turns sees 
claudia sitting by a cypress tree like a little girl for the first 
time in years she is weeping copiously 

louis 
claudia  youre crying  

we see her face tears of blood running down it she is heartbroken 
lost 

claudia 
you never talked to me like that  in all these years 

louis 
and you never cried  

claudia

would die the way he died 

louis gathers her in his arms 

louis 
hush claudia hush now my dear  

claudia 
tell me you dont hate me louis i did it for you  

louis walks her towards the carriage 

louis 
i love you claudia always and we are free now claudia no lestat 
just the two of us beginning the great adventure of our lives 

he lifts her into the carriage and drives off leaving the silent 
waters of the swamp 

int flat night 

sturdy mullato workmen lifting cases and trunks out of the apartment 
all the furniture is covered in white sheets claudia dressed in a cap 
and hat is playing the piano by the light of one remaining oillamp 

louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries 

louis 
the birds we forgot about the birds theres nothing for it but to let 
them go 

he opens the cage and the canaries fly around the room 

there is a knocking on the door claudia falters 

claudia 
what was that 

louis 
the workmen must have a trunk  dont stop cherie  

he goes downstairs claudia plays a moment then stops perturbed she 
goes to the window then sees something out there that makes her face 
go white she screams

louis reaches the door the knocking gets louder he opens the door as 
 

claudia  

reaches the stairs she screams  

claudia

but louis has opened the door nothing there he looks back at claudia 
puzzled then at the door again when swooping into his vision comes 
the nightmare image of  

lestat  

in filthy swampsoaked rags robust again but his flesh shrivelled 
covered in scars his eyes riddled bloodshot he roars 

lestat 
where is she where is that accursed child 

louis throws his body against the door slamming it on lestats 
reaching hand the hand withdraws as lestat roars louis bolts the 
door 

louis runs up the stairs sweeps claudia in his arms watching apalled 
as the door shudders with the force of lestats body 

in the parlour 

louis runs through with claudia in his arms 

louis 
it cant be  

claudia 
it is take the back stairwell  

suddenly lestat crashes through the casement window scattering blood 
everywhere reefing himself on the shattered glass he tumbles to the 
floor and gets unsteadily to his feet 

lestat 
give me her louis 

louis throws claudia behind him and hurls himself on lestat who fights 
like a ravening animal bits of his broken body coming off in the 
process then with a terrifying effort lestat hurls louis off goes 
for claudia who grabs the poker from the fireplace scatters burning 
coals over him he falls back then comes at her again as the drapes 
catch fire louis grabs the lamp 

louis 
stay back for the love of god or ill burn you alive 

lestat lunges again at claudia louis hurls the lamp which explodes 
him in flame 

lestat screams in agony whirls around the room then comes on claudia 
again she hurls another lamp louis throws the flaming sheets around 
him wrapping him further in fire lestat falls to his knees choking 
hands up over his face in the smoke the whole parlour is afire louis 
gathers up claudia smothering the burning house carries her down the 
back stairs through the carriage way and through the gathering crowds 
of mortals into the street 

ext street night 

louis running with claudia in his arms he looks back at the flames of 
the house sound of a ships horn 

claudia 
the ship is sailing wihout us 

louis 
not yet 

holding her tightly louis runs 

ext deck of ship near dawn 

louis stands at the railings in the morning mist as the ship moves down 
the river he sees 

city of new orleans 

with flame lighting up the sky 

louis vo 
though the fire seemed to spread through the quartier i stood on that 
deck until dawn fearful he would come out again of the very river like 
some monster to destroy us both and all the while i thought lestat 
we deserve your vengeance you gave me the dark gift and i delivered 
you into the hands of death for the second time 

int room san francisco 

louis and malloy 

malloy 
did he die in the fire 

louis 
he was dead to us we were free that was all that mattered 

ext ship evening 

the ship shrouded in mist 

louis vo 
though the ship was blessedly free of rats a strange plague 
nonetheless struck its passengers 

a body is slipped into the sea a priest reads last rites to a mourning 
family 

int ships hold 

turnks and cases creaking with the ships movement dead rats 
everywhere 

louis vo 
claudia and i alone seemed imune we kept to ourselves pondering the 
mystery of lestat and the greater mystery of each other 

ext ship night 

passing through the straits of gibralter 

louis vo 
we reached the mediterranean i wanted those waters to be blue they 
were black nightime waters and how i suffered then straining to 
remember the colour that a young mans senses had taken for granted 
that my memory had let slip away for eternity it was balck off the 
coast of italy black off the coast of greece europe itself was black 

ext deck night 

claudia sitting with an easel and sketchpad sketching the bay of 
naples a beautifully realised drawing all in shades of grey and 
black louis observes 

claudia 
louis your quest is for darkness only this sea is not your sea they 
myths of men are not your myths their history isnt yours 

the sketch changes to a sketch of  

the acropolis  

in the moonlight 

louis vo 
we saw the acropolis by moonlight shades of grey and silver and i 
longed for the brilliant white of those marbles in the hot sun of 
homer 

the sketch changes to a sketch of  

transylvania  

and the traditional shapes of the vampire landscape 

louis vo 
we docked at varna and searched the rural countryside of the 
carpathians for what she liked to term our kind 

a montage of sketches now  a translyvanian village a graveyard 

ruined castle after castle looking into the skies 

louis 
the quest for these old world vampires filled me with bitterness we 
searched village after village ruin after ruin and i was glad when 
always we found nothing for what could the damned really have to say 
to the damned 

int room san francisco 

malloy and louis 

malloy 
you found nothing 

louis 
peasant rumours superstitions about garlic crosses stakes in the 
hear all that  how do you say again bull shit but one of our kind 
not a whisper

no vampires in transylvania no count dracula 

louis 
fictions my friend the vulgar fictions of a demented irishman so 
we repaired to paris 

ext boulevard facade of grand hotel and paris opera 

crowds and gaslight everywhere carriages horses opera coming from 
the opera house 

louis vo 
i think the very name of paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that 
was extraordinary i was a creole after all and paris was the mother 
of new orleans a universe whole and entire unto herself 

ext 18th centure palaces along the seine  night 

the high walls of the louvre dark figures walking in pairs through the 
shadowy tulieries 

ext street  shop window 

claudia in furtrimmed muff and bonnet peers through the glass at a 
display of dolls each doll in there seems to resemble her with blonde 
hair and blue eyes she peers deep into the shop and sees  

madeleine a young woman bent over a workbench painting a dolls face 
oblivious to being watched 

int opera staircase

branching arches louis is overcome with sadness claudia is

int salon night 

claudia surrounded by discarded dresses and outfits being attended by 
cautouriers all the clothes are tiny to fit her frame but have an 
adult cut and shape 

louis 
we were alive again we were in love and so euphoric was i that i 
yielded to her every desire 

int sumpruous hotel suite 

full of late 19th century furniture lots of empire style regency 
gilt velvet and brocade 

close on a huge black ebony chest 

against a wall solemn among all the light and glitter

by a large gilt mirror in her new clothes she is covered with 
jewelry fixing earrings to her ears 

claudia

herself 

claudia

louis 
yes 

claudia 
well tell me papa what was it like making love 

louis is stunned he blushes 

claudia 
you dont remember or you never knew 

louis 
it was something hurriesand seldom savoured something acute that 
was quickly lost it was the pale shadow of killing 

claudia 
but how will i ever know louis 

she stares at him through the mirror 

claudia 
ill never find them will i my own kind 

ext boulevard evening 

louis and claudia walk along a boulevard like father and daughter all 
around them are bourgeois parisian families on their evening stroll 
claudia points at the children that pass

she points to a beautiful french child walking by with her mother 

claudia 
or her or her  or any of them

claudia 
they are ducklings that will grow into swans whereas i must be the 
duckling forever

claudia 
yes should i take her louis among her dolls make a doll of her in 
turn 

louis 
come claudia 

he takes her arm but claudia shakes him off and moves into the shop 

ext latin quarter night 

louis walks briskly head bowed 

louis vo 
for a time we had been almost human in the sensual whirl of whtt paris 
had to offer but the human delights of that city only served to remind 
her of the ageless child she had become i felt her pain as i walked 
until i become aware that i was being followed 

cu louis feet  

walking a step echoes his 

louis stops turns sees nothing then walks again the echoing steps 
begin again 

louis again sees a shadow flitting 

louis 
claudia 

nothing he walks again hears the same effect then he stops he 
stares at a gaslamp opposite 

louis vo 
so it was when i had given up the search for vampires that a vampire 
found me 

santiago a tall vampire materialises under the gaslight and louis 
gradually realises that this vampire has assumed the same attitude 
posture clothes and hairstyle as louis 

louis gives an involuntary shake of the head santiago mimics louis 
takes a step forwards santiago mimics louis folds his arms santiago 
mimics 

louis and statiago simultaneously 
clever 

louis 
you mean me harm 

santiago a beat later 
you mean me harm 

louis calculates 

louis 
trickster buffoon 

santiago echoes the first word but not the second louis has broken 
his composure he turns his back on santiago only to come face to face 
with santiago right in front of him 

again louis turns this back to find santiago facing him 

louis turns glowers refusing to look at him 

louis 
ive searched the world for an immortal and this is what i find 

slowly he looks up santiago draws close breaking the mirror trick and 
suddenly slams louis back against the wall 

louis is furious he regains his balance strikes out at santiago and 
when santiago vanishes to reappear behind him louis slams back his 
elbow into his midriff santiago staggers amazed and then rushes at 
louis throwing him down 

louis rolls back to his feet then to his amazement sees two vampires 
on in front on behind he looks both ways then sees one has vanished 
he stares awestruck at this new one 

armand 

he looks like an angel 

armand 
you are all right 

he reaches into his waistcoat takes an engraved invitation out of his 
pocket and thrusts it at louis 

louis reads it alound as we see 

theatre des vampires 
by special invitation 
friday 9 pm 

armand 
bring the petit beauty with you no one will harm you i wont allow 
it remember my name armand 

armand bows and vanishes 

louis listens to the silence 

ext boulevard des capuchines  theatre des vampires  night 

louis formally dressed with claudia in rich attire on his arm they 
pass people buying tickets for the theatre and go inside 

louis 
remember what ive told you theyll have different powers theyll 
read your thoughts if you allow it 

they draw close to 

huge posters reading  

theatre des vampires presents 
the masque of the red death 
by edgar allen poe 

the posters are illustrated with cliched images of vampires overcoming 
damsels in distress 

another angle 

claudia 
but this cant be real this is nonsense 

louis 
nonsense all right but something tell me its going to be the 
strangest nonsense weve ever seen 

warily they show their invitations to the mortal ticket taker at the 
door he glances away indifferently 

int theatre box night 

claudia and louis look at the crowd as the lights go down 

claudia 
mortals mortals everywhere and lots of drops to drink 

louis 
they are here i know they are listen for something that doesnt make 
a sound 

stage curtain rises 

an elaborate painted set of an italianate castle death standing before 
it the traditional image of the grim reaper complete with magnificent 
scythe 

louis whisper 
its a vampire its the one i saw in rue st jacques 

a version of the poe story unfolds before them all of the participants 
are vampires all beautiful gleaming white aged 20 or 30 

louis 
they use no paint and the audience think it is paint 

claudia 
how devilishly clever 

a spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out upon the stage 

claudia 
shes no vampire 

louis 
no shes frightened she doesnt know where she is 

the audience laughts uneasily then stops as the mortal woman comes 
into the footlights she is too beautiful too confused santiago as 
death advances on her she backs away terrified then sees the other 
vampires in a phalanx advancing from behind in a halfcircle 

mortal woman 
i dont want to die 

she looks around in panic santiago swoons arms over his breast as if 
he is hopelessly in love 

santiago 
we are death 

the mortal woman steps to the footlights 

mortal woman 
someone help me please what have i done 

louis whispers to claudia 

louis 
this is no performance 

claudia 
and no one knows but us 

on the stage  

santiago 
we all die death is the one thing you share with all those here 

santiago gestures to the audience 

audience 

rapt faces 

on stage 

mortal woman 
but im young 

santiago 
death is no respecter of age he can come any time any place need i 
tell you what fate has in store for you 

mortal woman 
i would take my chance let me go please 

santiago 
and if you take that chance and live what is your fate the humpbacked 
toothless visage of old age 

santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of her peasant 
blouse it opens completely and starts to slip she tries to catch it 
but gently stops her wrists the blouse falls exposing her young 
breasts 

louis and claudia 

louis 
this is monstrous 

claudia 
yes and very beautiful 

on stage 

santiago 
just as this flesh is pink now it will turn grey and wrinkle with age 

woman 
let me live please i dont care 

santiago 
then why should you care if you die now 

she shakes her head confused he catches her wrists behind her back 

audience is awestruck by her beauty her suffereing 

santiago draws near her cheek 

santiago 
and suppose death had a heart to love and to release you to whom would 
he turn his passion would you pick a person from the crowd there a 
person to suffer as you suffer 

audience 

a young girl cries out in jest 

young girl 
oh yes take me monsier vampire i adore you 

audience roars with laughter 

onstage 

santiago 
you wait your turn 

the audience laughs again 

the mortal woman shakes her head in panic 

santiago 
well have you a sister a mother a daughter you would send in your 
place 

close on claudia 

even she is repelled by the cruelty she shakes her head 

mortal woman 

shakes her head she is helpless 

santiago 
we alone can give death meaning do you know what it means to be loved 
by death to become our bride 

mortal woman looks up on hte verge of hysteria or fainting but then 
her eyes mist over she is being entranced 

from her pov we realise she is looking past santiago at the divinely 
beautiful armand who has just stepped out of the wings armand has 
entranced her he passes santiago santiago stiffens but yields the 
stage 

armand 
no pain 

mortal woman 
no pain 

armand takes her by the nakes shoulders 

armand 
your beauty is a gift to us 

on stage 

armand gestures to the others who slowly gracefully close in 

armand 
who deserves such a gift 

he pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls revealing her 
nakedness but she is spellbound 

mortal woman 
no pain 

armand embraces her drinks her naked body stark against her black 
clothes then he passes her to the other vampires one by one 

close on louis who battles desire and hunger with anger 

louis 
ive seen enough of this i loathe it 

claudia 
be still 

on stage 

the naked mortal woman lies dead on the floor the vampires seem to 
vanish one by one as the curtain draws across the audience loudly 
applauds what they presume are theatrical tricks 

another angle 

the audience milling towards the exits they talk in vacuous terms 
about the beauty of the show the symbolism of it the daring of it as 
they leave 

gradually louis and claudia are left alone in the empty theatre louis 
seems anxious to leave claudia whispers in his ear 

claudia 
patience louis patience 

he looks around the empty theatre more eery now than when the play was 
on the red curtain shifts slightly in a hidden breeze a candle 
sputters and dies in a box then the candle flares again and we see 
armand in the box looking down on them he stares with a dreamy 
expression saying nothing 

louis 
weve been searching for you for a very long time 

his voice echoes eerily armand gestures for them to follow him 

int foot of stairway 

armand leading louis and claudia following it opens into a  

huge underground ballroom 

walls are painted with famous copies of durer brueghel goya and bosch 
depictions of death fine wooden coffins line the walls candles burn 
in sconces casting alternate shawdows and pools of light armand walks 
through gesturing louis and claudia to follow him 

as they walk through vampire man and women appear out of the shadows 
like wraiths startling them drifting around them stroking them 
touching claudia as if she were a doll shrieks of preternatural 
laughter 

armand gestures to the vampires to back off 

all obey but estelle 

estelle 
such a darling 

she menaces claudia her breasts enormous her fangs bared armand 
throw her a look and she is flung against the wall 

louis stares around the vampires faces drift towards him and away 
always disclosing the face of armand who seems some distance away but 
strangely close staring at louis with a constantly calm hypnotic 
gaze then a young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a candleabra 
which he hands to armand 

armand and the boy come towards them leading them along the walls his 
candleabra illuminating the ghastly murals his face gleaming like an 
angel above the candleflame 

louis 
monstrous 

armand 
yes and very beautiful 

louis 
your lips they didnt move 

armand 
they did but too fast for you to see them no magic just grace and 
speed 

the boy is watching louis armands hand beckons and the boy draws up 
to louis in the candlelight he places his arms on louis shoulders 
louis glances at armand who smiles louis sees the puncture marks on 
the boys neck 

armand 
he wants you 

louis is utterly confused cant resist drinks his blood 

the boys body presses against him sensual willing the other 
vampires appear all around louis who suddenly senses it and draws 
away ashamed 

claudia watches warily from a distance armand beckons at her and 
louis and open a door in the wall which reveals a stone staircase 

int medieval room 

medieval chairs table an old coffin a bed in one corner a blazing 
fire a medieval painting of satan being banished from heaven above 
the fire armand places the boy on the bed settling him so he sleeps 

armand 
disappointing isnt it to come so far and find so little jaded 
ingenues amusing themselves with make believe 

louis 
we had feared we were the only ones 

armand 
but how did you come into existence 

he glances at louis then at claudia who averts her eyes 

armand 
you dont want to answer two vampires from the new world come to 
guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away 

louis 
are you the leader of tis group 

armand 
if there were a leader i would be the one 

claudia stares at him constantly guarded 

louis 
so you have the answers 

armand 
ah you have questions 

louis 
what are we 

armand 
nothing if not vampires 

louis 
who made us what we are 

armand 
surely you know the one who made you 

louis 
but the one who made him who made the one who made him the source of 
all this evil 

louis looks at the picture armand watches him 

armand 
that is a picture nothing more 

louis 
you mean we are not children of satan 

armand 
no 

he smiles at louis a smile of infinite compassion 

armand 
i understand i saw you in the theatre your suffering your sympathy 
for that girl i saw you with the boy you die when you kill you feel 
you deserve to die and you stint on nothing but does that make you 
evil or since you comprehend what you call goodness does it not make 
you good 

louis 
then there is nothing 

armand 
perhaps 

he passes his finger through the candle flame 

armand 
and perhaps this is the only real evil left 

louis 
then god does not exist 

armand 
i have not spoken to him 

louis 
and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil 

armand 
none that ive ever known i know nothing of god or the devil i have 
never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my 
soul and as far as i know after four hundred years i am the oldest 
living vampire in the world 

he stares at them his face angelic hypnotic young his eyes hold 
them both in a trance 

louis 
my god so its as i always feared nothing leading to nothing 

armand 
you fell too much so much you make me feel 

he stares from claudia to louis he seems to be reading their souls 

armand 
the one who made you should have told you this the one who left the 
old world for the new 

louis 
he knew nothing he just didnt care 

armand 
knew you mean he is 

claudia appears suddenly to louis shoulder interrupting 

claudia 
come beloved its time we were on our way im hungry and the city 
waits 

she stares hard at armand armand looks from her to louis 

armand 
so soon to go 

he seems genuinely regretful but claudia pulls louis out 

int darkened corridors and theatre night 

louis and claudia feel their way through darkened corridors trying to 
find their way out 

louis vo 
the place was dark as we left a darkness that confounded even claudia 
and as we blundered through it again came the thought i have wronged 
lestat i have hated him for th wrong reasons 

suddenly a light comes on they see they are in the empty theatre 
santiago stands on the stage under a candle 

santiago 
how did you wrong him 

louis is stunned 

louis 
you read my thoughts 

santiago 
you said a name  

louis 
a name i dont want to say again 

santiago 
i seemed to recongise it 

other vampires appear behind him 

santiago 
there is but one crime among us vampires here 

he looks at claudia 

santiago 
you should know who are so secretive about the vampire who made you 

claudia laughs 

claudia 
boredom 

santiago 
it is the crime that means death to any vampire to kill your own kind 

claudia 
aaaah i was so afraid it was to be born like venus out of the foam as 
we were come louis lets go 

ext hotel saint gabriel night 

claudia and louis enter the lobby 

claudia 
i lothe them i cant stand the sight of them stupid bourgeois 
parisians all dressed in black like some private club ive searched 
for them the world over and i despise them 

louis 
what danger 

claudia 
i can feel it from them they want to know who made us what became of 
him they have their rules their idiotic rules 

they come to their room enter 

int hotel rooms night 

louis closes the door behind him claudia paces 

louis 
do you think i would let them harm you 

claudia 
no you would not louis danger hold you to me 

louis 
love holds you to me and we are in danger not you 

claudia 
love 

she smiles at him a strange sad adult smile 

claudia 
you would leave me for armand if he beckoned you 

louis 
never 

claudia 
he wants you as you want him hes been waiting for you he wants you 
for a companion he bides his time that place he finds them as dull 
and lifeless as we do 

louis 
thats not so 

claudia 
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word when he put 
me in that trance 

louis 
so you felt it too 

claudia 
let him go he said let him go 

she touches his face 

claudia 
is that what i should do louis let you go my father my lover my 
louis who made me 

there are tears in her eyes louis lifts her up in his arms 

louis 
he can protect us claudia 

claudia 
you really believe that 

ext dollship night 

claudia staring at the dolls we see madeleine inside painting a 
doll she sees claudia and smiles and waves 

int theatre night 

louis sitting alone in the box as the curtains draw back to show 
santiago as death as before louis takes advantage of the darkness to 
slip away 

int armands room night 

armand opens the door to louis knock 

armand 
i was waiting for you 

louis 
listen to me 

he follows armand into the room 

louis 
claudia is dear to me my daughter 

armand 
your lover 

louis 
no my beloved my child 

armand 
if you say so you are innocent 

louis 
im not innocent but im afraid she feels shes in danger from the 
others 

armand 
she is 

louis 
but why 

armand 
i could give you reasons her silence her youth its forbidden to 
make so young so helpless that cannot survive on its own 

louis 
then blame the one who made her 

armand 
did you kill this vampire who made you both is that why you wont say 
his name santiago thinks you did 

louis 
we want no quarrel with him 

armand 
its already begun if you want to save her send her away 

louis 
then i leave too 

armand smiles 

armand 
so soon without any of those answers you so longed for 

louis 
you said there were none 

armand 
but you asked the wrong questions do you know how few vampires have 
the stamina for immortality how quickly they perish of their own will 

louis 
we can do that 

armand 
you would never give up life if the world were reduced to one empty 
cell on fragile candle you stay alive and study it you see too 
clearly you see too much 

louis 
thats what the one who made me said 

armand 
how he must have loved you 

armand suddenly grips louis close to him 

armand 
louis i need you more than he ever did i need a link with this 
century the world changes we do not therein lies the irony that 
ultimately kills us i need you to make contact with this age 

louis laughs bitterly 

louis 
he dont you see im not the spirit of any age im at odds with 
everything and always have been im not even sure what i am 

armand smiles 

armand 
but louis that is the very spirit of your age the heart of it you 
fall from grace has been the fall of a century 

louis is stunned 

louis 
and the vampires of the theatre 

armand 
like moths around the candle of the age decadent useless they cant 
reflect anything but you do you reflect its broken heart 

louis is speechless 

armand 
are these not the answers you came for 

louis softly 
yes my god 

armand 
a vampire with a human soul an immortal with a mortals passion you 
are beautiful my friend lestat must have wept when he made you  

louis 
lestat you knew lestat 

armand 
yes i knew him knew him well enough not to mourn his passing 

armand stands he takes louis by the arm leads him towards the back 
wall 

armand 
but you must go now you must get her safely out of paris 

he opens a hidden door in the wall 

armand 
noone else knows of this door when you knock you will find me 
waiting 

ext theatre des vampires night 

louis in the street outside as the door closes behind him 

louis vo 
i feld a kind of peace at last i had found the teacher which lestat 
could never i knew now have been i knew knowledge would never be 
withheld by armand it would pass through him as through a pane of 
glass and i knew claudia must leave me 

int hotel suite night 

louis enters there is unfamiliar scent in the air a doll sitting by 
the mirror louis looks in the mirror and sees  

madeleine the dollmaker resplendent in green taffeta sitting like a 
madonna with claudia on her lap claudias arms are wound round her 
neck the contrast between mortal woman and immortal child is plain 

claudia 
madeleine louis is shy 

madeleine rises and comes towards louis she draws back the lace 
fringes round her throat so he can see the two marks there she says 
softly dreamily 

madeleine 
drink 

louis turns away claudia speaks icy from the bed 

claudia 
do it louis because i cannot do it i havent the strength you saw to 
that when you made me 

louis turns to madeleine 

louis 
you havent the vaguest conception under god of what you ask 

madeleine 
au contraire monsieur i have 

louis pushes her away claudia screams 

claudia 
you have found your new companion louis you will make me mine 

louis grips madeleine and shakes her 

louis 
how do we seem to you do you think us beautiful magical our white 
skin our fierce eyes drink you ask me have you any idea of the 
thing you will become 

claudia 
your evil is that you cannot be evil and i will suffer for it no 
longer 

louis 
dont make me claudia i cannot do it 

claudia 
yet you could do it to me snatching me from my mothers hands like two 
monsters in a fairytale couldnt you have waited six more years and 
i would have had that shape and now you weep you havent tears enough 
for what youve done to me 

she points to madeleine 

claudia 
you give her to me do this before you leave me 

she begins to weep sobbing like a child 

claudia 
oh god i love you still thats the torment of it but you know i must 
leave you louis 

louis 
yes 

claudia 
and who will care for me my love my dark angel when you are gone 

louis looks at madeleine 

louis 
you promise to care for her then 

madeleine 
yes 

louis 
and you know what you ask for 

she wraps her arms around claudia 

madeleine 
yes 

louis 
what do you think she is madeleine a doll 

madeleine 
a child who cant die 

her finger clutches a locket around her neck louis touches it opens 
it 

the locket  

a picture of a young girl claudias age wistful beautiful 

louis softly 
and the child who did die 

madeleine 
my daughter 

louis takes her chin in his hand gently 

louis 
look at the gaslight dont tke your eyes off it you will be drained 
to the point of death but you must stay alive do you hear me 

madeleine 
yes 

louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood 

ext hotel balcony later 

louis on the balcony weakened terribly a breeze blows on the gauze 
curtains behind him through which we see  

silhouettes of madeleine and claudia madeleine her arms outstretched 
now a vampire a long moan of pain coming from her claudia comes 
through the curtains alarmed 

claudia whisper 
louis 

louis speaks without turning 

louis 
she is dying it happened to you too but your childs mind cant 
remember 

claudia 
but if she dies 

louis 
its only mortal death 

he turns to look at claudia 

louis 
bear me no ill will my love we are now even 

claudia 
what do you mean 

louis 
what died tonight inside that room was not that woman it will take her 
many nights to die perhaps yeaars what has died in that room tonight 
is the last vestige in me of what was human 

she takes his hand 

claudia 
yes father at last we are een 

he bends down and kisses her he looks up at the wafting curtains he 
sees  

many vampire shadows 

silhouetted coming closer 

claudia 

looks up and sreams 

the curtains 

are ripped aside the vampires of the theatre surge through 

estelle 
time for justice little one 

the vampires close on them as louis struggles claudias scream pierces 
the night air 

int corridor of theatre des vampires night 

in a press of vampires louis claudia and madeleine are forced down 
the dark corridor into  

the ballroom 

vampire chaos as they are dragged through louis struggling like a 
demon 

louis 
armand get me armand he wouldnt countenance this  

santiago

santiago strikes louis to the ground as he struggles to his feet he 
sees the vampires part around a figure coming through he gasps at the 
sight of  

lestat 

dressed beautifully but horribly scarred now from the fire as well as 
the earlier stabbing lestat is confused ancient teetering reaching 
for santiagos shoulder to steady himself

echoing scraping  

lestat grips santiago 

lestat

louis

santiago grabs louis by the neck 

santiago 
death for the others for you eternity in a box  

we see now what caused the scraping a huge metal coffin being dragged 
through the vampires claudia screams 

santiago

the vampires grap louis they force him towards the coffin lestat 
struggles with them 

lestat

santiago laughing 
we promised nothing 

louis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the coffin claudia 
weeps 

louis

power 

louis struggling in the coffin then the lid is forced down huge 
locks closed over it 

int coffin

the metal

then of locks breaking 

louis opens his eyes the lid opens he sees  

armand 

above him reaching down to take his hand 

armand

louis gets out into a vast long catacomb louis runs to the end of it 
steps through a broken brick wall 

louis 
where is she wheres claudia 

armand 
follow me  that way  through my cell  

he points to his cell at the end of the passage the foot of the steps 
sound of rain beyond the door

armand 
i cant save her 

louis 
you cant believe id leave without her armand you must save her you 
have no choice 

armand 
louis i cant save her i will only risk losing you  

louis runs up the stone stairs it leads to the ballroom he enters 

estelle stands far off looking at him coolly she lifts the stage 
skull mask and laughs softly behind it a male vampire slumps in a 
chair staring softly at louis 

silence indifference 

louis sees lestat sitting in a far corner he rushes up to lestat who 
looks up at him confused hes holding something crumpled made of 
cloth 

lestat 
youll come home with me louis fro a little while until i am myself 
again 

louis 
claudia 

louis turns round and round in rage passive still faces a door bangs 
open and shut 

louis looks again at lestat he snatches the cloth from lestats hand 
we see it is a small torn bloodstained dress claudias dress 

the door bangs again estelle laughs rain gusts into the ballroom 

louis goes to the door holding the dress armand approaches trying to 
pull him away but louis shrugs him off he draws nearer and nearer and 
stairs at  

int brick airwell 

on the stones lie claudia and madeleine burn to ashes in each others 
arms like the corpses of his wife and daughter in the new orleans 
graveyard embracing each other 

only claudias blond hair and madeleines red hair remain unburnt 

louis looks up at the walls of this airwell many stories to the sky 
he cries out in agony 

santiago appears behind him staring louis roars in horror and attacks 
santiago scattering the ashes into the rainy wind claudias golden 
locks fly up into the wind they whirl around the warring figure 

armand appears drags louis free pulls him screaming from the airwell 
into the ballroom towards the exit 

claudias hair is sucked up by the wind through the airwell towards 
the night sky 

ext notre dame door night 

louis is slumped against the stone wall armand stands beside him like 
a guardian angel 

armand 
i couldnt prevent it 

louis 
i dont believe you i do not have to read your soul to know that you 
lie 

armand 
louis they cannot be brought back there are some things that are 
impossible even for me 

louis 
you let them do it 

louis climbs to his feet 

louis 
you held sway over them they feared you you wanted it to happen 

armand 
louis i swear i did not 

louis 
i understand you only too well you let them do it as i let lestat 
turn a child into a demon as i let her rip lestats heart to pieces 
well i am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till 
the web traps the one who made it your melancholy spirit of this 
century i know what i must do and i warn you  you saved me tonight 
so i return the favour  do not go near your cell in the theatre des 
vampires again 

ext theatre des vampires dawn 

wet and deserted the streets around the theatre are quiet 

cu clock 

chiming five am 

close on louis 

lookin at the paling sky he is in an alleyway outside of armands 
cell he has a huge keg with him he finds the door unlocked he 
enters 

int cell 

empty the hearth is cold the old coffin is gone louis silently 
closes the door to the passage and blocks it with an immense bar he 
goes in the other door 

int theatre 

louis hurls kerosene all over the stage the curtain the sets the 
seats below he grabs the scythe from the playlet he walks out 
dribbling a trail of kerosene behind him 

int stairs 

louis walking rapidly down leaving the trail of kerosene he creeps 
quietly into the  

ballroom 

leaking kerosene from the cask he splashes over the coffins that gleam 
in the dimness 

then he strikes a match and heaves it into the kerosene everything 
bursts into flame the trail of kerosene roars into fire through the 
ballroom over the coffins and up the stairs we hear explosions of fire 
from above 

louis 

shudders all over fighting the morning weakness he readies the 
scythe like the grim reaper 

estelle rises from her burning coffin screams and tries to run through 
the fire but louis slashes her down with the scythe and she goes down 
screaming her dress in flames 

estelle 
stop him its morning the sunlight stop him 

others rise choking in the smoke screams from everywhere they are 
burning 

louis backs up the stairs to the  

dungeon 

he can see there a thin pale light under armands bolted door suddenly 
 

santiago 

comes at him from behind louis turns santiago rushes him in a blur 
louis swings the scythe too fast to see what he himself is doing 
santiagos head streaming blood flies through the air 

the body drops flapping its arms 

screams come from everywhere 

another vampire rushes burning towards louis he decapitates him in 
turn then he staggers into armands cell and bars the door the 
connects it to the ballroom behind him he staggers to the outer door 
there is a thin strip of daylight beneath the door blinding him he 
throws it open and staggers into the daylight 

ext theatre des vampires dawn 

louis staggers out of the burning theatre into the thin daylight 
great gusts of smoke cover the street he staggers through the 
daylight weakening about to fall when through the clouds of smoke 
comes  

a magnificent hearse  

as in a dream driven by armands human boy the door of the hearse 
opens through the curtains enclosing the interior we see armand he 
reaches a hand out to louis and pulls him inside 

the hearse vanishes through the smoke leaving the spectacle of the 
burning theatre 

ext theatre des vampires twilight 

the gutted theatre and ballroom the roof collapsed exposed to the 
evening sky the life of paris goes on around it oblivious 

int louvre nights later 

it is already a museum by this time and louis and armand fancily 
dressed and composed walk through it they stop by a gericault  the 
wreck of the medusa 

louis 
you didnt even warm them did you 

armand 
no 

louis 
and yet you knew what i would o 

armand 
i knew i rescued you didnt i from the terrible dawn 

louis 
you were their leader they trusted you 

armand 
you made me see their failings louis you made me look at them with 
your eyes 

he looks at louis affectionately 

armand 
your melancholy eyes 

louis 
what a pair we are we deserve each other dont we 

armand 
we are a pair and thats what counts 

armand and louis walk slowly through the louvre together camera 
follows them for a while then comes to rest on a sunrise by turner 

louis vo 
we left paris shortly after for years we wandered greece egypt all 
the ancient lands then out of curiosity perhaps boredom who knows 
what i took him home to my america 

int movie theatre night 

a deco cinema of the twenties louis and armand dressed in the style 
of the period walk down the aisle through the crowded seats 

louis vo 
and there a technological wonder allowed me see sunrise for the first 
time in two hundred years 

on the screen murnaus sunrise in black and white we see a montage 
of sunrises from a whole range of movies in black and white 

louis vo 
and what sunrises seen as the human eye could never see them we would 
sit in the dark night after night among nameless humans entranced 
with the miracle of light silver at first then as the years 
progressed in tones of purple red and my longlost blue 

the sunrises continue in colour now and the backgrounds in them 
change to the fifties 

louis vo 
and in time parted we had become so alike we both wanted the 
certainties of loneliness once more 

the lights come up in a different theatre louis sitting there alone 
in a half empty theatre dressed in the clothes of the fifties he 
rises exits with the others 

ext new orleans street night 

cars rushing by twentiethcentury madness louis emerges from the 
theatre walks through the streets 

louis vo 
i had returned to new orleans as soon as i smelt the air i knew i was 
home there was sadness there rich almost sweet like the fragrance 
of jasmine i walked the streets savouring it like a long lost 
perfume 

ext garden district night 

louis walks past the many greek revival mansions 

louis vo 
and then on prytania street only blocks from the lafayette cemetery i 
caught the scent of death and it wasnt coming from the graves 

camera pans over whitewalled lafayette cemetery and its surrounding 
mansions 

louis vo 
the scent grew stronger as i walked old death a scent too faint for 
mortals to detect 

louis sees rats darting across the street they rush into a great 
overgrown garden surrounding a ruined mansion no lights 

louis stops at a rusted gate he forces it open and enters  

a veritable jungle of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria he sees 
a faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass window of a huge 
greek revival house he approaches then he sees  

old shrivelled corpse of a man long dead and dried up snagged in the 
thorny rosevines 

louis looks around walks on sees another corpse almost nothing but 
bones sinking into the wet earth the roots of an oak overgrowing it 

he looks up at the distant light 

he passes a third corpse caught in wisteria and rose vine only bones 
and clothes 

louis vo 
they were like the doomed princess caught in the thorny vines of 
sleeping beautys castle i knew what it meant a vampire had lured 
them here but had benn to weak to get rid of them 

louis sees dead rats lying near the steps 

louis vo 
it spelt weakness madness the behavior of a dying animal that 
pollutes its own lair 

louis treads carefully on the rotted steps he moves along the porch 
more dead rats he sees through the floorlength window into rooms 
lined with stacked books virtually walled with them water seeps down 
from the ceiling gleaming as it streaks over the books the floors of 
the splendid rooms are bare except for a rotten french chair by a dead 
fireplace a single mirror reflecting the moon 

dead rats 

he moves along the porch to the parlour windows the candle flickers 
inside he sees  

his pov 

lestat lying on the floor he is gaunt to near starvation all his 
scars are gone but he is almost a skeleton and his eyes are enormous 
in their sockets his clothes are rags blond hair beautiful as 
always 

malloys entrances face superimposed over 

malloy vo 
lestat escaped the fire 

louis vo 
he hadnt even been there and all those years i thought he was dead 

back to  

lestat one tiny candle stands beside him he reads an early comic 
from the turn of the century without turning his head he speaks 

lestat 
im so glad youre here louis ive dreamed of your coming 

louis 
dont try to speak its alright 

lestat 
i didnt mean to let them do it that santiago he tricked me 

louis 
thats all past lestat

expressionless

he looks up at the tape it is still turning 

malloy

he shakes his head he gets up and with shaking fingers gathers his 
tapes he runs out of the room 

ext street outside night 

malloy running for his car a convertible he leaps in and screeches 
off through the night 

ext streets night 

malloy whips the car through the tiny streets in sheer unfocused 
terror 

malloy 
jesus 

ext golden gate bridge night 

malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge he breathes 
deeply to calm himself he takes a tape from his pocket and with 
still shaking hands sticks it in the deck 

louis votape 
1791 thats when it happened i was twentyfour younger then you are 
now 

suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat pulls his neck 
backwards  

lestat sinks his teeth in his neck 

malloys hands on the wheel shaking shuddering losing their grip 

malloys eyes bulging as the life drains out of him lestat sucking 
him like a rat 

the wheel swinging free of malloys dying hands 

the car veers wildly into oncoming traffic 

lestat drinks regardless 

a truck coming towards them about to crush the car 

lestats bony hand grabs the wheel jerks it as he drinks 

the car misses the truck by inches 

lestat throws malloy to one side climbs into the front seat 

the tape playing 

louis vo tape 
my invitation was open to anyone sailors whores thieves but it was 
a vampire that accepted 

on lestat at the wheel the corpse of malloy in the passenger seat he 
smiles we can see the blood renewing him 

lestat 
dear louis will i ever forget 

ext golden gate bridge night 

lestat drives on the car a tiny speck against the bridge the sea the 
sky beyond with the first fingers of light spreading through it 


the end
