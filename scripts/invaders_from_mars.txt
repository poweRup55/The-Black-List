         of starstudded heavens at night  scattered cumulus
        clouds alternately obscure and disclose a threequarter
        moon and vast open deeps of glittering constellations
        the music diminishes and backs the voice of the narra
        tor

                               narrator
                 since the beginning of time the people
                 of our earth have looked upon the stars
                 and pondered  they wondered what man
                 ner of man  or creature  inhabited
                 the faint mysterious worlds that lay
                 beyond

        a clatter  he picks it up quickly and listens ap
        prehensively for an indication that he has awakened

        alarm clock on the window sill which reads 340

        david looks at his father with exasperated patience
        and with a shrug of martyrdom swallows the medicine
        and drops back on his pillow

                               maclean
                       gently

                 al rockets from over at white sands 
                       david shakes his head

        david feeling the effects of the sedative yawns
        again  his father runs his fingers lightly through
        davids hair in a soothing fashion

                  our earth is traveling through
                  space at well over a hundred
                  thousand miles an hour  at that

                 i have  and my findings are al
                 most unbelievable  that child died
                 of a subdural hematoma all right
                 but thiscaused it

        everyone crowds around the desk  metzler picks up a
        small hexagonal crystal about a halfinch long with
        the diameter of a pencil  attached to one end is a
        thin platinum disk and two small wires run from this
        to a ruptured platinum globe the size of a small mar
        ble

                               metzler cont
                 i found this device inserted in the
                 base of the skull  and the hemorrhage
                 was caused when this little detonator
                       points to ruptured globe
                 exploded in her brain

                               fielding
                 incredible

                 trolled kathy wilson and impelled
                 her to set fire to her house

                               metzler
                 very possible  weve done some
                 thing similar with white mice 
                 and have made them follow directional
                 impulses with high frequency oscil

                               blake
                 probably their method of getting
                 rid of people when they have no
                 further use for them
