               ext the other end of the tunnel  night

               the two men emerge from the tunnel to the right are	high
               limestone cliffs before them darkness to the left is part
               of a house wall with a door  a dark and forbidding door of
               oak and iron now the womans singing is loud and near the
               general stares at the house looks at the surrounding
               darkness and then back to the house again

                                   general
                             bewilderedly
                         there was no house here

               oliver and the general cross to the house at the door the
               general listens a moment then lifts his hand and thunders on
               the panels with his knuckles the sound of the singing breaks
               off instantly and they stand waiting in the moonlit silence
               suddenly the door opens before them and lamplight makes a
               frame about them a mans voice cheery and welcoming comes
               from the doorway

                                   albrechts voice
                         come in come in

               they step through the doorway and the door closes behind
               them

               int albrechts living room  night

               it is a lovely room of simple austere proportion warm with
               lamplight comfortable with chairs and sofas and heated by a
               brazier full of coals various antiquities heads bits of
               sculpture torsos limbs bowls vases amphoras and cylixes
               decorate the room at one end is a long table on which
               various shards artifacts have been arranged for labor and
               sorting on this table are also books and measuring
               instruments

               the various people in the room turn curiously upon the
               entrance of the soldier and the correspondent it is albrecht
               who is welcoming them he is a swiss of middle age a
               scholarly gentle man with a humorous smile

               before the brazier warming his behind under his coattails
               just as he would have done in devonshire is a ruddyfaced
               englishman also of middle age he is formally dressed and
               has a stiff official air this is mr thomas st aubyn
               british consul at adrianople

               seated some little distance from him in a stiffbacked chair
               is a woman in her early thirties still possessed of a
               haggard beauty there is a curious restrained stillness
               about the woman and when she moves it is with a certain
               careful deliberation she is working on a hand embroidery
               frame after one glance at the newcomers she pays no further
               attention to them this is mary wollsten secretary to the
               consul she is dressed primly in dark clothing  

               at a small table by himself with a tankard of wine before him
               and an empty wine bottle on the table is a commercial
               traveller henry jacks a cockney dressed in a loud fuzzy
               plaid suit and seeming at this moment to be somewhat the
               worse for wear and liquor

               the general and oliver look around the room in astonishment
               albrecht himself shows some surprise now that he sees the
               general in the fully lighted room

                                   albrecht
                             surprised

                              polite explanation

               the people in the room exhibit varying degrees of interest

                                   albrecht
                             smiling
                         it may seem an odd choice for a
                         home yet i like it
                             to oliver and the

               he half turns to indicate the consul

                                   albrecht
                         this is mr st aubyn british
                         consul from adrianople

               st aubyn bows formally the general returns his bow with a
               nod and oliver goes forward and shakes the consuls hand

                                   albrecht
                         	and miss st aubyn

               cathy smiles wanly in greeting oliver in american fashion
               goes from her father to miss st aubyn takes her hand

                                   oliver

                             masking irritation
                         that was my companion she sings
                         little peasant songs quite nicely 
                         a completely untrained voice of
                         course

               st aubyn continues the introductions indicating the somber
               faced woman who sits apart from the others

                                   st aubyn
                         my secretary miss wollsten

               at this point jacks rises unsteadily and lurches towards the
               others he flashes a card from his pocket

                                   jacks
                         jacks  henry jacks tinware
                         best grade and the lowest prices

                              known slogan
                         jacks sells no junk

               the general looks at him astonished at this strange
               commercial personality oliver having shaken hands with miss
               wollsten nods across to jacks amiably

                                   oliver
                         arent you a little out of

                         jacks jacks goes to the world

               he walks unsteadily back to his own seat

                                   albrecht
                         mr jacks is a philosopher
                             to the general
                             and oliver

                         inconvenient for travel we were
                         under constant shelling all the way
                         down the coast

                                   general
                         the enemy is in retreat there will
                         be no more fighting here
                             to albrecht

                                   general
                         but why

               ida the woman servant a middle—aged greek woman in peasant
               costume with a dark sombre face comes in she has an
               amphora of wine and two glasses in her hands she pours wine
               for oliver and hands him the glass then turns to the general
               and begins to pour for him as he and albrecht talk

                                   albrecht
                         there was some trouble here ——the
                         villagers on the mainland —this
                         island was the focal point of their
                         anger they came here ——broke open
                         the tombs and despoiled the graves

                                   general
                         all the graves

                                   albrecht
                         im afraid so there were rumors
                         ——people were aroused some feared
                         restlessness among the dead you
                         know the old superstitions

                                   general
                         i donut understand

                                   ida
                         i can explain master soldier

               she has put down the amphora so that her hands are free she
               lifts a fore—finger to each side of her mouth and grimaces
               between the upright fingers

                                   general
                             understanding her
                              immediately
                         vorvolakas

               hastily ida crosses herself at the same time nodding
               agreement

                                   general
                             not too unpleasantly
                         you are an old fool

                                   ida
                             grinning pleased at this
                              insult from her heroic
                              countryman
                         you think so you think such things
                         do not happen right now ——
                         upstairs there is one who is rosy
                         and bright —— full of blood  and
                         here ——
                             she makes a sidewise
                              inclination of her head
                              toward mrs st aubyn
                         ——	here is one who is pale and
                         cold as a lily

                                   general
                         you are still a fool

               ida laughs and albrecht picks up the amphora and starts to
               pour another glass of wine for the general

                                   general
                             to albrecht
                         you know the greek legends you
                         drink the greek wine but you are
                         not a greek

               albrecht is carrying the wine jug and glasses to a small
               table near the brazier

                                   albrecht

               i am greek sir by affection

               albrecht puts down the jug and the glasses and turns to	the
               general

                                   albrecht
                         but the gods played a little trick
                         on me i was born in switzerland

                                   oliver
                             pointing to an antique
                              statue
                         you collect these to sell abroad

               albrecht starting to pour from the wine jug shakes his
               head

                                   albrecht
                             shaking his head
                         no more one day i stood in the
                         royal museum at munich and watched
                         the fat burghers and their
                         brood—mare wives staring and poking
                         at my beautiful trophies now i am
                         content just to live —— here in the
                         heart of a vanished world

                                   jacks
                             butting in without moving
                              from his place
                         i wish itd vanish i do
                         id give every bloomin statue in
                         the place for one whiff of fish n
                         chips — for one peek at
                         piccadilly

                                   albrecht
                         each to his taste

               jacks gets up lurching and steadying himself on the table

                                   jacks
                         im going back first boat to
                         england im going back and hear
                         the sound of bow bells
                             gets up and starts to the
                              stairs complaining as he
                              walks
                         im not well im not well
                         somethings wrong with me
                         ——something hurts

                                   st aubyn
                             disdainfully
                         odd way to describe plain
                         drunkenness

               jacks pays no attention to him but goes on up the stairs
               the rest watching the stairs are lit in such a way that the
               upper portion is in complete darkness shadowed by the
               landing above  as jacks disappears into this darkness there

               had been arrested in startled movement the girl thea
               slowly lifts her head to face the people below her as she
               does so the general makes a sudden move forward a move of
               recognition and astonishment —— then restrains himself and
               stand rigidly still

               med shot — thea

               as they reach jacks who is mumbling and trying to get to his
               feet thea starts down the stairs it is then that she sees
               the general who still stands rigid staring up at her as if
               she were an apparition she hesitates a moment a step or two

               toward jacks the general is studying her suddenly she

               faces him full face he looks at her in amazement greatly
               agitated

               close shot  the general looking at thea his face is
               strained and he seems to have suffered from a shock

               med full shot  the general watching thea albrecht coming
               down the stairs looks at him

                                   albrecht

                             coming into the scene

                         get a good sleep you can return
                         to your command in the morning

               the general is about to shake his head in a negative answer
               when he suddenly thinks better of it and still looking at
               thea speaks

                                   general

                         so strange and eerie in a place
                         where we had thought there was only
                         the dead

               as oliver finishes speaking cathy holds out her glass to
               thea who begins to pour wine into it

               thea finishes pouring the wine and puts down the amphora the
               chilled jug has made her hands cold she rubs them together
               then blows on them cathy and oliver watch her both smiling

               full shot  thea the camera pans with her to the foot of the
               stairs here she pauses and from a small marble bench takes
               up a lychnos sets it alight from another that is burning
               there and with this lamp in her hand begins to ascend the
               stairs

               med shot of the stairs tall and lovely with almost
               measured grace thea ascends the stairs to the second floor
               landing then comes up onto the landing and pauses looking
               down the corridor she holds up her lamp

               long shot  camera set up behind thea so that it sees what
               she sees before her in the corridor there are three points
               of illumination one from the skylight two from windows
               these three sources of light cut the blackness of the
               corridor into almost equal sections oblongs of blackness
               alternating with rectangles of grey moonlight around thea
               there is a nimbus of weak and wavering light the
               illumination from her little lamp
               the whole corridor is very still very oppressive thea draws
               in her breath almost as if taking courage and moves toward
               the first patch of blackness at its edge she hesitates and
               steps forward with a little rush of movement for a moment
               she is lost to view then emerges in the first patch of
               moonlight she moves slowly across this then again at the
               very edge of the second section of darkness she pauses
               there is a little sound in the darkness some scuffling of
               papers or blowing curtain she stops stock still begins to
               lift her lamp the lamp flame flickers and then a sudden
               soft draft makes the flame lean far from the wick pulsate
               puff out the loss of the light leaves thea cleft between
               darkness and moonlight again she takes a sharp intake of
               breath again moves on and is lost to view only to emerge
               again in the second section of light she moves normally
               across this patch toward the darkness of a door set into a
               deep embrasure

               med close shot as thea emerges from the darkness and turns
               right her hand already outstretched for the doorknob a dark
               figure obtrudes itself from the deeper blackness of the door
               embrasure a hand reaches out to seize her wrist she gives a
               half stifled scream of fear and looks up into the face of the
               general as it emerges into the light

                                   general
                         you blew out the light  to
                         see better in the darkness

               thea shakes her head perplexed still frightened she looks
               at the lamp in her hand the general reaches out his hand to
               point out the lamp their hands touch he draws his hand back
               quickly

                                   general
                         and your hands are cold —
                         cold as dead hands

               thea is too terrified to speak

                                   general
                             with menacing softness
                         you you know me

               thea shakes her head too torrified to speak

                                   general
                         swear it by your winding shroud
                         do you swear it

               thea shrinks away still unable to utter a sound the general
               realizes that his questioning is futile he releases her
               wrist but still holds her fast with his fixed accusing
               gaze

                                   general
                             slowly
                         maybe you have no memory for the
                         past ——
                             in a whisper
                         vrykolaka

               with the word terror takes her she makes a quick movement
               to flee just as quickly he seizes her dragging her to him
               he has to hold both her hands then pulls her up against his
               chest he repeats the word without any special meaning his
               face across which a narrow beam of light falls obliquely is
               grotesque and horrible the girl struggles and her struggles
               free one hand she pushes herself away from him and quickly
               makes the sign of the cross between herself and the general
               at the same time whispering hurriedly

                                   thea
                         christ be with me ——

               for a bare second there is silence between them and then
               quite suddenly he releases her other hand and begins to roar
               with laughter she stands amazed too wonderstruck even to
               flee almost gaping at him

                                   general
                             through his laughter
                         you thought me a vrykolaka —a
                         vampire  

               he pinches his arm

                                   general
                         look  i am alive

               he begins to laugh again

                                   general
                         and i thought the same of you
                             sobering
                         i am ashamed a grown man 

               the general smiles in ridicule of his own foolishness

                                   general
                         we of the mountain villages
                         are strange people there are
                         too many old dreams in our
                         blood eh

               thea smiles in agreement

                                   general
                         then you can understand 
                         you can forgive me

               again she smiles he starts to move away from her he has
               gone through the black patch of darkness nearest them and has
               emerged into the moonlight on the other side she lifts her
               head and calls to him

                                   thea
                         general ——

               he turns

                                   thea
                         what do they call you what
                         is your name

                                   general
                         nikolas pherides

               he turns and continues down the corridor

               closeup of thea a strange look comes over her face from her
               stare it is evident that the name strikes some sharp chord
               in her mind

                                                       fade out

                                                       fade in

               ext a ruin overlooking the sea  morning  effect shot

               it is a bright morning and between the two portals of a
               ruined temple can be seen the sunlit sea see page 98
               hellas

               in the space between the two portals three people are
               grouped cathy thea and albrecht cathy is seated on one of
               the white stones leaning back against the wall a rug
               wrapped about her knees albrecht stands behind and a little
               in back of her while thea stands leaning gracefully against
               the opposite portal half silhouetted against the brightness
               of the sea

               for a moment they remain quiet then suddenly thea throws up
               her arms in a gesture of ecstasy and speaks almost as if to
               herself

                                   thea
                         the sea the sea

               albrecht stares at her arrested by the words

                                   albrecht
                         what made you say that thea

               the moment is broken thea looks at him selfconsciously and
               then shakes her head

                                   thea
                         i dont know

                         the very words of xenophon and the

                         them thea

               smiling thea shakes her head

                                   albrecht
                         you dont have to its inside of
                         you  all the glory that was
                         greece — the dancing the singing
                         and the white marble 

                                   cathy
                         how clover you are mr albrecht

                             disregarding her
                              pointing to a column
                         this was the temple of hades the
                         god of the dead it contained no
                         images  just empty space and
                         walls of perfect symmetry

                                   cathy
                             looking about her
                         how disappointing i expected it
                         was something more romantic a
                         temple to the goddess of love
                         perhaps

                                   albrecht
                             looking off

                         journey to another world
                             after a little pause
                         but i have my other guests to think
                         of  the general will be wanting
                         to go back to his army if youll
                         excuse me 

               he starts off the two girls watch him go into the grove
               thea seats herself beside cathy

               close two shot  thea and cathy

                                   thea
                         cathy — how does it feel to
                         have a father

                                   cathy
                         what an odd question

                         i mean does one love a father
                         because he is good and kind —or
                         just because he is ones father

                                   cathy
                             out of her depth

                         because i do of course hes nice
                         to me

               cathy leans over toward her

                                   cathy
                         thea  youre hiding something

               cathy looks at her in astonishment

               int the generals room  day

               the general is seated on the edge of his cot still in his
               shirt sleeves he is pulling on his boots oliver has been
               washing at the little wash stand and is drying his face with
               a small towel oliver begins to whistle merrily as he throws
               the towel down the general looks at him

                                   general

                         worlds i have that old dark world
                         of peasant ignorance and
                         superstition in which i was brought
                         up and a new world which the army
                         gave me —— a world of mathematics 
                         gun rangeslogistics tactics
                         strategy

                                   general
                         there is something evil about
                         her

                                   oliver

                             interrupting
                         i know all you are going to say —i
                         have been saying it to myself but
                         the thought will not leave my mind
                         she resembles my wife —there is
                         something about her ——the way she
                         moves —— the way she turns her
                         head 

                                   oliver
                         but that should make you like her

               the general shakes his head

                                   general
                         it makes me fear her

                                   oliver
                             shrugging
                         i cant understand that

                                   general

                                   cathy
                         the general — you dont even
                         know him

               there is a little silence while thea looks toward the ground
               at her feet

                                   cathy
                         come thea if youre going to
                         claim him as your father youve got
                         to make up your mind theyll be
                         leaving any minute

                         for a father and now — i dont
                         know ——

               thea is still hesitant still trying to puzzle it out

                                   cathy
                         do you like what youve seen of
                         him

               thea shakes her head

                                   thea
                         i felt he did not like me

                                   cathy
                         that should decide it or you

                         i will let him go he is dead to me

               int  the generals room  day

               oliver and the general are ready to depart oliver takes a
               last look around the room to see that they have left nothing
               the general stands by the door buckling on his belt

                                   oliver
                         well at any rate i would like
                         to say goodbye to the girl

                                   general
                         we have no time for that

               oliver shrugs

                                   oliver
                         ready

               the general nods and straightens his coat under his belt
               oliver throws open the door and they start out

               int  main room  day

               the camera is set up in the doorway of the bedroom to shoot
               past oliver and the general as they go out a albrecht is
               coming down the stairs  he is hurrying and is very excited

                                   albrecht
                         wait gentlemen wait

               they turn to him

                         i need your advice —— something
                         has happened —— mr  jacks ——

                                   oliver
                         drunk again

                                   albrecht

                         if you wish

               albrecht nods gratefully turns and they follow him as he
               starts up the stairs

               int upstairs corridor  day

               the three men albrecht oliver and the general come to the
               second floor and start down to the last door the camera
               trucks before them

                                   albrecht
                         he was going back to hear the sound
                         of bow bells hell never hear them
                         again

               they stop in front of the door to jacks room albrecht opens
               it through the doorway can be seen a sheeted body on the
               bed the face covered the three men stop in the doorway

                                   oliver
                         he complained of not feeling well
                         i thought he was drunk ——	he
                         staggered

                                   albrecht
                         that staggering his dying so
                         quickly 
                             to general
                         in your campaigns have you never
                         seen men who staggered before they
                         died who talked incoherently ——
                         walked blindly

                                   general
                         ive seen men die drunk — and
                         ive seen men die of the plague

                                   oliver
                             aghast
                         plague theres no possibility
                         of that is there

                                   general
                         the rider on the pale horse is
                         pestilence he follows the wars

                                   albrecht
                         im not sure that it is the plague

                                   general
                         we will know when the next one
                         sickens
                             to oliver
                         until then you and i remain here
                         i will not bring the plague to
                         my troops

                                   albrecht
                         in the meantime it would be
                         useless to alarm the others
                             nodding
                         let them think it was a normal

               guests at two tables they are just finishing dinner oliver

                         im glad you and the general didnt
                         have to leave us we would feel
                         quite deserted

                                   oliver
                             with a look which divides
                              his compliment between
                              cathy and thea
                         how could we go back to the wars
                         with such pleasant company here

                                   cathy
                             smiling
                         thank you

               thea smiles pleased mr st aubyn looks at his daughter
               smiling and gay

                                   st aubyn
                         youre feeling better cathy
                             to albrecht
                         i must admit your island is
                         peaceful enough even i have
                         relaxed
                             smiling
                         in fact i feel quite exhausted

               he lifts his hand to his forehead

                                   miss wollsten
                             concerned
                         perhaps you should rest for a
                         little while mr st aubyn

               st aubyn dismisses the suggestion with a gesture

                                   cathy
                             to oliver
                         pappa is so strong not a bit like
                         me even as a child i was
                         delicate then mamma died everyone
                         thought i should die too

               oliver smiles politely but avoids the invitation to
               flirtation instead he turns to thea

                                   oliver
                         thea youve hardly said a
                         word all through dinner
                             troubledly
                         i feel something strange in
                         the house —— cold

               the general turns to look at thea his eyes sombre and
               questioning

                                   general
                         youre afraid because mr jacks is
                         upstairs

                                   thea
                             shaking her head
                         the dead are dead they can
                         do no harm

               albrecht moves to get up from the table

                                   albrecht
                         miss thea complains of the cold
                         lets go to the fire

               the guests rise and the men stand back as cathy thea and
               miss wollsten go out of scene towards the other end of the
               large room albrecht who has drawn glasses and a wine bottle
               towards him lifts one of the glasses toward st aubyn
               questioningly

                                   albrecht
                         st  aubyn

                                   st aubyn
                             shaking his head
                         an excellent wine no doubt but it
                         has rather a curious brassy taste
                         in my mouth no i really quite
                         tired

               an alert speculative look comes into albrechts face as he
               watches st aubyn move out of scene

               med shot cathy thea and miss wollsten have seated
               themselves around the brazier miss wollsten already at work
               on her interminable embroidery st aubyn passes them going
               to the staircase in bg miss wollsten looks up and watches
               him anxiously cathy also looks up

                                   cathy
                         good night pappa

               st aubyn smiles at her with an effort and starts slowly up
               the stairs

               from the top he stops falters and almost loses his balance
               he clutches at the balustrade to save himself from falling
               for a second he stands there almost doubled over his face
               drawn from a sudden onslaught of pain then he straightens
               himself with an effort and pulls himself slowly up the
               remaining steps at the head of the stairs he goes past
               camera camera pans to show him start down the murky
               corridor staggering as if he were drunk he hesitates then
               turns and lurches to the third door at the left opens it and
               goes in

                         us

                                   albrecht
                         thats impossible i told them
                         jacks died of a sudden heart
                         attack probably brought on by over
                         drinking

                             nodding
                         dr drossos should be here any

               men across the room but miss wollsten is watching them
               covertly as the men start across to the brazier albrecht
               carrying the bottle and glasses she gathers together her
               embroidery and stands up

                                   miss wollsten

               the others call out good night to her as she crosses to the
               stairs and begins to ascend albrecht and the general go to a
               small table where albrecht puts down the bottle and glasses
               oliver joins cathy and thea

               miss wollsten comes up the stairs she hesitates a moment at

               down to the third door she knocks there is no answer she
               opens the door the room is dark she goes in

                         good night oliver

                                   oliver
                         sleep well

               the two girls start up the stairsoliver looking after them
               pityingly

                                   cathy
                             over her shoulder
                         youre not leaving tomorrow

                                   oliver
                         i think not

               thea half turns to look back at oliver a long sweeping look

               thea and cathy continue upstairs and oliver turns back to
               where the other two men arc seated

                                                       dissolve

               int main room  night

               the general and albrecht are still sitting together

               oliver stands near them

                                   general
                         until we know what choice is
                         there we have to stay

                                   oliver
                         but the war the army —— they
                         need you

                                   general
                         better no general than one
                         carrying the plague

                                   oliver
                         we still dont know that its the
                         plague ——

                                   general
                             adamantly
                         dr drossos will tell us we
                         will know what to do then

               oliver gives a little shrug of resignation and walks a few
               steps into the room head down hands in his pockets

               then he turns grinning ruefully 

                                   oliver
                         i wonder if my editors psychic
                         reports from the greek front are
                         going to be a little vague

                                   albrecht
                             chuckling
                         or even spirit messages from
                         the next world

               olivers eyes widen and then he smiles quizzically at
               albrecht

                                   oliver
                             nods thoughtfully
                         i suppose a war correspondent
                         could get the plague
                             cheerfully
                         well id better try for some sleep
                         — while im alive to enjoy it
                         good night gentlemen

               he starts for the stairs the camera dollies with him then
               pans with him as he climbs

               int the corridor  night

               oliver comes up onto the landing and starts down the
               corridor suddenly a shadowy form materializes from the
               darkness and a voice whispers to him

                                   miss wollsten
                         mr davis —

               oliver startled stops and stares

                                   miss wollsten
                         will you help me mr st aubyn
                         is ill — very ill

                                   oliver
                             starting forward
                         his room is down here isnt it

               int girls bedroom  night

               med full shot both girls are in their beds and both seem to
               be asleep

               close shot — cathy she sleeps soundly

               close shot — thea she is wide awake listening to the sound
               of excited footsteps in the hall thea looks toward the door

               insert	the bottom of the door frame and the floor light
               passes the door there is darkness then more light goes past

               med close shot — thea she rises to one elbow and waits for
               a moment watching the closed door then she swings her feet
               to the floor and begins to reach for a wrapper which hangs at
               the foot of the bed she puts it on stands up and starts
               tiptoeing across the room camera panning with her  camera
               halts as thea pauses at the foot of cathys bed she looks at
               the motionless figure of the sleeping cathy then camera
               panning with her again she goes to the door and stands
               there listening

               int the corridor  night

               dolly shot albrecht and the dapper uniformed figure of dr
               drossos come down the corridor the camera dollies before
               them

                                   albrecht
                         if hes not dead hes certainly
                         a sick man

               albrecht and dr drossos turn at st aubyns door and go in

               int st aubyns room  night

               oliver and the general are standing at the foot of st
               aubyns bed miss wollsten stands near the head of the bed
               looking down at the motionless figure of the consul albrecht
               and dr drossos enters dr drossos nods to the general and
               crosses to the bed  while the others wait tensely he feels
               the mans pulse he shakes his head and takes hold of the
               blankets edge to pull it up over the dead mans face

                                   miss wollsten
                             fighting hysteria
                         no no i wont believe it
                         hes not dead

                                   general
                         this is dr drossos chief medical
                         officer of my division

                                   miss wollsten
                         i dont care who he is he
                         doesnt know	he cant tell ——

                                   dr drossos
                             pityingly
                         ill make any test you want
                         look

               dr drossos plucks a feather from the pillow a little curl
               of fluffand holds it before st aubyns masklike face

               insert	the feather at st aubyns face

               it doesnt move

                                                       back to scene

                                   miss wollsten
                             stubbornly
                         hes not dead i tell you hes
                         not dead

               dr drossos sighs he turns and picks up a hand mirror from
               the chest of drawers behind him

                                   dr drossos
                         if there is the finest breath
                         of life it will cloud a mirror

               he takes a handkerchief from his pocket and carefully
               polishes the mirror to clarity then holds it before the dead
               mouth he turns the unclouded mirror so that the others may
               observe it

                                   dr drossos
                         you see

                                   miss wollsten
                             clinging desperately to
                              her delusion
                         the breath can stop the heart can
                         stop —— it still doesnt mean
                         death men have lived 

               dr drossos nods with approval being entirely devoid of
               sentiment his manner is that of a teacher answering the
               argument of a particularly bright student

                                   dr drossos
                         quite right in cataleptic trance
                         a man may live for days with no
                         visible sign of life the breath
                         suspendedthe heartbeat stilled
                             looking down at st
                              aubyn
                         but this man is dead

               dr drossos turns away to replace the mirror on the chest of
               drawers as he does so oliver steps forward and starts to
               pull the blanket over the dead mans face again miss
               wollsten stops it

                                   general
                         what difference does it make
                         covered or uncovered the eyes see
                         no more

               as he speaks the general starts toward the door

               int corridor  night

               close shot on closed door of st aubyns room the door opens
               and the general starts to step into the corridor he is
               suddenly motionless obviously arrested by something he sees
               camera draws aside to disclose thea the girl evidently is
               frozen in the act of trying to slip away she starts to put
               her hand to her throat but as she is not wearing the
               necklace fumbles nervously with the collar of her robe
               then still under the generals relentless stare she goes
               back to her room at this moment oliver comes out of st
               aubyns room he looks down the corridor then worriedly back
               to the general albrecht and dr drossos also come out and
               the four men start toward the stairs

               int st aubyns room  night

               miss wollsten stands looking down at st aubyn then suddenly
               she takes from her bodice a long embroidery needle  still
               gazing intently into his face she jabs the needle deep into
               the dead mans arm there is no reaction in the marble set of
               the corpses face

               miss wollsten pulls the blanket over the dead mans face and
               suddenly bursts out weeping burying her face in her hands

                                                       dissolve

               int main room  day

               morning sunlight pours in through the windows cathy sits
               near the door crying delicately into a lace handkerchief
               thea stands beside her theas expression betrays grief but
               it is the controlled and dignified grief of the peasant who
               knows death as intimately as life and is equally at peace
               with both near them is miss wollsten stonyfaced and
               composed oliver is seated on the table swinging his feet
               the general stands in the open doorway looking toward the
               sea dr drossos and albrecht stand together in the center of
               the group

                                   dr drossos
                         we are faced with a very serious
                         form of plague its first symptoms
                         are dizziness nausea weakness
                         inability to focus the eyes or
                         control the limbs this is followed
                         by acute spasms sometimes
                         blindness and finally in moat
                         cases death

                                   cathy
                             frantically
                         i dont want to hear any more
                         you cant keep me here this
                         horrible island —— it has cost me
                         my father —— it will kill all of
                         us

               the general turns his head and looks at cathy without
               emotion

                                   general
                             implacably
                         i will not have the plague carried
                         to my troops no one leaves here
                         —not you not i not anyone

               oliver goes over to the distraught and weeping cathy putting
               his hand on her shoulder sympathetically

                                   oliver
                         the doctor only wants us to know 
                         the worst for our own good
                         besides he holds out some hope 

               oliver turns to dr drossos who nods slowly

                                   dr drossos
                         if the wind shifts if the sirocco
                         blows  the hot wind from the
                         south  all danger will be over in
                         twentyfour hours

                                   albrecht
                             to drossos gentle
                              mockery
                         good winds and bad winds

               albrecht goes to the table

                                   dr drossos
                             patiently
                         the disease is transmitted by fleas
                         and their bodies are eighty percent
                         moisture the hot wind literally
                         burns them away

               albrecht takes the bronze trident from the figure of poseidon
               and fingers it thoughtfully as he speaks

                                   albrecht
                         the ancient greeks had just as good
                         an explanation  that the gods
                         sent the plague to punish mortals
                         for harboring vrykolaka 

                                   dr drossos
                             impatiently
                         they used to believe that sort of
                         thing in the mountain villages
                         some still do 

               he glances at the general and then at thea

                                   general
                             with serious
                              determination
                         i do not

               albrecht still holding the trident walks over to the open
               doorway where the general stands miss wollsten gets to her
               feet suddenly and faces the men with a look of scorn almost
               of hatred

                                   miss wollsten
                             to drossos
                         if you have nothing more to tell
                         us will you excuse me —

               dr drossos bows and miss wollsten crosses the room to the

                         shes right this is hardly the
                         time to bandy old tales

                         i have lived long enough to doubt
                         everything  which is to say i
                         believe everything a little

               albrecht goes to the table and replaces the trident

                                   dr drossos
                         youre just talking nonsense

                                   albrecht
                         let us put it to the test protect
                         yourself with every scientific
                         precaution you can think of ill
                         go out on the cliff and build a
                         votive fire to hermes  not that i
                         believe in him any more than i do
                         in science

               it is a moonlit night and the cypress trees cast deep shadows
               across the marble flooring of the terrace
               from somewhere on the island possibly played by one of the
               servants comes the sound of a greek bagpipe blatting its
               shrill and mournful music into the still air

               the camera is set up to take in the balcony from one end
               thea oliver and cathy are together cathy is stretched out
               on a settee with a robe over her knees oliver and thea stand
               together near one of the pillars

                                   oliver
                             commiseratingly
                         i know it must be hard but you
                         have relatives in london youve
                         got a whole world of living ahead
                         of you 

                                   cathy
                             on the verge of the tears
                              which are so easy for
                              her
                         no one can take my fathers place

               she gropes around as if looking for something

                                   cathy
                         my handkerchief — i think i must
                         have lost it — perhaps when we
                         were in the grove
                             with a preemptory note
                         thea

               thea bestirs herself out of whatever reverie has held her

                                   thea
                         ill find it

               she starts off toward the right oliver looks at her

                                   oliver
                         you cant go down there alone  

               he takes a few quick long strides and catches up with her
               cathy is left completely alone she looks off at the other
               two and her customary expression of weak helplessness quickly
               changes to one of anger she is so intent that she does not
               notice miss wollsten rise from a chair in the b  g walk
               through the deep shadows cast by the cypress trees and come
               noiselessly to stand beside her miss wollsten has to speak
               to gain her attention

                                   miss wollsten
                         cathy 

               cathy looks around at her inquiringly somewhat startled

                                   miss wollsten
                         i wish i didnt have such bitter
                         knowledge of you cathy

                         thats what you are —— a weak
                         pale halfdead thing that drains
                         all the life and joy from those who
                         want to live

                             haughtily in an attempt
                              to put miss wollsten in

                         crossed — everytime you cant
                         get your own way

               cathy tries to interrupt but miss wollsten goes on
               ruthlessly

                                   miss wollsten
                         your father knew it too but he

               she points over the balustrade toward the cypress grove
               below

                         he told me

               she faces her triumphantly	miss wollsten shrinks and turns
               away cathy stands looking after her smiling then turns and
               walks to the edge of the ruins and looks down into the grove

               ext the cypress grove  night

               only trickles of moonlight come through the pendulous
               branches and thick boles of these dark trees the camera
               tracks to a space between two of the largest trees a space
               which seems filled only with shadow and moonlight but as it
               moves in closer oliver and thea are disclosed embracing
               they break apart she starts to turn from him but he takes
               her hand and turns her so that she faces him

               his hand around her chin so that she looks up at him her
               eyes are wet with tears

                                   oliver
                         youre crying why

                         everythings so simple i like you

               thea smiles at him affectionately but then her face clouds
               again and she looks away from him

                                   oliver
                         whats bothering you thea is it

                         old man and these last few days
                         have been a terrible strain on him
                         he wont harm you

               she makes a pathetic attempt at a smile he puts his arms
               around her protectively and they kiss slowly they break from
               their embrace and together they start up the path

               another aspect of the grove  night

               this is at a point where a narrow flight of marble stairs
               come clown from above 	the camera is on the stairs focused on
               the path	oliver and thea walk in silence their hands
               clasped	they come slowly up the path

               look up

               general pherides stands there erect and silent looking up
               with an expression which is hard to fathom

               three shot nervous and embarrassed thea disengages her hand
               from olivers

                                   oliver
                         you gave us quite a start 
                         standing there

               the general is silent thea moves rapidly toward the stairs
               carefully avoiding physical contact with the general as she
               goes past him he does not turn to look at her but as oliver
               moves to follow her the general puts a restraining hand on
               his arm then without a word he steps down onto the path
               and starts along it toward the shore oliver looks at him in
               puzzlement shrugs and then follows him

               ext grove  night

               the two men walk silently through the grove at the edge of
               the grove on the shoreward side of the island the general and
               oliver come out from beneath the trees and emerge onto the
               beach below the figure of cerberus the general seats himself
               on a block of stone looking out toward the sea oliver

                         wanted to lead them here you are
                         quarantined just because you wanted
                         to pray at your wifes side —— and
                         even her body is gone

               the general looks over

                             musing

                         if she looked like thea she must
                         have been beautiful

               the general takes a deep breath and sighs remembering other
               days

                                   general
                         she was beautiful there was blood
                         between her family and my kin but
                         that did not stop me from taking
                         her when i saw her beauty nor did

                         doesnt explain why you are always

                                   oliver

               come into the ruins

                         her going toward the house

               oliver makes a vague gesture of disappointment and sits down
               beside cathy

               while cathy was speaking the general had turned to look	down
               into the grove he still stands looking down among the trees

                             in a low voice
                         let the doctor guard us against the
                         plague — i shall stand guard
                         against the other things  the
                         things we cannot understand

               in surprise at the general he looks at them and then stalks
               off into the darkness toward the house cathy watches him

               montage of tides  tide running in and out  day and night
               over the sound of grecian reed pipes and a voice singing
               the lament of konos the lament that describes how life
               comes in and goes out with the tides of the sea

               ext ruins  day

               a greek brazier on a tripod stands before the portal facing
               the sea a fire burns in the brazier and albrecht stands
               beside it with a handful of twigs which he is about to put on
               the fire dr drosssos stands watching him

                                   albrecht
                             turning to him
                         i suppose you want to hear my
                         prayer to hermes

                                   dr drossos
                         i just came to see if your prayer
                         would entertain me as much as my
                         medicine seems to amuse you

               albrecht turns his hand and lets the remaining twigs fall
               onto the fire it burns up with a bright flame then a thin
               column of black smoke ascends he lifts his hands upward in
               the grecian attitude of prayer

                                   albrecht
                             teasingly
                         youre too late my friend i have
                         already made my prayers and how
                         about your scientific efforts

               dr drossos steps forward bends to pick up some twigs which
               are beside the brazier and puts them on the fire

                                   dr drossos
                             dryly
                         also too late i owe you a dinner

               as the meaning of this sinks in albrechts bantering manner
               disappears

                                   albrecht
                             concerned 
                         you feel the symptoms

                                   albrecht
                         my friend  what can one say 

                                   dr drossos
                         you can have your servants prepare
                         a dinner that is the way ill meet

                         have fought him before ive won
                         often now he wins let him come

               room during the dinner have been replaced by a great central
               lamp also oilburning the long table is in a pool of
               brilliance tongues of light from the manifold wicks of the
               lamp flicker into the outer dimness of the room as the
               dinner is almost over there remain on the table only bowls
               of fruit and dates wine glasses and the many wine jugs and
               bottles some of them empty at one end of the table sit dr
               drossos as host miss wollsten albrecht and the general at
               the opposite end as if drawn apart by their mutual youth
               are cathy thea and oliver on the stairs sits the man
               servant of albrecht and his bagpipe under his arm
               out of this hairy apparatus he is coaxing folk melodies of
               his native hills the woman servant dressed in gay national
               costume waits on the table

               med shot of dr drossos and group at one end of the table
               dr drossos refills miss wollstens glass and carries the
               bottle to his own glass with an unsteady hand

                                   dr drossos
                             thickly
                         when i was a young man i
                         prescribed moderation in all
                         things especially wine

               dr drossos fills his glass to the brim and then continues
               pouring so that the bright liquid spills over onto the
               table miss wollsten laughs softly and a little drunkenly and
               albrecht takes the bottle out of the doctors hand setting
               it upright again the general smiles and picks up his wine
               glass

                                   general
                         when i was young a man was measured
                         by the skins of wine he could
                         empty

               albrecht looks toward the other end of the table and lifts
               his glass

               with their heads close together in intimate conversation
               cathy and oliver are smiling gaily thea smiles too but
               rather puzzledly as if the conversation eluded her oliver is
               speaking in a very low tone almost whispering plainly the
               wine has had an effect

                                   oliver
                             mockly melodramatic
                         and then   the vrykolaka will get
                         you if you dont watch out

               cathy more animated than we have ever seen her between the
               wine and her growing interest in oliver starts to laugh

                                   cathy
                         oh no — its too delicious
                         youre making it up

                                   oliver
                         on my word thats what they
                         believe

                                   thea
                             smiling but distressed
                         please you shouldnt laugh

                         you see thea believes it too

               cathy turns to thea where olivers teasing is goodtempered
               her mocking laughter has an edge of malice to it

                                   cathy
                         tell me about them thea they have
                         great wings end long teeth

                             embellishing
                         sharp shiny teeth  and they
                         creep up to your bed 

                                   cathy
                         closer and closer — until they
                         bite into your throat

               as she says it cathys fingers dart out and touch theas
               throat thea gives a little muffled cry and throws herself
               back from cathy cathy and oliver both burst out laughing
               leaning close together sharing their childish joke

                                   cathy
                         oh my poor simple thea
                             to oliver
                         did you ever see anything so
                         ludicrous

               thea frightened by the conversation and unhappy because
               oliver and cathy have been making fun of her starts to get
               up from the table

               and thea in the background as thea stands up dr drossos
               leans forward peering down the table towards her

                         thea come here

               the others turn to look at the girl as she obeys the summons

                         look at her warm beautiful 
                         alive drink with me thea —
                         drink to my old enemy who wins at
                         last 

               as thea comes to stand beside him dr drossos picks up
               albrechts wine glass and hands it to her thea obediently
               drinks in silence they watch her drain the glass her head
               going back slowly it is a beautiful a pagan gesture

                             almost to himself
                         there is only one place where the
                         women bewitch one with their
                         beauty

               close shot of thea as she starts singing its a primitive
               sensuous song and theas whole body seems to respond

               med close shot of oliver and cathy watching thea it is
               obvious that oliver is bewitched his eyes follow every move
               the girl makes cathy steals a glance at him

               another angle as thea sings she moves toward oliver in a
               series of slow steps as she comes closer to him she starts
               to smile a slow dreamlike smile that seems to well up from
               some deep inner joy oliver leans forward drawn by the girl
               until as she comes within reach he puts out his hand to take
               her arm her smile quivers into a little laugh at once
               childish and enticing she eludes him at this moment her
               song ends while the	others applaud she crosses to the
               door there she stops abruptly

               closeup of thea looking across the room at oliver her face
               flushed and alive is a frank invitation almost innocent in
               its candid admission of desire then she slowly turns her
               head away

               he gets to his feet cathy puts out her hand to hold him back
               but he doesnt even see it as oliver walks past the table
               unsteadily the general gets to his feet and blocks his way
               oliver pushes him aside impatiently

                                   oliver
                         everythings dead in here dead and
                         empty
                             gesturing toward the
                              door
                         out there the night is alive

               he continues across and goes out through the door

                                   cathy
                             starting for the door
                              harshly
                         someone should go with him hes
                         has had too much to drink

               suddenly miss wollsten laughs cathy whirls around to stare
               at her angrily miss wollsten returns the stare

                                   miss wollsten
                         i think thea is steady enough for
                         both she has not had too much to
                         drink

               the general looks at her with hatred and crosses back to his

               goes upstairs

                             almost incoherently
                         dont go you are leaving me you
                         are all leaving me 

               albrecht instantly concerned gets up and bonds over the
               dying man

                                   albrecht

                              strength
                         i must meet him with laughter 
                         with songs and laughter  to
                         show him i am not afraid 

               with the last words dr drossos catches up his wine glass
               but before he can lift it to his lips he begins to slump in
               his chair the echo of his final challenge dies the general
               steps quickly to his side

                                   albrecht
                         he is dying

               dr drossos doubles up in his chair and falls limply forward
               across the table his hand relaxes and the wine glass falls
               the wine spilling out with the doctors life

                             slowly
                         when she stood beside him i knew
                         i could feel death in the room

               the house it is evident that she is disturbed and agitated
               by something after a moment the sound of theas voice
               singing comes into the still morning air cathy stops
               listening

               closer shot of cathy her face hardening with angry jealousy
               as she listens to theas clear sweet song oliver comes into

               he looks off in the direction of the singing

               olivers smile fades into concern as he comes up to take
               cathys hand in quick sympathy

                                   oliver
                         what is it cathy whats the
                         matter

               med close shot of cathy and oliver the singing continues
               over this entire scene sometimes louder sometimes fainter
               as if thea were strolling about the island

               cathys expression is distraught and she clings to olivers
               hand

                                   cathy

                             with rising hysteria
                         last night dr drossos  today you

                         you i couldnt stand it

               cathy clutching olivers hand tightly leans toward him
               yearningly oliver beginning to find her emotionalism
               awkward and a little distasteful is deliberately matterof
               fact now

                                   oliver
                         theres no reason to decide
                         any of us are going to die

                         and i the others are strangers
                         they mean nothing to me

               struck by this callousness olivers face loses the last
               trace of sympathy for cathy

                         live i have no one in the world 
                         you must stay with me care for me—

               making an effort to control his instinctive aversion to her
               closeness oliver takes hold of her arms and pulls them away
               at the same time stepping back from her he smiles at her
               trying to return their relationship to a normal footing

                                   oliver
                         well talk later when youre
                         yourself again

               cathy still stands motionless and oliver walks away in the
               direction of theas singing which now comes over the scene
               clearly camera remains on cathy as she watches him go her
               face contorts and she starts weeping with rage and
               frustration abruptly she turns and starts off

               the general stands here leaning on his sabre looking toward
               the mainland from which comes the sound of cannonading
               behind him is a camp chair

               in the distance small puffs of smoke can be seen and the
               sound of canon fire comes from afar

               ext the landing outside the tunnel  day

               the general looks up at a little flag on a pole which has
               been erected nearby it blows south rippling and undulating
               in the brisk north wind he turns to look back at the other
               shore cathy comes out of the tunnel the general turns to
               her

                                   cathy
                             looking at the flag
                         the wind has not changed

               he shakes his head cathy sinks down in the camp chair	her
               face still drawn from her emotional upset looks frighteningly
               exhausted

                                   general
                             compassionately

                                   general
                         you look so pale this morning as
                         if all your blood were drained
                         away

               cathy looks at him her ego gratefully absorbing this
               attention and sympathy the general takes a few steps back
               and forth then stops before her

                         how old is she

               the general waits tensely for the answer which means so much
               to him cathy now definitely bored by the trend of the
               conversation replies cattily

                         the sun is so strong here

               the general watches her depart then walks to the edge of the
               landing and starts down towards the beach

                         to die without dying

                         why are you making up these things 
                          why are you wishing evil on me
                             as if answering her own

                         but i didnt know your hatred was
                         so bitter 

               the generals expression softens he shakes his head sadly

                                   general
                         it isnt hatred i couldnt hate

               thea looks at him wonderingly struck by the change in his
               tone

                         to take me with you

               the general draws back from her in horror believing as he
               does that she is a vrykolaka with his left hand he begins to
               reach inside his tunic

                         have done

                         done to the young english girl

               thea turns and runs the general stands looking after her

               ext the lower end of the path leading from the house  day

               oliver comes leisurely down the path to the three or four
               steps which brings it to the floor of the grove he stops
               suddenly as thea runs in very agitated she runs up to him
               and he takes her in his arms

                         cooped up here waiting for death 
                         naturally his mind goes back to the

                         ignorant lad in some mountain

               oliver shakes his head

                                   oliver
                             earnestly

                         abandoned her 

               oliver takes her hand

                                   oliver

                             slowly
                         for a moment when he looked at me
                         so sadly i felt that i had wronged
                         him but then 

               she shudders remembering her last sight of the general

                                   oliver

                         chance is to stay away from him

               oliver puts his arm around her in a protective gesture 

                                   oliver

               thea gives him a faint grateful smile and rests her head
               against his shoulder trustingly

               the narrow ledge in front of the crypts  day

               the general turns onto the ledge and begins walking from the
               crypt comes the sound of someone moving about he stops

               int the crypt  day

               the crypt beside it stands miss wollsten suddenly the body
               of the general blocking the doorway shuts off the light
               falling into the crypt miss wollsten looks up startled

                              attempting to look more
                              normal and a little
                              strange and guilty

                         horror of being buried alive and
                         awakening to find myself shut in —
                         entombed —— imprisoned

                         thats superstition thats
                         something out of old tales  about
                         the dead who live — im talking of
                         something else cataleptic attacks

               he turns and walks away from her miss wollsten looks after
               him with a puzzled expression she makes a half move as if to
               stop him for explanation then thinks better of it and lets
               him go

                                                       fade out

               servant who is setting the table and the man servant who is
               pouring charcoal into the brazier as the charcoal covers the
               live coals that corner of the room grows dim and the camera
               pans to the foot of the stairs

               thea stands in front of the mirror brushing her long hair
               suddenly there is a small movement in the glass alongside
               her reflection she stops brushing poised in midair peers
               into the glass then whirls to look at the window

               the window  night

               a face hardly discernible and unrecognizable is disappearing
               from the glass

               close shot  thea she looks in puzzlement at the window
               then with a little shrug she lays down her brush and begins
               to pile up her hair and put on her headdress she finishes
               bends swiftly to put out the oil light and goes out the door
               the room is plunged into darkness except for the lighted
               doorway of miss wollstens room

               int the corridor	night

               dolly shot the camera moves before thea as she comes down the
               dark hallway the top button of her dress needs fastening and
               she is concentrating on it as she walks behind her a vague
               form seems to be emerging from the darkness at the stair
               landing she pauses

               the top of the stairs  night

               full close shot  thea  as she pauses to finish adjusting
               the button behind her the halfseen dimness of the figure
               that has followed her down the hall emerges fully in the
               person of the general just as he comes into clear
               perception thea finishes fastening the button of her dross
               and starts down the stairs quite oblivious of his
               threatening proximity he stops at the top of the stairs

               int the girls bedroom  night

               the camera is set up in a corner with a wide angle lens
               taking in both the door to the hall and the door to miss
               wollstens room the room is in darkness but miss wollstens
               room glows with a dim light miss wollsten comes into the
               doorway of her room in her hand is one of the little
               lychnoses she hears a knock at the hall doorway she
               hesitates a second then puts out the lamp plunging the room
               in darkness at this instant the door from the hail opens
               admitting light as well as the general the general strikes a
               match and sets flame to the oil lamp which thea left in the
               room when the room is illuminated miss wollsten has
               disappeared and only the black emptiness of her doorway can
               be seen the general holds up the lamp and looks around he
               walks into the room and camera pans with him as he crosses to
               the window

                                   cathys voice
                         general —

               the general turns back towards the hall door startled

               another angle  including both the general and cathy who
               stand in the open doorway to the hall

                                   cathy

               the general walks over to her

                         ill —— or frightened

                         comforting to know that someone
                         cares

               as she speaks cathy goes into the room and sits on the edge
               of her bed

                                   general
                             kindly

                             smiles almost
                              affectionately
                         and i have no children

               the general turns to leave the room then looks back toward
               the other bed

                                   general
                         miss wollsten shares the room with

               cathy gestures toward the darkened doorway of miss wollstens
               room the general looks for a second longer at theas bed and
               then nods as he starts out

                                   cathy
                             smiling
                         ill see you at dinner

               as the general closes the door behind him cathy gets up and
               crosses to the dressing—table

               from behind her out of the darkness of her own room comes
               miss wollsten

                                   miss wollsten
                         ive always known what an evil mind
                         lay behind that pretty weak face of
                         yours —— but this cathy  even i
                         would never have believed it is of

                                   cathy
                             genuinely bewildered

                                   miss wollsten 
                         youve been playing on the
                         superstitions of that poor old man
                         — — working at him — — turning him
                         against thea

                                   cathy
                             angrily
                         really this is idiotic

                                   miss wollsten
                         youd do anything to get oliver
                         away from thea but im going to
                         stop you im going to tell mr
                         davis exactly what you are

               cathys bewilderment has this time given way to rage as the
               ancient antagonism between the two women flares up again

                                   cathy
                         and what makes you think hell
                         believe you when i tell him what
                         you are   what part you played in
                         my fathers life 

               miss wollsten shrinks back from her appalled at the
               interpretation cathys tone gives to her love for st aubyn

                                   cathy
                         when i tell him that youre unfit
                         to live a normal life with normal
                         people — a cataleptic

                                   miss wollsten
                             stricken
                         you wouldnt tell that ——

                                   cathy
                         wouldnt i

               now miss wollstens calm leaves her she almost shrieks at
               the girl

                                   miss wollsten
                         then tell them youre despicable
                         a monster of vanity with heart for
                         no one but yourself tell them
                         everything  but i will tell them
                         too — and youll lose cathy 
                         you understand  youll lose

               she turns from cathy picks up the lamp and goes back to her
               own room cathy looks after her her expression of rage
               fading to an irritated frown then with a shrug she picks
               up the lychnos and walks out of the room to the hall

               int miss wollstens room  night

               the bed is turned down and a white cotton nightgown hangs
               over the footboard miss wollsten picks up a shawl and
               adjusts it with a frenzied movement about her shoulders she
               starts to pick up the lamp then suddenly stops her face
               contorts her lips writhe in strangulated agony and very
               slowly her knees buckle she goes to her knees to all fours
               and then slides from this position to the floor

               int main room  night

               the table  albrecht has a soup tureen before his and is

               the various places cathy coming across the room from the
               staircase goes to her place

                                   albrecht

                         perfect days before the sirocco

               albrecht starts to ladle out another portion looks toward
               the one empty seat and asks

                         her

               cathy turns to oliver waiting hopefully for his answer

                                   oliver
                             politely disinterested

                         depends on what dispatches are
                         waiting for me on the mainland

                                   albrecht

                         in case you do so would you 

               albrechts words are cut by terrible shriek from the upper
               floor for a split second they are sit motionless and then
               they jump up and rush to the staircase

               int the corridor  night

               stairs the men in the lead cross towards the girls room

               wollsten
               over the scene come the sound of a door opening quick
               footsteps and ad lib voices as thea raises her head the
               camera draws back to show the general in the doorway of the
               room with oliver albrecht and cathy behind him as the
               general stares into the room theas hand goes up to her
               necklace she rises quickly as the general comes forward and
               steps aside the general drops to one knee beside miss
               wollstens body

               oliver goes over to thea and albrecht comes to stand beside

                         she is dead

               cathy still standing in the doorway gives a little gasp and
               draws back into her own room

               close shot the general opens the high neck of miss
               wollstens dress and examines the throat and upper bosom

                         there are no marks

               the two men lift miss wollstens body from the floor and
               carry it to the bed

                                   general

                              corpse
                         i promised her

               he looks around the room then goes to the dresser and picks
               up a handmirror

                                   albrechts voice
                         her heart is stopped  there is no
                         breath

                                   generals voice
                         nothing
                             after a pause
                         there is a way to make sure —

               oliver moves into miss wollstens room at the same time
               saying sharply

                                   oliver
                         no we can do without that

                         for tonight it will make them less
                         uncomfortable

                                   general
                             positively
                         no
                             looking toward the door
                         she shall not be left here

                                   albrecht
                         maybe youre right help me get
                         something to carry her downstairs

               the figures of the three men go past the camera their
               footsteps can be heard as they leave the room the sound of
               the door closing as they shut it behind them

               the camera which has remained focused on miss wollstens face
               begins to slowly move in to an extreme closeup here it holds
               a moment and as it holds there is a sudden twitch of muscles
               in the womans cheek

               as the sound of the mens feet scuffling as they bring in a
               heavy burden is heard the camera begins to pull back in
               order to reveal the general albrecht and oliver carrying in
               a heavy packing box of the sort that the archaeologist uses
               to ship statues and pieces of heavy stone carving
               they put the box on the floor line it with a blanket and
               then lift miss wollsten and place her in the box while the
               general and oliver get the lid from the hall albrecht
               notices the white cotton nightgown on the foot of the bed and
               picks it up they put the lid on the box and start to lift
               it

                                                       dissolve

               long shot thea is seated and she watches oliver albrecht
               the general and the man servant as they carry the heavy box
               down the path from the house behind the men and their burden
               walk cathy thea and the woman servant

               the ledge in front of the crypts  day

               the little procession comes up onto the ledge and starts
               walking along it to the nearest crypt the one next to that
               occupied by the remains of dr drossos

               the crypt  day

               the men come in with the box and set it up on two stone
               supports they group themselves around it and stand a moment
               with bowed heads

                                   albrecht
                         rest in peace

               they all file quietly out the camera does not move from the
               position in which it has been set it remains focused on the
               coffin for a long moment then slowly it begins to dolly
               in when it has come very close to the coffin the sound of
               groaning can be heard from within the box then a muffled
               cry movement and the sound of fingernails scraping against
               the boards

               the landing  day

               the general sits in his camp chair looking across at the
               mainland above his head the flag is streaming to the north 
               and a south wind blowing ruffles the generals hair and
               clothing the general pays no attention to the flag oliver
               half running comes out of the tunnel

                                   oliver
                             excitedly
                         general the wind  look the wind
                         has changed to the south

               the general glances up at the flag indifferently and then
               turns again to watch the mainland

                                   oliver
                         its the sirocco  well be able
                         to get away from here  you can
                         take command of your army

               the general shakes his head

                                   general
                         i have had command for the last
                         time —

                                   oliver
                         come — youll feel yourself again
                         as soon as we get off this dismal
                         island

                                   general
                             starting to rise
                         i shall not leave the island ——

               as he gets to his feet he staggers oliver catches him and
               looks at him in horrified alarm slowly the general nods
               answering the unspoken question he has the plague oliver
               takes his arm passes it over his own shoulder and begins to
               help him toward the tunnel

               tnt crypt  day

               the coffin is still sealed but from within comes a muffled
               crying the sound of fists beating on the boards the
               slithering scrape of nails

               int coffin  day

               close shot  miss wollstens face and shoulders she has
               managed to free her arms from the heavy blanket with her
               arms lifted above her head she is frantically pushing against
               the coffin lid as she struggles she screams and her screams
               echo and reverberate in the narrow confines of the coffin

               exhausted by her futile efforts miss wollsten stops
               struggling lies still breathing deeply her heavy breathing
               echoing

               then she tries to turn in the coffin it is too narrow again
               she beats on the lid then she tries to dig her way out with
               her nails the scrape of her nails on the dull and echoing
               wood is the only sound finally even this is too much for
               her fading strength she lies quiet softly moaning

               int corridor  day

               oliver and the general come up the stairs with oliver
               supporting the sick man they start down the corridor just as

               down the corridor she follows them when they turn into the
               generals room she stands waiting in the corridor a moment
               later oliver comes out

                                   oliver
                             as he passes cathy

               and stands beside him the general looks up at her

                                   cathy
                             looking toward the

               the ledge outside the crypt  night

               med long shot— the mouth of the crypt is solid black in the
               night from it comes a low mutter of sound

               int the crypt  night

               the coffin is silhouetted against the lighter darkness of the
               night outside the crypt here the muttering moaning and
               whining of the entombed woman sounds louder

               int the coffin

               miss wollsten is almost exhausted by her struggles her
               single garment is torn from her exertions her face is
               scratched and bleeding she lifts her hands again to tear at
               the wooden ceiling of her prison

               insert	miss wollstens hands the nails are ragged and
               broken blood streams from under them

               close shot — miss wollsten she ceases to struggle lies
               quietly her eyes open there is an expression of awareness
               in her face almost as if she were listening to something
               very faintly but growing in volume reverberated by the
               narrow confines can be heard a rhythmic tapping the sound
               gets louder and louder

               close shot of the crypt wall water is dripping down onto the
               coffin it drops with a certain finite measure like the word
               vrykolaka quickly and rhythmically

               several times miss wollstens lips move as if repeating the
               words then another word begins to come in from underneath
               the phrases of the general at first it is so low in volume
               then it is barely perceptiblethen it grows in volume

                                   generals voice
                         vrykolaka  vrykolaka 

               shot of the crypt wall the water continues to drip onto the
               coffin in the same rhythm as the word

               int the coffin — eight

               close shot — miss wollstens face she is listening to the
               drumming of the water on the coffin the word vrykolaka
               repeated over and over again to the same rhythm grows louder
               and more insistent she breathes rapidly she turns her head
               from side to side then finally her whole body tenses her
               mouth opens and she screams

                                   miss wollsten
                             screaming
                         vrykolaka

               with the word a convulsive movement a frenzy of strength
               takes possession of her she arches her back and forces her
               whole body against the lid of the coffin it begins to
               splinter

               int the main room  night

               albrecht is seated at his work bench he has a small square
               of emery paper in his hand and is meticulously attempting to
               remove the dirt and corrosion of the ages from poseidons

                         our friend poseidon didnt use it
                         for fishing he raked the sea with

                         night

               oliver walks to the stairs

               int the crypt  night

               miss wollsten is emerging from the shattered coffin there is
               a wild and maniacal gleam in her eyes the remnants of the
               white blanket still cling about her shoulders her white
               nightgown is in voluminous tatters about her bony body she
               starts out from the crypt

               int the girls room  night

               an oil lamp is burning on the dresser and a lighted lychnos
               stands on a little table beside cathys bed cathy is in bed
               propped up against the pillows her face is drawn her eyes
               unhappy and almost haunted thea sits on the foot of cathys
               bed watching her anxiously

                                   thea
                         you should sleep cathy lie down
                         and close your eyes try to forget
                         everything

                                   cathy
                             shaking her head
                         when i close my eyes i see miss
                         wollsten i cant think of anything
                         else

                                   thea
                             gently
                         she is dead — at peace

               with a movement so sudden that it startles thea cathy sits
               upright

                                   cathy
                             feverishly
                         suppose she isnt dead
                         suppose it was a cataleptic
                         attack

                                   thea
                         it was the plague

                                   cathy
                             interrupting
                         we quarreled she never dared
                         get angry or frightened  but i
                         said things to her  it was an
                         attack i know it was

               half convinced by cathys certainty thea gets up from the
               bed

                                   thea
                         then let us go to her cathy
                         well make sure — and your
                         mind will be at rest

               cathy shrinks back against the pillows her eyes	widening in
               terror

                                   cathy
                             whispering
                         oh no — i couldnt thea
                         i couldnt go into the crypt  im
                         afraid you know im afraid

               for a moment thea stands looking at cathy in silence then
               with an air of decision she crosses to the dresser she picks
               up a shawl then puts out the oil lamp the room fills with
               shadows and only the dim glow of the lychnos illuminates the
               scene

                                   cathy
                             half fearfully half
                              hopefully
                         what are you going to do

               thea goes to the door and there turns back to face cathy

                                   thea
                         ill be back soon dont
                         worry anymore cathy

               thea goes out quietly closing the door behind her cathy
               stares after her

               int the generals bedroom  night

               a candle burns beside the bed in the bed the genera lies
               restlessly tossing muttering in delirium

               int the girls room night

               the lychnos is burning dimly on a little table beside cathys
               bed she lies awake her eyes wide open watching the shadows
               across the ceiling she hears olivers footsteps listens
               identifies them then resumes looking at the shadows

               ext the convergence of the paths leading to the grove and
               the crypts  night

               thea descends the steps to the two paths and starts to take
               the righthand turn she stops as she sees something ahead of
               her and peers out into the darkness there is a low moaning
               sound it stops she takes two steps forward the moaning
               sounds again thea is frightened she stops a moment and then
               decides to take the lefthand path to the cypress grove and
               the beach she has hardly disappeared from view into the
               darkness of the lefthand path when miss wollsten comes
               along the path from the crypts she wanders in a dazed
               condition and there is madness in her eyes she seems puzzled
               as to which way she should go

               ext the cypress grove  night

               thea walks through the cypress grove under the dark trees
               she is nervous and stops several times even the sudden trill
               of a nightingale causes her to catch her breath in surprise
               and stand stock still until she has identified the sound
               smile at her own nervousness and pass on all the little
               night sounds of the wood are exaggerated and nerve shattering
               to her oversensitive ears finally she reaches the little
               beach at the end of the cliffs and stands here safe the
               space around her a guarantee against surprise

               int the main room  night

               albrecht is nodding over his work bench he almost falls
               asleep but catches himself and takes a draught of beer from
               the glass beside him he then goes on polishing the trident

               ext the steps leading to the landing  night

               thea listening and alert starts to climb the steps a
               sudden break of surf on the shingle of the beach makes her
               tense she goes on up the steps to the landing

               ext the landing  night

               thea comes up the dark tunnel faces her in the center
               through the broken roofing a shaft of moonlight cuts in she
               stands hesitantly before the opening then almost as if
               taking her courage into her hands she begins to walk slowly
               shuffling one foot after the other

               int the tunnel  night

               thea comes through the darkness

               med full shot  the patch of moonlight in the tunnel thea
               comes into the patch of moonlight and breathes a little more
               easily she starts to take a firmer step ahead of her in the
               darkness is a tiny unidentified noise she freezes

               close shot  thea she listens again there is the tiny
               unidentifiable noise someone moving

                                   thea
                             softly
                         who is there

               she waits for an answer the echo of her voice is flung back
               at her who is there —— who is there and dies away on the
               word who —— who

               med full shot  thea in the tunnel ahead of her in the
               darkness is the movement of something white

                                   thea
                         is that you oliver

               the echoes ring around her with her own words they die away

               close shot — thea she peers into the darkness

               int  the tunnel ahead of thea  night

               a dimly seen figure has advanced a few steps thea can see it
               is a woman

               med close shot  thea

                                   thea
                         cathy

               full shot  thea and the dim figure ahead of her from the
               darkness comes a ringing peal of maniacal laughter and a
               shouted name

                                   miss wollsten
                         cathy

               thea turns and runs back toward the landing miss wollstens
               dimly seen figure disappears in the other direction

               the mouth of the tunnel  night

               miss wollsten comes running madly out of the mouth of the
               tunnel she stops peers around suspiciously then goes to
               the door of the house and opens it softly

               int the main room  night

               the fire is low in the brazier at his work bench albrecht
               has tipped his chair back against the wall and is sleeping
               before him on the bench lies the bronze trident its sharp
               burnished points catching the fire light miss wollsten
               creeps in closes the door softly behind her and on tiptoe
               with the cunning of madness crosses the room to albrecht
               she looks at him he continues to sleep stealthily she
               reaches between his limp hands and takes up the trident

               with the trident in her hand she begins to cross the main
               room toward the stairs

               int the generals bedroom  night

               he is fitfully tossing

               ext	the beach  night

               thea still very frightened crouches against the stone which
               supports cerberus she listens and there is no sound and
               finally taking courage she begins to walk through the grove
               of cypress trees to the house

               int the girls room  night

               cathy lies still wide awake her eyes on the shadows on the
               ceiling suddenly the door opens quietly and closes again
               cathy half turns her head

                                   cathy
                         thea

               there is a rush in the darkness a stifled exclamation of
               fear a quick blow with the trident and cathy falls back on
               her pillow dead blood streaming from two puncture marks on
               her throat miss wollsten straightens gazes about her for a
               moment then disappears into the shadows of the room

               int the main room  night

               thea comes in closes the door softly behind her smiles as
               she sees albrecht asleep crosses to him and shakes him
               awake

                                   albrecht
                         oh — sleeping  oliver
                         wouldnt like that
                             he listens
                         well everything seems to be
                         all right

                                   thea
                         goodnight

               she starts across the room and up the stairs albrecht
               realizing his hands are empty begins looking for the
               trident

               int the girls room  night

               it is so still that miss wollstens movements around the wall
               in the darkness can be heard thea opens the door and comes
               in she looks over at cathys bed cathy seems to be asleep
               without bothering to turn up the oil light thea turns back
               the covers of her bed and begins to undress several times
               she pauses to listen as if she had hoard a slight sound then
               continues to take off another piece of clothing until she is
               down to her shift as she begins to pull down the shoulder
               straps of her shift a little louder noise in the darkness
               causes her to stop there is no repetition of the sound
               again she starts to slip down her shoulder straps

               int main room  night

               albrecht is still looking for his trident he finally gives
               up and takes a drink of beer

               int the generals room  night

               the general is tossing wildly he is awake and his eyes are
               glazed with fever he gets up he is dressed in his uniform
               trousers and a shirt he wears neither boots nor tunic he
               begins to stagger toward the door

               int main room  night

               the general comes out of his room supporting himself
               with one hand against the wall  he moves blindly into the
               corridor several times he passes his hand before his eyes as
               if trying to clear his vision but the blindness of the
               plague is upon him

               int corridor  night

               closer shot  he comes up the stairs he finds the door to
               the girls room by touch and opens it he has to support
               himself on the door jamb to prevent collapse he shuffles in

               int the girls room  night

               the general blindly gropes his way in

               close shot — thea she looks over in horror from the bed
               where she is now lying

               med full shot  the general as he gropes his way across to
               cathys bed he kneels down beside it

               close shot — the general and cathy he gropes over her face
               with his hand one hand touches the wound at her throat he
               touches the blood stained hand against the fingers of the
               other hand to test the wetness then gropes again for the
               wound

               close shot — the general and cathy he touches the two
               puncture marks

                                   general
                             muttering
                         vrykolaka

               his hand goes down to feel cathys heart beat there is none
               the general straightens up and from his belt takes the small
               sharp stick of hazelwood he turns and begins blindly
               staggering toward the other bed with outstretched hands his
               unseeing footsteps take him out of the periphery of the light
               into the darkness

               close shot  thea she lies still holding her breath trying
               desperately not to move not to make a sound not to attract
               the generals attention and give direction to his murderous
               footsteps she looks up at the shadows on the ceiling the
               lychnos casts weird moving shadows

               close shot  the general as he gropes his way 

               close shot  thea straining to see into the shadows beyond
               her bed suddenly her face becomes completely terrorized 
               out of the darkness beyond the bed materialises the generals
               hand holding the hazelwood stick as it comes into the
               periphery of the light from to lychnos

               closeup  theas face she can no longer control herself she
               screams

               med full shot  the general comes out of the darkness
               throws himself blindly toward thea

               another angle  silently swiftly miss wollsten comes out of
               the darkness the trident gleaming in her hand she strikes
               down the generals hands fall limp and harmless the hazel
               stick falls to the floor as the general collapses over the
               bed

               int the corridor  night

               oliver rubbing the sleep from his eyes startled by theas
               scream comes out into the corridor

               suddenly he becomes completely alert as from the girls room
               miss wollsten emerges oliver looks at her with shocked
               horror and then rushes towards the girls room

               int the main room  night

               miss wollsten comes rushing down the stairs albrecht looks
               at her in amazement his glass of beer falls to the floor
               she dashes through the door into the darkness

               ext the house  night

               albrecht comes out and peers off into the moonlight
               evidently he sees the direction of miss wollstens flight
               picking up a lantern he runs after her

               int the girls room  night

               med close shot  the general lies on theas bed thea now
               in her robe and oliver bent over him the general opens his
               eyes he seems darned but his lace is calm in contrast to
               his former appearance  he turns his head slightly in theas
               direction

                                   general
                             in a whisper
                         theodosia 

                                   oliver
                             with great sympathy
                         not theodosia theodosias
                         daughter  your daughter

               the general looks from one to the other uncomprehendingly

                                   general
                         daughter  my daughter 

                                   oliver
                         she was born before your wife
                         returned here to die you never
                         knew 

               an expression of full realization comes into the generals
               face he attempts to smile at thea and makes an effort to
               move his hand toward her thea understands the gesture and
               puts her hand over his warmly the touch of her hand induces
               a state of euphoria in the general he looks at thea
               gratefully peacefully

               ext the temple of hades  night

               fog is rising from the sea so that although the temple is
               still clear the cliff ends abruptly in a curtain of grey and
               watery vapor miss wollsten the trident held before her
               comes running into the temple she pauses looks forward into
               the grey wall before her behind her she can hear albrechts
               footsteps she throws down the trident it rings on the
               marble pavement of the temple then almost with composure
               she walks slowly forward and suddenly disappears into the
               grey fog from the fog comes a long descending scream a
               moment later albrecht appears with the lantern and stands
               looking off glancing down albrecht sees the trident
               gleaming in the light he picks it up examines it 

                                   albrecht
                             softly to himself
                         with poseidons trident she paid
                         her way to hades he let her pass
                         through the portals into his dark
                         realm

                                                       dissolve

               ext the flag at the landing  day

               the wind blows free from the south

               ext the beach  day

               it is early morning and the cliffs cast long shadows over the
               rippling catspaws on the water a small boat is drawn up on
               the beach albrechts man servant stands in the stern
               leaning on a sculling oar that he presses against the bottom
               to hold the boat steady thea with her bundle of possessions
               beside her sits on the thwart oliver stands on the beach
               holding the bow and talking to albrecht

                                   oliver
                             pressing albrechts hand
                         goodbye

                                   albrecht
                         may life be good to you both as
                         for the others —— they will be
                         quiet here —— and i will be with
                         them

               albrecht smiles at thea and oliver oliver steps into the
               bow the servant shoves the boat off from the beach

                                                       fade outthe end
