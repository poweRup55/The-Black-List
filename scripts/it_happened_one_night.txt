                                   based on a story by

               the harbor at miami beach fades in providing quick views of 
               yachts aquaplanes and luxurious shipcraft lying at anchor 
               in the calm tranquil waters of tropical florida this 
               dissolves to the name plate on the side of a yacht reading 
               elspeth ii and this in turn to a yacht corridor where a 
               steward is standing in front of a cabin door near a small 
               collapsible table upon which there is a tray of steaming 
               food he lifts lids and examines the contents a heavyset 
               sailor stands guard near the cabin door

                                     steward
                         fine fine she ought to like this
                              to the guard
                         open the door

                                     guard
                              without moving
                         whos gonna take it in to her you

                                     steward
                         oh no
                              turning
                         mullison come on

               the view widens to include mullison a waiter his eye is 
               decorated with a shiner

                                     mullison
                         not me sir she threw a ketchup 
                         bottle at me this morning

                                     steward
                         well orders are orders somebodys 
                         gotta take it in
                              he turns to someone 
                              else
                         fredericks

               the view moves to another waiter who has a patch of bandage 
               on his face

                                     fredericks
                         before i bring her another meal 
                         ill be put off the ship first

                                     stewards voice
                         henri

               the view moves over to a frenchman

                                     henri
                              vehemently
                         no monsieur when i leave the ritz 
                         you do not say i have to wait on 
                         crazy womans

               the view moves back to include the steward and the others 
               grouped around him

                                     another waiter a cockney
                         my wife was an angel compared to 
                         this one sir and i walked out on 
                         her

                                     guard
                              impatiently
                         come on make up your mind

               a petty officer approaches he is blustering and officious 
               but the type that is feeble and ineffective his name is 
               lacey

                                     lacey
                              talking quickly  
                              staccato
                         whats up whats up

               there is a fairly close picture of the group featuring lacey 
               and the steward

                                     steward
                         these pigs theyre afraid to take 
                         her food in

                                     lacey
                         thats ridiculous afraid of a mere 
                         girl
                              he wheels on the 
                              steward
                         why didnt you do it yourself

                                     steward
                              more afraid than the 
                              others  stammering
                         why  i  well i never thought 
                         about 

                                     lacey
                              shoving him aside
                         i never heard of such a thing afraid 
                         of a mere girl
                              moving to the tray
                         ill take it in myself

               they all stand around and watch him much relieved he picks 
               up the tray and starts toward the door of the cabin

                                     lacey
                              as he walks  
                              muttering
                         cant get a thing done unless you do 
                         it yourself
                              as he approaches the 
                              door
                         open the door

               we see him at the cabin door as the guard quickly and gingerly 
               unlocks it

                                     lacey
                         afraid of a mere girl ridiculous

               lacey stalks in bravely the tray held majestically in front 
               of him while the steward and waiters form a circle around 
               the door waiting expectantly there is a short pause 
               following which lacey comes hurling out backwards and lands 
               on his back the tray of food scattering all over him the 
               steward quickly bangs the door shut and turns the key as the 
               waiters stare silently

               the scene dissolves to the main deck of the yacht first 
               affording a close view of a pair of wellshod masculine feet 
               as they pace agitatedly back and forth then as the scene 
               draws back the possessor of the pacing feet is discovered 
               to be alexander andrews immaculately groomed in yachting 
               clothes in front of him stands a uniformed captain but 
               andrews brows wrinkled deep in thought continues his 
               pacing

                                     andrews
                              murmuring to himself
                         on a hunger strike huh
                              a grunt
                         whend she eat last

                                     captain
                         she hasnt had a thing yesterday  
                         or today

                                     andrews
                         been sending her meals in regularly

                                     captain
                         yessir she refuses them all

                                     andrews
                              snappily
                         why didnt you jam it down her throat

                                     captain
                         its not quite that simple
                              he shakes his head
                         ive dealt with prisoners in my time 
                         but this one 

                                     andrews
                         absurd
                              muttering
                         all this fuss over a snip of a girl
                              suddenly
                         im going down to see her myself

               he leaves with determination followed by the captain and 
               both are then seen walking in the direction of the cabin 
               andrews grim

                                     captain
                         this is dangerous business mr 
                         andrews after all kidnapping is no 
                         childs play

               but andrews ignores him and merely stares grimly forward 
               they arrive in front of the cabin door where lacey is 
               brushing himself off and where a couple of waiters are 
               picking up the last pieces of the broken dishes

                                     andrews
                         whats this whats happened here

                                     lacey
                              pathetically
                         she refused another meal sir

                                     andrews
                         get another tray ready bring it 
                         here at once
                              to the guard
                         open the door

               the guard unlocks the door and andrews enters then we get a 
               view of the cabin at the door as andrews enters and closes 
               the door behind him he looks around and his eyes light on 
               his prisoner following which the view swings over to ellie 
               a beautiful girl in her early twenties at the moment she 
               holds a small vase over her head ready to heave it and her 
               eyes flash angrily at sight of her new visitor however 
               she lowers the vase and sets it on a small table

                                     ellie
                         what do you want

               andrews doesnt stir from the door

                                     andrews
                         whats this about not eating

                         want definitely thats to see you

               she lights a cigarette andrews watches her a moment

                                     andrews

                         this boat

               she stares petulantly out at the blue sky but andrews comes 
               over and sits beside her

                                     andrews

                         married to him

                                     andrews

                         not
                              they are interrupted 
                              by a knock at the 
                              door
                         yes

               the door opens and several waiters parade in with trays of 
               steaming food

                                     ellie
                              starting for them 
                              threateningly
                         how many times have i told you not 
                         to bring any food in here

               the waiters back up frightened but andrews saves them

                                     andrews
                         wait a minute dont get excited 
                         this isnt for you
                              to the waiters
                         put it right here

               ellie glares at her father and wanders over to the window 
               seat while the waiters occupy themselves setting the table 
               andrews putters around the food lifting the lids from which 
               tempting aromas emanate he shuts his eyes murmuring oohs 
               and ahs

               a closeup of ellie shows her too drinking in the inviting 
               aromas and for a moment she weakens a close view of andrews 
               shows him glancing toward ellie to see her reaction whereupon 
               ellies face again appearing in a closeup freezes then 
               andrews and the waiters come into view

                                     first waiter
                         anything else monsieur

                                     andrews
                         no everything seems quite 
                         satisfactory i may want some more 
                         of that delicious gravy ill ring

                                     waiter
                         very good monsieur

               the waiters bow their way out as andrews pecks at the food

                                     andrews
                              making clucking noise
                         heavenly

               now ellie appears in the foreground with andrews at the 
               table in the background

                                     ellie
                              disdainfully
                         smart arent you so subtle

                                     andrews
                              chewing on a mouthful 
                              of food
                         if gandhi had a chef like paul it 
                         would change the whole political 
                         situation in india

                                     ellie
                         you cant tempt me
                              shouting unnecessarily
                         do you hear i wont eat

                                     andrews
                              quietly
                         please i cant fight on an empty 
                         stomach remember what napoleon said

                                     ellie
                         i hope youre not comparing yourself 
                         to napoleon he was a strategist 
                         your idea of strategy is to use a 
                         lead pipe

               andrews eats silently while ellie rants at him walking around 
               and puffing vigorously on her cigarette

                                     ellie
                              muttering
                         most humiliating thing ever happened 
                         to me
                              shuddering
                         a bunch of gorillas shoving me in a 
                         car that crowd outside the justice 
                         of the peace  must have thought i 
                         was a criminal  or something

               a close view of andrews intercuts with part of ellies speech 
               at the end of her speech he smacks his lips enjoying the 
               food with too great a relish then the two are seen together

                                     ellie
                              after a pause  
                              strongly
                         where are you taking me

                                     andrews
                              carelessly
                         south america

                                     ellie

                                     andrews

                              speaks between

                         divine

                                     ellie

                         aviation it takes courage to do

                         i hate business men  particularly 
                         if youre a shining example

               he grins not at all offended knowing she doesnt mean it

                                     ellie
                         your whole life is devoted to just 
                         one thing to accumulate more money

                         hes doing

                                     andrews

                         it you married him only because i 
                         told you not to

                                     ellie
                              strongly
                         youve been telling me what not to 
                         do since i was old enough to remember
                              screaming
                         im sick of it

               and as andrews ignores her she starts moving around the 
               table toward him  next she appears sitting on the edge of 
               andrews chair and she throws her arm around his shoulder

                                     ellie
                              pleading sweetly

                         off the boat keeping me prisoner 
                         like this is so silly

               andrews has been listening silently throughout the speech 
               giving no indication of his feelings in the matter

                                     andrews
                              unimpressed
                         youll be set free when the marriage 
                         is annulled

               a closeup of ellie her eyes blazing angrily shows her 
               slowly edging away from her father while he continues

                                     andrews voice
                              carelessly
                         so theres no use being a stubborn 
                         idiot

                                     ellie
                              hissing
                         i come from a long line of stubborn 
                         idiots

                                     andrews
                              again seen with her 
                              calmly
                         a time will come when youll thank 
                         me for this

                                     ellie
                              wildly
                         i wont thank you ill never thank 
                         you

                                     andrews
                         please dont shout

                                     ellie

                         ill scream if i want to

                                     andrews
                              reaching for it
                         ah coconut layer cake nice and 
                         gooey too just the way i like it

               he is about to insert the first bite in his mouth when ellie 
               her temper vanishing completely overturns the small serving 
               table dumping its contents into her fathers lap the 
               movement is so unexpected that andrews the fork still 
               suspended near his mouth stares at her stupefied then 
               realizing what she has done his eyes flash in anger dropping 
               his fork he rises and goes over to her while she stands 
               facing him defiantly without a word or warning he slaps 
               her a stinging blow across the cheek for a moment she doesnt 
               stir her eyes widening in surprise and staring at him 
               unbelievingly then turning abruptly she bolts out of the 
               door andrews remains motionless his eyes shutting painfully 
               it is the first time he has struck her and it hurts

                                     andrews
                              calling
                         ellie
                              and he starts for 
                              the door

               next on the deck at the open cabin door andrews is seen 
               staring off at something and an amazed frightened look comes 
               into his eyes then as viewed from his position at the cabin 
               door ellie appears standing on the rail and with a 
               professional dive she leaps into the water a full view of 
               the deck reveals the crew and the officers scurrying around 
               several of them shouting somebody overboard

                                     andrews
                         its my daughter go after her

                                     captain
                              shouting
                         lower the boats

               general excitement reigns several of the crew dive into the 
               water others release the boat lines following this ellie 
               is seen swimming furiously against the giant waves next she 
               appears as a small speck in the distance while half a dozen 
               of the crew are swimming in pursuit

               at the side of the yacht one of the boats has already been 
               lowered and two men jump in and grab the oars the men seem 
               to be gaining on ellie in the distance several small motor 
               boats are anchored and over the sides of the boats their 
               owners are fishing ellie seems to be headed in their 
               direction

               one of the motor boats appears closer a middleaged man 
               sits on the stern holding lazily to his line his feet 
               dangling in the water as the boat is tossed around by the 
               turbulent waves ellie is then again seen swimming she looks 
               back and the next scene shows the men rowing toward her 
               and gaining on her thereupon we see ellie ducking under the 
               water

               the middleaged fisherman is suddenly startled by ellies 
               face which appears from under water right between his legs 
               ellie puts her finger up to her lips warning him to shush 
               and he is too dumbfounded to say anything as the pursuing 
               boats come near ellie ducks under the water again and the 
               boats scoot right by the fisherman then ellies head bobs 
               up she peers ahead of her and seeing that her pursuers 
               have passed her she smiles victoriously

                                     ellie
                              to the fisherman
                         thanks
                              and she starts 
                              swimming toward shore

               the scene dissolves to the deck of the yacht as ellies 
               pursuers clamber aboard andrews waiting for them

                                     a man

               the view draws in to afford a closeup of andrews staring 
               out at the sea his face wreathed in a broad smile then 
               this fades out 

               the railroad station of an active terminal in miami fades 
               in the view moves down to the entrance gate to the trains 
               passengers hurrying through it then picks out two men 
               obviously detectives who have their eyes peeled on everyone 
               passing through then the view affords a glimpse of ellie 
               who stands watching the detectives this scene wiping off 
               we see an air transport with several planes tuning up in 
               the background as passengers file through several detectives 
               stand around in a watchful pose this scene wiping off the 
               front of a western union office comes into view several 
               people walk in and out at the side of the door two 
               detectives are on the lookout

               this scene also wipes off revealing the waiting room of a 
               bus station over the ticket window there is a sign reading 
               buy bus tickets here and a line forms in front of it 
               here too there are two detectives

                                     first detective

                         i told the old man it was the bunk

               the view moves from them to ellie who stands behind a post 
               and is watching the two detectives apprehensively as the 
               two viewed from her position stand by the ticket window 
               one of them turns toward her thereupon we see her slipping 
               behind a post concealing herself just then a little old 
               lady approaches her

                                     old lady

               she picks up a small overnight bag from the floor and hurries 
               away she crosses to the entrance of the waiting room and 
               disappears through the doors the view then wings over to a 
               telephone booth near the entrance clustered around the booth 
               are half a dozen men of varied appearance the inside of the 
               booth is lighted and a young man peter warne waves his 
               hands wildly as he shouts into the phone although it is 
               impossible to hear what he is saying a close inspection of 
               the men surrounding the booth the scene contracting to a 
               close view reveals them as being slightly and happily 
               intoxicated a short man approaches the door of the booth

                                     shorty

               a close view of peter warne in the telephone booth gives 
               evidence of his having also imbibed freely

                                     peter
                              shouting into the

               night editor gordon his sleeves rolled up sits at his 
               desk shrieking into the phone

                                     gordon

                         funny map of yours
                              he bangs down the 
                              receiver viciously 
                              and glowers at the 
                              phone

               in the phone booth peter reacts to the phone being hung up 
               on him but he goes right on for the benefit of the boys

                                     peter
                              into the dead phone

                         your hands and knees i hope this is 
                         a lesson to you

               he snaps up the receiver with a great pretense of outraged 
               pride following which the view expands to include his public

                                     men
                         attaboy peter thats telling him 
                         peter

               the gang is full of admiration for the courageous way he 
               talked to the boss as peter staggers out of the booth

                                     peter
                         give me any of his lip will he

                         think of his job

                         make way for the king long live the 
                         king make way

               with head held high he struts majestically out of sight 
               followed by his admirers following which the scene dissolves 
               to the bus station his inebriated admirers stand around the 
               entrance to a bus while peter stands on the steps his 
               suitcase in his hand

                                     peter
                              making a grand speech

                              turns his back and 
                              enters the bus

                         scram

               the scene cuts to the interior of the bus as viewed from the 
               front the view moving forward passing the conglomerate of 
               unprepossessing human beings who occupy the seats every 
               space is taken and the occupants seem hot and uncomfortable 
               which adds to their uninviting appearance mothers cling to 
               crying babies a swedish farm hand and his young wife are 
               already busy opening their basket of food prepared for the 
               long journey a surlylooking hoodlum traveling alone is 
               slumped in his seat his cap drawn carelessly over his eyes 
               the moving view passes these and other characters until it 
               reaches one unoccupied seat in the car unoccupied except 
               for several bundles of newspapers

               standing before the seat is peter his suitcase in his hand 
               speculating as to what disposition to make of the newspapers

                                     peter
                              calling
                         hey driver how about clearing this 
                         stuff away

               several passengers seen from his position in the back crane 
               their necks to scrutinize the intruder through a glass 
               partition the driver can be seen receiving his last minute 
               instructions from a superintendent who stands on the running 
               board their voices indistinguishable

               in answer to peters request the driver glances back 
               indifferently and continues talking to the superintendent 
               a close view of peter shows him arching his eyebrows an 
               amused acknowledgment of the disdainful attitude of the 
               driver he drops his suitcase and starts forward then we 
               see him arriving at the glass partition and peter taps 
               playfully on the pane with his fingernails whereupon the 
               driver turns and pulls the window down a few inches

                                     driver
                              annoyed
                         whadda you want

                                     peter
                              pleasantly
                         if youll be good enough to remove 
                         those newspapers ill have a seat

                                     driver
                              irritably
                         okay okay keep your shirt on young 
                         feller
                              with which remark 
                              the driver turns 
                              away from him

                                     peter
                              looking at the back 
                              of the drivers neck 
                              for a moment then 
                              confidentially
                         just between you and me i never 
                         intended taking it off

               he wheels around uncertainly and swaggers jauntily down the 
               aisle toward the empty seat en route he bestows genial smiles 
               upon several of his disgruntled fellow passengers and he 
               stops in front of a robust lady who at the moment is 
               breastfeeding her baby while a lighted cigarette dangles 
               from her lips

                                     peter
                         personally i was raised on a bottle
                              as the woman looks 
                              up at him perplexed
                         when i was a baby i insisted on it 
                         you know why
                              as the woman stares 
                              up stupidly
                         i never liked the idea of getting 
                         cigarette ashes in my eyes

               he moves forward leaving the woman unable to make head or 
               tail of it and assuming that hes crazy she shrugs her 
               shoulders and turns her attention to the baby

               now peter arrives at his seat and whistling softly raises 
               the window unhurriedly he picks the newspaper bundles up 
               one by one and flings them out of the window they hit the 
               sidewalk below with a dull thud thereupon a close view of 
               the driver shows him reacting violently to peters 
               unprecedented cheek and starting down from his seat

               peter has now cleared the seat of all the newspaper bundles 
               and still whistling his favorite melody he picks up his 
               suitcase preparatory to placing it in the rack overhead at 
               this point the driver enters the side door of the bus

                                     driver
                              pugnaciously
                         hey wait a minute

               peter his arms holding the suitcase over his head turns 
               and glances at the driver a quizzical look in his eyes

                                     driver
                              coming forward
                         what do you think youre doing

                                     peter
                              turning
                         huh

                                     driver

                         oh  the papers 

               he slowly lowers his arms and deposits the suitcase on the 
               floor

                                     peter
                              now seen close with 
                              the driver

                         all over town and read the news from 
                         the seat of my pants

                                     driver

                              turning to his 
                              suitcase

                         good sock on the nose

                              turning back to him

                         do it make sure you dont miss

               during his speech ellie enters from the rear and plunks 
               herself into peters seat unseen by peter she places her 
               small bag beside her

                                     driver
                              answering peter 
                              weakly
                         oh yeah

                                     peter

                                     peter
                              exhausted
                         you win

               smiling he turns to sit down but the smile dies on his 
               face when he finds his place occupied by ellie who stares 
               out the window

                                     peter
                              now at close range 
                              with ellie
                         excuse me lady 
                              slowly
                          but that upon which you sit  is 
                         mine

               ellie glances up at him  then down at her buttocks

                                     ellie
                              eyes flashing

                                     ellie
                              ignoring him  
                              calling
                         driver

               the driver who has stopped to witness this new altercation 
               returns

                              pleased to discomfort 
                              peter

                              peter thwarted for 
                              a moment just glares 
                              at her

                                     peter
                              also calling
                         driver

                                     driver
                         yeah

                                     peter
                         these seats accommodate two 
                         passengers dont they

                                     driver
                              hating to give in
                         maybe they do  and maybe they dont

               peter lifts ellies overnight bag off the seat and drops it 
               on the floor part of her coat covers the small space by her 
               side this he sweeps across her lap

                                     peter
                         move over lady this is a maybe 
                         they do

               he plops into the seat the other passengers around them 
               heaving a sigh of relief ellie flashes him a devastating 
               look and deliberately turns her back on him but peter 
               suddenly looks down toward the floor following which a close
               up at their feet reveals that ellies bag on the floor annoys 
               peter with his foot he slowly moves it over to her and 
               ellies foot is seen pushing it back whereupon peter 
               viciously kicks it over to her side again next we see ellie 
               glaring at him picking up her bag and standing on the seat 
               depositing it on the rack overhead but just then the bus 
               starts forward with a lurch which unbalances her and she 
               falls backward right in peters lap their noses almost touch 
               their eyes meet and they glare at each other hostilely 
               ellie quickly scrambles off and gets back in her seat turning 
               her back on him

                                     peter
                              amused
                         next time you drop in bring your 
                         folks

               this dissolves to a country road and the bus sways perilously 
               as it speeds through the night following which the view 
               dissolves to the interior of the bus revealing peter slumped 
               in his seat his hat drawn over his eyes ellie has her head 
               thrown back trying to sleep but the swaying bus causes her 
               head to roll from side to side uncomfortably and finally 
               she gives up

                                     ellie
                              an order
                         tell that man not to drive so fast
                              at which peter just 
                              cocks his head 
                              slightly

                                     peter
                         are you talking to me

                                     ellie
                         yes tell that man to drive slowly

               peter stares at her a moment resenting her officious manner

                                     peter
                              pleasantly
                         okay

               and much to her surprise he sighs deeply and relaxes to his 
               former position shutting his eyes she glares at him 
               crushingly

               the scene dissolves to another view of the bus disclosing 
               the driver and suddenly the bus comes to a stop

                                     driver
                              sticking his head in 
                              to face the passengers
                         rest station ten minutes

               the view draws back as some of the passengers rise the men 
               stretch their legs and the women straighten out their skirts 
               a close view of peter and ellie then shows her rising peter 
               accommodatingly shoves his feet aside for her to pass and 
               ellie starts up the aisle but she suddenly stops looks 
               back first at her bag and then at peter decides to take 
               her bag with her and returns to take it she reaches for it 
               on the rack peter watching her amused

               the scene dissolves to the outside of the rest station with 
               several passengers walking briskly back and forth the place 
               is dimly lit by one or two lampposts and peter can be seen 
               leaning against one of these posts smoking a cigarette the 
               scene moving in a close view of peter shows him stealing a 
               glance in the direction of ellie and a view from his angle 
               reveals ellie in the shadow of the bus her bag at her feet 
               she slowly turns her head toward peter and then quickly averts 
               it

               peter seen close speculates about her he glances around 
               the place and the scene moves about following his gaze it 
               takes in the other passengers all obviously poor and 
               uncultured the moving view reaches ellie the contrast is 
               perceptible thereupon we see peter reacting with 
               comprehension no doubt about it she doesnt belong with 
               these passengers then suddenly he sees something which 
               startles him and we see what it is directly in back of 
               her the young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts her overnight 
               bag from the ground and starts running with it ellie is 
               oblivious of his actions peter springs forward

               ellie sees peter coming toward her and is perceptibly 
               startled but peter whizzes by her and this amazes her even 
               more she shrugs her shoulders perplexed and resumes her 
               smoking in a few seconds peter returns puffing breathlessly

                                     peter
                         he got away i suddenly found myself 
                         in the middle of the brush and not a 
                         sign of the skunk

               ellie seen close with peter doesnt know what hes talking 
               about she looks at him puzzled

                                     ellie
                         i dont know what youre raving about 
                         young man and furthermore im not 
                         interested

                                     peter
                              taken aback
                         well  of all the  well 
                              hard
                         maybe youll be interested to know 
                         your bags gone

               at this ellie wheels around and stares at the spot where 
               her bag had been

                                     ellie
                         oh my heavens its gone

                                     peter

                         eventually

                                     ellie

                                     ellie
                              opening her purse

                         responsible for everything that 

                                     ellie

                         i dont want it reported
                              she starts away

                         want to be left alone
                              with which she 
                              disappears from the 
                              scene

               a closeup of peter shows him glaring after her

                                     peter
                              mumbling
                         why you ungrateful brat

               the scene dissolves to the bus where all the passengers are 
               scattering back to their seats peter is already seated 
               when ellie arrives a close view then shows her standing 
               uncertainly for a moment speculating whether to cross over 
               his legs to get her place by the window peter feels her 
               presence by his side and glances up she tosses her head and 
               plants herself in the seat in front of him vacated by the 
               young man who stole her bag peter takes the affront with a 
               shrug and slides over gratefully to the coveted spot near 
               the window

               the scene dissolves to a close view of ellie and a recently 
               arrived fat man next to her she has her head thrown back in 
               an effort to sleep but the fat man his hands clasped over 
               his protruding stomach snores disgustingly and the rumble 
               of the flying bus accompanies him suddenly the bus careens 
               the fat man falls against ellie and she awakens with a start 
               and pushes him back the fat mans snoring goes on 
               uninterrupted and ellie relaxes again but in a few seconds 
               the procedure is repeated and ellie is beside herself she 
               looks around for somewhere to flee

               peter seated in back of her in his customary slumped 
               position opens his eyes slightly it is apparent he has 
               been watching her for some time for he grins at her 
               discomfiture ellies head turns in his direction and the 
               grin leaves peters face he shuts his eyes and pretends to 
               be asleep ellie glances at peter to make certain he is 
               asleep the fat man falls against her again and it is all 
               she can stand she starts to rise peter sees her coming and 
               deliberately puts his hand on the seat next to him still 
               pretending to be asleep just as ellie starts to sit she 
               notices his hand and is embarrassed gingerly she picks up 
               his limp hand and places it on his knee she then slides 
               into the seat sighing with relief whereupon peter opens 
               his eyes and is amused slowly his head turns  and he 
               scrutinizes her soberly and appraisingly ellie slowly turns 
               her head for a glimpse of peter  and is startled to find 
               him gazing at her she turns forward her jaw set 
               forbiddingly

               the scene dissolves to the view of a road it is dawn and 
               in the distance against the horizon the bus a mere speck 
               makes its lone way over the deserted country this dissolves 
               to a large sign reading jacksonville and then into the 
               bus affording a close view of ellie and peter they are both 
               asleep her head resting comfortably on his shoulder peters 
               topcoat thrown over her then the view draws back the bus 
               is empty except for ellie and peter the last few passengers 
               are just leaving

               peters eyes slowly open he looks down at the head on his 
               shoulder and grins with a sigh he shuts his eyes again and 
               resumes his slumber next at the front of the bus the driver 
               stands staring at peter and ellie in this intimate position 
               and his mouth twists knowingly

                                     driver
                              murmuring
                         oh yeah

               ellie stirs squirms a little uncomfortably and with a sleepy 
               grunt shifts her position just as she settles down her 
               eyes open she stares out of the window with unseeing eyes 
               and then closes them dreamily giving the impression that 
               still half conscious she is trying to recall where she is 
               apparently she does for her eyes suddenly snap open and she 
               lifts her head finally in a scene including peter ellie 
               realizes that she has been sleeping on his shoulder whereupon 
               she straightens up embarrassed

                                     ellie
                         oh im sorry 
                              feebly smiling
                         silly isnt it

               she looks around and her finding herself alone with peter 
               adds to her embarrassment

                                     ellie
                         everybodys gone

               she lifts her arms to adjust her hat and becomes conscious 
               of his coat over her which slips she stares at it 
               thoughtfully for a moment  then at peter

                                     ellie
                              realizing that he 
                              put it there
                         oh thank you
                              she hands him his 
                              coat ill at ease
                         were in jacksonville arent we

                                     peter
                         yes

                                     ellie
                              nervously
                         that was foolish of me why didnt 
                         you shove me away

                                     peter
                         i hated to wake you up
                              she glances at him 
                              speculatively
                         how about some breakfast

                                     ellie
                         no thank you
                              she rises anxious 
                              to get away
                         thank you so much

               most uncomfortably she edges away from him toward the front 
               of the bus peter watching her leave his interest definitely 
               provoked

               the scene cuts to the stand as ellie emerges from the bus 
               at the foot of the steps is the driver

                                     ellie
                         how much time have i

                                     driver
                         about a half hour

                                     ellie
                         im going over to the windsor hotel

               peter appears in the door of the bus in the background and 
               a close view then shows him stopping to listen as he sees 
               ellie talking to the driver

                                     drivers voice

                                     drivers voice
                              aghast
                         wait for you

               a smile flits across peters face then a wider view shows 
               ellie leaving the driver

                                     ellie
                              as she goes
                         yes i may be a few minutes late

               she disappears from sight leaving the driver staring at 
               her dumbly and peter standing in back of the driver shakes 
               his head in amazement

               the scene dissolves to the bus stand later that morning  
               at the same spot where the bus had previously been it is no 
               longer there however a huge crowd fills the space and the 
               view moving down through the crowd singles ellie out she 
               has just arrived and looks around helplessly finally she 
               spots a uniformed terminal guard and approaches him

                                     ellie
                              now next to the guard

                                     ellie

                              and he turns his 
                              back on her

               ellies face clouds the crowds surge about her she looks 
               around thoughtfully suddenly her eyes open in surprise at 
               something she sees and the view then moves over to peter 
               who sits on his suitcase looking toward ellie

                                     peter
                         good morning

               peter is in the foreground the guard is seen in the 
               background ellie stares at peter perplexed

                                     peter
                         remember me im the fellow you slept 
                         on last night

                         for that 
                              turning to guard

                         york

                                     ellie

                         sorry miss

               the guard leaves the scene and ellies disappointment is 
               apparent

                                     peter
                              sarcastically
                         whats the matter wouldnt the old 
                         meanies wait for you
                              ellie glares at him 
                              disdaining to reply  
                              this angers him and 
                              he continues hotly
                         say how old are you anyway dont 
                         you know these busses work on a

                                     ellie
                              starting away
                         what are you excited about you missed 
                         the bus too

               peter looks at her a moment before replying

                                     peter
                              quietly
                         yeah i missed it too

               there is a close view of the two she turns to him her 
               interest is provoked by his tone of voice she glances up 
               into his face

                                     ellie

                         that what happened last night is

               while she is putting the ticket away in her purse peter 
               speaks

               he pulls a newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her 
               ellie glances at the headline hurriedly

                                     peter

                              a disdainful 
                              expression crosses

               he turns his back on her and leaves a closeup of ellie 
               shows her staring after him her eyes blazing angrily

               in a telegraph office peter addresses a girl operator as he 
               drops a telegram on the counter which she reads

                                     peter

                              apparently

                              firmly
                         collect

               as the clerk takes the wire from him scene fades out

               the bus terminal fades in it is night now and the rain 
               comes down in torrents people scurry around to get into the 
               buses as the voice of an announcer is heard

                                     announcers voice
                         bus for blahblahblahblah  
                         charleston  blahblahblah  and 
                         all points north to new york

               this dissolves to the interior of a bus which is practically 
               filled peter is in his seat reading a magazine while ellie 
               enters hurriedly from the rear door and starts forward as 
               she approaches peter she hesitates a second and deliberately 
               passes him plunking herself into a seat in the opposite 
               aisle peter turns just as she gets seated he glances at 
               her indifferently

               a close view shows ellie seated next to a man who sits reading 
               a newspaper which covers his face her eyes are fixed forward 
               her lips set adamantly a closeup of the man next to ellie 
               makes it plain that he is a typical drummer at the moment 
               he is absorbed in a serial story but suddenly he becomes 
               aware of something at his feet and without lowering the 
               newspaper his gaze slowly shifts downward at this the 
               view moves down until it reaches ellies trim ankles her 
               feet beat a regular tattoo on the floor her extreme agitation 
               is evident the view moves back slowly taking in ellies 
               shapely leg as far as the knee then we see ellie and the 
               drummer as his gaze is still fixed on her leg slowly his 
               face breaks into a lascivious grin he lowers his paper and 
               turns for a scrutiny of her face what he sees apparently 
               delights him for he drops his paper completely  and smiles 
               broadly

                                     drummer
                         hi sister  all alone my names 
                         shapeley
                              ellie favors him 
                              with a devastating 
                              look which is wasted 
                              on the drummer
                         might as well get acquainted its 
                         gonna be a long trip  gets tiresome 
                         later on specially for somebody 
                         like you you look like you got class
                              he surveys her from 
                              head to foot
                         yessir with a capital k
                              he chuckles at his 
                              own sally
                         and im a guy that knows class when 
                         he sees it believe you me

               a closeup of ellie as shapeleys voice continues shows 
               her glancing back at peter expecting him to come to her 
               rescue

                                     shapeleys voice
                         ask any of the boys theyll tell 
                         you shapeley sure knows how to pick

                         and thats the way i like em

               ellie again looks toward peter but peter seems to have found 
               something of unusual interest in his magazine and we again 
               see the harassed ellie and the irrepressible shapeley who 
               continues

                                     shapeley

                              and continues  
                              awed by the 
                              recollection

                              takes a vigorous 
                              puff and turns to 
                              her again

                              intending to freeze 
                              him
                         seems to me youre doing excellently 
                         without any assistance
                              this however only 
                              brings a guffaw from 
                              the drummer

                                     shapeley
                         thats pretty good well shut my 
                         big nasty mouth

               a closeup shows ellie enduring more of this as shapeleys 
               voice continues

                                     shapeleys voice
                         looks like youre one up on me 
                         nothin i like better than to meet a 
                         highclass mama that can snap em 
                         back at you cause the colder they 
                         are the hotter they get is what i 
                         always say

               now ellie and shapeley are seen together with peter seen in 
               the background

                                     shapeley
                         take this last town i was in i run 
                         into a dame  not a bad looker 
                         either  but boy was she an iceberg 
                         every time i opened my kisser she 
                         pulls a ten strike on me it sure 
                         looked like cold turkey for old man 
                         shapeley i sell office supplies 
                         see and this hotsytotsy lays the 
                         damper on me quick she dont need a 
                         thing  and if she did she wouldnt 
                         buy it from a fresh mugg like me 
                         well says i to myself  shapeley 
                         you better go to work youre up 
                         against a lulu well im here to 
                         tell you sister i opened up a line 
                         of fast chatter that had that dame 
                         spinnin like a russian dancer before 
                         i got through she bought enough stuff 
                         to last the firm a year and did she 
                         put on an act when i blew town

               ellie has scarcely listened to him and has divided her 
               attention between glancing back at peter and staring at 
               shapeley as if he were insane  none of which bothers 
               shapeley he goes on with his merry chatter blowing rings 
               of smoke in the direction of the ceiling

                                     shapeley
                         yessir when a cold mama gets hot  
                         boy how she sizzles she kinda 
                         cramped my style though i didnt 
                         look at a dame for three towns
                              quickly
                         not that i couldnt for me its 
                         always a cinch i got a much better 
                         chance than the local talent
                              confidentially
                         you see theyre kinda leery about 
                         the local talent too close to home 
                         know what i mean

               ellie has now reached the point where she could without any 
               compunction strangle him

                                     shapeleys voice
                              continuing over this 
                              glimpse of her 
                              desperation
                         but take a bird like me  its here 
                         today  and gone tomorrow and what 
                         happens is nobodys business

               at this time she turns helplessly toward peter but we peter 
               being deliberately oblivious of her presence following which 
               the three are seen with peter in the background

                                     shapeley
                         but i dont go in for that kinda

                              can stand

                                     ellie

                         believe you me you bore me to 
                         distraction
                              but shapeley merely 
                              throws his head back 
                              and emits his 
                              characteristic guffaw

                                     shapeley
                              laughing

                              he holds up two 
                              fingers

                                     peter
                              approaching them
                         hey you

               shapeleys laugh dies down he looks dumbly up at peter his 
               two fingers still held in midair

                                     shapeley
                         huh

                                     peter
                              indicating his own 
                              seat

                                     shapeley

                              at which shapeleys 
                              face falls

                                     shapeley
                              puzzled
                         wife

                                     peter
                         yeah come on  come on

                                     shapeley
                              rising
                         oh excuse me
                              edging away
                         i was just tryin  you know  to 
                         make things pleasant

               and smiling sheepishly he sidles over to peters seat his 
               two fingers still poised in air peter plants himself next 
               to ellie and totally ignoring her opens his magazine and 
               resumes his reading then ellie and peter are seen close 
               together she looks up at him

                                     ellie

                                     peter
                              without turning
                         forget it i didnt do it for you 
                         his voice got on my nerves

               she feels herself crushed and ventures no further comment 
               as peter resumes his interest in his magazine

               a full view of the bus follows and there is silence for a 
               while as the bus slows down and comes to a stop almost 
               simultaneously a boy makes his appearance selling magazines 
               and candy

                                     boy
                         here you are folks candy  popcorn  
                         cigarettes  magazines 

               as ellie and peter are seen again she turns and calls to 
               the boy

                              thumb for the boy to 
                              leave

                         beat it
                              and the boy 
                              frightened by his 
                              voice leaves

                                     ellie
                              resentfully

                              she starts to rise
                         here boy 

               peter snatches the purse out of her hand and takes the money 
               out ellie stares at him dumbfounded

                                     peter

                              vehemently
                         thats none of your business

                                     peter

                         youre on a budget from now on
                              he flings her purse 
                              back at her and 
                              pockets the money

                                     ellie

                                     peter
                         shut up

               he returns to his magazine leaving her staring at him 
               petulantly as the scene fades out 

               somewhere on the road at night this is apparently on the 
               outskirts of a town two local policemen and our bus driver 
               stand in the foreground near a police booth the rain sweeps 
               across their faces as they talk the passengers in the bus 
               which stands in the background stick their heads out trying 
               to hear what is going on

                                     first policeman

                         not even then if this keeps up

               peter approaches the group and is then seen with the officers 
               and the driver

                                     peter

                                     driver
                         looks like we cant go through till 
                         morning

                                     second policeman
                              his only contribution
                         not even then if this keeps up

                                     first policeman

                         thanks

               he dashes toward the bus then he appears at the side door 
               of the bus

                                     peter
                              calling
                         hey brat 
                              he is about to enter 
                              when he sees ellie

               the view moves to the rear door of the bus ellie stands on 
               the bottom step

                                     ellie
                              haughtily
                         are you talking to me

                                     peter
                         yeah come on  were stopping here 
                         for the night

               he disappears inside the bus through the side door with an 
               independent toss of her head ellie turns and also enters 
               the bus but through the rear door

               the scene dissolves to dykes auto camp ellie stands alone 
               on the porch of a small bungalow sheltered from the rain 
               over her head is a sign reading

               office  dyke auto co  p d dyke prop

               she looks about her restlessly giving the impression that 
               she has been waiting for someone suddenly she is attracted 
               by something and gazes in its direction then as seen by 
               ellie in a long view there appears about twenty yards away 
               a small cabin lighted on the inside and from it peter 
               emerges accompanied by a man  presumably mr dyke we cannot 
               hear what is being said from their movements however it 
               is apparent that an exchange of money is taking place dyke 
               waves his hand in departure and starts toward ellie at the 
               same time peter calls to her

                                     peter
                              shouting
                         hey come on were all set
                              saying which he enters 
                              the cabin

               ellie hesitates a moment then starts toward the cabin now 
               she is hurrying across the open space en route she passes 
               dyke

                                     dyke
                              as they pass
                         good evening hope you and your 
                         husband rest comfortably

               ellie keeps on running but suddenly she stops dead and looks 
               back at dyke following which a closeup of ellie shows her 
               eyes opening wide with astonishment her impulse is to call 
               dyke back to make him repeat what he said  to make certain 
               she heard him correctly but dyke is gone and she turns and 
               glances thoughtfully in the direction of the cabin then 
               slowly the corners of her mouth screw up in an attitude of 
               cynicism so thats it is it he has given her no previous 
               evidence of being on the make yet now with the first 
               opportunity  her thoughts however are interrupted by 
               peters voice

                                     peters voice
                         well brat  what do you say

               as she doesnt stir there appears a closeup view of peter 
               standing in the doorway of the cabin looking toward ellie

                                     peter
                              impatiently
                         come on come on what are you going 
                         to do stand there all night
                              he disappears inside

               for a long moment ellie is lost in speculation as to how to 
               proceed then tossing her head defiantly with her lips set 
               grimly she starts toward the cabin until she reaches it 
               stops in the doorway and peers in as she does this there 
               is a view of the inside of the cabin as seen by her at the 
               door except for two cots on either side of the room a few 
               sticks of cane furniture a small table upon which stands an 
               oil burner for cooking the place is barren at the moment 
               peter is attaching a clothes line across the center of the 
               room his suitcase is already open and now ellie steps 
               inside surveying the place contemptuously but peter with 
               his back to her is oblivious of her presence and as he 
               works he hums his favorite melody ellie finally breaks the 
               silence

                                     ellie
                              sarcastically
                         darn clever these armenians

                                     peter
                              seen close as he 
                              turns
                         yeah yeah its a gift
                              but he finishes his 
                              hammering and turns 
                              to his suitcase

                                     ellie
                              seen with peter
                         i just had the unpleasant sensation 
                         of hearing you referred to as my 
                         husband

                                     peter
                              carelessly
                         oh i forgot to tell you i registered 
                         as mr and mrs
                              the matteroffact 
                              way in which he says 
                              this causes her 
                              eyebrows to lift

                                     ellie
                         oh you did what am i expected to 
                         do  leap for joy

                                     peter
                         i kind of half expected you to thank 
                         me

                                     ellie
                         your ego is colossal

                                     peter
                              blithely
                         yeah yeah not bad hows yours

               there is silence for a moment and peter proceeds with the 
               unpacking of his suitcase as she watches him ellies mood 
               changes from one of anger to that of sarcasm

                                     ellie
                              appearing in a close
                              up her face 
                              disdainful

                                     peters voice
                              interrupting

                              but the rain outside 
                              causes her to hesitate

                                     peter

                         right

               while he speaks he has taken the extra blanket from the cot 
               and hung it over the clothes line this manages to divide 
               the room in half

               a close view at the door shows ellie watching him with 
               interest

                                     ellie
                              sarcastically
                         that i suppose makes everything  
                         uh  quite all right

                                     peter
                              the previous scene 
                              returning

                         respect prying eyes annoy me
                              he has the blanket 
                              spread out now
                         behold the walls of jericho maybe 
                         not as thick as the ones that joshua 
                         blew down with his trumpet but a 
                         lot safer you see i have no trumpet

                         the right place ill give you my 
                         best pair of pajamas

               he flings them over to her and she catches them and throws 
               them on her cot throughout the scene she hasnt budged from 
               the door but peter now prepares to undress

                                     peter
                         do you mind joining the israelites

                                     ellie
                         youre not really serious about this 
                         are you

                                     peter
                              seen at close range 
                              going about the job 
                              of undressing very 
                              diffidently
                         all right dont join the israelites 
                         perhaps youre interested in how a 
                         man undresses
                              and he hangs his 
                              coat over the chair
                         funny thing about that quite a study 
                         in psychology no two men do it alike
                              now his shirt is 
                              coming off

               a close view of ellie shows her standing stubbornly

                                     peters voice
                         i once knew a chap who kept his hat 
                         on until he was completely undressed
                              chuckling
                         made a comical picture

               as the scene includes both of them peter spreads his shirt 
               over his coat

                                     peter
                         years later his secret came out he 
                         wore a toupee

               he lights a cigarette diffidently while she remains brazenly 
               watching him her eyes flashing defiantly

                                     peter
                         i have an idiosyncrasy all my own 
                         youll notice my coat came first  
                         then the tie  then the shirt  
                         now according to hoyle the pants 
                         should come next but thats where 
                         im different
                              he bends over
                         i go for the shoes first after that 
                         i 

                                     ellie
                              unable to stand it 
                              any longer
                         smart aleck

               and thoroughly exasperated she goes behind the blanket and 
               plops on the cot she sits on the edge debating what to do 
               feeling herself trapped her impulse is to leave if only to 
               show this smart aleck hes not dealing with a child and she 
               rises impetuously and moves to the window

               a close view at the window shows her looking out the downpour 
               has not abated one bit and the heavy raindrops clatter 
               against the window pane in a sort of challenge to ellie 
               whose jaw drops she turns slowly back to the room and as 
               she does so her eyes light on the cot it looks most inviting 
               after all she hasnt had any rest for two nights she falls 
               on the cot again her shoulders sagging wearily following 
               this the view reveals both sides of the blanket peter is 
               already in his pajamas

                                     peter
                         still with me brat
                              there is no answer 
                              from ellie
                         dont be a sucker a nights restll 
                         do you a lot of good besides youve 
                         got nothing to worry about the walls 
                         of jericho will protect you from the 
                         big bad wolf

               a close view shows ellie glancing over at the blanket despite 
               herself the suggestion of a smile flits across her face

                                     ellie
                         you havent got a trumpet by any 
                         chance have you

               peter gets the idea and smiles broadly

                                     peter
                         not even a mouth organ

               pulling the covers back he prepares to get into bed humming 
               as he does so

                                     peter
                              humming to himself
                         whos afraid of the big bad wolf  
                         the big bad wolf the big bad wolf
                              louder
                         shes afraid of the big bad wolf 
                         tralalalala 
                              he springs into bed

               ellie smiles and wearily she pulls her hat off her head 
               she sits this way a moment thoughtfully then determined 
               she looks up

                                     ellie
                         do you mind putting out the light

                                     peter
                         not at all
                              he leans over and 
                              snaps it off

               the room is thrown into darkness except for a stream of light 
               coming in the window from the nightlight outside the camp 
               visible are peters face and arms as he stares ceilingward 
               while on ellies side all we can see of her is her silhouette 
               except for such times as she gets in direct line with the 
               window there are glimpses of her as she moves around in the 
               process of undressing and we see or rather sense her dress 
               dropping to the floor she now stands in her chemise this 
               being white silk it stands out more prominently against the 
               darkness she picks up the pajamas and backs into a corner 
               following which a closeup of her head and shoulders shows 
               her glancing apprehensively toward peters side of the room 
               and holding the pajamas in front of her with one hand with 
               the other she slips the strap off her shoulders she flings 
               her slip over the blanket

               peter on his side of the room looks toward the blanket 
               and reacts to the slip coming into sight then other 
               undergarments join the slip on the blanket

                                     peter
                              hoarsely
                         do you mind taking those things off 
                         the walls of jericho
                              a pause
                         its tough enough as it is

                                     ellies voice
                         oh excuse me
                              and we see the 
                              underthings flipped 
                              off the blanket

               ellies side of the room appears showing her crawling quickly 
               into bed pulling the covers over her and glancing 
               apprehensively in peters direction  following which a 
               close view shows peter being very conscious of her proximity 
               the situation is delicate and dangerous the room is atingle 
               with sex he turns his gaze toward the blanket the view 
               moves to the blanket remaining on it a moment it is a frail 
               barrier the view then moves back to peter whose eyes are 
               still on the blanket his face expressionless a close view 
               of ellie next shows that she too has her eyes glued on 
               the blanket a little fearfully she turns her head and gazes 
               at the ceiling for a moment then suddenly her eyes widen  
               and she sits up abruptly

                                     ellie
                              seriously

                                     peter
                              seen close turning 
                              his head toward her
                         whats that

                                     ellie
                              both sides of the 
                              blanket coming into 
                              view
                         who are you

                                     ellie

                                     peter

                         it back to me in the morning

                                     ellie
                              flopping back on her 
                              pillow as she mumbles
                         pleased to meet you mr warne

                                     peter
                         the pleasure is all mine

               there is silence between them for a few seconds

                                     peter
                         ive been thinking about you

                                     ellies voice
                         yes

                                     peter

                         that twice a missus and still 
                         unkissed

               ellie doesnt like the implication and glares in his 
               direction as peters voice continues

                                     peters voice
                              meaningly
                         ill bet youre in an awful hurry to 
                         get back to new york arent you

                                     ellie

                         goodnight mr warne
                              she turns over

                                     peter
                         goodnight

               he also turns his head toward the wall and the scene fades 
               out 

               a long view of the sky in the early morning fades in in 
               the dim distance there is a speck which as it comes nearer 
               turns out to be an airplane the drone of its motors becomes 
               louder and louder then the view cuts to the control cockpit 
               of the plane revealing two pilots

                                     first pilot
                              shouting to other
                         the old mans screwy

                                     second pilot
                              who cant hear him
                         whats at

                                     first pilot
                              louder
                         i said the old mans screwy

                                     second pilot
                              nodding his head in 
                              agreement
                         yeah

                                     first pilot
                              cupping his mouth
                         the dames too smart for him

                                     second pilot
                              nodding again then 
                              leaning over
                         howd you like to be married to a 
                         wild cat like that

               the first pilot grimaces in disgust grabs his nose between 
               his fingers and goes through the motion of ducking under 
               water and as they both laugh the scene cuts to the cabin 
               of the plane a privately built plane which has all the 
               equipment of a passenger ship andrews and one of his 
               secretaries a conservativeappearing man of middle age 
               lean over a table this being a closed cabin the roar of 
               the motors scarcely interferes with the dialogue

                              impatiently

                         sir
                              he shrugs his 
                              shoulders to indicate 
                              there is no news

                                     andrews
                              muttering
                         amateurs

                                     secretary
                         theyre the finest detective agency 
                         in the country sir

               andrews doesnt answer him he puffs furiously on his cigar 
               glances out of the window and turns irritably to a phone by 
               his side he snaps up the receiver and presses a button 
               following which the scene cuts to the control cockpit where 
               a light flashes on the instrument board and the pilot picks 
               up the receiver

                                     pilot
                         yes sir

                                     andrews
                              seen in the cabin
                         i thought i made it clear i was in a 
                         hurry to get to new york
                              bellowing
                         what are we crawling for

               in the control cockpit the pilot reacts to the complaint 
               and glances at his speed indicator we then see the speed 
               indicator registering 180 miles an hour the pilot looks 
               aghast

                                     pilot
                              yelling into phone
                         weve got her wide open sir

                                     andrews
                              irascibly
                         well step on it step on it

               he bangs up the receiver and stares moodily out of the window 
               it is plain that he is worried the view then includes his 
               secretary henderson

                                     henderson
                         i hope shes all right sir

                                     andrews
                              sharply
                         of course shes all right what do 
                         you think can happen

                                     henderson
                              intimidated
                         nothing sir

                                     andrews
                         then shut up about it

               thereupon the view cuts to a closeup of an airplane motor 
               in rapid motion and this dissolves to the auto camp cabin 
               next morning a close view showing ellie peacefully sleeping 
               but the drone of the plane overhead disturbs her and she 
               moves restlessly

                                     ellie
                              murmuring in her 
                              sleep
                         darn planes 

               she squirms around uncomfortably and finding it impossible 
               to resume her slumber opens her eyes the sun pouring in 
               through the window causes her to squint she sits up and 
               stares outside puzzled then remembering where she is she 
               looks toward the other side of the cabin listening for some 
               sign of life but there is none and she relaxes she falls 
               back on the pillow pulling the covers over her

               now peter enters from the outside with an armful of 
               foodstuffs which he dumps on the table he looks toward 
               ellie

                                     peter
                         hey  you not up yet come on  
                         come on

                                     ellies voice
                         what time is it

                                     peter
                         eight oclock

               he goes to the blanket which hangs between the two cots and 
               throws something over it to ellie

                                     peter
                         here 

                                     ellie
                              catching the package
                         what is it
                              opening the package
                         why its a toothbrush thanks
                              noticing her dress 
                              hanging freshly 
                              pressed
                         you  you had it pressed

                                     peter
                              getting things ready 
                              for breakfast

                         why you sweet thing you whered 
                         you get it pressed
                              at this the view 
                              moves with him and 
                              he goes to the blanket

                                     peter
                         listen brat  im going to count 
                         to ten if youre not out of bed by 
                         then im going to yank you out myself

               a close view of ellie shows her being stubborn but alarmed

                                     peters voice
                              counting quickly
                         one  two  three  four  five

                                     ellie

                         why you bully i believe you would

                                     peters voice

                                     ellie
                              screaming
                         im out im out

               and she jumps out of bed throwing the cover around herself 
               following which peter is seen going back to the table

                                     peter
                         youll find the showers  and things  
                         right back of the second cottage
                              at this ellie sticks 
                              her head over the 
                              blanket

                                     ellie
                              aghast
                         outside

                                     peter
                         certainly outside all the best 
                         homes have em outside

                                     ellie
                         i cant go out like this

                                     peter
                         like what

                                     ellie
                         like this i have no robe

                                     peter
                         here  take mine

               he flings his robe over to her and she disappears behind 
               the blanket

                                     peter
                         but make it snappy

               now ellie has got into his robe and appears on his side 
               the robe is too large for her and she makes a comical figure 
               as she enters she tries to maintain her customary dignity

                                     ellie
                              dignifiedly
                         whered you say the showers  and 
                         things  were
                              peter turns when he 
                              sees her he laughs

                                     peter
                              appraisingly
                         hey  youre little arent you

                                     ellie
                         where is the shower

                                     peter
                         your hairs cute like that you should 
                         never comb it

                                     ellie
                              leaving haughtily
                         ill find it myself

               she slams the door viciously but peter rushes over to the 
               window to watch her and as viewed by him ellie appears 
               next walking to the showers outside the cabin she holds her 
               head high and struggles valiantly to maintain as much dignity 
               as she can muster under the circumstances then in the cabin 
               at the window peter watching ellie chuckles at her shaking 
               his head in amusement he starts toward the table and the 
               scene cuts to a moving view outside the cabins with ellie 
               walking past several cottages on her way to the showers 
               several people stop to stare at her until she reaches her 
               destination there are two wooden shacks adjoining each 
               having a sign on them one reads showers  men  the 
               other showers  women in front of the womens shower 
               there are several unappetizinglooking fat women waiting 
               and with them is a small girl ellie crosses over to the 
               womens shower and disappears inside the waiting women 
               staring at her puzzled a moment elapses and ellie backs 
               out being pushed by a woman part of whose naked body is 
               visible and whose voice is heard in protest

                                     woman
                         cant a body have some privacy around 
                         here

               the women who are waiting chuckle at ellies embarrassment 
               as she stands aside they certainly are making a monkey out 
               of her decorum the little girl keeps eyeing ellie 
               fascinated

                                     little girl
                              pointing
                         dont she look funny mama

               ellie wheeling on the little girl crushes her with a 
               devastating look so that the little girl cringes against 
               her mothers skirt ellie goes to the end of the line to 
               await her turn following which closeups show the little 
               girl slowly turning her head to look at ellie and ellie 
               noticing the little girl staring at her whereupon ellie 
               sticks her tongue out at her and in a scene which includes 
               both the little girl retaliates by sticking her tongue out 
               also

               this dissolves to a view of ellie coming out of the showers 
               at the same time shapeley comes out of the mens shower and 
               upon seeing ellie his face lights up

                                     shapeley
                         hello sister

               ellie ignores him and walks toward her cabin but shapeley 
               falls into step with her

                                     shapeley

                         for a killin and you turn out to 
                         be an old married woman

               the scene cuts to the door of peters cabin as peter comes 
               out stands in the doorway and is surprised to see ellie 
               and shapeley who are then seen from his angle talking 
               thereupon peter is seen again as his lip curls up a little 
               jealously he returns to the cabin following which we again 
               see ellie and shapeley walking he notices the robe she is 
               wearing and he looks down toward her feet the view moving 
               down to show ellies legs and feet the pajama legs are seen 
               protruding below the robe the cuffs of which she has turned 
               up then the view moving back up to ellie and shapeley he 
               lifts her robe playfully

                                     shapeley

                              stopping  her eyes 
                              blazing

                                     shapeley
                         okay i was just trying to make 
                         conversation

               ellie leaves him abruptly and the scene cuts to the cabin 
               where peter is now busy setting the small table ellie enters 
               after a moment while peter has his back to the door

                                     peter
                              without turning
                         high time you got back

                                     ellie

                         the showers we got to chatting about 
                         this and that you know how time 
                         flies

               she disappears behind the blanket following which we see 
               peters side of the cabin while ellies voice continues 
               from behind the blanket

                                     ellies voice
                         we must come back to this place often 
                         you meet the nicest people

               her head bobs up over the blanket now and again as she 
               dresses

                                     ellie

                         shes turned out quite a charming 
                         creature

               peter ignores her chatter except for an annoyed glance once 
               in a while

                                     ellie

                              sticking her head 
                              over blanket
                         why peter dont you want to hear 
                         about our lovely friends

               a close view shows ellie in the process of buttoning her 
               dress she looks up having recognized a tinge of jealousy 
               in his voice which intrigues her she starts to the other 
               side of the blanket then we see her joining peter in his 
               part of the cabin

                                     ellie

               directly outside their window and the view moves with peter 
               as he goes to the door which he opens slightly thereupon 
               dyke is seen in conversation with two men outside the cabin

                              suddenly
                         come here you little fool

               she starts toward him we then see him plunking her in a 
               chair

                                     peter
                         sit down

               he rumples her hair and sticks a few hairpins in her mouth 
               he now stands aside and deliberately talks loud enough to be 
               heard outside

                                     peter
                              practically shouting

                         she says if we dont stop over at

                              a closeup showing 
                              her staring at him 
                              in bewilderment
                         what are you talking about

               at this peter rushes over to her and clamps his hand over 
               her mouth

                                     peter
                              with his hand over 
                              her mouth
                         the baby is due next month  and 
                         they want us to come

               ellie looks up at him and realizes what hes doing she 
               nods to him that its all right whereupon he removes his 
               hand from her mouth and now one of the detectives approaches 
               front door of the cabin when he hears peters voice he 
               stops to listen

                                     peters voice
                         she says she saw your sister ethel 
                         the other day and shes looking 
                         swell

               the detective knocks on the door at this we again see inside 
               of the cabin as peter whispers to ellie to say come in

                                     ellie
                              calling
                         come in

               the moment she does peter rushes behind the hanging blanket 
               he has his head stuck over it waiting for the detective to 
               enter and the moment the door opens peter ducks the 
               detective takes a step inside the room

                                     peters voice

               a close view shows ellie and the detective they have been 
               staring at each other

               ellie goes over to her cot and starts picking up her hat 
               and things whereupon dyke very much affected turns to the 
               detectives

                         daughter of the big wall street mug

               a closeup of ellie appears as their voices are heard

                                     first detectives voice

                         quit bawling quit bawling

               the detectives start out accompanied by dyke who is still 
               concerned about the disturbing of his tenants as they 
               disappear out the door we hear dykes voice

                                     dykes voice
                         i told you they were a perfectly 
                         nice married couple

               their voices die peter stands in the middle of the room 
               watching them go from her side where she has been stalling 
               ellie peers out of the window until the detectives vanish 
               she starts toward peter then they appear together both 
               staring out until the detectives are well out of sight 
               finally peter closes the door and turns to her

                                     peter
                              seriously

                         if it turns out to be a girl after 
                         all

               this brings laughter from them both but peter suddenly 
               sobers and he looks at her thoughtfully

                                     peter

                         parts myself

               they are interrupted by the door being flung open dyke sticks 
               his head in the door

                                     dyke

                         to pack yet

               and they both scurry around throwing things carelessly into 
               peters suitcase as the scene fades out

               gordons office fades in and gordon is at his desk as his 
               secretary enters

                                     secretary

                              as the secretary

               gordon snatches the wire out of her hand and tears it 
               viciously into bits

                                     gordon
                         collect

                         dont accept any more

               the scene dissolves to andrews new york office  a richly

                              the entrance of 
                              several employees

                                     one of them

                                     brown
                         yessir

                                     andrews
                         send the story out to the newspapers
                              he rips a picture of 
                              ellie on the desk 
                              out of its frame
                         some of the out of town papers may 
                         not have a picture of her here  
                         wire this to them  i want it to 
                         break right away

               as he hands the picture to brown the view moves in to a 
               closeup of the picture which dissolves to a closeup of the 
               same picture in a newspaper and as the view draws slowly 
               back we see the headline over it which reads daughter of 
               banker disappears ten thousand dollars reward the view then 
               draws back to reveal shapeley reading the newspaper he stares 
               long and absorbedly at the picture then slowly he turns his 
               head toward the rear of the bus and the view following his 
               gaze passes a group of men singing the man on the flying 
               trapeze they are huddled together and accompanied by a 
               man who plays a guitar then the view continues moving until 
               it reaches peter and ellie who join in the song and a close
               up of ellie shows her eyes sparkling as she sings gaily

               shapeley looks back at ellie and apparently comes to the 
               conclusion that his suspicions are correct for he quickly 
               folds the newspaper casting a surreptitious glance around 
               to make certain he is not being watched a diabolical smirk 
               spreads over his face

               a full view of the interior of the bus shows most of the 
               occupants joining in the fun singing they seem unmindful 
               of the discomfiture caused by the rocking of the bus which 
               throws them against each other then the view draws in to a 
               front seat in which sit a woman and a small boy of ten the 
               womans face is haggard and she sways uncertainly her eyes 
               half closed her small sons frightened face peers up at 
               her

                                     boy
                              in a trembling voice
                         whatsa matter ma dont you feel 
                         all right

               the woman struggles valiantly to recover her composure she 
               presses her sons small hand in a feeble effort at assurance

               a close view of ellie and peter shows ellie singing more 
               boisterously than the rest doing the comical song with 
               exaggerated gestures but suddenly her face clouds at 
               something she sees

                                     ellie
                              touching peters arm
                         peter
                              as he turns
                         theres something the matter with 
                         that woman she looks ill

               peter follows her gaze whereupon we see the woman her head 
               rolls weakly a pained expression on her face

                                     ellie
                              again seen with peter 
                              sympathetically
                         i better go over and see her

                                     peter
                         dont be silly nothing you can do 
                         must be tough on an old woman  a 
                         trip like this

                                     ellie
                              worried
                         yes

               we see the other passengers around ellie and peter enjoying 
               themselves one of them pokes her

                                     man
                         hey gallicurci come on  get 
                         onto it
                              poking peter
                         you too mccormack

               ellie and peter snap into it they are just in time for the 
               long wail which precedes the chorus

                                     ellie and peter
                              singing
                         oooohhe flies through the air 
                         with the greatest of ease  this 
                         daring young man on the flying trapeze 
                         

               at this the scene cuts to the road the bus is caught in a 
               muddy road full of ruts and at the moment wavers dangerously 
               at an angle the left front wheel is stuck in a deep hole 
               and the engine roars and clatters as the driver feeds the 
               gas finally the bus moves forward extricating the wheel 
               but just as it does the right front wheel falls into another 
               mud hole on the other side and this time the bus seems 
               hopelessly stuck a closeup of the right wheel showing it 
               revolving desperately but in vain the mud splashes in all 
               directions and the wheel seems to sink deeper and deeper 
               thereupon this view cuts to the inside of the bus the bus 
               is tilted over at an extreme angle which has thrown ellie 
               into a corner on the floor where she now crouches in an 
               undignified position she looks like a turtle her head being 
               invisible

                                     ellie
                              sticking her head 
                              out
                         thank the man for me peter this is 
                         the first comfortable position ive 
                         had all night

               peter amused is assisting her to her feet the guitarist 
               has continued his playing uninterrupted and as peter lifts 
               ellie he sings

                                     peter
                              singing
                         she flies through the air with the 
                         greatest of ease this darin young 
                         maid on the flying trapeze 
                              grunting
                         her movements are graceful  all 
                         men does she please 

               a close view of the woman and the little boy now shows the 
               latter terrifiedly watching his mother whose head sags 
               wearily finally she topples forward in a swoon

                                     boy
                              with a moan
                         ma ma whatsa matter with you
                              tears stream down 
                              his cheeks
                         somebody help me somethins happened 
                         to her

               the music stops abruptly everyone looks up startled ellie 
               starts forward followed by peter passengers closely group 
               around the woman and chatter shes fainted look how pale 
               she is

               peter and ellie step up

                                     peter
                         get some water somebody

                         let me get in here son

               ellie goes out of sight to get water the boy cries audibly 
               terrorstricken but gets out of peters way and peter lifts 
               the woman up and stretches her across the seat ellie comes 
               back with water which she silently hands to peter who 
               administers to the woman and when she slowly opens her eyes 
               makes her drink the water the woman looks around bewildered

                                     peter
                              consolingly

                         just took a little nosedive thats 
                         all

               he assists her in sitting up the boys wailing is heard 
               and he now rushes over and throws his arms around his mother

                                     boy
                              crying
                         ma  oh gee ma 

               his mother clings to him but still feeling faint her head 
               sways peter looks up at ellie and gives her a sign to sit 
               down beside the woman ellie sits down beside her peter 
               takes the boy by the shoulders

                                     peter
                         come on son better give your mother 
                         a chance to snap out of it
                              as the boy emits a 
                              heartbreaking sob
                         its all right son shell be okay 
                         in a couple of minutes

               he leads the boy away while ellie places her arm around the 
               woman

                                     ellie

                         trip hasnt it

               the scene cuts to a close view of shapeley who has his eye 
               peeled on peter watching him and we next see peter and the 
               boy who is still sobbing quietly they are now standing 
               away from the other passengers

                                     boy

               peter reaches into his pocket for a bill just as ellie 
               approaches them

               a smaller one before he can find anything however ellie 
               takes the one he has in his hand and gives it to the boy

                              empty hand and then 
                              at ellie

               she leaves with the boy peter watching her a moment 
               impressed by her display of humanness before turning and 
               leaving the scene following which a closeup shot of shapeley 
               watching peter then also rising and starting out

               on the road the driver is now standing in front of the mud
               hole staring at the sunken wheel dolefully as several people 
               stray into the scene

                                     driver
                         that storm sure made a mess outa 
                         these roads

                                     peter
                              appearing and seeing 
                              the trouble

                         there isnt a town within ten miles 
                         of here

               shapeley is just entering the outskirts of the group he 
               stops looks in the direction of peter speculatively he has 
               the newspaper stuck in his pocket which he caresses tenderly 
               the scene expanding peter is then seen leaving the group

                                     shapeley
                              as peter approaches
                         whats up

                                     peter
                         looks like were going to be stuck 
                         for a long time
                              he starts away

                                     shapeley
                              calling to him
                         say buddy 

               peter turns and looks at him quizzically and the two are 
               then seen close together

                                     shapeley
                         like to have a look at my paper

               he has taken it out and has it opened as he hands it to peter 
               the headlines concerning ellie and her picture shriek out at 
               peter this startles him for a moment but he manages to 
               recover his poise

                                     shapeley
                         travelin like this you kinda lose

                              guardedly
                         thanks
                              he glances from the 
                              newspaper to shapeley 
                              wondering how much 
                              he suspects

                                     shapeley

                         talk this thing over privately

               and the view moves with them as peter leads the way toward a 
               clump of bushes off the side of the road shapeley following 
               they are concealed from the rest of the passengers

                                     peter

                         do you pack a gat

               a close view of the two shows the smile dying on shapeleys 
               face he looks up quickly

                                     shapeley

                              to realize he is in 
                              for something he 
                              hadnt bargained

                         may have to shoot it out with cops

               the perspiration starts appearing on shapeleys brow as we 
               see him in a closeup peters voice continues

                                     peters voice

                              hand and shaking it

                                     peter
                              putting his hand 
                              away
                         come on scram and stay away from 
                         that bus

                                     shapeley
                         sure anything you say

               as he says this he backs away from peter following which a 
               closeup of peter shows a twinkle in his eye and then as 
               seen by peter shapeley appears walking hurriedly away when 
               he thinks the distance is safe he starts running he slips 
               and falls in the mud picks himself up and continues his 
               race for life

               the scene dissolves to the road at night with ellie and 
               peter walking along it is apparent they have been trudging 
               like this for a long time

                                     ellie
                         poor old shapeley you shouldnt 
                         have frightened him like that

                                     peter
                         at the rate he started hes probably 
                         passed two state lines by this time 
                         the exercise is good for him

                                     ellie
                         yes i noticed he was getting a little 
                         fat lately

                         i was never built for these moonlight 
                         strolls
                              protesting

                                     peter
                         i dont trust that chatterbox

               the scene dissolves to the banks of a narrow stream at night 
               peter is bending over removing his shoes and we see the 
               two closer as they talk

                                     peter

                         fainting scene

                         have to starve all the way

                                     peter
                              rising  uttering a 
                              deep sigh
                         must be some strange power westley 
                         has over you women
                              he now has his shoes 
                              off and ties them to 
                              each other
                         how do you expect to get there

                                     ellie
                         to new york

                                     peter
                         yeah

                                     ellie

                                     peter
                         arent you afraid of me

                                     ellie
                              confidently
                         no

                                     peter
                              looking at her
                         okay hang on to these

               as he bends down in front of ellie he gets a firm grip around 
               her legs and throws her over his shoulder like a sack she 
               squeals terrified but peter ignores this and with his 
               right hand which is free he lifts the suitcase and starts 
               walking across the stream ellies first fright is gone and 
               she now rather enjoys the sensation of being carried by peter 
               she lets herself go completely limp still clinging to his 
               shoes which she carries by the string as they walk the 
               dangling shoes keep hitting peters backside

                                     peter
                         i wish youd stop being playful

                                     ellie
                              thereupon holding 
                              the shoes out at a 
                              safe distance
                         sorry
                              peter takes several 
                              more laborious steps 
                              before either of 
                              them speaks
                         its the first time ive ridden piggy

                                     peter

                                     ellie

                                     ellie
                              after a silence for 
                              several seconds
                         i remember distinctly father taking 
                         me for a piggyback ride 

                                     peter
                         and he carried you like this i 
                         suppose

                                     ellie
                         yes

                                     peter

                                     ellie
                              another silence before 
                              she speaks again
                         my uncle  mothers brother  had 
                         four children and ive seen them

                                     peter

                         rider in your whole family i never 
                         knew a rich man yet who was a good 
                         piggyback rider

                                     ellie

                                     peter
                         to be a piggybacker it takes 
                         complete relaxation  a warm heart  
                         and a loving nature

                                     ellie
                         and rich people have none of those

                                     peter
                         not a one

                                     ellie
                         youre prejudiced

                                     peter

                         and ill show you somebody thats 
                         human take abraham lincoln for 
                         instance  a natural piggybacker
                              contemptuously
                         where do you get off with your stuffed
                         shirt family
                              turning
                         why your father knew so much about 
                         piggyback riding that he 

               in his excitement he wheels around to speak to her forgetting 
               that as he turns she goes with him not finding her at his 
               right he swings around to his left naturally he takes ellie 
               with him  and realizing his mistake he mutters

                                     peter
                         aw nuts

               he proceeds on his way walking faster than before they 
               continue this way silently for some time finally ellie breaks 
               the silence

                                     ellie
                              persistently
                         my father was a great piggybacker

               peter raises his eyes heavenward in thorough disgust then 
               calmly hands his suitcase to her

                                     peter
                         hold this a minute

               ellie takes the suitcase from him and his hand now free he 
               delivers a resounding smack on her backside so that ellie 
               lets out a yelp

                                     peter
                              taking the suitcase
                         thank you

               the scene dissolves to the edge of a cow pasture at night 
               and ellie and peter are revealed climbing under a barbed 
               wire fence following which the scene dissolves to a haystack 
               in front peter sets his bag down and surveys the layout 
               ellie watching him

                                     peter
                              to himself
                         this looks like the best spot

                                     ellie
                         were not going to sleep out here 
                         are we

                                     peter
                         i dont know about you but im going 
                         to give a fairly good imitation of 
                         it

               and he busies himself laying out a bed for her pulling hay 
               from the stack and spreading it out on the ground ellie 
               wanders aimlessly and then moves to a rock where she sits 
               and watches peter

                                     ellie
                              after a pause coyly
                         peter 

                                     peter
                              as a close view shows 
                              him still arranging 
                              her bed grumbling
                         what

                                     ellies voice
                         im hungry

                                     peter
                              without looking up
                         just your imagination

                                     ellie
                              seen at the rock 
                              while peter is out 
                              of sight
                         no it isnt im hungry and  and 
                         scared

                                     peters voice
                         you cant be hungry and scared at 
                         the same time

                                     ellie
                              insisting
                         well i am

                                     peter
                              as both he and ellie 
                              are seen in their 
                              respective places
                         if youre scared it scares the hunger 
                         out of you

                                     ellie
                              argumentatively
                         not if youre more hungry than scared

                                     peter
                              impatiently
                         all right you win lets forget it

                                     ellie
                              after a pause
                         i cant forget it im still hungry

                                     peter
                              tearing his hair 
                              screaming
                         holy smokes why did i ever get mixed 
                         up with you

               this brings silence and he goes on building a bed for her 
               then a closeup of ellie shows her watching him her eyes 
               soften a very definite interest in him is slowly but surely 
               blossoming and the fact that he is making her bed adds to 
               the intimacy of the scene a close view of peter shows him 
               concentrating on his task but he pauses a moment and turns 
               to glance at her it is a devouring look which he quickly 
               dispels by working more feverishly on her bed

                                     peter
                              muttering while he 
                              works
                         if i had any sense id have been in 
                         new york by this time
                              he emphasizes his 
                              feelings by yanking 
                              viciously at the hay 
                              as both of them are 
                              now seen
                         taking a married woman back to her 
                         husband hunh what a prize sucker i 
                         turned out to be
                              he has her bed ready 
                              without glancing at 
                              her
                         come on  your beds all ready

               she watches him a moment then rising slowly starts toward 
               peter then she stands over her bed surveying it 
               speculatively

                                     ellie
                         ill get my clothes all wrinkled

                                     peter
                              sharply
                         well take them off

                                     ellie
                              shocked
                         what

                                     peter
                              shouting
                         all right dont take them off do 
                         whatever you please but shut up 
                         about it

               she flashes him a petulant offended glance but it is lost 
               on peter who has his back to her and meticulously she 
               slips to her knees and proceeds to stretch out on the hay 
               the hay bed is bumpy and hard and she has quite a difficult 
               time getting comfortable her efforts to do so are accompanied 
               by painful sighs a close view shows peter stopping to watch 
               her and his look is sympathetic and solicitous then while 
               ellie groans and sighs and pounds the hay with her palm 
               peter steps out of sight ellie is unaware of his departure 
               so busily occupied is she with her makeshift bedding she 
               squirms around unhappily and finally stretches out deciding 
               to make the best of it she lies on her back her hands 
               clasped under her head looking up at the stars

                                     ellie
                              seen close as she 
                              is lying back on hay 
                              bed
                         youre becoming terribly disagreeable 
                         lately snap my head off every time 
                         i open my mouth
                              she waits for a reply 
                              but receives none
                         if being with me is so distasteful 
                         to you you can leave
                              independently
                         you can leave any time you see fit 
                         nobodys keeping you her
                              martyrlike
                         i can get along

               she waits a second and then turns to see what effect this 
               has on him the fact that peter is gone doesnt quite register 
               at first she looks around calmly then is puzzled and 
               finally she becomes panicky she sits up with a start

                                     ellie
                              murmuring frightened
                         peter 
                              there is a pause 
                              while she listens 
                              but nothing stirs 
                              and there is more 
                              apprehension in her 
                              voice
                         peter

               real terror comes into her face and she is ready to cry 
               she gets to her feet

                                     ellie
                              with a terrified 
                              outcry
                         peter

               at this he comes running into the scene under his arm he 
               has a watermelon

                                     peter
                         whats the matter

                                     ellie
                              relieved
                         oh peter
                              she throws her arms 
                              around his neck and 
                              sobs freely

                                     peter
                              hoarsely
                         whats got into you

                                     ellie
                              clinging to him
                         oh peter i was so scared

               with his free hand he removes her arm from around his neck 
               and starts away

                                     peter
                              setting the watermelon 
                              down
                         i wasnt gone more than a minute 
                         just went out to find you something 
                         to eat

                                     ellie
                              a sob still in her 
                              voice
                         i know  but 

                                     peter
                              kicking the melon 
                              over to her
                         here eat your head off

                                     ellie
                         i dont want it now

                                     peter
                              vehemently
                         thought you were hungry

                                     ellie
                         i was  but 

                                     peter
                         but what

                                     ellie
                         i was so scared  that it scared 

                                     peter
                              exasperatedly
                         holy jumping catfish you can drive 
                         a guy crazy

               he kicks the melon viciously out of sight and without any 
               particular preparation or fuss he flops down on his bed 
               following which ellie goes to her bed and lies down too 
               then a close view of ellie appears and at the moment she 
               looks far removed from the spoiled pampered selfreliant 
               brat of alexander andrews instead she is a helpless baby 
               clinging to peters protective wing shed be ever so grateful 
               right now for a little civility on his part for a little 
               tenderness and understanding and she glances over at him 
               hopefully peter however stares up at the stars dreamily 
               and we then see ellie turning away from him disappointed 
               still the minute ellie turns her head peter looks at her 
               out of the corner of his eye and its a long and steady 
               gaze then suddenly he gets an idea and rises he finds his 
               topcoat and goes to her

                                     peter
                         might get chilly later on
                              he spreads it over 
                              her
                         better use this

               as he bends down to tuck her in their faces are seen in 
               close proximity ellie tremulous and fearful has her eyes 
               peeled on him the situation is imminent with danger anything 
               is likely to happen at this moment and she is frightened 
               and expectant  she knows how weak she would be if he 
               suddenly crushed her in his arms peter avoids her gaze he 
               too is a bit shaky the temptation is there and his 
               resistance is waning he tucks her in and quickly turns away 
               ellies eyes however never leave him immediate danger has 
               vanished and it leaves her a little regretful

               a close view of peter as he walks over to a rock and sits 
               down shows him nervously taking out a cigarette and lighting 
               it

                                     peter
                         youve had a lot of men crazy about 
                         you havent you

               ellie doesnt respond she has the scrutinizing speculative 
               look of a girl who feels herself falling in love with someone 
               who is practically a stranger to her as a result of which 
               she is frightened then a wider view includes both of them 
               and we see that peter too fights valiantly against a 
               mounting interest in this girl who epitomizes everything he 
               dislikes he creates the impression in the following scene 
               that in his analysis of her he is trying to dissuade himself 
               from something he is bound to regret his attack on her 
               consequently is overly vicious

                                     peter
                         i guess youve pretty much had your 
                         own way with them thats your trouble 
                         mostly youve always had your own 
                         way thats why youre such a mess 
                         now

               he pauses a second waiting for a protest but ellie offers 
               none she is too much absorbed in her own confusing emotions 
               a close view then shows peter taking a long puff on his 
               cigarette and exhaling the smoke watching it vanish before 
               he speaks

                                     peter
                              suddenly
                         you know what generally happens to 
                         people like you you get your values 
                         all mixed up you attach all the 
                         importance to the wrong things right 
                         now for instance theres only one 
                         thought in your mind  to get back 
                         to king westley

               he waits for a reaction but a close view shows ellie 
               absorbed and she remains silent peters voice continues

                                     peters voice
                         comical part of it is it isnt what 
                         you want at all in a couple of weeks 
                         youll be looking for the nearest 
                         exit
                              now seen with her
                         people like you spend all your life 
                         on a merrygoround i guess thats 
                         what makes you so dizzy
                              he rises and paces a 
                              few moments
                         youre always chasing after something 
                         at least you think you are truth 
                         is youre just running away
                              emphatically
                         from yourself mostly cause youre 
                         miserable you hate yourself the 
                         worlds full of people like you 
                         dont know what they want

                                     ellie
                         do you know

                              after a pause
                         nothing youd give two cents for

                                     ellie

                              her
                         if they didnt get themselves all 
                         balled up with a lot of manufactured

                         does cause you were tired  and

                                     ellie

                                     peter

                         two years ago i got a notion and

                         on swell after a while it got stale 
                         i went down to tahiti just lay on 
                         the beach for six months what could 
                         be sweeter

                                     ellie
                         doesnt sound very exciting

               peter seen close looks at her for a long time before 
               speaking

                                     peter
                         i guess not id have given odds it 
                         wouldnt mean anything to you
                              he goes over and 
                              flops down on his 
                              own side of hay
                         there were moments when i had hopes 
                         when i  aw im wasting time  
                         youre destined to be a dope the 
                         rest of your life
                              contemptuously
                         i pity you goodnight

               he turns over with a finality that precludes any further 
               discussion following which a closeup of ellie reveals that 
               her eyes are wide open staring thoughtfully up at the sky 
               the scene fades out slowly

               a road fades in it is day now and peter and ellie are 
               trundling along ellie limps and wears an unhappy expression 
               on her face

                                     ellie
                         what are you thinking about

                                     peter

                         thinking of you

                                     ellie

                         dames like you so dizzy

                                     ellie

                         doing

                                     peter
                         hitchhiking

                                     ellie
                         well youve given me a very good 
                         example of the hiking 
                              strongly
                         where does the hitching come in

                                     peter
                              amused at her
                         a little early yet no cars out yet

               she spies a rock and heads for it then we see her seated on 
               the rock

                                     ellie

                         sit right here till they come
                              peter comes over 
                              sets his bag down 
                              and prepares to wait
                         got a toothpick

                                     peter
                         no but ive got a penknife
                              he extracts one from 
                              his pocket which he 
                              snaps open

                                     ellie
                         hay  in my teeth

               she points to her front teeth and peter flicks the hay out 
               of her teeth

                                     peter
                         there it is better swallow it were 
                         not going to have any breakfast

                         neednt rub it in
                              peter takes a carrot 
                              out of his coat pocket 
                              and starts nibbling 
                              on it ellie looks 
                              up at this

                         no
                              as peter smacks his 
                              lips with satisfaction
                         its a wonder you couldnt get me 
                         something i can eat

               while she speaks a car roars by at terrific speed peter and 
               ellie both jump up

                         we let a car get away
                              ellie goes back to 
                              her rock despondently

                                     ellie

                              he shakes his head 
                              sadly
                         but theyre all wrong never get 
                         anywhere

                                     ellie
                         tch tch im sorry for the poor 
                         things

                                     peter
                         but the thumb always works different 
                         ways to do it though depends on 
                         how you feel for instance number 
                         one is a short jerky movement
                              he demonstrates
                         that shows independence you dont 
                         care if they stop or not cause you 
                         got some money in your pocket see

                                     ellie

                                     peter
                         number two is a wider movement  a 
                         smile goes with that one  like 
                         this
                              he demonstrates
                         that means you got a couple of brand 
                         new stories about the farmers 
                         daughter

                                     ellie

                         huh

                                     peter

                         broke  and hungry  and everything 
                         looks black its a long movement 
                         like this 
                              demonstrating
                          with a follow through

                                     ellie

                         havent got a long face with it

               in the distance a car is heard approaching and ellie looks 
               up quickly

                                     ellie
                              excitedly
                         here comes a car

                                     peter
                              alert

                         one keep your eye on that thumb 
                         baby and see what happens

               peter steps forward into the road and does his thumb movement 
               the car approaches but speeds right by spreading a cloud 
               of dust in peters face leaving him staring at the departing 
               car nonplussed thereupon ellie seen close glances up at 
               him a satirical expression on her face

                                     ellie
                              sarcastically
                         im still watching your thumb

               peter is still looking after the car

                                     peter
                         something must have gone wrong i 
                         guess ill try number two

                                     ellie
                         when you get up to a hundred wake 
                         me up

               another car is heard coming and peter steps forward prepared 
               to hail it then this dissolves to a long view of the road 
               as a stream of cars of every description speeds forward 
               toward the camera and vanishes the view moving in to 
               the side of the road peter is seen still in the same spot 
               he waves his arms jerks his thumb indulges in all sorts of 
               gyrations while ellie remains slumped on her rock completely 
               worn out

               now ellie watches peter out of the corner of her eye her 
               face expressionless peter continues his arm waving  but 
               slows down like a mechanical toy which has run out he finally 
               gets down to just thumbing his nose at the passing vehicles 
               and then thoroughly wearied he flops down on a rock near 
               ellie

                                     peter
                         i guess maybe i wont write that 
                         book after all

                                     ellie
                         yes but look at all the fun you 
                         had
                              as he glares at her
                         mind if i try

                                     peter
                              contemptuously
                         you dont make me laugh

                                     ellie
                         youre such a smart aleck nobody 
                         can do anything but you ill show 
                         you how to stop a car  and i wont 
                         use my thumb

               the scene widens as she rises and steps forward

                                     peter
                         whatre you going to do

                                     ellie
                         mind your own business

               she lifts her skirt to above her knees and pretends to be 
               fixing her garter her very attractive leg is in full display 
               almost instantly we hear the screaming and grinding of 
               quickly applied brakes and peter looks up astonished

               the scene wiping off we then get a closer view of ellie and 
               peter sitting in the back of an open ford it is a broken
               down rickety affair of the 1920 vintage ellie grins 
               victoriously up at peter who stares ahead of him glumly

                                     ellie
                         you might give me a little credit

                                     peter
                         what for

                                     ellie
                         i proved once and for all that the 
                         limb is mightier than the thumb

                                     peter
                         why didnt you take all your clothes 
                         off you could have stopped forty 
                         cars

                                     ellie
                         we dont need forty cars

               peter glares at her and ellies eyes twinkle mischievously 
               following which we get a wider view which includes the driver 
               of the car danker he is a man of about thirty a heavy 
               set loose chinned person at the moment he is singing an 
               aria from some opera he suddenly stops turning to ellie 
               and peter in the back seat

                                     danker

               bursts forth into song gustily

                                     danker
                              singing

                              completing his last 
                              line
                         turn

               the scene dissolves to the front of a lunch wagon on a 
               deserted road and dankers car drives into the scene and 
               stops then we see danker turning to ellie and peter

                                     danker
                         how about a bite to eat

                                     peter

                         never hungry

                         no

                                     danker
                              singing as he leaves 
                              them
                         young people in love are very seldom 
                         hungry people in love are very seldom 
                         hungry

               when he is out of sight peter glares at ellie

                                     peter
                         what were you going to do gold dig 
                         him for a meal

                              defiantly
                         why not im hungry

                                     peter
                         eat a carrot

                                     ellie
                         never
                              she starts out of 
                              car
                         im going in and ask him 

                                     peter
                              grabbing her arm
                         if you do ill break your neck

               she looks up at his glowering face realizes he means it 
               and wilts under his dominant gaze

                                     peter
                         lets get out and stretch our legs

               peter gets out followed by ellie and they walk away from 
               the car both are silent at the door of the lunch wagon 
               then danker comes out and looks around furtively ellie and 
               peter as seen by him appear walking away following which 
               the view moves over to the ford and drops down to a closeup 
               of peters suitcase now danker looks about quickly and starts 
               toward his car he springs into the car steps on the starter 
               and is off

               ellie and peter hear the motor they wheel around and their 
               eyes widen in surprise

                                     peter
                         hey

               he flings his coat at ellie and dashes after the ford he is 
               then seen running after it when the car turns around a bend 
               in the road peter continues the pursuit this scene wiping 
               off the ford now makes its appearance around the bend and 
               as it approaches peter is seen at the wheel he looks like 
               hes just been through a fight and as peter rides in ellie 
               comes running toward him

                                     ellie
                              a note of great relief 
                              in her voice
                         oh peter what happened are you 
                         all right

                                     peter
                         come on  get in

                                     ellie
                              noticing a gash in 
                              his cheek
                         oh youve been hurt theres a cut 
                         on 

                                     peter
                              impatiently
                         come on come on
                              at this she runs 
                              around to get in the 
                              other side

                                     ellie
                              as she runs
                         what happened

                                     peter
                              as we see them closer
                         just a road thief picks people up 
                         and runs off with their stuff what 
                         a racket
                              by this time she is 
                              in the car

                                     ellie
                         whatd you give him for the car

                                     peter
                         a black eye
                              thereupon the car 
                              moves out of sight

               a close view shows peter and ellie driving along in the ford 
               peter looks ahead uncommunicatively ellie glances up at 
               him and it is plain that somethings on her mind

                                     ellie
                              a little self
                              consciously
                         look  uh  how are the  uh  
                         carrots holding out any left

               peter glances at her he knows what a concession this is on 
               her part and he smiles sympathetically

                                     peter
                              tenderly
                         you dont have to eat the carrots
                              as she looks her 
                              surprise
                         just passed a pond with some ducks 
                         in it

                                     ellie
                              with a cry of joy
                         darling

               she reaches up and kisses his cheek and peter beams happily

                                     peter
                              looking worried
                         havent much gas left in this thing 
                         got to start promoting some
                              throwing her his 
                              coat
                         better take the things out of the 
                         pocket of that coat ought to be 
                         good for ten gallons

               the scene fades out 

               andrews study fades in affording a close view of king 
               westley he answers every description we have had of him he 
               is a stiff handsome stuffedshirt gigolo he sits in a 
               chair leaning on a cane his gloves loosely in his hand 
               the view then moves back to reveal andrews who from the 
               opening of the scene is speaking as he paces around the 
               room

                                     andrews

                                     andrews

                              he starts out

               as andrews opens the door a number of reporters enter

                                     andrews
                         come in boys this is my  uh  
                         this is king westley
                              westley rises
                         he has a statement to make

                                     reporters
                         hello westley how do you do
                              they group around 
                              him

               the scene dissolves to the side of a lonely road at night 
               first there is a closeup of a newspaper headline which 
               reads

               andrews withdraws objection magnate and aviator reconciled 
               everything all right come home darling says westley 
               then the view draws back revealing that the newspaper is in 
               the hands of ellie who sits in the car alone gazing at the 
               headlines then peters voice is heard

                                     peters voice
                         all right brat

               at the sound of his voice she is startled and she quickly 
               folds the paper and throws it out of sight she starts to 
               get out of the car

                                     ellie
                              as she scrambles out 
                              of the car just as 
                              peter comes up to 
                              her
                         any luck

                                     peter
                         yeah he finally agreed to let us 
                         have a room

                                     ellie
                         what about money

                                     peter
                         talked him out of it he thinks were 
                         going to stay a week ill have to 
                         think of something before morning

                                     ellie
                         thats swell

                                     peter

                         me its foolish i told you theres 
                         no sense in our staying here tonight 
                         we could make new york in less than 
                         three hours

                                     ellie
                         i couldnt arrive in new york at 
                         three in the morning everybodys in 
                         bed

                                     peter
                              after a pause
                         okay
                              with a wave of his 
                              hand
                         cottage number three

               as they start toward it the scene cuts to the owners cabin 
               the owner of the auto camp and his wife are standing at 
               window looking out she is a hatchetfaced shrew he is 
               meek and docile

                                     wife
                         there you go  trustin people again 
                         how many times did i tell you 

                                     owner
                         he looked like an upright young feller 
                         to me ma

                                     wife
                         yeah theyre all upright till they 
                         walk out on you

                                     owner
                         said he was gonna stay a week

                                     wife
                         mebbe

                                     owner
                         worst comes to the worst we got his 
                         car for security

                                     wife
                              unconvinced
                         i dont trust him

               the scene cuts to the inside of a cabin not unlike the 
               previous auto camp cabin in which peter and ellie spent a 
               night peters opened suitcase is on a chair over which he 
               leans ellie walks around puffing at a cigarette

                                     peter
                              without looking up
                         well here we are on the last lap

               ellie crosses to the window and stares out moodily peter 
               removes several things from his suitcase and lays them on 
               the bed there is a strained silence between them as both 
               are lost in their own thoughts a close view of peter as he 
               putters abstractedly with the contents of his bag creates 
               the impression that he empties it tonight rather ruefully 
               it somehow spells finis to their adventure

                                     peter
                              strangely
                         tomorrow morning youll be in the 
                         arms of your husband

               ellie seen close turns away from the window and looks at 
               peter she stares this way for a long moment before speaking

                                     ellie
                              in a still small 
                              voice
                         yes youll have a great story wont 
                         you

                                     peter
                              dryly
                         yeah swell

               peter takes the rope out of his bag it is the one used for 
               the walls of jericho previously he lays it aside and then 
               remembering retrieves it for a moment he holds it in his 
               hand speculatively then turning proceeds to tack it up 
               the noise of the tacking attracts ellies attention and 
               ellie again seen close turns and looks toward peter

                                     ellie
                         is that the walls of jericho going 
                         up

                                     peters voice
                         yep the walls of jericho
                              at which she turns 
                              back to the window

               peter also seen close stretches the rope across the room 
               and tacks the other side

                                     peter
                              then reaching for 
                              blanket
                         we certainly outsmarted your father
                              he throws the blanket 
                              over the rope
                         i guess you ought to be happy

               there is no response from her a close view revealing that 
               she quite obviously isnt happy they are now separated by 
               the blanket and peter gets her pajamas from his suitcase 
               and throws them over the blanket

                                     ellie
                         thank you
                              there is silence 
                              while peter starts 
                              undressing  suddenly

                                     peter
                              laconically
                         nope

                                     ellie
                         why not

               peter glances up at the walls of jericho and after a 
               speculative pause speaks quietly

                                     peter
                         i dont make it a policy to run around 
                         with married women

               a closeup of ellie disclosing only her neck and shoulders 
               shows her slipping out of her clothes she pauses  then 
               looks up

                                     ellie
                         no harm in your coming to see us

                                     peters voice
                         not interested
                              at this ellies face 
                              falls this is a 
                              definite rebuff

                                     ellie
                              weakly

               peter seen close is now getting into his pajamas

                                     peter

                              his mouth screws up 
                              bitterly
                         thats what you wanted wasnt it

               ellie is already in bed staring up at the ceiling

                                     ellie
                         peter have you ever been in love

               peter crawls into bed

                                     peter
                         i probably did the world a great 
                         favor at that got two pinheads out 
                         of circulation
                              he reaches over and 
                              lights a cigarette
                         cupid thinks hes doing something 
                         when he brings two lovers together

                         out a shingle

               the view now widens to include both sides of the blanket 
               ellie doesnt hear a word of peters attack she is too intent 
               on her own thoughts

                                     ellie
                         havent you ever wanted to fall in

                                     ellie

                         all seems to me you could make some 
                         girl wonderfully happy

                                     peter
                              disdainfully
                         maybe
                              after a pause
                         sure  sure ive thought about it 
                         who hasnt if i ever met the right 
                         sort of a girl id 
                              interrupting himself

                         her  somebody thats real  
                         somebody thats alive they dont 
                         come that way any more

               ellies disappointment is apparent

                                     peter
                              seen close
                         ive even been sucker enough to make 
                         plans
                              a long puff on his 
                              cigarette
                         i saw an island in the pacific once 
                         never been able to forget it thats 
                         where id like to take her but shed 
                         have to be the sort of a girl thatd 
                         jump in the surf with me on moonlight 
                         nights  and love it as much as i 
                         did
                              he loses himself in 
                              his romantic 
                              contemplations
                         you know those nights when you and 
                         the moon and the water all become 
                         one  when something comes over you  
                         and you feel that youre part of 
                         something big and marvelous
                              sighing
                         those are the only places to live 
                         where the stars are so close over 
                         your head that you feel you could 
                         reach right up and stir them around

               a closeup of ellie at this point shows that she is affected 
               by his stirring description of a heaven  from which she is 
               excluded as she listens to him continuing

                                     peters voice
                         certainly ive been thinking about 
                         it boy if i could ever find a girl 
                         whos hungry for those things 

               peter again seen close has disposed of his cigarette and 
               now stares dreamily heavenward

                                     peter
                         im going to swim in the surf with 
                         her  im going to reach up and 
                         grab stars for her  im going to 
                         laugh with her  and cry with her 
                         im going to kiss her wet lips  
                         and 

               suddenly stopping he turns his head slowly sensing ellies 
               nearness and the view drawing back to include ellie shows 
               her standing at his bedside looking down at him yearningly

               then we see them close together peters face is immobile 
               ellie drops to her knees

                                     ellie
                              fervently
                         take me with you peter take me to 
                         your island i want to do all those 
                         things you talked about

               peter stares at her lovely face his heart cries out with an 
               impulse to crush her in his arms

                                     peter
                              after a long pause 
                              hoarsely
                         better go back to your bed

                                     ellie
                              simply
                         i love you

                                     peter
                              arguing with himself
                         youre forgetting youre married

                                     ellie
                              tensely
                         i dont care i love you nothing 
                         else matters we can run away 
                         everythingll take care of itself
                              begging
                         please peter you cant go out of 
                         my life now i couldnt live without 
                         you
                              in a choked voice
                         oh peter 

               sobbing she lays her head on his breast and throws her arms 
               around him all is quiet for a moment as ellies head rests 
               on his breast while peter struggles with an overwhelming 
               urge to pour out his heart to her

                                     peter
                              scarcely audible
                         better go back to your bed

               there is a lengthy pause neither of them stirs then ellie 
               slowly raises her tearstained face and gets to her feet

                                     ellie
                              whispering
                         im sorry

               she turns and disappears behind the blanket peter remains 
               motionless then a close view shows ellie as she gets into 
               bed sobbing quietly she hides her face in the pillow to 
               suppress her sobs it is the first time in her life that she 
               has been so deeply hurt a close view next shows peter 
               reaching over for a cigarette which he lights all his 
               movements are thoughtful meditative he leans back and stares 
               at the ceiling until we see only the cigarette in his mouth 
               as it emits slowly rising puffs of smoke this dissolving 
               the cigarette is seen to be burnt three quarters down a 
               long frail ash hanging perilously on peter is then seen as 
               he removes the cigarette from his mouth and crushes it in a 
               tray he leans back on the pillow and for a moment he is 
               quiet then glancing over in ellies direction he calls to 
               her

                                     peter
                              softly calling
                         hey brat 
                              a pause
                         did you mean that would you really 
                         go
                              he waits for a 
                              response but none 
                              comes he tries again
                         hey brat 

               he listens  all is quiet he slips his covers off and 
               crosses to the blanket and peers over it she is asleep 
               her tearstained face rests on the pillow her arm extends 
               over her head it is a childlike posture

               peter is watching her tenderly he speculates whether to 
               awaken her and decides against it he starts away peter 
               tiptoes around the room for a few moments deep in thought 
               then as an idea which he has been turning over in his mind 
               begins to take form he hastily begins dressing

               the scene dissolving peter is seen completely clothed and 
               starting for the door when he thinks of something he turns 
               back grabs his suitcase stops to throw a kiss to ellie 
               and goes out into the night thereupon the scene wipes off 
               disclosing a gas station along the road at night here peter 
               is talking to a station attendant

                                     peter
                         all im asking is enough gas to get 
                         me to new york the bags worth twenty
                         five dollars

                                     man
                              hesitatingly
                         yeah but i got a bag my wife gave 
                         me one for christmas

                                     peter
                              highpressuring 
                              him

                         and give you ten dollars profit 
                         what do you say

                                     man
                              looking at peters 
                              hat
                         i aint got a hat 

                                     peter
                         what

                                     man
                         i aint got a hat

                                     peter
                              promptly putting it 
                              on his head
                         well you got one now  come on 
                         fill er up

               while he is still talking the scene dissolves to a view of 
               peter driving furiously a broad happy grin on his face 
               following which several scenes wipe off in succession 
               denoting the passage of time  scenes of peter driving at 
               high speed causing several cows to amble out of the way of 
               the car driving into the holland tunnel and of the back 
               room of a speakeasy where peter stands in front of a small 
               desk upon which there is a typewriter near him is a swarthy 
               italian

                                     peter
                         fine thats fine tony now get me 
                         a drink and make sure nobody disturbs 
                         me for half an hour

                                     italian
                              going out
                         sure sure pete

               as peter plants himself in front of the machine the scene 
               dissolves to a closeup of the typewriter carriage upon which 
               are typed the words

                and thats the full and exclusive story of ellen andrews 
               adventures on the road as soon as her marriage to king 
               westley is annulled she and peter warne famous newspaperman  
               and undoubtedly the most promising young novelist of the 
               present era  will be married 

               the view drawing back peter rereads the last sentence 
               smiles contentedly and as he yanks out the sheet the scene

                              running after gordon 
                              as the latter starts

               gordon is affected by the sincere note in peters voice

                                     peter

                         a cent in the world can he

               while peter has been speaking gordon stares into space 
               thoughtfully

                                     gordon
                         what a story
                              picturing it
                         on her way to join her husband ellen 
                         andrews falls in love with 
                              alert  grabbing 
                              paper out of peters 
                              hand
                         lemme see that a minute

               he moves to his desk excitedly and peter a gleam of hope 
               in his eyes joins him following which the scene cuts to 
               the shack of the camp owner and wife in the early morning 
               the owner is suddenly startled out of his sleep by the voice 
               of his wife calling zeke zeke he looks up just as she 
               rushes into the room

                                     wife
                         i told you i told you you couldnt 
                         trust him hes gone

                         took that magnesia

                         come on get up dont lay there 
                         lets do something about it

               thereupon the scene cuts to the auto camp cabin affording a 
               close view of ellie tossing restlessly in her sleep suddenly 
               there is a loud banging on the door and ellie startled 
               awakens the pounding continuing ellie looks around 
               frightened the door suddenly bursts open and the owner and 
               wife enter they both glance over at peters side

                                     wife
                         see that theyre gone

                                     owner

                         looks like it dont it
                              suddenly he sees

                              glaring at ellie
                         oh

                                     ellie
                              in a close view at 
                              ellies bed as the 
                              owner and his wife 
                              come up to her 
                              timidly  sitting 
                              up

                              bewildered
                         why hell be back

                                     wife

                         took his suitcase and everything
                              ellie is perceptibly 
                              startled by this 
                              piece of news

               there is a close view of ellie as the wifes voice continues 
               uninterruptedly

                                     wifes voice
                         could tell she was a hussy just 
                         from the looks of her

               ellie is lost in thought trying to adjust herself to the 
               idea of peters leaving her like this she scarcely hears 
               what is being said

                                     owners voice
                         hey you got any money

                                     ellie
                              snapping out of her 
                              trance
                         why  no

               as zeke leaves the wife plunks herself in a chair grimly 
               determined to wait until ellie gets dressed and out

                                     ellie

                         sheriffs office

               the scene thereupon cuts to the exterior of the auto cabin 
               as ellie emerges the wife standing in the doorway in the 
               foreground several people are scattered around the courtyard 
               one woman washes stockings under a pump a man is changing 
               the tire on his car ellie comes down the steps and crosses 
               the courtyard

                                     wife
                              shouting to her

                         away from here i run a respectable 
                         place

               ellie does not turn but walks straight forward trying to 
               maintain her poise the people in the courtyard turn to stare 
               at her and one of them snickers

               the scene dissolves to gordons office as peter is pocketing 
               the money gordon is fondling the story

                                     peter

                              waving the story

                              he drops the story 
                              on the desk and 
                              escorts peter out 
                              his arm around his 
                              shoulder

                         in the business

               they reach the door which peter opens then they appear at 
               the doorway through the open door the secretary stares 
               dumbfounded at their friendliness

                                     gordon
                         slong kid and good luck

               outside gordons office peter kisses the secretary as he 
               passes through

                                     peter

                              he goes out

               gordon is immediately electrified into action

                                     gordon

               in his office

               during his speech his other phone has been ringing 
               persistently he has ignored it until now he picks up 
               receiver

                                     gordon

                              and turns back to

                              rings impatiently 
                              but gordon ignores 
                              it
                         with king westley in it hes waiting

                              the second phone 
                              speaking into it 
                              impatiently
                         yeah yeah what is it

               a close view of gordon as he listens shows his eyes widening 
               with amazement

                                     gordon
                         what  ellen andrews youre crazy

               this cuts to a telephone booth where a reporter is seen 
               speaking excitedly

                                     reporter

                         made up she phoned in

               back in gordons office gordon is seen still at the phone

                              receiver and grabs 
                              the first phone

                         nervous breakdown

                              dumbly as he speaks 
                              into the phone

                         pinched

               he picks up peters story and flings it viciously into the 
               wastebasket

                                     agnes

                              leaving
                         yessir

               gordon goes to his desk mumbling to himself his eye lights 
               on the waste basket containing peters story and he is about 
               to kick it when he stops he stares at it thoughtfully 
               reaches down lifts it out  runs through it hastily  and 
               then stares into space deep in thought

               the scene dissolves to an open road in the morning as peter 
               flies over it in his ford he beams happily he passes a 
               gasoline truck and waves cheerily to the driver this 
               dissolves to a closeup of an auto siren accompanied by a 
               prolonged wail then to a road that morning as four 
               motorcycles two abreast speed forward followed by a 
               luxurious limousine which in turn is trailed by a car filled 
               with reporters next in the limousine andrews is seen in 
               the back seat he is accompanied by king westley  henderson  
               lovington and a police inspector

                                     henderson
                         i knew she was safe

                                     lovington
                              sighing
                         certainly gave us a run for our money
                              but andrews is too 
                              overwhelmed with joy 
                              to listen to any of 
                              this

                                     andrews
                              anxiously
                         cant you get them to go any faster
                              at this the inspector 
                              leans over to talk 
                              to chauffeur

               this dissolves to a deserted road peter at the wheel of his 
               car his high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing

                                     peter
                              singing
                         i found a million dollar baby 

               he is interrupted by the song of a meadowlark whistling its 
               strange melody peter listens to it a second time then 
               answers its call by imitating it the meadowlark whistles 
               again and peter is highly amused

                                     peter
                              waving his hand  
                              to the meadowlark
                         okay pal be seein you

               just then the sound of sirens is heard in the distance peter 
               glances back and as the sirens come nearer he pulls over 
               to the side of the road there follows a full view of the 
               road with peter in the foreground at the side as the police 
               cavalcade whizzes by accompanied by the shrieking sirens 
               thereupon peter seen close gets an idea

                                     peter
                              to his ford
                         come on dobbin old boy we got a 
                         police escort

               he applies the gas and shoots out of sight following which 
               a full view of the road shows peters car trying to catch up 
               with the parade it outdistances him however and we see 
               peter in the ford pressing his body forward to help the car 
               make time his foot pushes the accelerator down to the floor 
               but the police cars are now out of sight and peter gives 
               up

                                     peter
                              seen close to the 
                              car  with 
                              exaggerated dramatics

                         afraid youre gittin old

               thereupon the scene dissolves to a small town road where at 
               the door of a sheriffs office a policeman is standing on 
               guard the reporters hang around in front of him several 
               yokels look on the limousine and motor cycles are at the 
               curb and now in a closer view at the door the policeman 
               on guard steps aside as the door opens and ellie her father 
               and king westley emerge king has his arm around her the 
               moment they appear in the doorway cameras click and several 
               reporters surround them

                                     reporters
                         will you make a statement miss 
                         andrews was it an exciting 
                         experience how did you travel

                                     andrews
                              brushing them aside
                         later boys later see her at home

               they cross the sidewalk  to the waiting limousine as 
               cameras click

               the scene dissolves to a road with peter still driving he 
               is however as before in excellent form and is singing 
               lustily suddenly however his eyes widen and he pulls on 
               his brake the car screeches and moans  and comes to a 
               stop

                                     peter
                         take it easy dobbin remember your 
                         blood pressure

               we find peter directly in front of a slow moving freight 
               train several hoboes stick their heads out of a car and 
               peter waves to them the hoboes look puzzled for a minute 
               and then wave back the view then swings over to an opening 
               between the cars affording a flash of the police parade on 
               the other side apparently on its way back

               peter amuses himself by talking to an old flagman

                                     peter
                         better get that toy train out of 
                         here im in a hurry

               the flagman grins at him in reply by this time the last car 
               is in sight and peter gets all set to move he stops 
               however to wave to a couple of brakemen on the rear platform

               in the meantime the motorcycles have started forward and 
               the sirens begin their low moaning wail peter attracted 
               turns and over peters shoulder we see the parade starting 
               as the limousine passes we get a glimpse of the inside 
               ellie lies back on king westleys shoulder he has his arm 
               around her as they pass out of sight thereupon a close view 
               of peter shows him reacting to what he saw he turns his 
               head quickly to stare at the disappearing car a look of 
               astonishment and bewilderment in his eyes slowly he turns 
               his head forward staring ahead of him blankly he cant 
               quite make it out then gradually the significance of it all 
               strikes him  and his mouth curls up bitterly

               the scene wiping off a series of newspaper headlines come 
               into view

                              ellen andrews returns home

                        marriage halted by father to be resumed

                    ellen andrews and aviator to have church wedding

                                  love triumphs again

                     parental objection removed in favor of lovers

                               glad to be home says ellen

               this dissolves to the anteroom of a newspaper office the 
               place is alive with activity and copies of newspapers are 
               lying around bearing headlines relating to the andrews story 
               peter a bewildered stunned expression on his face enters 
               and crosses funereally toward gordons office several people 
               standing around look up

                                     people

                         what a dame

               peter pays no attention to any of this he reaches gordons 
               door which is open he walks directly past agnes and enters 
               the office she looks up at him puzzled then in gordons 
               office peter walks to gordons desk and lays the roll of 
               bills on it agnes enters watching him anxiously

                                     agnes
                         gordons out back some place
                              seeing the money 
                              she looks up 
                              surprised

                                     peter
                         see that he gets that will you 
                         agnes tell him i was just kidding
                              he goes out

               as agnes stares after him puzzled gordon dashes in from a 
               back door

                                     gordon

                                     gordon

                                     gordon
                              looking at the money
                         where is he

               the scene cuts to the outer office and corridor as seen 
               over gordons shoulder through the open door peter is seen 
               walking out gordon hurries after him

                                     gordons voice
                         hey pete

               at the sound of gordons voice peter turns and gordon comes 
               over to him

                                     peter

                         thanks joe

               he leaves gordon watching him sympathetically and the scene 
               fades out

               the lawn of the andrews estate fades in it is morning and 
               at the moment the place is a beehive of activity dozens of 
               butlers and maids hustle around setting tables floral 
               decorations are being hung by men on ladders in the 
               background on a platform a twentypiece orchestra is getting 
               ready accompanied by the scraping of chairs adjusting of 
               music stands unpacking of instruments

               the scene cuts to andrews study king westley is seated 
               and andrews walks around him they are both dressed in striped 
               trousers frock coat etc

                                     andrews

                         properly
                              he waves toward the 
                              window
                         with all the fanfare and everything

                         charge

               a close view of andrews shows him looking around his study 
               despairingly

                                     andrews

               a close view of king shows him looking up surprised as

               he withdraws his hand which he looks at disgustedly  the 
               result of a jellyfish handshake

                                     king

                         of a great stunt for the reception
                              as andrews looks at 
                              him quizzically
                         im going to land on the lawn in an 
                         autogyro what do you think of that

               a close view of andrews shows him staring off at king in 
               complete disgust

                                     andrews
                         you thought that up all by yourself 
                         huh

                              unabashed
                         why itll make all the front pages 
                         a spectacular thing like that 

                                     andrews

                         but go ahead have a good time as 
                         long as ellie doesnt object

                                     king
                         oh no shell be crazy about it 
                         well see you later im going out 
                         on the lawn and arrange for landing 
                         space
                              holding out his hand
                         goodbye
                              but andrews turns 
                              his back on him

                                     andrews
                         weve done that already

                              smiling
                         yes of course

               he turns and leaves andrews watching him go shaking his 
               head sadly

                                     andrews
                         autogyro i hope he breaks his leg

               andrews starts out and the scene cuts to the hallway as 
               andrews enters from the study a maid coming down the stairs 
               he calls to her

                                     andrews
                         oh  mary 

                                     mary

                                     andrews
                         how is she

                                     mary
                              hesitantly
                         why  uh  shes all right sir

                                     andrews

                                     mary
                         oh no sir no different than 

                                     andrews

                         huh

                                     mary

                         she sent me for a drink
                              she leaves

               andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the 
               stairs following which the scene dissolves to the upstairs 
               corridor in front of ellies door andrews enters and knocks 
               several times receiving no response he gingerly opens the 
               door

               next andrews enters ellies bedroom and looks around the 
               view swings around the room following his gaze it focuses 
               on ellie who reclines on a sofa in her bridal outfit her 
               head resting on the back she stares moodily unhappily up 
               at the ceiling the view then expanding to include both father 
               and daughter andrews is seen staring at her a moment 
               sympathetically he senses something is wrong

                                     andrews
                              after a pause
                         ellie 

                                     ellie
                              jumping up with a 
                              start
                         oh hello dad

                                     andrews
                              a close view as he 
                              goes over to her
                         i knocked several times

                                     ellie
                         sorry must have been daydreaming
                              to hide her confusion 
                              she reaches for a 
                              cigarette

                                     andrews
                              with forced lightness
                         well everythings set creating 
                         quite a furor too great stunt kings 
                         going to pull

                                     ellie
                              in a faraway voice
                         stunt

                                     andrews
                         landing on the lawn in an autogyro

                                     ellie
                         oh yes i heard

                                     andrews
                              noting her 
                              listlessness
                         yes personally i think its silly 
                         too

               as he continues talking the view moves with ellie who 
               wanders over to a window overlooking the lawn and stares 
               out lost in thought

                                     andrews voice
                              he goes over the

                              turning and looking 
                              at him blankly

                                     andrews

                              table and crushes 
                              her cigarette

                                     andrews

                         find you
                              smiling feebly  
                              meaning his heart
                         you know the old pump isnt what it 
                         used to be

                                     ellie
                              her hand on his arm
                         sorry dad i wouldnt hurt you for 
                         the world you know that

               she moves away from him and sits on the sofa and andrews 
               watches her a moment and crosses over to her he sits beside 
               her placing an arm affectionately around her shoulder

                                     andrews
                              tenderly
                         ellie  what is it arent you happy 
                         child

               at this point she finally breaks and impulsively buries her 
               face on his breast

                                     andrews
                              after a pause 
                              hoarsely
                         i thought so i knew there was 
                         something on your mind
                              there are audible 
                              sobs from ellie
                         there  there

               they remain thus quietly for some time finally andrews breaks 
               the silence

                                     andrews
                         what is it darling
                              receiving no answer
                         you havent fallen in love with 
                         somebody else have you

               as this brings an audible sob from ellie andrews lifts up 
               her chin

                                     andrews
                              looking into her 
                              eyes
                         have you
                              ellie turns her head 
                              away a little ashamed 
                              of her tears

               ellie now rises and walks miserably away from him dabbing 
               her eyes andrews watching her realizes he has hit upon 
               the truth he walks over to her

                                     andrews

                                     andrews

                         since i can remember

               a closeup of andrews shows him watching ellie as her voice 
               continues

                                     ellies voice

                         loathsome i cant walk out on king 
                         now itll make us all look so 
                         ridiculous
                              she shrugs resignedly
                         besides what difference does it 
                         make
                              inaudibly
                         ill never see peter again

                                     andrews
                         is that his name

                                     ellie
                         yes peter warne

               she starts to walk away when she is attracted by her fathers 
               surprise at the mention of the name

                                     andrews
                         peter warne
                              his hand has 
                              instinctively gone 
                              to his inside pocket

                                     ellie
                              noticing this
                         why do you know him
                              but andrews withdraws 
                              his hand apparently 
                              he has changed his 
                              mind

                                     andrews
                              evasively
                         oh no  no

                                     ellie
                              suddenly anxious
                         you havent heard from him have 
                         you dad

                                     andrews
                              obviously guilty
                         why no dont be silly

                                     ellie
                         oh please dad 

               she has reached into his pocket and has extracted a letter 
               which she hurriedly opens and reads following which we see 
               a letter in peters handwriting it is addressed to 
               alexander andrews 11 wall street it reads

               dear sir i should like to have a talk with you about a 
               financial matter in connection with your daughter peter 
               warne

               ellie is then seen reading and rereading the note her face 
               clouds and then slowly changes to an expression of complete 
               disillusionment

                                     ellie
                              her voice strident
                         looks like that was his only interest 
                         in me the reward

                                     andrews
                              taking the note from 
                              her

                                     ellie

                                     andrews

                                     ellie

                         me thoroughly entertained its worth 
                         every penny he gets

               she paces agitatedly andrews watching her silently he knows 
               what an awful blow to her pride this must be mary now enters 
               with a cocktail tray which she sets on the table

                                     ellie

                         need
                              she pours herself a 
                              cocktail

                                     mary

                              mumbling

                              he goes out behind 
                              mary

               ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another 
               as king enters

                                     ellie
                              upon seeing him
                         well if it isnt the groom himself 
                         youre just in time king

               a close view of the two shows king taking her in his arms

                                     king
                         how are you ellie
                              he gives her a kiss 
                              which she accepts 
                              perfunctorily  but 
                              he insists upon being 
                              ardent

                              she drains the glass 
                              pouring another as

                         come on king youre lagging
                              they both drink

               in andrews study andrews walks around the room perceptibly 
               affected by his visit with ellie he keeps turning peters 
               letter over in his hand apparently debating in his mind 
               what to do with it he finally gets an idea  and 
               determinedly crosses to the phone then the scene cuts to a 
               hotel room first there is a closeup of a newspaper  a 
               tabloid bearing a heading which reads love triumphant

               interrupted romance of ellen andrews and king westley 
               resumed as father yields wedding reception to be held on 
               andrews lawn

               below this is a page of pictures and the view turns to each 
               photograph the first picture is of ellie and king on a beach 
               the title over the picture reads where they met the second 
               picture shows them in the cockpit of a plane the heading 
               reading where they romanced the next picture is of a 
               small frame house with a shingle on it reading justice of 
               the peace over the photograph is a caption where they 
               were married the next picture is of the andrews yacht and 
               the title reads where she was taken finally the view 
               moves down to the bottom of the page to a picture of ellie 
               and king with her father between them in front of sheriffs 
               office caption reads where love triumphed over these 
               pictures the phone bell has been ringing

               and now peter is seen staring expressionless at the 
               newspaper suddenly he becomes conscious of the phone ringing 
               he looks up  then goes to it

                                     peter
                              into the phone

                         cant i see you at your office

               the scene cuts to andrews study affording a close view of 
               andrews at the phone

                         youd like to get this thing settled

               this cuts to the hotel room where peter is at the phone

                                     peter
                         yeah but i dont like the idea of

                         between you and me  those things 
                         give me a stiff pain

                                     andrews
                              seen in his office

                         to 

               his eyes fall on something and there follows a close view 
               of a tabloid newspaper featuring the heading love 
               triumphant and containing the pictures of ellie and king 
               the view then moves down to feature headline reading groom 
               to land on brides lawn

               king westley plans to drop in an autogyro on the lawn of 
               andrews estate peters mouth screws up disdainfully

                                     peter
                              into the phone

                         come over id like to get a load of 
                         that threering circus youre pulling 
                         i want to see what love looks like 
                         when its triumphant i havent had 
                         a good laugh in a week
                              he is still at the 
                              phone as the scene 
                              dissolves

               then the lawn of the andrews estate dissolves in it is now 
               filled with guests who wander around chattering gaily the 
               orchestra plays a captain of waiters in the foreground 
               instructs his men

                                     captain
                         i want everything to be just so 
                         when the ceremony starts you stand 
                         on the side  still no moving around  
                         no talking comprenez

               the view cuts to a roadway leading to the estate and peter 
               is seen driving up in his ford and squeezing in between two 
               rollsroyces the uniformed chauffeurs glare at him but 
               peter springs nonchalantly out of his car

                                     peter
                              blithely as he passes 
                              them
                         keep your eye on my car when youre 
                         backing up you guys

               and as he goes the chauffeurs look at each other surprised 
               the scene dissolves to andrews study where a butler stands 
               in front of andrews who is seated at his desk

                                     andrews
                         show him in

               the butler leaving a close view shows andrews reaching over 
               and snapping on a dictograph concealed somewhere on his desk 
               the office coming into view again we see andrews rising and 
               awaiting peters entrance after a moment peter comes in 
               removes his soft felt hat and tucks it under his arm

                                     andrews
                         mr warne

                                     peter
                         yeah

                                     andrews
                         come in sit down

               peter advances into the room looking around curiously his 
               air is frigid contemptuous as andrews studies him and he 
               makes no move to sit andrews waves to a chair and sits down 
               himself peter flops into the nearest chair

                                     andrews
                              seen close with peter 
                              after a pause
                         i was surprised to get your note my 
                         daughter hadnt told me anything 
                         about you about your helping her

                                     peter
                         thats typical of your daughter 
                         takes those things for granted
                              too restless to sit 
                              he jumps up
                         why does she think i lugged her all 
                         the way from miami 
                              vehemently
                         for the love of it

                                     andrews
                         please understand me when i say she 
                         didnt tell me anything about it i 
                         mean not until a little while ago 
                         she thinks youre entitled to anything 
                         you can get

                                     peter
                              bitterly

                         of her you dont i suppose

                                     peter
                              seen close now
                         if i didnt i wouldnt be here
                              he reaches into his 
                              pocket
                         ive got it all itemized
                              and he throws the 
                              paper on andrews 
                              desk

               andrews picks up the paper and glances at it

                                     peter
                              now seen closer with 
                              andrews

                                     peter
                              sharply
                         who said anything about a reward

                                     andrews
                              smiling
                         im afraid im a little confused 
                         you see i assumed you were coming 
                         here for 

                                     peter
                              impatiently
                         all i want is thirtynine sixty if 
                         youll give me a check ill get out 
                         of this place it gives me the 
                         jitters

                                     andrews
                         youre a peculiar chap

                                     peter
                              irritably
                         well go into that some other time

                                     andrews
                         the average man would go after the 
                         reward all you seem to 

                                     peter
                         listen did anybody ever make a sucker 
                         out of you this is a matter of 
                         principle something you probably 
                         wouldnt understand
                              he burns at the 
                              thought
                         when somebody takes me for a buggy 
                         ride i dont like the idea of having 
                         to pay for the privilege

                                     andrews
                         you were taken for a buggy ride

                                     peter
                         yeah  with all the trimmings now 
                         how about the check do i get it

               a closeup indicates that andrews has been studying peter 
               throughout the scene he is now completely won over

                                     andrews
                              smiling
                         certainly
                              he opens a checkbook 
                              and writes it out

               while andrews writes peter wanders around the room in an 
               attitude of bitter contempt andrews rises and goes to him

                                     andrews
                         here you are
                              as peter takes the 
                              check
                         do you mind if i ask you something 
                         frankly
                              peter just looks at 
                              him without responding
                         do you love my daughter

                                     peter
                              evasively while 
                              folding the check
                         a guy thatd fall in love with your 
                         daughter should have his head 
                         examined

                                     andrews
                         thats an evasion

                                     peter
                              putting the check 
                              into a wallet
                         she grabbed herself a perfect running 
                         mate king westley the pill of the 
                         century
                              pocketing wallet
                         what she needs is a guy thatd take 
                         a sock at her every day  whether 
                         its coming to her or not

               a close view of the two shows andrews smiling here is a 
               man

                                     peter
                         if you had half the brains youre 
                         supposed to have youd have done it 
                         yourself  long ago

                                     andrews
                         do you love her

                                     peter
                              going for his hat as 
                              he replies
                         a normal human being couldnt live 
                         under the same roof with her without 
                         going nuts
                              going to the door
                         shes my idea of nothing

                                     andrews
                         i asked you a question do you love 
                         her

                                     peter
                              snapping it out
                         yes
                              as andrews smiles
                         but dont hold that against me im 
                         a little screwy myself

               he snaps the door open and goes out following which andrews 
               is seen watching the door his eyes twinkling and the scene 
               cuts to the downstairs hallway as peter comes through moving 
               on to the front door but just as he reaches it ellie enters 
               accompanied by half a dozen men and holding a cocktail in 
               her hand they see each other almost simultaneously and 
               both stop glaring

                                     peter
                              looking her over 
                              contemptuously
                         perfect now you look natural

               at this ellie leaves her group and comes toward peter and a 
               close view shows them together glaring at each other

                                     ellie
                              icily

                                     peter

                                     ellie

                                     peter
                         same to you

                                     ellie

                         fun youll enjoy it immensely

                                     peter
                         i would but ive got a weak stomach

               he wheels around and goes through the door ellie looking 
               after him her eyes blazing the drone of a plane motor 
               outside is heard and several people rush down the stairs 
               all excited

                                     guests
                         here comes king hes just coming 
                         down hurry up everybody come on 
                         ellie

               immediately there is a general excitement as guests hurry 
               through the hallway on the way to the lawn but ellen does 
               not move  she remains staring blankly at the door through 
               which peter went until andrews enters from his study

                                     andrews
                         i just had a long talk with him

                                     ellen
                              her voice breaking
                         im not interested

                                     andrews
                         now wait a minute ellie 

                                     ellie
                              sharply
                         i dont want to hear anything about 
                         him

               she walks away from him and andrews frustrated looks at 
               her helplessly thereupon the scene dissolves to a full view 
               of the lawn the orchestra is playing mendelssohns wedding 
               march the lawn is crowded with guests in the background we 
               see the autogyro idling a closer view shows a small platform 
               serving as an altar over it there is an arbor of roses 
               back of the altar stands a minister ready a reverse view 
               reveals a long narrow carpeted pathway leading to the house 
               both sides are lined with guests who are murmuring excitedly 
               at the moment king westley and his best man are marching 
               solemnly toward the altar back of the altar we see a high 
               platform upon which are several newsreel men who are grinding 
               their cameras

               the guests of whom close glimpses are caught are now peering 
               over each others shoulders king and his best man have 
               reached the altar and the music of the wedding march comes 
               to a stop the orchestra leader is looking around apparently 
               waiting for a signal at the door of the house a very prissy 
               middleaged man waves his handkerchief and nods his head to 
               the orchestra leader the orchestra leader acknowledges the 
               signal by nodding his head  turns to his men  waves his 
               baton and the orchestra starts playing here comes the 
               bride  the guests whisper to each other excitedly a 
               great deal of stirring takes place

               the door of the house slowly opens  and a parade of small 
               flower girls emerges they march taking each step carefully 
               while they strew flowers along the path they are well out 
               of the way when ellie on the arm of her father appears in 
               the doorway a view of the guests shows that they cannot 
               contain themselves murmurs of here she comes and doesnt 
               she look beautiful are heard the newsreel men on their 
               platform behind the altar bestir themselves this is what 
               theyve been waiting for

               ellie and her father seen close now make their way to the 
               altar ellies face is solemn and her jaws set

                                     andrews
                              whispering out of 
                              the side of his mouth
                         youre a sucker to go through with 
                         this

               ellie glances at him out of the corner of her eye  and 
               quickly turns forward again

                                     andrews
                         that guy warne is ok he didnt 
                         want the reward

               ellie keeps her eyes glued in front of her remaining 
               expressionless

                                     andrews
                         all he asked for was thirtynine 
                         dollars and sixty cents thats 
                         what he spent on you it was a matter 
                         of principle with him  says you 
                         took him for a ride

               this registers on ellie and she raises her eyes  but her 
               reaction is only slightly perceptible

               a close view of a group of guests shows two girls looking 
               enviously in the direction of the bride

                                     a young girl
                              whispering
                         i wish i were in her shoes

                                     second girl
                         yes she certainly is lucky

               ellie and her father are seen again and andrews is still 
               whispering to her

                                     andrews
                         he loves you ellie told me so

               this brings a definite reaction which she quickly covers 
               up

                                     andrews
                         you dont want to be married to a 
                         mug like westley

               at this there is a close view of westley  there is a 
               satisfied smirk on his face

                                     andrews
                         i can buy him off for a pot of gold 
                         and you can make an old man happy 
                         and you wouldnt do so bad for 
                         yourself if you change your mind 
                         your cars waiting at the back gate

               ellie gives no indication of her intentions her face remains 
               immobile and now ellie and her father have reached the altar 
               the prissy man is placing them in position the big moment 
               has arrived the guests are all atwitter but a close view 
               of ellie shows that she realizes that her fate is closing in 
               on her she looks around for a means of escape

                                     minister
                              starting the ceremony
                         dearly beloved we are gathered 
                         together here in the sight of god 
                         and in the face of this company to 
                         join together this man and this woman 
                         in holy matrimony if any man can 
                         show just cause why they may not 
                         lawfully be joined together let him 
                         speak now or else hereafter forever 
                         hold his peace king wilt thou have 
                         this woman to be thy wedded wife so 
                         long as ye both shall live

                                     king
                         i will

                                     minister
                         ellen wilt thou have this man to be 
                         thy wedded husband so long as ye 
                         both shall live

               then seen at the altar ellie makes her decision she reaches 
               down takes a firm hold on her train and pushing several 
               people aside runs out of the scene those at the altar look 
               up surprised and the most startled of all is king himself

                                     king
                              calling after her
                         ellie

               he starts to go after her  but finds andrews in his way 
               while the outcries of the guests rise in chorus

                                     guests
                         whats happened wheres she going

               on the platform the newsreel men a look of astonishment on 
               their faces decide to follow ellie

                                     a man
                         get her mac shes ducking

               and as viewed by the newsreel men ellie is seen in the 
               distance dashing through the gates the guests stare 
               dumbfounded following this andrews and king are seen 
               together in the crowd

                                     king
                              helplessly
                         what happened

                                     andrews
                              blandly
                         i havent the slightest idea

               but his mouth twitches as he tries to keep from smiling as 
               king runs out of sight andrews gets out a cigar and lights 
               it  a happy smile on his face which he now doesnt try to 
               conceal

               outside the front gate ellie is seen in a fast roadster as 
               she starts away with a plunge her eyes sparkle a crowd of 
               people dash up headed by king they stop dead when they see 
               the car disappear on the lawn the commotion runs high and 
               the guests chatter their amazement a close view of andrews 
               shows him smiling with satisfaction

               the scene dissolves to andrews office where andrews is 
               regaling himself with a whiskey and soda he is in a 
               pleasantly inebriated mood when his secretary enters

                                     andrews
                              as he picks up the 
                              phone that has started 
                              ringing
                         dont want to talk to  dont want 
                         to talk to anybody dont want to 
                         see anybody

                                     secretary
                         but its king westley on the phone

                                     andrews
                         ooooooh

                         complaining it was dirt cheap
                              as he hangs up
                         dont fall out of any windows

                                     secretary
                              placing a telegram 
                              on the desk

                                     andrews
                              reading it

                         say let em topple

               this dissolves to the exterior of an auto camp very much 
               like the other camps at which peter and ellie stayed the 
               owners wife is talking to her husband

                                     wife

                         i dunno

               the scene moves to the cabin occupied presumably by peter 
               and ellie the windows are lighted there is a blast from a 
               trumpet and as the lights go out a blanket is seen dropping 
               to the floor and the scene fades out

                                         the end
