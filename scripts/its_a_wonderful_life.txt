etc prominently seated among them is henry f potter his goon 
beside his wheelchair
uncle billy and george are seated among the directors the 
chairman of the board is dr campbell they have folders and 
papers before them on which
they have been reporting before each of the directors there are 
individual reports for them to study

dr campbell
i think thats all well need you for george i know youre 
anxious to make a train

george rising
i have a taxi waiting downstairs

dr campbell
i want the board to know that george gave up his trip to europe 
to help straighten things out here these past few months good 
luck to you at
school george

george
thanks

dr campbell
now we come to the real purpose of this meeting –– to appoint a 
successor to our dear friend peter bailey

potter
mr chairman id like to get to my real purpose

man
wait just a minute now

potter
wait for what i claim this institution is not necessary to this 
town therefore mr chairman i make a motion to dissolve this 
institution and turn its
assets and liabilities over to the receiver

uncle billy angrily
george you hear what that buzzard   

lawyer
mr chairman its too soon after peter baileys death to discuss 
chloroforming the building and loan

man
peter bailey died three months ago i second mr potters motion

dr campbell
very well in that case ill ask the two executive officers to 
withdraw

dr campbell rises from his seat george and uncle billy start to 
collect their papers and leave the table

dr campbell continued
but before you go im sure the whole board wishes to express its 
deep sorrow at the passing of peter bailey

george
thank you very much

dr campbell
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this 
organization

potter
ill go further than that ill say that to the public peter 
bailey was the building and loan

everyone looks at him surprised

uncle billy trying to control himself
oh thats fine potter coming from you considering that you 
probably drove him to his grave

potter
peter bailey was not a business man thats what killed him oh 
i dont mean any disrespect to him god rest his soul he was a 
man of high ideals
socalled but ideals without common sense can ruin this town
picking up papers from table
now you take this loan here to ernie bishop    you know that 
fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi you 
know    i happen to know the bank
turned down this loan but he comes here and were building him a 
house worth five thousand dollars why

george is at the door of the office holding his coat and papers 
ready to leave

george
well i handled that mr potter you have all the papers there 
his salary insurance i can personally vouch for his character

potter sarcastically
a friend of yours

george
yes sir

potter
you see if you shoot pool with some employee here you can come 
and borrow money what does that get us a discontented lazy 
rabble instead of a
thrifty working class and all because a few starryeyed dreamers 
like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of 
impossible ideas now i say   

george puts down his coat and comes around to the table incensed 
by what potter is saying about his father

george
just a minute –– just a minute now hold on mr potter youre 
right when you say my father was no business man i know that 
why he ever started
this cheap pennyante building and loan ill never know but 
neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his 
character because his whole life was   
why in the twentyfive years since he and uncle billy started 
this thing he never once thought of himself isnt that right 
uncle billy he didnt save enough money
to send harry to school let alone me but he did help a few 
people get out of your slums mr potter and whats wrong with 
that why    here youre all
businessmen here doesnt it make them better citizens doesnt 
it make them better customers you    you said    whatd 
you say just a minute ago    they
had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think 
of a decent home wait wait for what until their children grow 
up and leave them until theyre
so old and brokendown that they    do you know how long it 
takes a working man to save five thousand dollars just remember 
this mr potter that this rabble
youre talking about    they do most of the working and paying 
and living and dying in this community well is it too much to 
have them work and pay and live and
die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath anyway my father 
didnt think so people were human beings to him but to you a 
warped frustrated old man theyre
cattle well in my book he died a much richer man than youll 
ever be

potter
im not interested in your book im talking about the building 
and loan

george
i know very well what youre talking about youre talking about 
something you cant get your fingers on and its galling you 
thats what youre talking
about i know
to the board
well ive said too much i    youre the board here you do 
what you want with this thing just one thing more though this 
town needs this measly onehorse
institution if only to have some place where people can come 
without crawling to potter come on uncle billy

george leaves the room followed by the jubilant uncle billy 
potters face is grim with hatred the frustrated old man 
remark was gall in his veins

anyone in this county can tell you that
takes some doing take during the depression for instance you 
and i were the only ones that kept our heads you saved the 
building and loan and i saved all the
rest

mother and paying your bills youre able to keep say ten if 
you skimp a child or two
comes along and you wont even be able to save the ten now if 
this young man of twentyeight was a common ordinary yokel id 
say he was doing fine but
george bailey is not a common ordinary yokel hes an 
intelligent smart ambitious young man — who hates his job –– 
who hates the building and loan almost as
much as i do a young man whos been dying to get out on his own 
ever since he was born a young man    the smartest one of the 
crowd mind you a young
man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because 
hes trapped yes sir trapped into frittering his life away

george

potter

potter offers hand

as they shake hands george feels a physical revulsion potters 
hand feels like a cold mackerel to him in that moment of 
physical contact he knows he
could never be associated with this man george drops his hand 
with a shudder he peers intently into potters face

george contd –– vehemently

whole vast configuration of things id say you were nothing but 
a scurvy little spider you

potters secretary in the outer office

drying on a line he
is in his long winter underwear he is sipping a mug of hot 
coffee staring at the stove cold gloomy and drunk ignoring 
clarence and the tollkeeper
preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved problems 
clarence is standing on the other side of the stove putting on 
his undershirt this is a
ludicrous seventeenth century garment which looks like a babys 
night shirt –– with embroidered cuffs and collar and gathered at 
the neck with a
drawstring it falls below his knees

the tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them 
suspiciously throughout the scene he attempts to spit but each 
time is stopped by some amazing
thing clarence does or says clarence becomes aware that his 
garment is amazing the tollkeeper

clarence
i didnt have time to get some stylish underwear my wife gave me 
this on my last birthday i passed away in it

the tollkeeper about to spit is stopped in the middle of it by 
this remark clarence secretly trying to get georges attention 
now picks up a copy of
tom sawyer which is hanging on the line drying he shakes the 
book

clarence contd
oh tom sawyers drying out too you should read the new book 
mark twains writing now

the tollkeeper stares at him incredulously

statement

clarence

to george

makes his way warily out the door from his expression he looks 
like hell call the nearest cop

building a strong wind springs up which blows open the door to 
the shack clarence runs
to close the door

as clarence speaks george cocks his head curiously favoring his 
deaf ear more interested in his hearing than in what clarence 
has said

george

the world
