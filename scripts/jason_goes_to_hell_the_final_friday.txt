              were rapidly moving across the water skimming towards the
              dark woods on the far shore

              elizabeth marcus drives her toyota celica along this heavily
              wooded road  shes a young woman innocent looking sweet
              and pretty
 
              the light is fading  shadows begin to overtake the land
 
              she is obviously some place remote  a sign caught briefly
              in her headlights says crystal lake  4 miles  elizabeth
              swings the car around a barely seen curve in the road  she
              pulls up
 
 
         3    ext deserted cabin  dusk
 
              elizabeth parks the toyota  she gets out takes a look at
              the cabin
 
              a for rent sign hangs tacked to the porch at an angle
              the place looks dark dirty uninviting
 
              she moves to her rear door opens it and bends in to get her
              overnight bag  behind her the darkness gapes with the
              ominous threat of violence
 
              she comes back out of the car and moves to the cabin  a
              porch swing rotted and unusable bangs methodically against
              the old wood of the house  elizabeth fumbles for the keys
              and drops them
 
              as she bends down to pick off the for rent sign snaps it
              chain and swings down missing her neck by inches
 
              startled she rips the sign off and tosses it onto the porch
              with a loud bang
 
 
         4    int deserted cabin  living room  dusk
 
              elizabeth enters  the place is damp and dank  a layer of
              moldy dust has gathered  shadows obscure the corners of the
              room
 
              elizabeth put down her bag and gropes the wall for a switch
              she finds one  flips it  the light turns on for a few brief
              momentsthen sputters and goes out

                                  elizabeth
                        shit
 
              she turns and goes back outside
 
 
         5    ext deserted cabin  dusk
 
              elizabeth walks slowly around the cabin towards a decrepit
              old woodshed at the edge of a dark unfriendly woods  she
              slowly opens the doora mossy ladder rests against the far
              wall
 
              elizabeth enters and walks towards the ladder  suddenly the
              woodshed door bangs closed  elizabeth shrieks then
              scrabbling at the door flings it open and rushes outside
              with the ladder
 
              there is a rustle off among the trees  she hesitates again
              footsteps on dry leaves  just a gust of wind off the lake
 
              with a last look over her shoulder she drags the ladder back
              towards the cabin and enters
 
 
         6    int deserted cabin  living room  night
 
              elizabeth comes back in with the ladder  she picks up her
              bag removes a four pack of bulbs and climbing on the
              ladder replaces the bulb in the living room  the light
              comes onbut its scant illumination against the dark night
 
              suddenly her foot slips on the slimy step of the ladder and
              she drops the old bulb which shatters loudly on the floor
 
              grimacing elizabeth climbs down the ladder and quickly
              sweeps up the broken glass  having done that she shuts the
              front door all the way then puts her bag on the bed and
              opens it  she takes out a few pairs of jeans and some shirts
              and moves to the standing wardrobe
 
              we know that she will open the doors of that wardrobe and
              come face to face with her death
 
              she opens the wardrobe
 
              nothingjust a moth
 
              she puts her clothes away  the sound of a branch scraping
              against the side of the cabin adds to the tension  now she
              turns
 
              there is no one waiting there in the doorway

              elizabeth yawns stretches and walks up the stairwell to the
              second floor landing which leads into a pitch black hallway
 
 
         7    int deserted cabin  bathroom  night
 
              she moves down the hallway then enters the bathroom and
              turns on the light  crossing to the bathtub she bends down
              and turns on the hot water  it comes spitting out brackish
              and brown at first then finally clear
 
              she stays bent over the tub letting the dirty water run
              down the drain  then she puts the plug in filling the tub
              for a bath  as it fills she undresses down to the her
              tshirt and underwear
 
              she looks over to discover that the medicine cabinet door is
              open  she crosses to it and closes it
 
              this has got to be the one  she will close that door and
              there reflected in the mirror will be
 
              nothing just the dim illumination of the bathroom light
 
              she bends down to test the temperature of the tub water
              its good
 
              she removes her underwear and tshirt then puts one foot in
              the water testing it then eases into the comforting warmth
 
              the light in the bathroom sputters and then burns out
 
              elizabeth sighs resigned then continues climbing into the
              tub when  wham
 
 
         8    int deserted cabin  living room  night
 
              the front door blows open banging into the wall
 
 
         9    int deserted cabin  bathroom  night
 
              elizabeth turns startled  she grabs her towel brushing by
              her makeup bag and wrapping the towel around her walks
              slowly down the dark hallway onto the landing
 
              from downstairs she hears a noise
 
 
        10    int cabin  night
 
              bending precariously far out over the landing she looks down
              onto the first floor

              her pov
 
              nothing but the stirring of leaves blowing into the cabin
              through the open doorway
 
              on elizabeth
 
              as a cool breeze from the doorway makes her shiver  slowly
              she moves towards the stairs when we hear that sound again
              from downstairs  what the hell is it  once again she leans
              far out over the landing
 
              her pov
 
              still nothing  leaves  the whine of the wind
 
              on elizabeth
 
              looking  something must have made that noise  then
              suddenly from the perfect darkness behind her jason
              voorhees steps out hockey mask in place machete sharp and
              ready
 
              elizabeth stands back up obscuring jason from view
 
              close on elizabeth
 
              feeling that something is definitely not rightin fact
              something is really really wrong  with a panicked
              expression she turns around to look behind her
 
              her pov
 
              nothing  darkness  jason is gone
 
              on elizabeth
 
              relaxing  everythings okay  she turns towards the stairs
              and right into jason who raises his machete high
 
              with a scream she leaps backwards as jason swings flying
              through the rotted wood of the railing and crashing down onto
              the first floor
 
              on jason
 
              yanking his machete from the wooden bolster on the railing
 
              on elizabeth
 
              looking down at her towel  its sliced through  a thin
              line of blood crossing her stomach in a diagonal  she runs

        11    ext deserted cabin  night
 
              elizabeth leaps from the porch over an overrun flowerbed
              onto the hood of her car  she quickly looks behind her
 
              her pov
 
              to see jason striding through the front door of the the
              cabin coming for her
 
              on elizabeth
 
              as she skids all the way across the hood of the car onto the
              far side then runs through the trees and brush in front of
              the house  her feet bare her eyes panicked  the branches
              seem to claw at her tearing scratching
 
              jasons pov
 
              quickly gaining  god he moves fast  elizabeth turns sees
              us and screams
 
              on elizabeth
 
              turning back to face forward when  whack  shes clipped by
              a tree and knocked to the ground  she scrambles up and looks
              around
 
              her pov
 
              jason is nowhere to be seen
 
              elizabeth moves slowly now turning around her breathing
              quick and panicked  where is he  is he toying with her
              she turns and jason leaps in front of her machete raised
 
              suddenly elizabeth reaches into the cleavage at the front of
              her towel and pulls out a small pistol
 
                                  elizabeth
                        eat me you bastard
 
              she fires one shot directly into jasons forehead knocking
              him back at step then turns and bolts towards 
 
 
        12    ext clearing in woods  night
 
              she runs into this clearing then turns to see jason rapidly
              coming after her striding out into the open raising his
              machete ready to deliver the lethal blow when suddenly
 
              intense bright lights snap on around the clearing

              stunning jason for a moment  the girl disappears into the
              treeline as
 
              the deafening roar of gunfire
 
              cracks out from the darkness  there are fbi agents hidden
              behind every tree bush and rockand now they are all
              firing on jason at once
 
              jason jerks as the bullets tear into his body
 
              then there is a momentthe fbi agents watchingwaiting
              for jason to fall
 
              but he doesnt fall  he stands there  his head turning
              slowly searching the darkness for his next kill  suddenly
              from out of the darkness we hear
 
                                  fbi agent abernathy
                        incoming
 
              we hear a muffled shoomp sound then a familiar whistling as
              a mortar shell descends on jason in the middle of the
              clearing
 
              the grenade lands right at jasons feet
 
              an anxious beatthen
 
              the mortar explodes
 
              we watch as jason is blown irrevocably limb from limb
 
              on various chunks of jason
 
              spinning slowly in the air in slomo  an arm something
              unrecognizable his head still in the hockey mask then
              finally
 
              on jasons black heart
 
              spinning through the air to finally land with a wet plop on
              the field  it beats once then once morethen stops
 
              a moment of silencethen the rest of the fbi agents emerge
              from their hiding places  there is an eerie afterthebattle
              silence to the scene  jasons crimes have been so heinous
              that even in death proximity to his mangled remains seems to
              render a somber atmosphere
 
              agent abernathy makes his way through his quiet somehow
              stunned men and over to elizabeth  he is clearly the man in
              charge  his suit alone says that and his demeanor backs it up

              elizabeth stands and faces him  it is a strange tableauthe
              bright lights the smoke in the air the nearly naked woman
              facing the man in the suit
 
              agent abernathy offers his hand
 
                                  abernathy
                        good job agent marcus
 
                                  elizabeth
                               shaking his hand
                        thank you sir
 
              a tv camera is thrust into abernathys face  the media has
              apparently caught wind of this event  reporters scream for
              agent abernathyyour comments  what was your first
              thought when  abernathy smiles and puts on his best
              media face
 
                                  abernathy
                        ladies and gentlemen please
                        please
 
              the crowd quiets
 
                                  abernathy
                               continuing
                        it is my pleasure to announce that
                        jason voorhees is finally and
                        irrevocablydead
 
              angle on a lone man
 
              sitting some distance away on the rise of a hill  his
              weathered face shows a healthy contempt for this somewhat
              premature celebration  he plugs a twisty homegrown cigar
              into the corner of his mouth light a match off the beard
              stubble on his chin then fires up the cigar  a glowing
              coal in the darkness  his hawks eyes stare at something
              with ferocious intent
 
              on jasons heart
 
              laying on the ground in the clearing not beatingbut
              intact
 
                                                       match cut to
 
 
        13    int hallway outside morgue  night
 
              where we see the heart on a rolling metal surgical table

              pull back to reveal
 
              a coroner a big man in his 30s as he rolls the cart up to
              a security checkpoint manned by two fbi agents  the coroner
              hands his id to fbi agent 1 then lifts his arms as fbi
              agent 2 pats him down
 
                                  fbi agent 1
                        okay sir
 
              the two sliding doors in front of the coroner slide open and
              he wheels the metal surgical cart inside the door closing
              behind him
 
 
        14    int fbi morgue  day
 
              the coroner is in the middle of his autopsy  he talks into
              a microphone as he works taking the dismembered parts of
              jason from a body bag
 
                                  coroner
                        we have a large male caucasianage
                        unknown
 
              he begins inspecting various organs weighs them takes
              samples  he works methodically making verbal notes as he
              works
 
                                  coroner
                               continuing
                        no indication of cirrhosis
 
              on jasons vile black heart
 
              as the coroner inspects it
 
                                  coroner
                        the heart is nearly twice the size of
                        a normal heart  malformed
 
              hes about to lift the heart whenthe heart beats
 
              the coroner stops  he didnt see that
 
                                  coroner
                               trying to keep his
                                composure
                        it appears to be filled with a black
                        viscous fluidfrankly i dont know
                        what the hell it is  its not blood
 
              the heart beats again

              the coroner stares shocked transfixed
 
              the heart undulates now as it beatsit is a hypnotic
              throbbing pulse  something that has to be stared at
              something that awakens deep impossible cravings
 
              it draws the coroner towards it his eyes glassy transfixed
              by what he sees
 
              it beats faster undulating a gaping kneading maw
 
              the coroner stares then reaches down and takes the now
              furiously beating heart in his hands
 
              he looks at it for a frighteningly long beat  he brings it
              closer to his face  he would appear to be studying it
              trying to understand what in gods name this thing is
 
              and then he suddenly smiles raises the monstrous organ to
              his lips
 
              and eats the heart of jason voorhees
 
              when he finishes the heart he stands for a moment not
              moving  then suddenly his throat bulges and he begins to
              scream a horrible scream and as he screams we
 
                                                       cut to
 
 
        15    int hallway outside morgue  night
 
              dead silence  whatever is going on in that room cannot be
              heard through the airtight doors
 
              the coroners assistant walks up carrying dinner  the two
              fbi men stop him

              saying that she walks off  the sheriff glances around at
              the people in the diner then a little cowed goes outside
 
              on diana
 
              as she walks up to the counter where steven sits

              stalkers pov
 
              following him moving in closer

              josh smiles and hurries to the passenger side of the car as
              edna climbs back in behind the wheel
 
              stalkers pov
 
              suddenly rushing towards the car smashing into the drivers
              door slamming it shut with tremendous force just as ednas
              head is lowered to enter
 
              she is dead
 
              stalkers pov
 
              turns to josh who stands frozen in absolute terror
 
              pov rushes at him
 
              as we 
 
                                                       cut to
 
              black then slowly
 
              fade up on
 
 
        23    int voorhees house  room  night
 
              close on josh
 
              strapped on a metal table  straps across his body  even a
              strap to hold his head firmly in place  firelight dances
              across his apparently nude body and his terrorstricken eyes
              his terror grows as a shadow leans in to cover his face
 
              on the coronerjosh
 
              as he looks down at josh  it is the coroner we see but his
              eyes are those black empty pools of jasons evil  many large
              sores cover the mans face

              even as we watch another seems to push its way forth from
              the skin  clearly they weaken the man  he sways slightly
              catches his balance and raises something into view  a
              stranger razor
 
              on josh
 
              as he begins to whimper  the man lowers the razor towards
              his face  the blade glints in the firelight as the
              coronerjason brings it down closer closer until its
              sharp edge touches joshs skin  then suddenly
 
              the man begins to give josh a shave
 
              the scrape of the razor is loud against joshs unlathered
              moustache
 
              now the cornonerjason moves the blade across joshs adams
              apple carefully expertly
 
              when the man is finished there is a long uncertain beat
              then his hands bring a hot towel into view
 
              joshs pov
 
              as the towel is laid over his face
 
              blackness
 
              over which we hear the strangled sounds of the coronerjason
              breathing  what the hell is he doing  after a long moment
              the towel is lifted and still in
 
              joshs pov
 
              we see the coronerjason lean in opening his mouth wide
              until his face fills the screen
 
              a beat then josh screams a horrible scream as we
 
                                                       cut to
 
 
        24    ext voorhees house  night
 
              there is a dark and evil aura to the house but it is not the
              victorian haunted house of some storybook tale of ghosts  this
              a place built as a summer home in the forties abandoned many
              years ago it looks now as if it is dissolving slowly back
              into the small encroaching corner of the lake behind it and
              into the woods around it
 
              but the sense of evil doesnt come from the rot or the
              decay those are just symptoms

              the sense of evil comes from the core of darkness that we can
              feel in every gaping window  in every shadow  in the dark
              shadows of the trees and the darker waters of the lake
 
              as josh continues to scream we
 
                                                       fade to black
 
 
        25    int diner  night
 
              steven and randy sit by the counter vicki stands beside them
              and we can see ward back in the kitchen cooking up some food
 
                                  steven
                               to vicki

                        prank call

                        once said  there is no worse regret
                        then a temptation resisted
 
              a beat
 
                                  randy
                        jesus steven thatsthats really

                                  randy
                        hell when steven was a kid he was
                        like having strippers delivered to
                        church bingos and shit

                        raised enough money to build a day
                        care center
 
                                  randy
                        it was a community service
 
                                  steven
                        absolutely  the church even sent me
                        an autographed picture of god
                               yelling to the back
                        ward
 
                                  ward
                               shouting from back

                        told them i wanted to trade my mom in
                        for a box of lincoln logs
 
              suddenly a wet sponge comes flying in from offscreen and
              hits ward in the face
 
                                  joey b os

              suddenly randy walks up to steven and quickly handcuffs him

                                  steven
                        wanna know how i did that
 
                                  randy

                                  steven
                               steven smiles
                        gotta go  see you guys later
 
              he runs past randy to the door of the diner then stops and
              turns to him
 
                                  steven
                        by the way if youd been paying
                        attention youd have noticed i held
                        the receiver down when i dialed 
                        cop like you should be more observant
                        than that
 
              and he rushes out of the diner
 
                                  randy
                        he drives me so fucking crazy

              in the darkness the phone rings  a key turns in the door as
              diana enters  she finds the light switch as the phone rings
              again
 
              the lights come on and she dashes across the room to answer
              the phone
 
                                  diana
                        coming  hold on
 
              she snatches the phone

              diana thinks a second trying to place the callerthen
              suddenly smiles
 
                                  diana
                        ed

              behind diana a shadowy figure appears in the doorway  we
              see him as he moves forward but diana doesnt
 
 
        27    int landis squad car  night
 
              hes in his car talking on the phone

        28    int dianas house  living room  night
 
              diana is as happy as shes ever been  the man who we now
              recognize as josh is still approaching from the shadows
 
                                  diana
                        god ed i love you too i
 
              now directly behind diana josh snakes a hand out snatches
              the receiver from her then slams it back into its cradle
 
              diana only ha time for a startled gasp as josh grabs her  he
              takes her head in a firm embrace and draws her face close to
              his
 
                                  diana
                        josh  what are you doing
 
              his lips draw closer and closer to hers  his eyes are cold
              empty places
 
              she turns her head to the side away from josh  her eyes
              open in a terror born of absolute disbelief and a certain
              knowledge that except for the pain she is already dead
 
              dianas pov
 
              on the mirror over the mantle  in the reflection she sees
              not josh but jason voorhees mask in place
 
                                  diana
                        oh godoh jesus

              on joshjason
 
              as he reaches out to diana turns her head back to his and
              opens his mouth  its dank and vile and theres something
              in there something that writhes horribly the same oozing
              color as jasons dark heart
 
              as the thing squirms out from between his teeth and towards
              dianas lips she manages to screams last
 
                                  diana
                        no
 
              panicked determined she reaches down and opens the drawer
              of the phone table
 
              inside is a service revolver
 
              the phone begins to ring again as diana grabs the gun and
              sticks it against joshs temple as the black thing in his
              mouth begins to pry her lips apart trying to worm inside
 
              she pulls the trigger
 
              the shot rings loud in the room  joshjason staggers back
              falls to his knees hes been shot in the back of the head at
              close range  its a wound that would kill anyone human
 
              the phone continues to ring until it is knocked off its
              cradle by diana as she turns and runs to the patio door
 
              its locked
 
              she fiddles with it trying to open it then glances back to
              make sure joshjason isnt coming for her
 
              joshjason isnt there
 
              oh shit  she back against a wall looking around  where
              is he  she turns  hes not there  she spots the phone and
              moves towards it
 
              then from the darkness of the shadows
 
              joshjason leaps out at her grabs her and flings her down
              to the floor
 
              the injured but very obviously alive joshjason holds
              dianas head firmly against the carpet  he lowers his mouth
              towards hers and once again that black thing in his mouth
              squirms through his lips  the phone keeps ringing and
              ringing

              suddenly the room is bathed in light as a car pulls up
              outside
 
 
        29    int dianas house  entryway  night
 
              steven enters  he sees blood and hearing diana scream
              rushes into
 
 
        30    int dianas house  living room  night
 
              and leaps on josh his momentum knocking the man off diana
              before josh can force the horrible squirming thing from his
              mouth into hers  but the advantage is just momentary
 
              joshjason turns to steven and grabs him by his shirt
              picking him up off the ground with what is clearly superhuman
              strength and throws him against the nearest wall
 
              steven hits the wall with a sharp nearly backbreaking
              impact  he lies for a moment stunned near unconsciousness
              then he regains his bearings just in time to see joshjason
              taking a knife sharpening pole from the knife rack next to
              him in the kitchen
 
              then joshjason turns and flings the instrument through the
              air at steven just as diana runs up to see if stevens okay
 
              the pole pierces diana through the back
 
              she looks up at steven with a stunned expression and then
              sinks down to the floor revealing joshjason behind her
 
              there is a fury in him now that is terrible to behold  an
              unearthly scream of frustration and rage tears from his
              throat  his hands reach out ready to tear into steven
 
              steven manages to duck roll and come up beside the fireplace
 
              joshjason turns and charges at steven
 
              steven grabs a fireplace poker and rams it with all of his
              strength through joshjasons chest
 
              as he does this he is positioned so that he cant help but
              see the reflection in the mirror  he sees jason voorhees
              struggling furiously trying to pull the poker out of his
              chest  in trying to do that joshjason is thrown backward
 
              he crashes through a window and falls outside
 
              steven rushes back to diana  he bends taking her in his
              arms

                                  diana
                               weakly
                        you saw him  you know who he is
 
              steven nods
 
                                  diana
                               continuing

              but the pain is too much
 
                                  diana
                               continuing
                        steven
 
                                  steven

                        im scared  im very scared
 
              all steven can do is hold her  her eyes close  she dies

                        oh god almighty no
 
              on sheriff
 
              standing there staring in shock  he pulls his gun
 
              as he does this steven sets diana down and runs towards the
              window
 
                                  steven
                        it was josh  he fell outside  he 
 
              steven looks out the window

              there is nothing there but darkness  joshjason is gone
 
              on steven
 
              as he turns back to sheriff the man kneels by diana

                                  sheriff
                        oh my dear god
 
                                  steven
                               really to himself
                        he was dead  he had to be dead
 
              sheriff looks up at steven
 
              the boy stands covered in blood  suddenly he realizes what
              this must look like
 
                                  steven
                        no you cant think i
 
              but sheriffs eyes grow cold

                        she had something to tell me
 
                                  sheriff

              sheriff suddenly hauls off whacks steven across the face
              then grabs him by the collar and pulls him close
 
                                  sheriff
                               continuing

              sheriff looks at steven with an almost astonished pity

                                  sheriff

                        bitch
 
              defeated eyes filled with loss and anger sheriff turns and
              walks away  then just before he exits he turns back
 
                                  sheriff
                               continuing

              the sheriff leaves
 
              steven watches him go then turns to randy who cant quite

              carriage standing just outside the door
 
              vicki moves to the carriage and picks up the baby who
              immediately stops crying

              randy leads steven from the interrogation room towards the
              jail cell block

              steven has not been paying attention  hes staring at
              something on the other side of the room
 
              his pov
 
              jessica enters through the front door with vicki
 
              on steven
 
              in his eyes we see that in spite of whatever might have
              happened in the past he really loves this girl
 
                                  steven
                        jessica
 
              on jessica
 
              as she suddenly turns and lifts something up into view  the
              baby
 
              on steven
 
              as his eyes widen realizing what this means what it was
              that diana was going to tell him what landis meant by his
              talk about a miscarriage
 
              this is his daughter hes looking at

              suddenly another man comes through the police station door
              and places his hands protectively on jessicas shoulders
              she turns away from steven and looks at this new arrival
 
              its robert campbell the host of american casefile

              he and steven each eye each otherinstant enemies

                        whats the problem

              there is a pause as the sheriff listens and we can tell from
              his face that whatever the problem isits serious
 
                                  sheriff

              end we see creighton duke in cuffs walking towards him with
              officer dill slightly behind trying to keep up
 
              finally the sheriff and duke get nose to nose

                        was missing and he was standing over
                        the open cabinet
 
                                  sheriff

                        to it before i could
 
              the sheriff can barely contain himself upon hearing this he
              tries to calm down but its an effort
 
                                  sheriff
