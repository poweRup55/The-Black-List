                               irritated
                        what are you doing
                               seeing the cord

              close up the horribly ripped and torn cord end does look
              quite grotesque
 
              back to jill
 
              she cans the foggy night and a deadly fear now grips her
              slowly then picking up speed she follows after cort

              has stopped in the rvs doorway  jill rushes up and turns
              to look at what hes staring at

              quickly he shifts and roars backward  jill is thrown to the
              floor  items fall off the counters

              in a cloud of dust the huge rv races backwards
 
              moving shot  from behind the trees
 
              we follow after the vehicle as it peels out of the

              is wearing headphones listening to her walkman  she sits on
              her bed ogling through the pages of a playgirl magazine
 
              over sissys shoulder
 
              the magazine is filled with beefcakeposing guys  she is
              practically drooling on the pages  in the background a
              figure quickly passes by the open window
 
              close on sissy
 
              the movement catches her eye  she cranes her head to look
 
              wider
 
              taking off the rock n roll blaring headphones sissy shuts
              off her walkman  she walks over to the window and looks out

              a bit perplexed  she knows she saw something  she starts to
              turn away when the sound of leaves crunching underfoot is
              heard  she sticks her head out the window  she tries to
              sound authoritative

              she hears footsteps right below the window  she thinks then
              breaks into an impish grin seeing something  sissy quietly
              tiptoes over to the table and picks up her halfconsumed can
              of cherry coke

              quickly she withdraws the can and jumps back from the window
              expecting a response she is surprised not to get one
              stifling a laugh she creeps back toward the window

              the sheriff immediately raises his hand to strike her  then
              quickly controlling himself he grabs her by the shoulders

              he disregards tommys question and stares at his daughter
              with sincere concern
 
                                  sheriff

              the sheriff hesitates not wanting to answer  somehow it
              blurts out
 
                                  sheriff
