                                      screenplay by

                                       todd farmer

                              based on characters created by

                                      victor miller

                                      shooting draft

                

               we open on

               an eye we have seen this eye before but we cant be sure 
               just where it stares at us implacably malevolently it 
               blinks blinks again then closes we are in

               darkness

               the darkness is slowly broken by moving vertical lines at 
               first we dont realize what were seeing but soon the lines 
               resolve themselves into pillars

               we are moving past pillars a vast line of them  cold 
               concrete  marching away into the distance

               intercut

               extreme closeups reveal bits and pieces of maybe a figure  
               we see the hint of a shoe a link of a chain a scrap of 
               tattered leather a mask an eye the eye closes

               and again we are in 

               blackness

               now we hear footsteps we go from black to gray as we move

               past the large concrete pillars in the distance looms 

               a pedestal

               rising high off the seeping concrete floor it is framed by 
               pillars on either side  and lit from above by a single 
               shaft of harsh white light

               something stands on the pedestal something huge but from 
               this distance we cant see what it is

               moving with the footsteps we approach 

               now we are close enough to see a massive figure wrapped in 
               a straight jacket and secured by chains to the floor below 
               and the ceiling above he is immobile imprisoned  chained 
               like an animal

               as we get closer we recognize this figure  his massive 
               limbs his mask

               a hockey mask

               and behind the mask the eyes the left eye is gone  long 
               ago gouged out and scarred over but the right eye stares 
               with dark brooding fury

               jason vorhees

               he lives

               her tracey she stops and stares at jason for a moment until

               we see a nondescript sign that reads crystal lake research 
               facility in the distance is a small concrete building

               something about its structure suggests that it leads 
               underground

               a military personnel truck stops at the concrete building

               soldiers jump out of the back and disappear into the building

               int underground corridor  morning

               dr wimmer moves with the soldiers towards jasons room when 
               rowan comes up

                                     rowan

                         the cryostasis chamber yet

                                     dr wimmer
                         i dont want him frozen doctor i 
                         want him alive

                                     rowan
                         weve already discusses this

                                     dr wimmer

                                     rowan
                         but dr wimmer you cant risk 
                         transporting him through open country

                                     dr wimmer
                         you have to see the bigger picture 
                         here

                                     rowan

               his unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue 
               even to defy death simply calls for more research

                                     rowan

                         innocent civilians if he escapes

                         sergeant

                                     sgt mazur
                              to his men
                         lets move him out

                                     rowan
                         but

               as they brush past rowan and shes powerless to stop them

               int holding cell  moments later

               once again were in the cavernous room line with pillars

               mazur and his men move quickly to surround jason pedestal

               no one speaks doctor wimmers upper lip is slick with sweat 
               the men close in around the stillshrouded jason

               some have cattle prods others carry noose polls with slip 
               knots on the end still others hold billy clubs at the ready 
               and all of them carry holstered sidearms

               they stand there waiting for the word from mazur who goes 
               to the pillbox and raps on the wall near the snout of the 
               machine gun

                                     sgt mazur
                         careful with that 50 soldier youve 
                         got friendlies out here

               mazur then circles jason cautiously

                                     dr wimmer
                              agitated
                         what are you waiting for

                                     sgt mazur
                         just takin my time doc i only 
                         want to have to do this once
                              to his men
                         all right boys lets knock him 
                         out

               three men with cattle prods move in and administer a 
               methodical series of jolts through the shroud

               the shrouded figure twitches violently then falls still

               after a moment the black shroud falls off and slips silently 
               away mazur and wimmer react with horror

                                     sgt mazur
                         what the christ

                                     dr wimmer
                         it cant be

               but it is

               johnson

               one of the chains is cinched around his neck his face is 
               ghostly blue he couldnt be more dead grim realization 
               dawns on sgt mazur who spins around wildly frantic eyes 
               searching then finding

               jason

               emerging from the pillbox his straight jacket is split open 
               at the seams broken chains hang off his wrists and drag 
               behind his legs he stands firm the massive 50 in hand as 
               if he were about to mow them all down

                                     sgt mazur
                         oh shit

               suddenly jason swings the massive gun cracking a nearby 
               soldiers skull

               the remaining men open fire peppering jason with ordinance 
               but this only seems to infuriate him jason grabs a nearby 
               soldier and holds him up like a shield just as 

               another soldier fires riddling the captive soldier with 
               bullets dropping the dead soldier jason windmills both 
               arms whipping the chains over his head one length of chain 
               wraps around a soldiers neck the other hits the side of 
               sgt mazurs head

               a soldier runs at jason with a noose pole and tries to put 
               the noose around his neck jason grabs a pole and smashes 
               the soldier across the forehead the soldier at the end of 
               the chain tries to run jason jerks the chain snapping the 
               soldiers neck and pulls him off his feet

               dr wimmer turns to run but he only gets a step before jason 
               throws the noose pole and spears dr wimmer through the chest 
               he falls to his knees and forward the tip of the pole hits 
               the floor holding the doctor up as he dies

               soon no one is left alive except sgt mazur who struggles 
               to stand shotgun in hand jason closes in mazur fires point 
               blank to no effect

               jason moves toward him mazur disappears behind a pillar

               jason moves off down the line of pillars heading for an 
               exit

               int underground corridor  continuous

               mayhem hasnt reached this hallway yet it remains tranquil 
               and quiet as rowan walks along carrying a cardboard box 
               stenciled on the side destroy

               suddenly a soldier runs past

                                     rowan
                         hey whats the

               but the soldier is gone then another runs by

                                     rowan
                         oh shit

               suddenly boom a third running soldier accidentally flattens 
               rowan

               the box goes flying scattering jasoniana all over the 
               hallway bloodencrusted work gloves newspaper clippings

               we watch one artifact go skittering across the floor

               jasons machete

               the soldiers disappear through a door sounds of gun fire 
               and screams echo through the hall rowan struggles to her 
               feet and moves slowly down the hall towards the door

               wham

               the door flies off its hinges as sgt mazur lands nearby

               rowan blood pouring from his mouth kneels beside him

                                     sgt mazur
                         get out of here get out now

               the sgt dies in her arms she takes his shotgun locks and 
               loads and moves off down the dark hallway

               jason vorhees

               comes into the corridor filling it with his bulk backlit 
               and ominous

               jason picks up his old machete it fits in his hand like an 
               old friend he moves past the dead sergeant

               int stairs subterranean  later

               on rowan

               steel steps ring with her footsteps as rowan pounds down the 
               stairs she shivers with the cold as she looks for a place 
               to hide among the huge tanks and gothiclooking ducts and 
               pipes

               jason moves down the stairs into the subterranean lair

               on rowan

               she crouches in the dark shotgun cradled in her arms she 
               spots a large steel door and moves to it

               int cryo lab  continuous

               rowan darts behind a rack of gas canisters jason enters 
               his machete ready in one corner the door to a boxy cell 
               like chamber the cryo unit stands open theres no sign of 
               the girl

               jason looks around seeking his prey suddenly rowan steps 
               out of hiding shotgun at the ready

               kablam

               the pointblank blast nails jason in the back and drives him 
               forward he spins as

               kablam

               hes hit in the knee he stumbles but doesnt fall

               kablam

               jason is hit in the shoulder but doesnt fall

               this isnt working thus rowan glances to a rolling rack of 
               gas canisters beside her using her foot she shoves the 
               rack the wheels squeak as it rolls forward finally stopping 
               at jasons feet jason looks at the rack like you gotta be 
               kidding me he looks back to

               rowan who just grins and lowers her shotgun she fires at 
               the canisters

               kaboom

               the canisters pressurized contents explode sending jason 
               falling into the cryo chamber rowan dives for cover

               hurling herself across the cryo lab rowan slams shut the 
               cryo unit door and jason is trapped inside

                                     computer voice os

               lights glow engines hum to life

               through cryo unit window

               we hear a sibilant hiss as cryo gas cascades over jason  
               his movements slow as the coldness sets into his flesh

               slowly the hiss dies away as the unit goes silent and still

               rowan breaths a sigh of relief she sags against the door

               then 

               the machete

               bursts through the steel door and into rowans gut alarms 
               sound

               she places her hands on the cryo unit and shoves herself off 
               the machete blade she screams in pain and staggers toward 
               the closing door

               she grabs the edges of the door but it swings inexorably 
               closed she yanks her fingers away at the last second before 
               theyre pulverized by the closing door massive pressure 
               bolts suss the door shut

                                     rowan

               chsshshshshssh

               gash filters into the room from the leak in the cryo unit

               rowan begins to fade she stumbles backward against a wall 
               and falls to her knees

                                     rowan
                         no please

               close on

               her face as ice crystals form

               tableau

               rowan frozen on the floor and jason motionless behind the 
               cryo unit door

               we move slowly over the scene languidly drinking it in

               from rowan to jason back to rowan

               fade to black

               fade in

               int subterranean lair  445 years later

               pitch black a light slices through the darkness then 
               another illuminating the stale air

               cloaked figures holding lights move down the concrete steps 
               and into the dusty space below

               they reach the large steel door ice has crusted over the 
               window in the door

               int cyro lab

               a thick layer of ice and frost covers the floor and ceiling

               through the door we can see lights on the other side of the 
               frozen door

               now we hear a humming sound followed by turning gears then 
               the sound of cracking ice as the metallic door opens

               too precise

               this is kayem 14 and as time goes on we realize that shes 
               a science droid

               she casually glances around the room sniffs the air then 
               speaks in a warm contralto that is like her movements almost

               is still trying to remove the frozen cup from his hand he 
               rakes it across the cryocell then 

               a huge chunk of ice drops from the roof of the cryo unit and 
               shatters at azraels feet scattering shards of ice across 
               the frozen floor

               now its azraels turn to jump backward right into jasons 
               frozen frame

               jason teeters backward then falls forward the machete still 
               cemented to his hand catches azrael in the shoulder

               and the momentum takes the kids arm clean off

               when jason hits the cold ground all his chains and shackles 
               shatter into tiny brittle bits

               and the impact jars the machete free from his hand

               kayem rushes to azrael whos staring at the pulsing stump 
               of his arm in breathless horror she removes a syringe and a 
               clear patch from her pack she quickly injects him with the 
               needle

                              the drug takes hold
                         youre so pretty

               kayem deftly applies the clear patch to azreals shoulder

               the patch instantly expands sealing the wound and stopping 
               the flow of blood

               then tosses the heap to the ground dallas stares in shock 
               as jason grabs the gun hand a shot is fired

               our guys are buffeted mercilessly by the shock wave which 
               gradually fades away only to be replaced by ominous silence

               the others hurry through waylander the last and the biggest

                         it for you

               jason reaches down and slowly almost gently plucks the 
               machete from lowes belt

                                     lowe

               jason stares at the two cutting instruments comparing then

               kinsa freaks and starts to scream rowan clamps a hand over

                         youre good with people

               suddenly an electrical short circuit fills the cargo hold 
               with light across the bay they see a body  its moving

               hard to tell who it is

                                     rowan
                         my god i think theres somebody 
                         over there

                         straight across

                         be careful

               janessa leads kinsa toward the shuttle bay just as rowan 
               starts toward the body the light fails again and shes

               plunged into darkness

               with rowan

               she works her way edgily across the cargo hold the grunt 
               gun held ready

               she continues an act of sheer will at last she reaches the 
               corner of the storpod where she thought she saw the body

               she braces herself whips around the corner to see 

               nothing

               just two bloody steel rods sticking through the storpod

               rowan takes a few steps backward panic seeping in suddenly 
               she senses danger to her right  jumps back and levels the 
               gruntgun all at the same time shes this close to firing 
               when she sees 

               brodski

               trashed laying on the floor of cargo bay how he managed to 
               drag himself off the steel rods is anybodys guess

                                     brodski

                         refitting the shuttle

               she drops the gruntgun and grabs brodski beneath his massive 
               shoulders he groans in pain but shes not strong enough to 
               pull him

                                     rowan
                         im sorry youre too heavy ill 
                         have to go get help

               brodski grabs her arm

                         save yourselves get the hell out

                         alright lets get started

               kayem flips through the air and lands on top of a 6x12 crate  
               looks down to find jason is gone

                                     kayem 14
                         ooo you wanna play

               jason appears behind the crate and slams his hand into it

               it upturns but kayem walks the crate like a river log and 
               flips backwards landing behind jason

                                     kayem 14
                         sorry chump not good enough

               jason turns to her the satellite dish over his shoulder

               kayem opens fire jason and the satellite beyond are riddled 
               with bullets

               through the shards of flying glass and debris kayem catches 
               a glimpse of jasons retreat she moves between two racks 
               filled with reflective satellite panels spots jason and 
               opens fire

               panels shatter shes shooting at his reflection as jason 
               steps up behind her kayem realizes her mistake as jason 
               raises his machete

                                     kayem 14
                         tricky little sumbitch

               she leaps into a roundhouse kick but jason catches her leg 
               and flings her through the air she tumbles then lands like 
               a cat in the weapons hold doorway then backflips into the 
               weapons hold

               jason moves toward the weapons hold

               int weapons hold  continuous

               jason enters but finds no kayem he glances around then 
               moves toward the walkway

               over his shoulder

               kayem drops to the pedestal in the center of the room she 
               tosses her gatlin gun aside and pulls her sidearms

               jason turns

                                     kayem 14
                         peekaboo

               kayem opens fire jason is blown into 

               int walkway b  continuous

               through a blurred combo of martial arts kicks mixed with 
               sidearm onslaught kayem pushes jason to the end of the 
               walkway where he finally crumbles to the floor

               kayem immediately flips through the air and lands straddling 
               jason she slams the barrels of her sidearms up to his 
               temples

                                     kayem 14
                         say goodnight ass 

               kafwam jason bashes her in the chest sending her flying 
               backwards she crashes onto the floor begins to rise but 
               jasons foot slams her throat to the ground

               she struggles to get up but jasons too much he raises her 
               machete

               another angle

               as the kids stare into the hallway theres nothing they can 
               do

               jason

               brings his machete down when suddenly 

               brodski rises behind jason and stabs him in the leg

                                     rowan
                         brodski

               jason reaches down and breaks the knife blade kayem glances 
               up at brodski

                                     kayem 14
                         i had it under control but thanks

               she leaps to her feet

                                     brodski
                         my pleasure

               the exertion and loss of blood leaves brodski weak he 
               stumbles nearly falls but rowan and waylander catch him

               kayem points her guns at jason

                                     kayem 14
                         as for you

               she fires a round of bullets at him describing a circle on 
               the wall behind him

               int lab one  continuous

               the slugs burst through the back wall shattering the assorted 
               glassed specimens

               int walkway b  continuous

               jason must be wondering why kayem fired around and not at 
               him but he doesnt contemplate the moment instead he raises 
               his weapon

               kayem opens fire again blowing jasons arm off jason stares 
               down at the severed limb as kayem barrels toward him

               she spins and throws a roundhouse kick slamming him right 
               through the shattered wall

               int lab one  continuous

               jason tumbles through shattering the remaining specimens 
               which fall all around him and cover him with goo he lands 
               in front of the n2

               kayem leaps through the hole firing then holsters her gun

               she reaches back and retrieves the rocket launcher if jason 
               could speak his first words would probably be oh shit

                                     kayem 14
                         now im gonna fuck you up

               and then kayem unleashes a final savage onslaught of 
               firepower a rocket blows his leg to hell another slams 
               into the side of his chest

               and finally kayem zeros in on his head and fires

               pov through jasons mask

               the rocket screams right toward him then 

               kafoom

               a third of his mask and skull is blown to hell the remaining 
               mass drops to the ground and now  finally 

               kayem approaches with jasons machete she spikes it 
               ceremonially in the last little lump of jason that remains

                                     janessa

               tsunaron goes to kayem who throws her arm around him in a 
               very possessive and sexually knowing way

               hoses lower from the n2 and nanoants pour out from within

               lasers move to the stump at jasons shoulder

               on n2 screen

               searching for biomatch

               several strands of nanoant groups spread out from the body 
               and swarm over parts of lab debris the swarm pulls assorted 
               parts back toward jasons body

               on n2 screen

               biomatch located  initiate tissue formation

               nanonats swarm with more intensity as a huge sphere of 
               robotic arms swings over the body and joins in to the fun
