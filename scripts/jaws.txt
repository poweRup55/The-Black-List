               sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward

               then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture

               it breaks wide showing the top and bottom a silhouetted 
               curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside 
               of a tremendous gullet looking out at the onrushing undersea

               landslide metabolic sounds the rare and secret noises that 
               certain undersea species share with each other also the 
               hint of familiar music twisted and distorted by the depths

               it is a pleasant moonlit windless night in midjune we 
               see a long straight stretch of white beach behind the low 
               dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses hear a 
               number of voices singing it sounds like an eastern 
               universitys alma mater no longer distorted

               makes a clumsy attempt at snaring chrissie cups her from 
               behind she squirms playfully out of his grasp we discover 
               hes not especially sober

               against the fire she pauses and looks at the ocean he is 
               plodding along in the sand winded

               chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water 
               leaving tom reeling atop the dune as she runs she is 
               shedding her clothes tom is trying to trail her by her 
               clothes like hansel following bread crumbs through the woods

               but chrissie is way ahead of him

               she runs headlong into the inviting sea plunges cleanly 
               into the water with a light whoops as the cold water sweeps 
               over her

               behind all this we continue to hear the sentimental beery 
               chorus of alma maters

               then we see it  a gentle bulge in the water a ripple that 
               passes her a dozen feet away a pressure wave lifts her up 
               then eases her down again like a smooth sudden swell

               feet tangled in his pants which have dropped around his 
               ankles she starts to swim back in to him

               she feels makes her open her mouth to scream but she is 
               slammed again hard whipped into an arc of about eight feet 
               up and down submerging her down to her open mouth choking 
               off any scream she might try to make another jolt to her 
               body driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the 
               surface then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible

               chain and a large patched inner tube charlie takes out a 
               monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the

               end and start to work charlie baits the hook with a massive 
               chunk of sirloin while denherder secures the loose end of 
               chain to a skinny piling charlie then fastens the inner 
               tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook

                                     denherder

               and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward the chain

               charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling he 
               turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a 
               fractured board denherder paces bored to death

               suddenly zipping out faster and faster as both men 
               straighten

               denherder is goggleeyed

                                     denherder
                         hey whats this

               the chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the 
               wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty a section of chain 
               tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into 
               the air both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube racing 
               out to sea in a wake of white water suddenly dips under

                                     charlie
                         look at him take it

                         let him do it gogogogogo

               it is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow 
               pilings

               close  piling

               a lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings snap with a 
               resounding crack

               the end of the jetty is yanked loose denherder is flipped 
               like a chip over the side and into the cold night water 
               where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber

               denherders point of view

               the severed section of jetty a joined platform of footboards 
               is being dragged seaward with charlie sitting dazed on top 
               of it his lit pipe still going

               charlie rolls into the water sputters turns to watch the

               in his direction

                         holy jesus christ

               denherder steps up on the brokenoff piling just to be out 
               of the water

               charlie inhaling terror trying to slog to shore the jetty 
               is getting closer suddenly an enormous black fin breaks 
               water like a periscope making course corrections as it comes 
               for charlie

               denherder jumps from piling to piling almost losing his 
               balance on his way to help charlie charlie has reached the 
               last pylon toward open sea and his hands clamber for a hold 
               but 

               insert  charlies hands

               the algae is too slippery and his fingers keep sliding back

               thats when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky 
               and charlie manages with denherders desperate help to 
               make it safely to shore the remains of the pier float belly
               up in the inlet

                         there trying to catch their breath 
                         and figuring out how to explain to

               hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men and 
               we can hear a plaintive but lenny from the local as brody 
               sees something that makes him move towards the other side of 
               the dock we see him cross to a little boat built for two or 
               three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man 
               climbs in with his gear

                                     brody

               matt hooper is gliding into the dockside and ben throws him 
               a line to help make fast as he moors its a small island of 
               courtesy in an otherwise discourteous mob hooper nods 
               politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock

                                     hooper

               the mate nods yes and starts to prepare to get under way

               ben and his mate move away from the dock headed towards the 
               channel and the open sea leaving felix and pratt to scamper 
               around the dock looking for another ride

                         tell me

               before he can finish brody spots something on shore that 
               moves him to shout to his deputy

                              noticing something
                         is that dynamite

               brody looks and stops by a boat thats about to cast off

               he holds out his hand

                                     brody

               the man passes brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks

               brody tucks the dynamite under his arm and continues down 
               the pier hooper is still with him

               quiet pros like ben gardner in wellworn comfortable

               death struggle his rod in a tight arc his buddy leaps across 
               to lend a hand

               twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues

               this time its the overloaded boat with the poor scallop 
               fishermen shouts of im on dig in strike then a tangle 
               of tackle springs from the water they have hooked each other

               joy turns to swearing  arnold felix stands up to applaud 
               the mishap while his buddy pratt takes careful aim with his 
               remington 1100 12gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it 
               were a clay pigeon  the tangle explodes

               three men are aboard one holding a rod which holds a fast

               crossing back and forth struggling jerking the mighty 
               tail threshing one man is screaming success the other two 
               slapping the angler on the back

               close  pratt and felix

               they spot it and sour

                         well get over there he aint caught 
                         it yet

               the owner of pratts boat throws it forward and pratt removes 
               a 45 automatic from the holster of his belt he tests it 
               firing once in the air as they near the scene of the 
               struggle eleven other boats begin converging until 

               harrys boat

               everyone wants to get into the act they are attacking the

               threshing beast with all theyve got pratt uses his 
               automatic another blasts point blank with a shotgun there 
               are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck 
               from time to time as bullets skip by finally the shark 
               stops threshing

               their boat has moved close to the shark closer than harrys

                         hand me that pole quick

               one of his party in the overfilled boat grabs a gaff and 
               leans out to grab the moribund shark but harry wont give 
               up the line still reeling in

                                     harry

                         we split down the middle

               pratt nods reluctantly the man swings lodges the gaff and 
               hauls the shark up onto the gunwale a paroxysm of cheers 
               from the surrounding boats smoke flares are fired into the 
               air

                                     harry
                              a tugofwar

               it is a tenfoot tiger and what a mess  splattered with 
               bullet punctures gashes bleeding from several orifices 
               but it is not dead  it kicks back to life and threatens to 
               capsize the boat pratt panics and fires six times with his 
               45 the bullets pierce the sharks head pass through and 
               split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water 
               rises everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them

               relief and delight cross his features

               shot the whole town and the armada fishermen all line up in 
               a classic high school graduating class shot with the 
               victorious fishermen kneeling in front and the rest of the 
               armada and townspeople arranged behind them hendricks hold

               brody spots the mayor coming towards the dock and detaches 
               himself from the group to join him

                                     brody

                         sure he is

               hooper and the fishermen

               the men who landed the monster are in a tight cluster 
               debating something with hooper who is dwarfed by the big 
               beer bellies and hamfisted hands all around him its 
               probable we dont even see him

               the men ad lib what kind of shark is this its a shark 
               like in the movies they got sharks its a maneater for 
               sure i bet its a recordbreaker etc

                                     hooper os
                         its a tiger shark very rare in 
                         these waters and definitely a 
                         maneater

               hooper enters the circle and picks up where he left off 
               measuring the sharks teeth others watch him charlie and 
               denherder walk over to the shark charlie punches it

               brody and vaughn

               they are walking down to the shark together

                                     vaughn

                              speaking to everyone
                         i think we all owe a debt of gratitude 
                         to these men for catching this 
                         monster

               brody and vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen 
               who are surrounding hooper raising their voices at him

                                     pratt

               mrs kintner joins the group

               she seeks out brody and stops in front of him

                                     mrs kintner
                         chief brody

               he nods she slaps him full across the face there is an 
               embarrassed silence some people leave following a trend 
               that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark

                                     mrs kintner

                         that my boy is dead i wanted you 
                         to know that

               she stops unable to continue her father takes her arm and 
               leads her away pratt harry and the others trail off after 
               her during the rest of the scene the camera tightens in on 
               brody to the exclusion of the others

                                     vaughn
                         im sorry martin shes in a sick 
                         terrible state

                         look maybe this is the wrong time 
                         to pursue this but im not sure

               before hooper can finish brodys shoulders slump and he 
               goes slack

                                     brody
                              almost to himself
                         shes right

                                     vaughn

                         im going home

               he turns and leaves abruptly surrendering the dock to vaughn 
               and hooper who eye each other with mutual disadmiration

               int brody house  night  dining room

               brody and ellen sean and michael have all finished dinner

               brodys plate is untouched a virgin meatloaf his glass on 
               the other hand is well used with the remnants of a stiff 
               scotch and ice he is staring across the table at the 
               youngest sean who makes a face at him he makes a face 
               back

               sean gives daddy the kiss brody shoos him and michael off 
               to bed ellen who is feeling progressively more left out 
               with each passing moment gets up abruptly and clears a few 
               dishes brody is not letting her into his world for the 
               moment and it shows theres a knock at the door

                                     hooper os

               they exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly 
               desperate but shared laughter

                                     hooper

                              he tells a story 
                              about his boyhood 
                              and a shark
                         but youve still got a problem here 
                         theres a shark just off the island 
                         somewhere

                                     brody
                         how come you have to tell them that

                                     ellen
                         excuse me but what are you talking 
                         about didnt they catch the shark 
                         this afternoon it was on the cape 
                         station news

                                     hooper
                         they caught a shark not the shark 
                         big difference i couldve proved it 
                         this afternoon by cutting that one 
                         open and examining his stomach 
                         contents also his bite was too 
                         small

               brody has the cork out of the wine pop

                                     hooper
                         i was lucky to find that in town  
                         its an estate bottled vintage year

               brody takes the fine wine and pours it into his drink glass 
               filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes diluted scotch 
               and the wine

                                     hooper
                              as brody pours
                         we ought to let it breathe 
                         whatever

                                     brody
                         lets all have a drink

               he extends the bottle to hooper who politely accepts a token 
               sip he takes some for himself and offers some to ellen

                                     brody

                         is it the bestfunded research 
                         expedition to ever study the shark 
                         around the world in 18 months

                         better than cousteau or compagno 
                         with computers telemetry defense 
                         department funding

                         martin hates boats hates the water 
                         on the ferry to the mainland he 
                         sits in the car the whole way over 
                         hes got this childhood thing theres 
                         a clinical word for it

                                     brody
                         drowning lemme ask you something 
                         is it true most attacks take place 
                         in three feet of water around 10 
                         feet from the beach

                                     hooper
                         yeah like the kid on your beach
                         i wish i couldve examined that shark 
                         they caught

                                     brody
                         something else do most attacks go 
                         unreported

                                     hooper
                         about half of them a lot of missing 
                         swimmers are really shark victims

                                     brody
                         theres a kind of a lone shark 
                         called uh

                                     hooper
                         rogue

                                     brody
                         yeah rogue picks out an area where 
                         theres food and hangs out there as 
                         long as the food supply lasts

                                     hooper
                         its called territoriality its a 
                         theory

                                     brody
                         and before 1900 when people first 
                         starting swimming for recreation 
                         before public bathing and resorts 
                         there were very few shark attacks 
                         cause sharks didnt know what they 
                         were missing

                                     hooper
                         you could say that

               brody digests all this confirmation of facts he has gleaned 
               in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species

               there is a long pause

                                     brody
                         why dont we have one more drink 
                         you and i and then we go down and 
                         cut open that old shark and see for 
                         sure whats inside him or not

                                     ellen
                         can you do that

                                     brody
                         i am chief of police i can do 
                         anything i want
                              to hooper
                         you want to come

                                     hooper
                         im flattered you should ask

               he gets up and they both start out ellen watches them go

               int boat shed  night

               dark spooky shed with shadows of boats and strange 
               silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding at one end the 
               large symmetrical bulk of the sharks carcass lies on a 
               tarp a single dark figure is bending over the dead shark

               the large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open 
               and the shadowy figure moves abruptly away from the shark

               the new entrants move into the shed it is hooper and brody 
               and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on 
               the way over

               as the shadowy figure moves silently into a vantage point 
               against one wall he passes through the light from a window 
               it is quint and we only see him long enough to recognize 
               him as he backs against the wall

                                     hooper
                         and it was dartmouth winter 
                         weekend and she was homecoming queen 
                         and i was her date then she got 
                         into the fact that her family had 
                         more money than my family and she 
                         was right  her greatgrandfather 
                         was in mining and my ancestors were 
                         yankee shipbuilders so we broke up 
                         and i went home with some beatnik 
                         from sarah lawrence

                                     brody
                         what stinks so bad

                                     hooper
                         our friend the shark

               they bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers

                                     hooper
                         we always had a summer place on the 
                         water  newport the vineyard so i 
                         figured id major in something i 
                         knew about oceanography marine 
                         biology it was that or design racing 
                         yachts like my older brother hmmm 
                         he we go up the old alimentary canal 
                         hold the light

               we hear a slurp and a squish as hooper produces a big knife 
               and dips into the shark with a major incision

                                     hooper
                         we open the abdominal cavity and 
                         check the digestive tract simple
                              he attends to his 
                              work

               from his vantage point quint watches unseen by the two 
               men

               brody is holding the light fighting the gag reflex 
               fascinated by the bizarre ritual

                                     brody
                         whats that

                         just as i thought he drifted up 
                         here with the gulf stream from 
                         southern waters

                                     brody

                                     brody
                         he ate a car

                                     hooper
                              laughs
                         no but tiger sharks are the garbage 
                         cans of the ocean they eat anything 
                         but this one didnt eat any people 
                         theres nothing here

               he kicks the remains around below camera

                                     hooper
                         nothing

                                     hooper

                         dont look on land you go out and 
                         chum for him

                                     brody
                         chum

                                     hooper
                         only one sure way to find him  
                         offer him a little something to eat 
                         chum  blood waste meat fish 
                         anything they can sense it miles 
                         away if hes out there we might be 
                         able to get a closer look at him
                              checks his watch
                         its a good time too theyre night 
                         feeders

               ext aboard hoopers boat  night tank

               we see brody looking sick and nervous holding on anxiously 
               as the fascinatin rhythm moves slowly ahead trolling at 
               night his glasses are already flecked with the white salt 
               of dried seawater he is wearing a lifepreserver

               hooper is at the wheel a chart spread in front of him his 
               eyes scanning the sea restlessly checking the dials and 
               gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depthfinding 
               and fishfinder gear mounted in the cockpit a green glow 
               shines from the instruments on his face two closedcircuit 
               tv cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto 
               monitors in the dash

               in the aisle between the seats is a large container filled 
               with unpleasantlooking bait hooper is longlining for signs 
               of shark and chumming

                                     hooper
                              indicating distant 
                              flashing beacon
                         thats the cape light  were on 
                         the stretch where hes feeding if 
                         hes still here

               brody bored tired and slightly queasy is trying to

               damage he comes across a jagged hole twothirds of the way 
               forward

               the hole is about the size of a basketball and the wood 
               around it has been bashed and splintered hooper explores 
               the hole with his hands then takes the knife from its sheath 
               and begins to dig at something whatever it is comes free in

                         there is a kind of shark called a 
                         great white shark that every expert 
                         in the world agrees is a maneater

                         in the waters around amity island 
                         and that he will continue to feed

                         and two deaths in the past few days 
                         it happened like this before in

                         depend on the summer people for our

                         have got to get someone to kill the 
                         shark we need noncorrosive mesh 
                         netting we need scientific support 
                         its gonna cost money just to keep 
                         the nuts out and save what we have

                         it swims up and bites you on the 
                         ass there are only two ways to solve 
                         this thing you can kill it or you 
                         can cut off its food supply

                         come here i want to show you 
                         something

               he leads brody around to the front of the billboard on which 
               we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin in

               two cavernous iron doors then a crack of vertical light as 
               six burly crewmen muscle them apart the amity ferry landing 
               is approaching people in colorful outfits waiting dockside 
               for the first filledtocapacity shuttle of the summer season 
               and 

               bachs little fugue is the musical accompaniment to this 
               wholly visual montage of disembarkation the next two minutes 
               should be treated like a short film taking into account 
               all of the colors episodes faces and behavior of a variety 
               of americans who colonize eastern resort communities for the 
               ninetyday season

               intercut with this montage is brodys home where ellen 
               hooper and brody are in sweaty gritty allout effort to 
               enlist some support elements in this montage include

               j  station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously 
               to the window cadillacs with rear admirals at the helm 
               their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years 
               before

               k  hooper when did he check out did he leave another 
               phone number

               then six blonde and tanned coney island meatballs descend 
               the ramp they all wear mens club lifeguard patches and 
               matching collegiate windbreakers they scour the landing 
               looking for someone to save

               the boat is empty everybody heading inland anticipating 
               the best fourth of july ever already there is debris on the 
               docks and the cleaning crew works away at it

               inside the ferry

               as bachs little fugue ends the six burly crewmen lean their 
               combined weight against the cathedral doors closing out the 
               light and locking in the trade the doors latch shut with a 
               resounding clang

               he is studying everything trying to make sure he has it 
               covered as well as possible he almost doesnt hear the 
               approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down 
               behind him and a flying officer gets out starched pressed

               brody signs the officer shakes his head as brody makes an 
               error

                                     brody

               brody complies shaking his head the officer snaps him a 
               salute jogs lightly back to his idling copter buckles in 
               and gives brody a thumbs up as he lifts off in a flurry of 
               sand and icecream wrappers

               of a campervan he watches in dismay as the family bumbles 
               onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun

               brody addresses his troops such as they are

                                     brody

               he nods to his men who head for some boston whalers or 
               similar boat with surfriding capability and push off into 
               the surf to patrol the swimming areas

               submerges its tail giving a final slap

               angle on quint

               he puts his rod away and stares at it and stares and stares

               hooper is the first to break the silence

               quint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house where 
               he swiftly takes out his green case and opens it to begin 
               to assemble something inside it brody is alone on the deck

               hooper is contained in his own excitement he has finally 
               come up with what he was looking for  an expensive nikon 
               through which he peers intently at the shark alongside he 
               is talking half to himself as he finetunes the range finder 
               and focus

               he is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional

               he snaps off the radio and for good measure pulls the 
               plug from the power source

               angle from deck

               the big shark is slicing through the water just below the 
               surface its fin high the big gray back glistening the 
               teeth gleaming

               angle  including foredeck

               he is positioning martin frantically trying to include brody 
               the shark and the orca in the same frame quint finishes 
               with the gun and as a final gesture snaps an explosive 
               cartridge into the breech he empties the box of cartridges 
               onto the table snatches up a big handful and drops them 
               into a pocket and heads out on deck bound for the bow 
               pulpit

               on deck

               quint appears with the harpoon gun he throws one end of the 
               line to hooper

               quint moves up toward the bow brody goes up to the flying 
               bridge to take the wheel hooper starts for the foredeck 
               but stops to rummage in his kit throwing gear around as he 
               desperately hunts for something

               he finds what hes looking for a small powerful strobe 
               unit waterproofed a miniature signal beacon he triggers 
               it and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in 
               the sun

               hooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light 
               to the first barrel as the shark begins to surface near the 
               bow

                                     quint

                         now

               he guides brody with hand signals brody tries urgently to 
               get it right not to oversteer to try to hold the big boat 
               with its throbbing diesels on the course that quint is 
               indicating

               hooper is rigging like crazy

               from the flying bridge

               brody steering fg hooper on the foredeck with the barrels 
               quint leaning out over the pulpit the gun at the ready the 
               shark crossing inexorably in front of them

               close on quint

               agonizing over his shot as the shark approaches glancing 
               back to see if the line is properly rigged and hooper is 
               clear of it

                                     quint
                         get clear damn you

               the shark is in position hooper shouts a moment too late

                         clear

               quint fires the harpoon slams into the shark behind his 
               head halfway along the back in front of the big dorsal 
               fin

               the rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion hooper jumps 
               back and the barrel leaps out of its rack pulled by the 
               line rigged to the harpoon it bounds forward and into the 
               sea past quint who is already reloading mounting another 
               steel shaft in the distance the barrel bobs and skips 
               violently in the water dragged by the shark in his merciless 
               moves

               the foredeck  quint

                                     quint

                         keg for a while he cant stay down 
                         with that on

               hooper furious with himself runs for the flying bridge to 
               take the helm from brody

               the flying bridge brody and hooper

               hooper has snatched the wheel and is ramming the throttle 
               forward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn

                                     hooper
                              to quint
                         rig another keg im bringing her 
                         around

               his eyes dart about the ocean looking for the barrel as he 
               hotdogs the ship around in a violent expression of his own 
               disgust with himself

                                     hooper
                              to himself
                         god damn it we had him
                              to quint
                         im coming about

               he spins the wheel again trying to make the big boat handle 
               like a formula speedster the decks tip and the rigging sways 
               under the sudden strain brody is caught unaware and tumbles 
               off his feet sliding across the deck to fetch up against a 
               wall the m1 rifle is close to his hand he stares at it

               from the flying bridge

               hooper is anguished intense trying to find the shark 
               spinning the wheel compounding his error tipping the boat 
               in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake quint has turned 
               his back to the sea and is in the pulpit looking up at 
               hooper staring at him excluding everything else

               as quint folds his arms and stares at hooper we realize the 
               sun is going down and its getting dark

                                     brody
                         why dont we go in get another crack 
                         at him tomorrow

                         lose him we stay out here until we 
                         find him

               hooper throttles back and the roar of the diesels subsides 
               and the boat resumes an even keel slowly circling the ocean

                                     brody
                         lets call in  we can radio and

               ext orca  open sea  night

               throttled back to slow ahead the boat circles the water 
               endlessly staying over the shark like an avenging angel 
               its running lights gleam in the night and a glow lights the 
               interior of the pilot house a bright strobe glints on the 
               water winking once like a firefly

               int pilot house  night

               he corrects course slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight

               hooper is sitting at the table morose brody is staring at 
               a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew or some other 
               crappy rations quint has on board dirty spoons stuck in the 
               open cans show us this has not been a formal dinner quint 
               fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home 
               brew

               he takes a pull and hands it to hooper who takes a double

               brody touches the fresh abrasion on his forehead where the 
               fishing rod caught him

               quint bends forward and pulls his hair aside to show something 
               near the crown

                         yeah the uss indianapolis
                         june 29th 1945 three and a half 
                         minutes past midnight two torpedoes 
                         from a japanese submarine slammed 
                         into our side two or three we was 
                         still under sealed orders after 
                         deliverin the bombthe hiroshima 
                         bombwe was goin back across the 
                         pacific from tinian to leyte damn 
                         near eleven hundred men went over 
                         the side the life boats was lashed 
                         down so tight to make the bomb run 
                         we couldnt cut a single one adrift 
                         not one and there was no rafts 
                         none that vessel sank in twelve 
                         minutes yes thats all she took 
                         we didnt see the first shark till 
                         wed been in the water about an hour 
                         a thirteenfooter near enough a 
                         blue you measure that by judgin 
                         the dorsal to the tail what we didnt 
                         know of course the captain knewi 
                         guess some officers knew was the 
                         bomb mission had been so secret no 
                         distress signals was sent what the 
                         men didnt know was that they wouldnt 
                         even list us as overdue for a week 
                         well i didnt know that  i wasnt 
                         an officer  just as well perhaps 
                         so some of us were dead already  
                         in the water  just hangin limp in 
                         our lifejackets and several already 
                         bleedin and the three hundred or 
                         so laying on the bottom of the ocean 
                         as the light went the sharks came 
                         crusin we formed tight groups  
                         somewhat like squares in an old battle  
                         you know what i mean  so that when 
                         one come close the man nearest would 
                         yell and shout and pound the water 
                         and sometimes it worked and the fish 
                         turned away but other times that 
                         shark would seem to look right at a 
                         man  right into his eyes  and in 
                         spite of all shoutin and poundin 
                         youd hear that terrible high 
                         screamin and the ocean would go 
                         red then churn up as they ripped 
                         him  then wed reform our little 
                         squares by the first dawn the sharks 
                         had taken more than a hundred hard 
                         for me to count but more than a 
                         hundred i dont know how many sharks 
                         maybe a thousand i do know they 
                         averaged six men an hour all kinds  
                         blues makos tigers all kinds
                              pause
                         in the middle of the second day 
                         some of us started to go crazy from 
                         the thirst one fella cried out he 
                         saw a river another claimed he saw 
                         a waterfall some started to drink 
                         the ocean and choked on it and some 
                         left our little groups  our little 
                         squares  and swam off alone lookin 
                         for islands and the sharks always 
                         took them right away it was mainly 
                         the young fellas that did that  
                         the older ones stayed where they

               ext ocean  night

               quint has just finished his story and we are looking across 
               the quiet night sea to the orca slowly circling in the night 
               the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figures 
               of the three men inside the red and green running lights 
               winking along the ships flanks we hear the distant boom 
               and drawnout hoot of a whale

               int orca pilot house  night

                                     brody

                         its a whale out there

               theres a brief eerie pause quint breaks the silence by 
               muttering into song which he slowly swells

                         tired and i want to go to bed i had 
                         a little drink about an hour ago 
                         and it went right to my head
                              etc

               gradually hooper and brody join in and the pilothouse 
               becomes a warm cozy place

               ext ocean

               the orca and its song in the night in the foreground the 
               barrel and strobe light flash up into view and behind them 
               the big dorsal fin surfaces and glides ominously towards 
               the ship

               int pilot house

               the song is continuing and we hear the barest hint of a 
               scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men quints 
               eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first to 
               hear the abrasion of his ship things vibrate on the shelves

               quint stops singing hooper and brody continue a duet the 
               scraping repeats and hooper now senses it he drops out of 
               the song leaving brody singing solo

                              quietly to hooper
                         start the engines

               as brody hears this and is about to stop singing the boat 
               is suddenly bumped from below and the gentle scraping turns 
               to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of the 
               vessel water bubbles up into the hold brody starts and 
               looks at the radio he is about to move towards it when 
               quints urgent instructions stop him

               he leaves brody in the pilot house and runs onto the deck 
               grabbing his m1 rifle as he goes brody hits a switch and 
               we hear the pumps starting

               angle on the orca

               hooper is on the flybridge starting the engines but the 
               diesels sound wrong

               hooper and brody join in from their respective positions

               the men in place singing the water sparkling towards the 
               horizon the stars twinkling above the sound of a distant 
               whale in distant counterpoint

               ext the orca  dawn

               brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge while hooper and 
               quint have a hatch up on the stern and are working together 
               to repair the damaged rudder controls torn loose by the shark 
               hooper is bucking the steel rod while quint is hammering 
               away at the joint trying to drive a new pin

               the engine is idling bits of iron clutter the deck along 
               with a few rough outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets

               brodys point of view  the water

               the barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them just off the 
               port side they are drifting up to it

               everything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up 
               on them

               shifts his pole takes hold of the rope poling it in

               hooper gets the line and starts hauling it up no resistance

               it comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck  
               he and quint exchange looks

               direction fully unfastened from the barrel comes the great 
               white first the fin then the conical nose and the upper 
               border of wide grinning teeth it knifes through the water 
               in absolute silence propelling itself with tremendous speed

               the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed
               off cable it rolls on its side and looks at them as it 
               passes

               past the stern the huge tail lashes out ripping the rope 
               out of quints hands shearing a huge swath through the paint 
               peeling it off like a plane taking one of the bronze letters 
               out of orca the shark begins an arc to sea its fin cutting 
               the water and starts circling the boat quint notices his

               brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard and 
               the barrel changing over catapults into the air before 
               plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash

               police combat pistol stance holding his 357 in both hands

               quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this as the

               at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated

               stretched too taut they jump out of the way falling flat

               on the deck as the ropes sweep over them knocking over 
               objects skeetering across the deck a tight jerking motion 
               and the orca is dragged through the water  backwards and 
               much too fast water is splashing up over the transom in its 
               backward wake the engines groan and complain

               quint tosses brody the hand pump then picks up his m1 and 
               checks the load

               the barrels approaching the orca dip below the surface one

               brody looks around hooper on the flying bridge searching in 
               all directions quint is looking more appalled every second

                              helplessly

                         on him where is he

                                     brody
                         have you ever had one do this

                              and he means this
                         no

               booming thud at the keel brody slides on the wet deck and 
               quint loses his footing falling into brodys arms

               with hooper on the fly bridge

               it seems the only place out of reach of the shark quint 
               climbs up brody following him reloading his pistol

               just then the barrels pop up ahead veer left and duck 
               under

                              points wildly

               the barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow 
               sliding under the orca seemingly endless violent scraping 
               sounds

                                     brody
                         hes trying to sink us

                         dead astern zigzag

               quint is grimly silent brody senses that quint is in the 
               fight of and for his life

               the orca taking evasive action but the three barrels are 
               closing the gap the engines coughing and missing destroying 
               themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft

                         brody
                 hes chasing us i 
                 dont believe it

               angle on the bridge

               hooper is jamming the throttle forward but the engine is 
               pounding and knocking wildly the barrels circle and move 
               in quint has his rifle ready

                                     hooper
                              suddenly giving quint 
                              the wheel
                         hold her

               he leaps to his gear trying desperately to get his dart 
               gun

               just then the shark attacks breaking water and rising over 
               the boat like a rocket snout jaws pectoral fins belly 
               falling sideways a vast spray drenches the men quint fires 
               into the belly the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness

                                     hooper
                              loading
                         keep him there keep him

               the orca shudders from side to side from hoopers point of 
               view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws 
               shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to 
               side trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull quint has 
               reloaded and is firing into the fish brody has a wicked 
               pointed gaff and is swinging wildly at the snout gashing 
               and gouging it trying for the eyes the killing lust is on 
               all three men

                                     quint
                         throttling back

               the boat surges the shark gives a final unbalances wrench 
               and disengages the dorsal fin circles off beginning a wide 
               loop around the boat

               the engine quivers and dies the boat without power rolling 
               half awash a wounded victim

               the fin dips the barrels follow the shark disappears beneath 
               the waves there is complete silence

               the three men on deck

               in the dead quiet we can hear the lap of waves against the 
               hull the hoarse panting breathing of the men the pings and 
               pops of the cooling dying engines

               quint and the transom

               he eyes the stern huge cracks and broken timber testify to 
               the fury of the attack

                                     quint
                              very quietly to 
                              hooper
                         what can that gun of yours do

                         kill him but i gotta be close  
                         very close

                                     brody
                              the awful realization
                         you gotta go in the water

                                                                    cut to

               on deck later

               quint and hooper are assembling the shark cage its shiny 
               bars the only undamaged things on deck brody is working 
               too bolting the sections together

                                     hooper
                              in command now
                         rig the cable to the roof eyebolts

               the men are speaking in near whispers quiet in the silence 
               that surrounds them hooper is in his wet suit adjusting 
               weights mask tanks etc the cage is standing in the stern

               quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section

               hooper climbs in though the top

                                     hooper
                         take me up

               brody cranks the winch hoisting cage and hooper into the 
               air quint balances the gin pole lines hooper crouching in 
               the cage examining it for stresses satisfied he holds out 
               his hand quint puts the spear gun into it

               close on hooper in the cage

               he examines his weapon checking the power load with the 
               big wickedlooking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor 
               point

                                     hooper
                         lower away chief
                              then to quint
                         try and keep him off me till im 
                         under

               hooper inside looking out the bars of the cage gives brody 
               a reassuring smile then pops his mouthpiece between his 
               teeth and checks his regulator brody steps back and with 
               quint guiding the cage begins lowering it off the gin pole 
               boom arm into the sea alongside the boat

               brody and hooper stare at each another as their faces pass 
               hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean

               as hooper disappears beneath the surface quint and brody 
               exchange a long look between them

               underwater  cage

               hoopers point of view

               submerging the sky horizon water line clean fresh sea 
               air then the magnificent innerspaces with bubbles 
               sparkling in front of us

               angle  hooper in the cage

               as he floats to twenty feet hooper never stops looking around 
               360 degrees he removes the rubber guard from the needle and 
               waits

               ext the surface  brody and quint

               their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still 
               circling

               suddenly both heads stop turning

               the sea

               the barrels have come to a stop delicately they change 
               course and meander toward the lowered cage

               underwater  hooper

               his back is to us he is just now completing a visual sweep 
               and turns eyes front into closeup and fixes wildly on 
               something monstrous and fascinating

               hoopers point of view

               the water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in 
               the blue from the deep gloom  diving slowly smoothly  
               comes the shark it moves with no apparent effort sinuous 
               beyond comparison as it nears the cage it turns and its 
               ghastly length passes right in front of him first the snout 
               then the jaw slack and smiling then the black eye

               hooper tentatively reaches out it is too far for the 
               strychnine pole the vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes 
               iron scars gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge 
               the passing currents with pink

               surface

               the trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the orca 
               above brody and quint leap back

               hooper  close

               the shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt hooper 
               expecting the shark to attack out of that same general 
               direction braces himself pole extended through the bars 
               breathing faster straining his eyes into the gloom and 
               we see that the shark attacking from behind him

               the cage is sent careening hooper grabs the bars for dear 
               life the shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal 
               jaws shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side bending 
               the bars like clothes hangers hooper cant turn the pointed 
               end of the pole around his body jammed as far away from the 
               nonrational attacker as possible

               hooper is trapped

               the shark withdraws to get some running room then charges 
               again the bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars 
               the jaws snapping and twisting two feet from hoopers torso 
               the tail thrusting it forward hooper drops the strychnine 
               pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture 
               depth

               all the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating 
               hooper at the waistline through frantic bubbles hooper 
               fumbles with the overhead hatch cover kicking up and out of 
               the cage the shark backpedals with its tail but the broad 
               head wont shake loose

               hooper rushes downwards after the strychnine pole

               angle  shark

               the shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after 
               hooper

               hooper nearly recovers the pole again it slips from his 
               frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss  
               hooper turns and looks up

               the great white is lunging at him twenty feet above

               surface

               one of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls 
               taut

               hooper  deep

               turning to meet the monster which  though held back for a 
               moment by the snarled rope  now surges forward

               surface  brody and quint

               the orca is listing dangerously aft the ginpole bent almost 
               to the breaking point brody is in a frenzy trying to haul 
               up the cage quint attaches the end of brodys rope to a 
               handwinch the ginpole is splitting

                                     quint
                         let go of it

               the pole gives way the rope whipping down on the gunwale 
               the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the orca dragging 
               it but quint wont give up the winch brody hauls on the 
               rope barehanded

               underwater  hooper

               maneuvering downward away from the jaws suddenly the 
               crazed shark veers upward for the surface

               surface  quint

               the winch is working faster now quint demonically winding 
               it in the crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks 
               water

               brody is horrified the cage is empty

                         quint
                    a horrible scream
                 hes comin up  

                                                       brody
                                               hes taken him

               master angle

               the shark breaks water right beside the orca rising with a 
               great whooshing noise it rises vertically towering overhead 
               blocking out the sun the pectoral fins seem to reach forward  
               the shark in all of its monstrous glory falls onto the 
               stern of the boat with a shattering crash narrowly missing 
               quint and brody it drives the stern underwater the ocean 
               pours in over the transom the jaws snap from side to side  
               brody flounders backwards away from it

               close  brody

               he is clinging to the mast for dear life as the ship begins 
               to tilt to stern and everything starts to break loose around 
               him

               nightmare angle  deck of the orca

               the giant jaws are snapping irresistibly at everything great 
               chunks of wood torn out of the deck and superstructure

               deck chair irons rope gear beercans bottles brodys 
               bag all are food for the insatiable maw blindly churning 
               away

               quint is clinging next to a rack of lances he is enraged at 
               this ultimate violation of his territory he snatches up a 
               lance and hurls himself at the shark with a wordless bellow

               the great head weaves side to side the deck is at a 
               treacherous incline slippery with blood and seawater quints 
               footing falters and slips he stumbles at the mouth of hell 
               the big teeth seize him and snap

               quints roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is 
               clamped between the grinding sawing teeth and his head and 
               legs suddenly contort as the sharks teeth meet across his 
               torso blood gushes onto the deck the remnants of his body 
               tumble from the sharks mouth

               brody sees the horror hears the screams  in his 
               desperation he tears loose one of hoopers remaining air 
               tanks and hurls it at the monster it tumbles into the bloody 
               well wedging across the back of the mouth the thick steel 
               blocking the cruel jaws

               the sharks head shakes even more violently trying to clear 
               the cold iron but the tank is in to stay

               deck of the orca listing badly

               to avoid sliding into the jaws brody scrambles on the titling 
               deck bracing himself in the cabin door to avoid pitching 
               down into the bloody mouth he fights his way into the cabin 
               already a shambles

               below him on the deck the shark lunges again shifting 
               weight so that the boat in now stern down and listing to 
               the side water from the sea pours into the cabin

               another lunge by the shark the huge snout and jaws slam up 
               against the doorframe blocking escape bloody gnashing

               more seawater to stay in the cabin is to go down with the 
               ship

               brody clambers as far from the shark as he can against the 
               forward wall of the pilothouse he sees the window hooper 
               used before its blocked by barrels and debris he breaks 
               the side window highest above the water edges out onto the 
               battered bridge

               the shark rolls around now half in the water the ship is 
               sinking the sea is not a viable alternative brody climbs 
               up into the flying bridge

               the shark is still lunging and snapping brody is forced to 
               climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath 
               him

               close  brody

               he scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge sees the m
               1 stuck there seizes it

               over brody looking down at the stern

               he is bracing himself aiming the rifle taking a bead on 
               the steel tanks silver gleaming in the bloody sharks mouth  
               he fires and fires bullets shatter the sharks teeth 
               punching holes in the dripping snout

               wide on the orca – explosion

               with a muffled boom the perfect symmetry of the shark is 
               suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as brodys 
               shot hits the pressurized tank a 30foot cloud of water 
               steel shark and debris covers the sky

               a gigantic convulsion hurls the great whites mangled body 
               into the sea the orca slowly begins to turn over in its 
               death roll

               underwater

               the sharks carcass floating down in a cloud of blood and 
               debris

               a shadow clouds the waters and the orcas mass begins to 
               slip into the frame

               close  hooper

               emerging from beneath the surface he raises his mask spits 
               out his mouthpiece and kicks toward brody

               surface  brody and hooper

               brody is holding onto a cushion barely afloat relieved the 
               shark is dead yet stunned to see hooper is still alive the 
               two men share weak laughter which soon trails off

               they swim through the debris using two barrels as floats 
               as dozens of seagulls feast on shark remains on the surface

               high shot from shore

               the two tiny miserable heroes swim ashore as the credits 
               roll
