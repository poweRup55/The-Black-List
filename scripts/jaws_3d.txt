				philip
		unhappy combination  most likely
		ones inside the other

				kathryn
		sharks are manbiters mister
		hutton  not maneaters 

				philip
			cutting her off
		thats a load of codswopple  a
		great white doesnt fear man  it
		doesnt fear beast  its an orgy
		of food and blood

				kathryn
		i think we can capture it  id
		like to try

				philip
		thats preposterous

				calvin
		go on doctor

				kathryn
		no ones ever caught a great white
		except indirectly in fishing nets
		i want to dart it and keep it
		alive

				calvin
		it would make a marvelous
		attraction  the only great
		white in captivity

				kathryn
			confidently
		i can get it

				philip
		you can get killed

				kathryn
		ive handled sharks before
		bigger than this one

				philip
		calvin let me go down there
		and kill the bastard

				kathryn
		no

				philip
			continuing to calvin
		itll chop up half a million
		dollars of your tropical fish
		in two minutes

				kathryn
		calvin i insist i be allowed
		to capture it

				philip
		three hundred million years of
		evolution have created the
		greatest butcher the worlds
		ever known

				kathryn
		its one of the worlds greatest
		creatures

				philip
		a shark could have a hundred
		embryos in its sack  you know
		how many are born  maybe five
		they eat each other before birth
		theyre born killers

				kathryn
		the only great white in captivity
		calvin  all those people

	the dolphins speed them to the opening of the galleon
	hold where they let go of the fins and kick down fast
	into the hold as the dolphins wheel around to attack
	the shark again

	mike and kathryn swimming downward toward camera
	they kick into the dark hold camera pulling down from
	them stopping  they swim past camera and in the next
	moment the berserk shark appears trying to follow
	them into the hold  it cant get through the opening
	too small but shatters part of the framing


397	mike and kathryn							397

	ducking away from and pushing aside large falling
	pieces of lumber  they look up reacting as they see


398	their pov  the shark							398

	lunging down into the opening again breaking off more
	of the hold framing


399	mike and kathryn							399

	evading more falling wood backing away as they look up
	at


400	the shark								400

	trying once more getting stuck in the hold opening
	which is now enlarged enough for it to wedge in part
	of its enormous form

	trying to get into the hold all the way the two
	dolphins butting its side


402	mike and kathryn							402

	arm pulls her further into the body of the sunken hull
	camera panning	 to show them moving toward the hole in
	the ships side

405	the shark								405

	still in the opening to the hold trying to break
	through the dolphins still butting its sides


406	mike and kathryn							406

	look at each other then abruptly decide and kick
	upward camera with them  as they move toward the
	surface they look down at


407	the shark								407

	starting to back out of the opening it has battered
	into the hold entrance


408	mike and kathryn							408

	kicking upward as fast as they can go


409	surface									409

	as they break through looking down


410	what they see  the shark						410

	coming up at them


411	mike and kathryn							411

	not knowing what to do  they start spasmodically as
	the two dolphins rush up from beneath the water and
	appear nearby  without a word mike and kathryn grab
	the dolphins dorsal fins and the dolphins start to
	rush them away


412	the chase								412

	shots alternating between mike and kathryn being pulled
	along by the dolphins and the giant shark pursuing them
	getting closer and closer  when it becomes apparent that
	the shark is going to overtake them the dolphins make a
	sharp turn and elude its heavier straightforward impetus
	seeing where they are mike points downward  kathryn hits
	bobby on the side and he dives abruptly  daisy follows


413	underwater								413

	the dolphins diving with mike and kathryn as they put
	their mouthpieces back in  we see that they are outside
	the control room the men inside looking out at them in
	shock  mike lets go of the fin and swims to the lock
	gesturing for kathryn to do the same  she does and
	both take refuge in the concrete recess as the shark
	zooms into frame from behind camera rushing at them


414	inside the recess							414

	as the huge shark comes at them  mike activates the
	outer door of the lock and they are washed in just as
	the shark smashes its head against the concrete jaws
	missing their feet by inches


415	int lock								415

	the shark still trying to get at them  mike shuts the
	outer door and starts to drain the water from the lock
	as it comes below their heads they pull out their
	mouthpieces and look at each other with dazed relief
	he puts his arms around her and they lean their fore
	heads together breathing hard  the water is out of
	the lock in seconds  inside men activate the inner door


416	int control room							416

	as mike and kathryn are helped in by the technicians
	one of them looks toward the os window suddenly

				man
		oh my god

	they whirl and look


417	the shark								417

	coming straight at the window as fast as it can  with
	a deafening crash it hits the window and the glass is
	shattered a wall of water roaring in


418	full shot  mike and kathryn and the men				418

	swept across the control room by the giant wave of
	water flung around  one man is smashed against a wall
	and killed  several others make it to the door getting
	out just before the water slams it shut


419	mike and kathryn							419

	putting their mouthpieces in again as the control room
	fills with water  they look toward

	with one of the technicians in its jaws and is sub
	dividing him

	starts flooding  a tape bank topples  crushing
	female technician


422	impaled shark								422

	thrashes violently working its way in  its caught
	on a huge section of thick glass piercing its side


423	mike and kathryn							423

	staring at the shark  suddenly the air in mikes tank
	runs out and reacting he taps kathryns arm  she sees
	his problem takes a deep breath and gives him her
	mouthpiece  they look toward the window at a loud sound


424	their pov  the shark							424

	still very much alive throwing its gigantic weight
	forward getting closer and closer to camera each
	violent lurch cutting its side open more blood pouring
	from the jagged rent


425	angle past shark on mike and kathryn					425

	as it gets closer and closer to them  they back away
	are blocked by a console


426	angle past mike and kathryn						426

	showing the shark closer yet  despite the impaling
	blade of glass despite the internal injuries the
	shark  in seconds  will have them


427	close on mike and kathryn						427

	sharing the mouthpiece huddled together helpless now
	then kathryns eyes widen both react


428	the shark								428

	shaking its head as it inches forward jaws open wide


429	mike and kathryn							429

	drawing back  kathryn screams


430	the shark								430

	emerging from its maw is philips body


431	philips body								431

	we see the grenade locked in his fist


432	mike									432

	quickly grasps a metal strip from the tape bank and
	fashions a crude hook

433	mike									433

	times his move perfectly and knocks the grenade out of
	philips locked fist  the grenade comes to rest between
	the sharks teeth  kathryn gives mike some air then


434	mike									434

	leaps forward and snatches the grenade out of the
	sharks mouth


435	mike									435

	hurriedly wraps a metal strip around the grenade


436	kathryn									436

	acts as a decoy and lures the sharks attention as


437	mike									437

	pulls the grenade pin and

	shoves grenade

	into the distracted sharks mouth


438	mike grabs kathryn							438

	and they roll behind a control room desk and computer
	terminal console


439	full shot shark								439

	as the shark is blown out backward through the window
	opening torn in half by the explosion its massive
	remains starting to slide toward the lagoon bottom
	turning the water crimson


440	mike and kathryn							440

	grabbing the stunned kathryn mike pulls her to the
	window and out starting upward through the bloody
	water


441	underwater  mike and kathryn						441

	sharing the air they slowly float to the surface
	buddybuddy breathing


442	surface									442

	mike and kathryn break through  helping each other
	they make their way over to a camera pylon


443	mike and kathryn							443

	cling to the pylon and each other


444	kathryn									444

	suddenly looks alarmed as she remembers

				kathryn
		bobby and daisy

	mike looks about no sign of the dolphins


445	kathryn									445

	slaps the water hard three times
	no dolphins
	she does it again
	and again


446	kathryn									446

	and now in total anger and frustration she pounds the
	water like rocky on the punching bag until she is
	drained and kathryn breaks down sobbing as mike holds
	her trying to comfort her


447	dolphins								447

	come shooting to the surface   theyre banged and
	bruised but are chirping excitedly and as happy to
	see kathryn and mike as they are to see them


448	dolphins								448

	slowly swim around the hugging mike and kathryn as
	camera pulls up to show the sea kingdom in all its
	entirety safe at last
