		     title sequence  under water  night

		     as titles and music play we move
		     slowly beneath the water off the
		     coast of amity

		     we swim beneath a dock threading
		     our way through pilings

		     we move through the water swimming
		     just swimming with all the time in
		     the world

		     we move over some junk  the 
		     rusting front end of an automobile
		     were going somewhere

		     the water becomes shallow and we
		     stop  up through the surface the
		     images distorted we see the lights
		     of a townamity

		     we move on swimming again just
		     swimming moving through the water
		     until suddenly the water swirls
		     with motion around us  we experience
		     the sensation of turning and then
		     we see it the eyeand for a
		     moment we think were going to
		     see more

		     but all we see as titles end is
		     the eye

6	the docks  dusk to night

	a huge banner is stretched above the docks  it reads
	amity annual christmas pageant

	the combined forces of the high school band chorus and
	dramatic society are in the process of rehearsing their
	musical version of the birth of christ  their director
	mr tarkanian is jumping about trying to organize things

		   joseph  wheres your robe  jesus

8	the bay  night							
	8

	the boat moves slowly toward the channel  sean looks
	back and sees the lights and activity on the dock and
	smiles a little then turns his attention to the job at
	hand switching on the boats spotlight using it to cut
	through the accumulating darkness

9	the channel  night						
	9

	sean brings the boat to the channel marker with its small
	blinking red light and kills the engine and examines the
	huge piece of dock piling most of which is beneath the sur
	face  its lodged against the marker so heavy in the water
	that its not moving an inch  hardly more than a shadow
	his face just barely illuminated by the occasional dull red
	light sean gathers the towline and begins trying to secure
	it to the piling a difficult job in the cold which
	requires him to lean out over the side as far as he can

	the band is heard starting up on the dock gradually col
	lecting itself until it sounds like one playing the first
	noel  a few moments later the choir begins singing it

	suddenly the water explodes up around him violently and the
	boat rocks in the shock of it and a dark form is seen for
	an instant and sean disappears from our view  the boats
	spotlight rocks crazily  then the turmoil of the water dies
	and all is calm and the singing from the dock is heard
	clearly again

	sean holding onto his shredded sleeve and coat bleeding
	profusely has fallen  to a corner of the stern  he looks
	off toward the dock and opens his mouth to call for help
	but nothing comes out  the music grows louder as the band
	and chorus find their confidence

	then a tremendous surge of water explodes upward and the
	dark form is seen again for an instant and our view of
	sean is lost  when we can see again sean and a corner
	of the stern are gone

	for a moment sean is seen holding onto the piece of dock
	piling with his remaining arm  he cries out for help but
	its lost in the swelling sound of the christmas carol
	coming from the dock  then sean and the pole disappear
	beneath the surface  hes just gone  a few moments later
	the pole pops back to the surface  in the rocking
	spotlight from the boat the clear outline of the sharks
	jaws can be seen where its taken a chunk of it  in the
	stillness of the night the band and chorus suddenly stop

				   tarkanian os
			   yelling his
			   patience
			   exhausted
		   get the star higher  higher  and
		   where the hell are the wisemen

10	int police station  day

	ellen in shock moves down a corridor with lenny seans
	boss the chief  he holds her arm as they move to a back
	room of the station  polly and a handful of townspeople
	watch sadly from the other end

				   lenny

	theres a slight bulge beneath it  ellen moves to the
	table  lenny moves to get ahead of her

				   lenny
		   i wish there was some way to make it
		   easy

	ellen still in shock watches as lenny pulls back the sheet
	she goes rigid staring at seans remains without expression
	he glances at her then puts the sheet back  she doesnt 
	move  he moves to an old desk which sits in a corner and
	takes up a package  seans service revolver in his holster
	and his badge are on top of it  he brings them to her

				   lenny
			   continuing
		   his things

	she looks dully at lenny then at the package staring at
	the service revolver

				   lenny
			   continuing

	she takes what he offers and leaves

	temperature has suddenly dropped thirty degrees and she
	looks out over the water feeling something which fills her
	with fear

				   ellen
		   sometimes i think im going crazy

		   it could have been an accident

				   ellen
			   looking at him
		   it was no accident

				   hoagie
		   im not saying youre wrong just

	altitude

				   ellen
		   what are you doing

				   hoagie
		   if you dont take it well be

	she hesitates then grabs the wheel in front of her and he
	puts a hand on one of hers and guides the wheel back so the
	plane levels off  shes gripping the wheel so tightly her
	knuckles are turning white

				   hoagie
			   continuing
		   easy does it  hold her gently

				   hoagie
		   in the hut sitting on a pole was a
		   shrunken head  my head  me

	she glances at him then looks ahead not sure whether shes
	should be nervous about the planes behavior

				   hoagie
			   continuing
		   it was like looking into one of those
		   mirrors which says objects may be
		   closer than they appear  chief
		   said there are two of everybody in
		   the world and since we already have
		   one of you the other one can go

		   its wonderful

	she eases the plane into more of a turn and enjoys the

	just fine

				   hoagie
		   you are crazy ellen  no matter

	a native festival a parade filled with masked and costumed
	dancers and musicians and marchers blasts its way through
	the ancient narrow streets of an early bahamian settlement

	hoagie wearing a windbreaker and ellen whos changed her
	clothes thread their way through the throng moving like
	salmon upstream against the flow of the mass of humanity
	moving the other way  shes fascinated by the music and
	noise and color of whats around her

				   hoagie
			   yelling
		   a few more streets

	she casts a smile at him then returns her attention to the 
	parade  hoagie navigates them through the crowd

	hoagie leads ellen up a street no wider than an alley  the

				   michael os
		   i wish you wouldnt say that

				   jake
		   what

				   michael os
		   spades a garden tool

	jake looks up from his clipboard and sees staring at him
	the dead black eye of a fish whose pupil looks to be about
	the size of a bowling ball  he freezes staring back at it

				   michael os
			   continuing
		   trouble with you jake is you have
		   no sense of humor

				   jake
			   finding

75	the barge  day

	michael stands to scan the water and the shark explodes out
	of the water over the low side of the barge passing within
	a few feet of clarence who freezes his mouth open with
	terrified surprise and goes straight for michael who
	throws himself to the deck  the shark misses him by inches
	unable to close its great jaws about him because of the
	width of the barge  as quickly as it appeared the shark
	is gone

76	the street  day						
	76

	hoagie and ellen fight their way across the street through
	the festival parade  the noise is deafening

	suddenly ellen stops  she shudders as she did on the beach
	hoagie looks back and sees her and threads his way to her
	bumping into several dancers as he goes  shes staring off
	into the distance seeing something beyond the reach of her
	vision

				   hoagie
		   whats wrong

				   ellen
		   nothing

	she looks at him and manufactures a smile

				   ellen
			   continuing
		   im fine

				   hoagie
		   no youre not

				   ellen
		   im terrific come on

	she grabs his hand and pulls him into a group of dancers
	picking up their rhythm trying desperately to get into
	it  hes forced to dance with her though every bone in
	his body resists the idea

				   hoagie
			   yelling above
			   the din
		   give it up

	she ignores him throwing every ounce of energy she has
	into the dancing

				   hoagie
			   continuing
			   yelling
		   you cant keep doing this

	again she ignores him and hes bumped into and they lose
	each other for a moment  she dances on and he has to run
	to catch her  he takes her arm and stops her

				   hoagie
			   continuing
		   i cant keep doing this

	the merrymakers pass around them like a river rushes past
	a rock  a band passes them and they can hardly hear
	themselves think

				   ellen
			   shouting
		   you promised me a drink

				   hoagie
			   shouting back
		   sharks come and go ellen  people
		   dont have anything to do with it

				   ellen
			   shouting
		   the kind with an umbrella in it

				   hoagie
		   give it up kick it in the ass
		   get on with your life

	the band passes and the noise settles momentarily to a
	dull roar as more dancers move around them

				   hoagie
			   continuing
		   i know what youre going through
		   the nightmares will go away
			   grins
		   i ever tell you about the time i flew
		   the pandas from china to a zoo  the
		   lady panda fell in love with me

	ellen starts to laugh  she cant stop herself  the music
	grows louder  he holds out his hand and she looks at it
	then takes it and they look at each other for a long moment

				   hoagie
			   continuing
		   a drink with an umbrella in it

	jake the pole held high watches as the shark gets closer
	his body tensing as he gets ready

	michael is rigid mesmerized with the approaching shark his
	expression filled with what hes wondering  will it try to
	get him

				   jake
		   you remember how to pull a rope

	michael looks at jake blankly then stares at the oncoming
	shark which comes closer and closer then at the last
	moment rolls to its side and opens its great jaws and goes
	for the horse meat

	jake waits until the sharks underside is at its most exposed
	then rams the pole into it then pulls it back quickly

			   continuing

		   know why  blushing suits you

				   ellen
		   im sorryi

				   hoagie
		   theres nothing to be sorry about

				   ellen
		   the whole idea is preposterous

	his expression takes on the color of his feelings  he
	likes this woman a lot

				   hoagie
		   i dont think so

	shes flustered and unsure how to respond

				   ellen
			   finally

		   maybe the gear crapped out

				   jake
		   if you hadnt been gassing about

	expression a mirror of his her hands behind her back her
	tiny feet spread apart exactly like his  he scratches his
	cheek unconsciously and she does the same  she checks his
	facial expression and resets hers

	he sighs and she sighs and he hears and looks down
	surprised to see her then noticing that shes assumed his
	body posture in every way  he makes a funny face and she
	makes one back and he smiles and she returns it

				   thea
		   uncle sean could make funny faces

	he snatches her up off the floor and hugs her holding onto
	her tightly

	drink then sits and returns to the writing of his report
	on their conch project  there are several open textbooks
	and several notebooks in front of them

	the shark hits the sub again his great jaws tearing into the

	raked with cuts  michael eyes it then the nearby wreck
	and pushes himself free of the sub swimming as fast as he
	can toward the freighter  the shark turns and starts after
	him closing the distance rapidly as michael makes for an

	coming from one end  he turns and looks back at the hole
	the shark is gone  he looks up and down the corridor then
	starts swimming away from the light

	the corridor begins to turn dark as a huge black shadow
	fills the other end

	michael senses something and looks back and sees the shadow
	of the shark against the wall  he freezes as the shadow
	moves toward him finally covering his face

	the shark comes closer and michael starts backing up  the
	shark moves closer almost lazily opening its jaws as it
	prepares to devour him  michael keeps backing up then
	trips and falls backwards through a door his arms coming
	up as he tries to stop himself

	his fall takes him down into a room  light floods into it
	from above  he gathers himself and looks up

	theres no sign of the shark  he looks about quickly taking
	measure of his situation then the light above is blacked out
	as the shark swims slowly over the room  michael watches
	barely breathing until the light returns  he listens and
	looks and waits  the silence builds  where the hell is it

	and heads back across the water in front of them

	cloth comes free of the statue the crowd breaks into loud
	anticipatory applause  it covers ellens scream  she
	starts running for the beach yelling as she goes   the fin

	ellen searches the water for the shark  she puts the boat
	into a long slow turn  all she can see is the endless
	expanse of ocean around her

137	the water  day							
	137

	the boat is seen from the surface from the point of view
	of something following her keeping pace with her

	the shark is stalking her

	hoagie michael and jake fly on in search of ellen

	hoagie banks the plane changing direction to search
	another area

139	the boatthe water  day					
	139

	ellen turns the wheel beginning another sweep searching
	for the shark  at first she doesnt see anything then she
	goes rigid

	a hundred yards away she sees the fin

	she shuts off the engine and in the quiet moves to the
	stern and looks at the shark which is keeping its distance

				   ellen
			   quietly with
			   deadly calm
		   come and get me you sonofabitch
		   take me and leave my family alone

	the silence builds as only the water lapping up against the
	side of the becalmed boat is heard

	the fin disappears beneath the surface and ellen still at
	the stern her body trembling looks for it  she cant
	see anything  the silence builds  she waits

	then in the intense calm the distant sound of an airplane
	engine droning is heard

140	int plane  day

	jake sees the boat and points

				   jake
		   there she is

	they see the boat and the tiny figure of ellen at the stern
	hoagie alters course dropping altitude as he goes  he
	starts fishing for a chart so he can radio her exact loca
	tion  michael rises in his seat to get a better view  he
	sees something in the water and strains to make out what
	it is

141	the water  day							
	141

	the dark form of the shark is visible beneath the surface
	as it moves rapidly toward the boat

142	int plane  day						
	142

	they strain to see the form in the water as the plane moves
	rapidly closer to the boat

				   hoagie
		   is that what i think it is

	no answer is necessary as they watch the shark close the
	distance to the boat  its going for ellen

				   jake
		   holy christ

				   michael
			   a whisper
		   mom

143	the boat  day							
	143

	the shark comes exploding up out of the water for ellen
	missing her by only a few feet taking a piece of the stern
	off the boat then disappearing beneath the surface

	then she hears the plane and looks but doesnt seem to see
	it  shes in shock from the sharks attack but is still
	dedicated to her mission

	the plane flies in low buzzing the boat the great roar
	of its engine causing ellen to duck out of the way

144	int plane  day						
	144

	hoagie makes a tight circle and starts back

				   michael
		   slow it down

	ellen watches the plane with horror as it comes in on a
	line parallel to the boat coming closer and closer to the
	water

146	int plane  day						
	146

				   hoagie
			   still on
			   the horn
		   a couple of boats fast and someone
		   who knows how to kill a shark  a
		   big one

	he puts the microphone back and starts preparing to bring
	the plane into the water

				   hoagie
			   continuing
		   grab your socks

		   you sure you know how to do this

				   hoagie
		   hell no  what kind of pilot do you

147	the boatthe planethe water  day				
	147

	ellen backs away from the stern as the plane nears the
	surface and its engine sputters then quits  it hits the
	water and its nose rocks forward then it settles forward
	and skips some seventyfive feet plowing through the water
	violently finally coming to a stop near the boat

	hoagie pushes the door open and water starts coming in

				   hoagie
		   hell that wasnt half bad get
		   goingill keep it busy

				   jake
		   itll come for the plane  its

	boat

				   ellen
			   screaming

	then she sees the shark heading for the plane and hoagie
	and she stares at it and the image of hoagie who backs up to
	the door behind him

				   ellen
			   continuing
			   barely
			   audible
		   hoagieno

150	the plane  day							
	150

	the shark attacks the plane going straight for the cockpit
	rising up out of the water blocking hoagie from view
	taking a mouthful of door then rolling off and disappearing
	beneath the surface  hoagie is gone

	michael and jake scramble aboard  they move quickly to
	ellen and michael puts his arm around her trying to offer
	comfort  shes in shock  they stare at the plane as it
	starts to sink scanning the water looking for hoagie

				   michael
			   quietly
		   it got him

				   ellen

	they turn and see hoagie struggling to climb aboard and
	move quickly to help him

				   hoagie
			   continuing
			   grinning
		   that thing has terrible breath

	they pull him aboard and he smiles at ellen who is very
	happy indeed to see him

				   hoagie
			   continuing
		   what say we get the hell out of
		   here ellen brody

		   get her started

	hoagie and michael start for the engine  ellen watches
	them then looks out over the water for the shark  jake
	turns on the heart monitor and ekg scope and a moment later
	the sound of the sharks heartbeat which is faint starts
	coming through the speaker and the sight of its rhythmic
	beating is seen on the scope

				   jake
		   its working

	hoagie watches as michael tries to get the engine started
	it wont turn over

				   hoagie
		   not the engine pal

	jake heads for the cabin

				   hoagie
		   maybe the plane gave it indigestion

				   jake os
			   from below

	jake takes the top off an underwater strobe light and
	begins rewiring rapidly changing connections  michael
	watches

				   jake
			   in the

	hoagie hands ellen sparkplugs which she dries with a rag
	she continues to glance at the sea her expression set with
	the inevitable  the sharks faint heartbeats are heard

154	below decks  day						
	154

	jake is taping a cover over the strobe base  michael is
	wiring another strobe light to the battery

	as michael and jake move topside they see hoagie and ellen
	staring at the speaker and ekg scope  the heartbeats have
	stopped  the line on the scope is flat

				   michael
		   your equipment has crapped out
		   again

				   jake
		   my equipment doesnt crap out

	jake grabs a pole from the deck and throws it to michael
	then starts tying the device to the end of it  his hands
	are trembling

				   hoagie
		   maybe it had a heart attack  too
		   much fatty food  humans are full of
		   cholesterol

	hoagie gets the last sparkplug screwed back in and tries
	the engine and it kicks to life

				   hoagie
			   continuing

	jake starts for the bow

				   jake
			   to michael

	michael grabs a coiled line from the deck and follows jake
	forward

				   hoagie
			   to ellen
		   were going to make it

	she just stares at him not believing it for a moment

	jake is standing at the bow looking out over the water

	michael relents and quickly ties the line around jakes
	waist  jake makes his way out to the end of the bowsprit
	using the guy wire from the mast for support  michael
	passes him the pole with the device at the end of it

	ellen and hoagie watch from the stern  hes underway

				   jake
			   continuing
			   yelling back
		   keep it steady

				   hoagie
		   aye aye captain

	the shark explodes up completely out of the water clearing
	the surface opening its jaws as it comes directly for
	michael who leaps back

				   ellen
		   michael

	jake moves back on the bowsprit getting in the sharks
	way and as the shark flies up toward jake he rams the
	pole down its throat  the pole snaps and the shark takes
	the device jake and a piece of the bowsprit

	ellen screams

	the guy wire flies loose and the already weakened mast
	begins to fall

	michael pulls at the line which goes limp in his hands

	jake in the sharks mouth goes crashing into the water

	the mast crashes into the boat and water

	ellen and hoagie are running forward

	michael watches as jake and the shark disappear beneath the
	surface

	in the distance the three of them see the shark rise up
	out of the water  part of jake is seen in its jaws  then
	theyre gone

	the heartbeats are heard again

	michael opens his mouth and a great wail of anguish comes
	out and carries out over the water

	hoagie dashes back toward the controls  ellen taking
	strength from her sons need grabs his arm hard

				   ellen
		   michael

	there are tears in his eyes

				   hoagie
			   yelling
		   get that goddamn gizmo of jakes
		   working

	michael stares at the sea  ellen looks at her son
	compassionately then michael starts for the cabin and
	ellen follows to the deck near hoagie where she watches
	the water

	the sharks heartbeats are getting louder and closer
	together  hoagie eyes the speaker as he opens the throttle
	giving it everything its got

156	below decks  day						
	156

	michael grabs the slave switch and turns it on and it
	begins to whine as the strobe unit in the sharks stomach
	begins to charge

				   hoagie os
			   yelling
		   its coming

	he hits the switch too soon   nothing happens  he can hear
	the heartbeats thumping a frenzy as the shark begins its
	attack

				   michael
			   yelling
		   what happened

				   hoagie 0s
		   nothing  what the hell are you doing
		   down there

	the whine begins to build again

157	above decks  day

	the heartbeats sound like an invitation to hell  hoagie
	grabs ellens arm

				   hoagie
		   take the wheel

	he leaves it before she does and runs to the cabin  she
	takes his place glancing at the water seeing the fin
	her expression floods with rage and she turns the wheel
	toward the shark trying to meet it head on

158	below decks  day						
	158

	hoagie sticks his head in the door

				   hoagie
		   the damn thing is going to have our

		   it needs more time to charge

	they start topside  michael brings the slave switch with
	him

159	above decksthe water  day					
	159

	ellen is bringing the boat directly toward the shark which
	is coming straight for them  the heartbeats are deafening

	as hoagie and michael move topside the boat and the shark
	collide head on sending shock waves from stem to stern
	ellen holds onto the wheel with both hands and keeps her
	feet  michael and hoagie are knocked on their asses

	the heartbeats retreat then start growing louder and
	stronger again  the whine of the strobe has stopped
	michael hits the switch several times and it starts again

	ellen sees the fin and steers toward it  the shark is
	coming again like an old boxer looking for the knockout
	punch in the fifteenth round

	the boat and the shark are heading for each other the
	distance between them closing fast

	ellen drives the boat toward it

	the slave switch makes a popping sound and michael hits the
	switch and the flash in his hand goes off

	the water explodes as the shark receives an enormous jolt
	of electricity  it thrashes about wildly then in slow
	motion some twentyfive feet from the boat right in front
	of it the shark rises up out of the water exposing half
	its body  it seems suspended there its great head pointed
	right at ellen its dead black eyes seeming to stare
	straight at her

	holding fast to the wheel her expression set hard ellen
	drives the boat straight at the shark  she pushes the
	throttle forward hard getting the last bit of speed from
	the engine driving straight into the beast impaling it in
	the throat with whats left of the sharp jagged end of the
	bowsprit

	the shark goes crazy its weight pulling the bow down into
	the water as it tries to free itself thrashing about so
	violently that it turns the bow into splinters

	ellen michael and hoagie are thrown into the water

160	the water  day

	they watch as the shark dies its violent death taking what
	remains of the boat beneath the surface with it

161	beneath the surface  day

	the shark and the boat sink slowly to the bottom

	seans death pours out of her  she begins to slip beneath
	the surface  hoagie grabs her

				   ellen
		   i cant

				   hoagie
		   yes you can

	michael reaches them and together helping ellen they swim
	to a large piece of the boat which is floating nearby

	holding it catching their breath ellen still crying they
	look out across the water silently remembering jake

				   michael
			   quietly
		   its over

	ellen stares at the sea her expression etched with
	uncertainty  is it over  will it ever be

	our vision shifts from ellen to her point of view of the
	endless expanse of ocean  in the distance the clouds seem
	to be reaching for its surface  slowly almost
	indiscernibly at first the closing music begins  another
	sound that of airplane engines is heard
