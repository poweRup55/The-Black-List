                 fact i wasnt gonna come to the meeting 
                 but i wanna say a couple of things i hope

                 to the new faces here i first came into
                 this fellowship ten months ago i came to
                 a meeting i was convinced was gonna be my
                 last  how could a buncha drunks help me 
                 then someone got up i think it was micky
                 and described himself as the shit around
                 which the universe revolved i dont know
                 if that was original to him  it doesnt
                 matter it was the first timeidheard it
                 and i still cant think of a better way to
                 describe how i felt  we all have our own
                 place in the darkness and i was in such a
                 mess i could hardly fucken see  id lost
                 someone very dear to me  she hadnt died 
                 i had  i dont know whether she left coza
                 the drinking or whether i drank coz i knew
                 she was gonna leave  either way the booze
                 won  i replaced her with alcohol  anger 
                 i was angry with her myself everyone and
                 everything  where i was i wanted to be
                 someplace else  any place but here  any
                 moment butnow but here i am and itisnow and theres a big change about to hap

                 this time i know im not running away  im
                 actually two miles into a 600 mile journey

                 and to thank everyone of you and everyone
                 in this fellowship for letting me walk out
                 of here free 

     2  ext  oakland bridge  san francisco bay  dusk

     high above the golden gate too high for specifics but there
     is something down there of interest to the camera descending
     with the music it seems to isolate a particular car too many
     and too distant to know which it is but the camera is follow
     ing and already a mile up the 101 interstate travelling north

     maybe via a dissolve and maybe not but red and white either
     way as the headlights are coming on the camera is closing on
     the highway and a car has definitely been selected there is
     nothing much of interest about it its a blue mercedes sedan

     mussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts the first
     puts the frame directly in front of the car in a few moments
     its brights snap up and titles continue in a dazzle of light

     3  int  mercedes sedan  101  dusk

     nobody in the car except berlin and a lot of cigarette smoke
     just time to wedge in a pov theres an intersection coming
     up he hits the indicators and crosses lanes winding his wind
     ow down takes a last hit at his cigarette and exits the butt

     4  ext  freeway intersection  dusk

     an instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway a
     heavy sky of red and black cloud the mercedes turns off head
     ing east this time the camera doesnt follow remains static
     over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear

     5  int  living room  house  dawn

     bare wooden boards and the sound of singing birds this house
     hasnt been lived in for years no furniture other than a new
     mattress in the middle of the floor still in polythene wraps

     berlin just about awake on top of it ten seconds of disorien
     tation while he puts this together a stone fireplace stairs
     leading to whats got to be a tiny room above with enough ef
     fort this place could be charming but right now its a wreck

     6  int  kitchen  house  dawn

     this kitchen was out of date by 1963 a huge china sink and a
     fat fridge but the cooker works and a battered old kettle is
     already on the gas tshirt and instant coffee berlin checks
     cupboards out crockery includes a cup and thatll do for now

     his lips articulate a silent expletive the gas has just gone
     out tries to relight it without success on hands  knees he
     explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door

     7  ext  open end garage and yard  house  dawn

     in the garage he finds the gas cylinder  empty and so is the
     bastard with it he drags fingers through hair in frustration
     looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out the
     view beyond he hardly cares to look at  but if he does it is
     as follows  clouds massing on the horizon fields getting re
     ady for rain  his nearest neighbor is around 200 yards away
     his nearest cow about 50 this house is remote and rural look
     ing with a veranda out back but berlin has no inclination for
     sightseeing as he walks away a dreary female voice seeps in

     8  int  living roomkitchen  house  dawn

     the voice comes via a police scanner most of this dialogues
     bullshit illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about
     berlin sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum
     and milk he unwraps another juicy fruit and regrets it goes
     round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine a reluctant
     decision is taken spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the
     kitchen starts unloading his leather bag a flotsam of stuff
     is excavated including a 9mm beretta and a pack of cigarettes

     he lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt
     wouldnt need a clairvoyant to realize hes trying to give up
     something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to
     the living room theres a call going out for david 72 sam 3
     david 72 acknowledges and berlin clearly recognizes the voice

     we have a 927d springfield street city dump but david 72
     is already hired im outside emersons i wanna be the first
     horrible face of her day berlin exhales through a smile the
     controller needs an eta for the 927 david 72 doesnt know
     advises her to roll a couple of cars and secure the location

     9  ext  hillside  springfield street  eureka  day

     a chevrolet zigzags up a shabby canyon its the road to the
     city dump its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage
     trucks everything is backed up nothing moves except the car
     the cause of the holdup is explained at the top a sheriffs
     car blocks the road a uniform moves to wave the chevrolet in

     10  ext  entrancetrackinfill  city dump  eureka  day

     the car parks at a weighhouse and a man in his 50s gets out
     looks like he hasnt slept in a while and got the mood to go
     with it sports jacket and cowboy boots a lot of laugh lines
     around the eyes but you wouldnt want to get arrested by him
     and especially not this morning his name is frederick t ross

                                 travis
                        you can drive down there sir

                        im already walking where is it

     one of those walking with him is a 10yearold kid with a dog
     travis looks almost too young to own his struggling moustache

                        and take a look i hope thats ok

     the track sinks through a valley of a million discarded tires

                                 ross
                        damn a its ok with a bit of

     the information comes from freckles and a missing front tooth

                                 ross
                        who are you

                                 trimble

                        ing ya youre in for a shock 

     trimble speaks with some enthusiasm ross looks back with none

                        they slit him from ear to ear
                        ya want me to make a statement

     11  ext  working face  infill  garbage dump  day

     a series of terraces have been created as the canyon fills up
     black smoke drifts from a distance at will of the wind gulls
     and bulldozers plus a stinking ten foot cliff of human filth

     several cars parked here including the blue mercedes several
     on lookers behind yellow police tape ross negotiates it look
     ing pissed off looks up and somewhere in the smoke is berlin

                                 ross
                        did you bring it with you

                                 berlin
                        i hope im not intruding

                                 ross
                        be my guest what you got

                                 berlin
                        old guy offed himself with a
                        knife i cant find the knife

     and the next thing ross is looking at is a death in the trash
     a massive dozer in the background everything else is garbage

                                 trimble
                        they cut his throat

                                 ross
                        would you getoutsidethe tape
                        and tell your dad to put that
                        fire out  that aint legal 

     another face here is so familiar ross hasnt bothered to ackn
     owledge it blattis is a 32 year old local newspaper reporter
     little is visible of the body except a bloodstained raincoat

                                 travis
                        i wonder what would make
                        him do a thing like that

                                 ross
                        dont annoy me travis

                                 travis
                        no sir

     truck horns wail in the distance on the horizon its thunder

                                 ross
                        so wheres the knife

     berlin wears surgical gloves removes film from a small camera

                                 berlin
                        i dunno  guess the dozer
                        musta shifted him you need
                        some hands up here to look 

                                 ross
                        you heard look for the knife

     swatting smoke ross directs anger at a fat cop called venables

                        you too movethatass

     berlin hands the film to ross as he gets into identical gloves

                        you done the pockets

                        welcome to eureka

     by now ross is crouched next to the corpse examining the wound

                        how longs he been feeling like this

                        the county and it was the worst
                        six months this station ever had

     this is citrines shop and berlin isnt gonna row it with him

                        more important to me than this

                        stop by my office we should talk

     26  int  mercedes sedan  city of eureka  night

     melted neon in the streets a wet midtown night nothing but
     sound of windshield wipers and click of a zippo lighter ross
     rides stoic passenger while berlin drives with festering eyes

                                 ross
                         what does he think it is

                        in different bags a 100 feet apart 

     they stop at a light and a beeper goes as warning to the blind

                        whats she gonna do  dump her bra
                        in one bag her hand in the other
                        and wander off whistling hey jude

                                 ross
                        its the garage on the far corner

     berlin is worrying at his fingertip on the wheel of the zippo

                        you cant stop it can you

                                 berlin

                                 ross
                        worrying  clicking  picking  you
                        may as well be back in los angeles

                                 berlin
                        what do you mean ross

     the lights change and off they go and berlin waits for a turn

                                 ross
                        why dont you dump it mail it off
                        give the fucking fbi a present

                                 berlin
                        why dont you dump the fat lady

                                 ross
                        because i dislike her too much 

                                 berlin

                        no you dont thats how youthinkyou feel about him thats how you
                        feel aboutyourself you wont give
                        yourself onefuckingminute foryou

     and by now theyve arrived and pulled up on the garage forecourt
     its indicative of their friendship that ross can talk like this

                        wait for me it might not be ready

     he quits the car and berlin watches him scurry towards a service
     shop rain beats on the roof and berlin looks stubbed out a lot
     of cuts coming up and here are some of them runs a hand through
     his hair in unconscious frustration a finger constantly bothers
     the zippo eyes towards ross who silhouettes in florescent light

     somewhere in the background the lights change to red once again
     the beeping sound of trafficlights speaking to the blind maybe
     he looks across but that doesnt matter something just happens
     inside his head he isnt yet quite aware of everything in close
     up big on the zippo big on berlin and he leaps out of the car

     berlin sprints through the weather  a station wagon is still in
     the air at the end of an hydraulic jack surprise from ross and a
     mechanic as berlin arrives fuck the fanbelt and listen to this

                                 berlin
                        i just had this insane idea  if
                        im wrong ill take a week off
                        and redecorate your entire house 

     rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them

                        shesblind ross  thats why all
                        the scars  hear that traffic light
                        that noise is to help blind people 
                        thats why the marks on her finger
                        tips  this lady reads inbraille

     rosss car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches
     it away an unexpected building in the distance victorian at
     a glance but probably later a clock tower and fifty lifeless
     windows the chevy disappears towards its somber architecture

     29  ext  the shastatrinity institute  day

     pine trees and slush and parked cars the chevrolet swings in
     and parks in front of the mansion breath in the air and eyes
     on the ugly pile as they slam doors and head for its entrance

                                 goodridge
                        then let me put your mind at ease 
                        firstly amber isnt blind  she
                        has some useful vision  and second
                        this isnt a prison its a college
                        of higher education  a severe vis
                        ual disability doesnt mean my stud
                        ents dont value their independence
                        as much as anybody else  and amber
                        was a very independent young woman 
                        she decided to leave  so she left 

                                 ross
                        and you gotnoideawith who

                        and i might add that in another six

                        will be leaving here  driving away
                        for their christmas holidays with pe
                        ople whose name iwontknoweither 

     ross could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex
     cuses himself to answer it whatever he hears he isnt liking

                        you have an appointment with miss
                        robertson

                        weekend she left  was briefly in

     32  int  corridor  institute  day

     looking back down a deserted corridor someone tried to put sun
     shine on the walls with yellow paint somewhere a long way away
     there is a sound like children singing ross loathes this joint
     loathes its silence eyes back to berlin as he rings a doorbell

                                 ross
                        where is everyone

                        staff side of the building

     here come footsteps and the door is opened by helena robertson
     early 20s and blonde and not immediately beautiful but delic
     ate features than need no make up and big dark eyes they look
     away for introductions as though shes shy ross  berlin grab
     glances as they follow in neither expected helena to be blind

     33  int  apartment  institute  day

     claustrophobia evaporates instantly great views down the val
     ley from every window plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and
     colors but no pictures on the walls no friendly photographs
     nor any lights although the afternoon is shutting down there
     isnt a light in the room ross elects to stay at the windows
     berlin takes an offered chair helena sits nervously opposite

                                 helena

                        fiftythree

     possibly the only grin ross is going to get out of this place

                                 berlin
                        you must have some idea about him

                                 helena
                        when we spoke on the phone
                        did you know i was blonde

                                 berlin
                        no

                                 helena
                        why not you heard my voice

     a good point and a point taken and berlin might even say so

                        we dont have some kind of
                        sixthsense you know ex
                        cept in ridiculous novels 

     now another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room

                        he used a breath freshener 

     a sardonic headshake from ross well that solves the case then

                        and i think his name was john

                                 berlin
                        john  you never said that
                        on the phone  what makes
                        you think his name was john

                        ing tea would you like some

     berlin would but ross wouldnt she leaves and whispers begin

                        this looks promising  i
                        think this one could be it

                                 ross
                        thank christ we got a witness

                        its starting to snow again

     empty teacups and empty notebook ross sits opposite berlin

                        and i remember he was a lit
                        tle breathless from carrying
                        the cases because the elevat
                        or had gone out that weekend

                        no it has a mind of its own

     a clock strikes four somewhere and berlin knows hes lost it

                                 berlin
                        can i see your hands

                                 helena
                        my hands

     he takes her hands and helena immediately looks uncomfortable
     he examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes

                        i have a class  i have to go

                                 berlin

                        breath like i can on yours

     a taut instant between ross and berlin berlin caught out and
     he knows it ross roars in silence you lying pig and writes
     in his notebook the angle switches to see berlin is a liar

                        im late  i really have to go 

     everyone suddenly on their feet and helena gets into a jacket

     berlin is more amused than annoyed they arrive at the car and
     his suggestion is met with an appropriate response from helena

                        asking a newly blind kid if he can
                        see is both cruel and dangerous 

     he floats the letter across the desk and hears the explanation

                                 berlin
                        i never asked if he could see i

     dead echos of plates in the kitchen and song of birds outside

     was last here and last time she was here she was happy dumps
     her case and heads for the living room cant see it but feels
     the overwhelming gloom finds a couch and now she sits to wait

     the silence is almost total but something disturbs it helena
     looks around back on her feet she tries to discover source of
     the sound finally arrives at a table lamp she feels the bulb
     and its hot a large moth beats itself crazy inside the shade

                        alright let me answer your question
                        whats the relevance of the janitor

     hits the cigarette like this is the one that caused the cancer

                        why dont i take you through it from
                        where im sitting  at some time bet
                        ween 2  230 am the janitor thought
                        he heard a vehicle approaching through
                        the woods he looks out and sees noth
                        ing no lights nothing figures it must
                        be hunters some time later he thought
                        he heard something else like a door or
                        a window slam he gets up and between
                        half past two and a quarter of three he
                        makes a search  with a flashlight  of
                        the top 3 floors finds nothing untoward
                         goes back to his apartment in the roof

     berlin looks grey as sick knows whats coming and here it is

                        the flashlight you saw washis the
                        footsteps you heard werehis the
                        elevator you were chasing up and down
                        after wasempty and is prone to such
                        activity due to an electrical fault 
                        apparently it happens frequently dur
                        ing gales the gale that was swinging
                        the door that knocked you down that
                        confused you so much and here we are
                        back to where im sitting you wanna
                        tell me what really went on that night

     it seems st anne has effectively destroyed the serial killer
     scenario stubs his cigarette and waits for berlins response

                                 berlin
                        two people know i didnt kill
                        him mr st anne ones me and
                        the others the man that did

                                 st anne
                        what man

     st anne is winning and they both know it and he almost grins

                        we just dealt with the man

                                 berlin
                        how dyou know the jan
                        itor didnt shoot him

     if st anne can raise an eyebrow he does by implication berlin is
     ditching his killer during this st anne rewinds his sony

                        youre telling me itshisflashlightisaw ok he
                        seesmyflashlight and im
                        coming up the stairs with a
                        beretta in my hand and hes
                        frightened he hits the door
                        on me picks up my gun hes
                        running he runs into ross
                        and in panic he shoots him

     the little sony snaps to a stop and st anne looks at his watch

                                 st anne
                        not unless he had a gun in one
                        hand and a phone in the other
                        he didnt ross was shot atexactlytwo fiftyseven am the
                        janitor put a call through to

                        get so accurate with my timing

     st anne backs off and carefully replaces the sony on the table

                        ross switched into channel 8 
                        we got a recording of the whole
                        incident i was gonna play it to

     helena is curled up under blankets maybe daydreaming but not
     asleep shes maybe here to keep warm as much as anything else
     sound of a vehicle approaching and she sits to listen the car
     pulls up and its engine silences helena is already out of bed

     138  int  living roomporchfront yard  house  day

     silhouette of a figure outside the front door someone rattles
     the handle but its locked and by the time helena reaches the
     door the visitor has gone thinking its berlin she twists the
     key and steps onto the porch a stale winter fog settling down

     hardly a sound except her own voice john is that you just
     the rattle of local crows and a bull heaving somewhere in some
     distant field john she cautiously descends wood stairs and
     walks two or three paces before bumping into a brown chevrolet

     exploration of the car establishes nil more confused than con
     cerned she listens country sound and not a sound out of place

     then suddenly she is alert something clatters somewhere like
     cans kicked in the garage was it the garage johnis it you

     helena locks the front door moves into the kitchen locks the
     back door glum silence in the house nothing but an old alarm
     clock ticking then a sound like something moving like a door
     creaking open was it in the garage the living room upstairs

     she returns to the living room curtains drawn and almost dark
     the endless silence is interrupted by a rush of water in pipes
     if anybodys here theyre upstairs helena moves to the bottom
     of them john are you up there its me darling i got a cab

     the only reply is more silence she begins to climb the stairs

     one hand on the wall she ascends slowly her helplessness giv
     ing way to suspicion with each new step at the top she pushes
     into the bedroom john are you here darling are you alright

     apparently no oneishere certainly no one in the bed and no
     one in the bathroom she reappears with an expression suppress
     ing anxiety feels her way past an antique wardrobe curiously
     its door is open a full length mirror inside shuts it as she
     passes and for a splitinstant the man in the room is revealed

     almost simultaneously fingers in black leather clasp her wrist
     helena in speechless with shock both she and the intruder are
     breathing hard the only other sound is the wardrobe door whin
     ing open again under its weight manifests a reflection of his
     back totally in black black wool hat leather jacket gloves

                                 intruder
                        got really fucken lucky didnt ya

     he backs her to the bed and sits her before releasing his grip
     the frame remains static and staring into the mirror and still
     on the intruders back helena stares unseeing at her own face

                        i was getting kinda concerned about
                        you jenny like how blind are you
                        blind as your friend or less blind
                        coz she couldsee you know had a
                        view outta one of em but you dont
                        seenothingdo you nothing at all

     he reaches into his jeans and produces a stainless steel knife
     even closed this thing is 10 inches long a leather loop attat
     ched at one and he teases the metal in front of helenas eyes

                        can you see this blind girl

     not a switchblade but by snapping it like a whip it locks out

                        gimme your hand

                        girl a couple of hunters found her

     maybe berlin asks him where or maybe his expressions enough

                        about 4 miles south of the institute
                        less than 50 feet from the road this

     upon mile of road he has yet to travel still it ascends until
     the chevrolet is reduced to an insignificance by the landscape

     gown with a similar urgency to get out she arrives in the liv
     ing room as the figure is clambering through the window panic
     as she blunders for the front door tears it open and vanishes
     into the corridor he crosses the room and follows her outside

     helena knows the building and moves faster than he may have ex
     pected green dressing gown and bare feet white nightgown and
     blonde hair the man in black hurries after her shes already
     at the swing doors and hes virtually running to stay with her

     she bursts through the doors and rushes downstairs he follows
     only seconds behind the wind groans down as they descend hel
     ena turns a corner of the stairwell and momentarily disappears

     for a moment he loses her which way did she go downstairs or
     along the corridor his anxiety is immediately assuaged spots
     what already looks like a ghost fleeing into shadows he takes
     off along the corridor getting breathless but getting closer
     near enough now to sense her fear near enough now to grab her

                        say night night dead girl

     as he reaches for her she turns margie wears a green dressing
     gown and a blonde wig and has a very big fucking pistol in her
     hand taylor cant believe what hes looking at and for an in
     stant neither does margie their surprise is mutually stunning

     how can it behim how can it beher taylors still trying to
     work out how they made the switch when the first bullet smacks
     into his chest gets another as he goes down he crumples in a
     deadly heap and revenge is completed with two more in the back

     up adjacent stairs peering down no time for introductions and
     no time for explanations call the policedo itnow shout
     ing up at him shes already descending tell em the gymnasium

     188  int  gymnasium  institute  night

     margie patrols plate glass windows where are the fucking cops
     shes shocked and looks strange indeed wig off but hair grips
     all over her head an overcoat and shoes but still wearing the
     nightgown underneath a couple of dreary lights in the ceiling
     helena sits numb under one of them all but hidden in a blanket

     margie cant stand waiting any longer im gonna call them my
     self helena nods and sure shes ok to stay here the doors
     settle and she is alone headlights cross the windows shifting
     the shadows of everything swooping the walls they move attent
     ion back to the door taylor stares in and then pushes through

     worse for wear but very much alive discarded his leather jack
     et revealing the bullet proof vest blood all over his tshirt
     looks like he caught one in the shoulder a bad burn and blood
     runs from his left hand in his right hand he clasps the knife

     he cracks it open like a whip helena hears it and stands ter
     ror as the footsteps approach margie margie but margie is
     nt around hes less than 30 feet away she tries to back off
     but is hindered by the blanket tries to scream but is stifled
     with fear maybe six seconds to live but this refers to taylor

     taylor he swings around but this time he doesnt get time to
     look surprised berlin blows the fucker across the room solid
     load slugs weighing an ounce each crash into him berlin keeps
     pumping the remington and doesnt stop firing until the magaz
     ine is over no conjecture now this bastard is very much dead

     berlin throws the 12 gauge aside and maybe it means something
     maybe at last he accepts hes stopped living in that world and
     ready to give himself a chance in this helena in his arms and
     this is his new world flashing lights and headlights flood in
     to the darkness their embrace goes on and this story is told
