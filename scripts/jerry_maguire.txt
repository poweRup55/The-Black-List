		we watch his face alive now

		there is a direct line from the deepest part of him to the
		words hes typing  his fingers fly  even his eyes grow
		moist

						jerrys voice
				what started out as one page
				became twentyfive suddenly i was
				my fathers son  i was
				remembering the simple pleasures
				of this job how i ended up here
				out of law school the way a
				stadium sounds when one of my
				players performs well on the
				field i was remembering even
				the words of the late dicky fox
				the original sports agent who
				said

		shot of dicky fox

						dicky fox
				the key to this job is personal
				relationships

		as jerry continues typing his voice is excited now

						jerrys voice
				and suddenly it was all pretty
				clear the answer was fewer
				clients  caring for them caring
				for ourselves and the games too
				starting our lives really

		shot of sentence  we must embrace what is still virginal
		about our own enthusiasm we must crack open the tightly
		clenched fist and give back a little for the common good we
		must simply be the best versions of ourselves that
		goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear

		he pauses and wipes his eyes still considering the sentence

						jerrys voice
						 continuing
				hey ill be the first to admit
				it what i was writing was
				somewhat touchy feely

		he deletes it  and then  zip  he restores it and
		continues on boldly

						jerrys voice
						 continuing
				i didnt care  i had lost the
				ability to bullshit  it was the
				me id always wanted to be

		statement is in evidence everywhere  jerry inconspicuously
		turns the corner yearns to blend in  its impossible the
		recognition ripples through the lobby  underling agent bob
		sugar 25 is the first to grab maguire by the shoulders

		yearold female employee of smi applauding with mission
		statement in hand her sleepy son at her side  jerry
		motions for them all to stop but clearly he could listen
		forever it is a watershed moment in his life

						jerrys voice

		folding up into a plane as music and credits end

		int airplanefirst class  night

		we move past a snoring businessman onto tired but
		adrenalized jerry maguire  he sits in firstclass working
		on his laptop a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby
		the woman passenger next to him 3oish finishes up a spicy
		phone conversation with her boyfriend

						 protective
				what 

						jerry
				whered you find the perfect white
				shirt

		she laughs its an infectious laugh  two strangers
		enjoying the good life  as we drift back three rows past
		the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the
		stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach

		we meet dorothy boyd 26  a harried passenger on this bus in
		the sky  her clothes are partcontemporary part mother
		functional she is never as composed or in control as she
		wants to be right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in
		the wrinkled whiteshirt sitting next to her  it is ray her
		fiveyear old son  dorothy is covered in toys and books
		stuffed into the side pocket is jerrys mission statement
		the easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like
		cold water as she rings again for a flight attendant  the
		overworked attendant arrives pissed snapping off the bell

													11


						dorothy
				look my son is allergic to the
				material in these blankets 

						attendant

		the attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and
		is about to exit as ray makes a gagging noise  hes about to
		get sick both women reach for an airsick bag and get it to
		his mouth just in time their faces are now inches apart

						attendant
						 continuing

						dorothy
				its okay  were in it together
				now

		the attendant now exits helpfully with the bag

		in tigerprint sweats  he looks like mickey dolenz  he
		holds flowers

													16

				one

		jerrys face falls  bobbi fallon moves into the embrace

		crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for
		loved ones  music

		int luggage area  morning

				gentleman behind you 

		dorothy turns is greatly relieved to see ray and snatches
		him off the belt  she bends down into his face  she speaks
		softly but intensely with no frills

						dorothy
				remember imagination
				remember what that means  well
				this is one of my bosses so you
				will now imagine me screaming at

		purse jerry takes a step closer interested and flattered

						jerry
				thanks actually it was just a
				mission statement

		ray has taken jerrys free hand and begun swinging on him

						dorothy
				i think in this age optimism like
				that its a revolutionary act

						jerry
						 eager for feedback
				you think so

						dorothy
				oh tsht yes

						jerry
				i appreciate that because some of
				that stuff you know it was two
				in the morning and

						dorothy
				 the part about we should
				embrace what it is still virginal
				about our enthusiasm 

		jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his
		words

						dorothy
						 continuing
				 and we should all force open
				the tightlyclenched fist of
				commerce and give a little back
				for the greater good i mean i
				was inspired and im an
				accountant  ray dont spill my
				coffee

		jerry looks more nervous as ray has now taken his mothers
		hand he is now swinging on both of them

						laurel

		dorothy returns to the world of motherhood bending down
		gathering rays toys  she wipes at rays hair

													20

		shes a little jazzed from her encounter with jerry maguire
		she cant help but look back at jerry who catches her
		looking   he salutes her with mock circumstance  she
		returns it with a guilty smile  he disappears and she finds
		herself oddly short of breath

				dooler you know bob sugar

						sugar
						 smoothly
				the best commercial director in
				the business  i hail you

						dooler
				sorry i yelled  you have
				exquisite taste

													23


						sugar
				everybodys having a great time
				youre both nuts  the movies
				great

		sugar moves on cheerfully

						dooler
				i like that guy

		the movie which plays simultaneously with the conversation
		is a hi8 confessional of jerrys former girlfriends
		michael jordan is cut into this nodding as if he were
		actually interviewing  the effect is funny but the
		confessions are brutally honest  there is the one he was too
		good for the one he wasnt good enough for he hated being
		alone the still in love girlfriend the punk rock
		girlfriend sports makes me ill the now married with kids
		girlfriend the cynical girlfriend beneath the cute
		exterior more cute exterior the purely sexual girlfriend
		the brainy girlfriend great at friendship bad at
		intimacy and even the girlfriend who does a great jerry
		imitation rubbing her face she does a flawless jerryonhis
		waytotheairport  all seem to agree on some basic points
		and if necessary maybe jordan narrates the following
		information to underscore it  jerry always has a
		girlfriend and many met him on the first day hed broken up
		with the last one  the relationship always competes with his
		job and the job always wins  the final confrontation
		happens somewhere around the 18month mark sequence ends
		with avery in character wielding a blowtorch threatening to
		burn all these old phone numbers

						jerry
						 wounded good sport
				 this is uh too funny

						dooler
				they aint laughing man
				somethings wrong

		jerry nods takes a swig of beer  he knows the response is
		little more than polite  none of the other agents can keep
		eye contact with him  dooler is right  on the screen the
		finale features a goodhumored collage of jerry photos cut
		to music

		int smi office  day

		elevator doors open  maguire is now paranoid  he walks
		through the buzzing smi headquarters heading for his corner
		office  he is like an fbi man searching treetops and corners
		for the gunman everywhere he looks is a potential grassy
		knoll

													24


		he passes fellow agents always smiling giving a word of
		encouragement to an agent having an emotional hallway
		conversation with an athlete even bends down to check the
		sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated
		basketball player moving forward there is trouble in the
		air but only he seems to sense it  he turns corner and is
		met by assistant wendy who hands him a long list of calls
		the sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward
		his back office

						wendy
						 as in get ready
				marcees here  shes already in
				your office

						jerry
				thanks wendy

		int jerry maguires office  day

		jerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny
		waters of newport beach and a large mall parking lot already
		standing reading the mail on his desk is lively marcee
		tidwell 25 africanamerican gorgeous a heatseeking
		smartbomb  she is also five months pregnant

						jerry
				marcee  hows my favorite
				players wife

						marcee
				jerry rod is very very upset
				tyson no

		across the room 4 yearold menace tyson ceases trying to pry
		a plexiglass case off the wall

						jerry
				tyson hello

		tyson just stares at jerry  jerry has little luck with kids
		he gives marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge  he
		grabs a twopint bottle of orange gatorade  another
		habit  and sits down at his desk  he slips into crisis
		mode like an old shirt

						jerry
						 continuing
				how can i make your life better

						marcee
				i know you say to take the arizona
				offer but my husband needs more
				recognition
						more

													25

		level of intensity

						marcee

				your fivepercent but this man
				my husband has a whole plan an
				image we majored in marketing
				jerry and when you put him in a
				waterbed warehouse commercial
				excuse me you are making him
				common  he is pure gold and
				youre giving him waterbed
				warehouse when he deserves the
				big four  shoe car clothing
				line softdrink  the four jewels
				of the celebrity endorsement
				dollar

		jerry finds himself admiring her drive and she commands the
		best in him  the desk buzzes and jerry ignores it

						marcee
						 continuing
				you gonna get that 

						jerry
				not a chance

		she smiles
													26


						jerry
						 continuing
				marcee things are changing around
				here  you and rod will have my
				total personal attention

						marcee
						 upping the ante
				damn right and you can start by
				taking rods poster and putting it
				where people can see it

						jerry
						 its infectious
				damn right

		he climbs up on the edge of his sofa and reaches for the
		poster with his hanging device true to marcees complaint
		the poster hangs in the upper siberian region of his wall

						marcee
				look at that handsome man trying
				to build a life up there by the
				airconditioner were coming to
				get ya darlin  we are so close
				to having it all

		on the poster  close

		it is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of
		secondtier players commanding widereceiver rod tidwell
		27 stands shirtless hands on hips looking vaguelyl
		uncomfortable emplazoned above his head in rod we trust
		elsewhere in the room we hear the inevitable crash
		tyson

		other these are two smart boys each one anticipating the
		others next three or four moves

						sugar

		suddenly hes flushed a little embarrassed

						jerry

				revenues

		quietly maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier

						jerry

		maguire reaches for water  the sound of the ice cubes
		jangling is suddenly very loud to him he is drowning

		jerry fights the desire to use his fists  hangs onto the
		table hes starting to freak out now trying to calm down
		sugars mouth keeps moving but we hear the music in jerrys
		mind  rising percussive music

		ext street  day

		jerry tries to move briskly down the street through the
		lunchtime businessmen traffic back to the office

		int sugars office  day

		sugar crosses the last call off his sheet and throws himself
		on the sofa  he lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof
		the younger turks watch their new leader  victory is his

		int jerrys office  night

		jerry stands at the door holding some belongings  he looks
		back and symbolically flips the light switch off
		unfortunately he hasnt realized the lights are already off
		so in his final gesture surprising himself he has weirdly
		turned the lights on

		ext corner office  night

		bam  jerrys door opens  he exits his office with box  he
		is now in a state of advancing melancholy slightly unhinged
		many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving

													37


						jerry
				well dont worry  im not going
				to do what you think im going to
				do which is flip out

						jerry
						 continuing

		jerry goes to a water dispenser calming himself and fills
		a small dixie cup  downs it and fills it again rubbing his
		face

						jerry
						 continuing
				but let me just say as i ease out
				of the office i helped build 
				sorry but its a fact 

		on dorothy  watching

		from her cubicle

						jerry
				 that there is such a thing as
				manners  a way of treating
				people

		he notices the fish tank nearby he attemps to be profound

						jerry
						 continuing
				these fish have manners  they
				have manners

		and now jerry feels bravado mixed with a wave of anger
		another cup of water as he finds power

						jerry
						 continuing
				in fact  theyre coming with me
				im starting a new company and
				the fish will come with me and
				you can call me sentimental

		he begins dipping into the tank grabbing the one exotic fish
		that failed to escape his cup its a firetailed peruvian
		beauty  he grabs a baggie from an assistants desk shakes
		out some crumbs and dumps the fish inside

						jerry
						 continuing to fish
				its okay its okay

		nearby a xerox repair guy watches the human train wreck

													38


						jerry
						 continuing
				but if anybody else wants to come
				with me this moment will be the
				ground floor of something real and
				fun and inspiring and true in this
				godforsaken business and we will
				do it together  whos coming with
				me besides flipper here

		but clearly even flipper is not happy with the new
		arrangement panicked he whips around the small baggie

						jerry
						 continuing
				anybody going with me

		silence someone coughs as agents and office personnel look
		on with equal parts pity and embarrassment jerry downs
		another small cup of water his lid is blowing off with each
		second

						jerry
						 continuing
				wendy  shall we

		assistant wendy looks at maguire  painfully polite

						wendy
				im three months away from the pay
				increase jerry  i have to uh
				you know stay

		jerry absorbs the blow and takes the keys from the top of
		her desk  she cant look at him  jerry stands alone the
		blue mission statement on wendys desk sits accusingly in
		frame  there is only silence now the loudest kind

						jerry
				okay anybody else

		on dorothy

		she looks around  doesnt anybody believe in the very thing
		they were applauding three days ago  she has an odd
		reaction a muscle twitch of the soul   before she knows it
		she stands boldly unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee
		onto herself in the process

						dorothy
				ill go with you
						 quietly on her
						  coffee mess
				wonderful

													39


		she dabs at her pants  next to her cleo looks on sadly

		on jerry

		halfway across the office

						jerry
				dorothy boyd  thank you

		she gathers her things increasingly aware of what shes done

						jerry
						 continuing
				we will see you all again  sleep
				tight

		he walks to dorothy and together they exit down the hallway
		corridor past the framed posters and awards

		wideshot

		rising over the huge office  for the first time we see the
		full expanse of the huge smi headquarters  and down in the
		corner of the frame two small figures leave carrying boxes

						jerry
						 to dorothy
				lets see how they do without us

		a beat of silence then noise returns to its normal
		commercial roar  a couple of fleas have been swatted off the
		carcass of an immense beast

		int elevator  night

		the tragicsounding beep of the elevator passing floors
		jerry maguire stands with dorothy both still charged with
		adrenalin and then the first pangs of dread there is
		silence  the elevator stops  a young amorous couple
		enters  both are about 24 and the guy presses a number five
		flights down  in a moment we realize they are deaf  they
		sign to each other murmuring noises of love and then the
		guy signs something obviously powerful because the girl
		emits a delighted gasp as does dorothy  the couple are
		truly in their own world  they kiss before exiting on their
		floor  and suddenly the elevator seems empty without them

						jerry
				wonder what he said

						dorothy
				my favorite aunt is hearing
				impaired he said you complete
				me

													40


		they continue on in silence

		int building lobby  night

		jerry and dorothy pass through another offices party  loud
		music its a preeaster party thrown for the building
		employees and their children  jerry and dorothy squeeze
		through with boxes and fish

		ext smi parking lot  night

		jerry and dorothy walk to their cars  music in distance

						dorothy
				so i know this is a bad time
				but  you will have a medical
				program right

						jerry
				sure yes medical i dont know

		he spaces out for a moment  awkwardly she touches him
		briefly

						dorothy
				and i guess we didnt talk about
				money  so ill just dive in 

						jerry
				give me your number  ill call
				tomorrow  im just a little im
				a little insane right now
						 off her look
				but its going to be great

						dorothy
				no no i know 

		they arrive at her red camry  she writes her number on the
		back of a business card

						jerry
				but i mean really wonderfully
						 out of steam
				great

						dorothy
						 unsure
				absolutely

		she climbs into her car rolls down the window

						jerry
				and when you think about what
				youve done later dont panic

													41


						dorothy
				me  no  my sister  its a good
				bet

		she starts the engine

						dorothy
						 continuing
				that took guts

						jerry
				same to you

		she salutes him as she drives off  his own move played back
		to him  camera moves away from jerry as he stands alone in
		the parking lot  salutes her in return  herb alpert  the
		lonely bull stripped of power his once mighty theme now
		seems puny

		voices

		int living room  night

		a living room filled with ten earnest talkative divorced
		women this is their talk group  we meet jan 30 who speaks
		shyly thoughtfully covering her braces often as she speaks
		she holds a toofull glass of red wine  much of the talk in
		this womens group will be improved by our cast of actresses

				i love men  i respect men  but
				that doesnt change the fact that

		dorothy dries her hands flicking in a hurry

						dorothy
				wonderful  next time you lecture

		she exits in a hurry as laurel throws her cigarette into the
		garbage disposal  she has a hard time saying this so she
		says it so nobody can hear

						laurel
				sorry

		int living room  night

		ray dreams sweetly in the middle of this rockbed of womens
		woes dorothy strokes his head as she plucks him up  in

		he realizes he doesnt know the words at all he switches
		channels finds a rush song with ornate lyrics  no one will
		ever know what the words are  he switches again and finds
		lets groove tonight by earth wind and fire excellent
		he begins singing nonsense noises passionately  switches
		again  all he wants is to sing along with a song he knows
		finally he finds tom petty and the heartbreakers refugee
		he drives through the countryside singing the call and

		jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon  ray is
		delighted by jerry   dorothy notes that hes great with her
		son  she pats jerry on the shoulder  her hand lingers
		perhaps a millisecond too long  she pulls away quickly
		always feeling on the edge or embarrassing herself around
		this guy

						dorothy
				okay have we gone over

						jerry
				yep  have a good time at school

						cush
						 a big thought

						tidwell
				hey man i wish i had a
				quarterback like you in arizona
				youre the shit

		cush looks up  compliments blow off him like a summer breeze

						cush
				thank ya

		tidwell waits for a compliment of his own but cush doesnt

						tidwell
						 loud mumble
				well you aint that mothafuckin
				good

						cush
				say what

													54


						tidwell
				i said  last i heard jesus
				christ was still in heaven  and

		ext marriott marquis  night

		the headquarters for the nfl draft is buzzing with activity
		limo doors open and out pours maguire and company  media
		lights flick on bathing cush  reporters chatter is it
		san diego or denver cushn  cush  fans at the outskirts
		are calling out to the young star go get the big chiching
		cush avery smoothly pulls espn into the front position
		telegenic cush shrugs and smiles ill either surf or
		ski  jerry admires his fiancee  there is nothing more
		attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job

													55


		shot drifts off this media bubble to find tidwell watching at
		the outskirts  he turns and exits unnoticed

		int gift shop  night  later

		tidwell hides out in the gift shop thumbing through
		magazines the chip on his shoulder grows by the minute
		elsewhere in the gift shop he sees the very real and
		emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother  both wear
		selfpromoting colorful homemade tshirts with the young
		athletes face on it  something about them their pure
		enthusiasm rubs tidwell in an odd way  he almost cries for
		himself for humanity as jerry enters  tidwell is
		embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state

						jerry
				at last i find you

						tidwell
						 sharply
				why the fuck am i here  i feel
				like im five years late for the
				prom

		in a look jerry sizes up the situation  with a hand on
		tidwells large shoulder he smoothly pumps up the big mans
		ego

						jerry
				come on  come with me  were
				going to take a walk through this
				lobby i want every media guy
				every player rep everybody to see

						tidwell
						 begrudgingly
				aright  lets walk

		we hear the ripping guitar explosion of the whos magic bus
		from live at leeds

													56


		int marriott lobby  night

		maguire and tidwell move through the brightlylit lobby past
		the reporters the competing agents the team
		representatives the already blasted jets fans past even a
		nike crew filming an nfl spot in the lobby  portable phones
		everywhere in every hand

		there is a heavy white media light bathing everything  as
		if life had become a tv show and everything within it
		concerned making other tv shows  jerry works hard
		introduces tidwell around and tidwell is natural polite and
		charming as they move through the predraft crowd  he does
		not sit down  music continues

		int marriott bar  day

		int marriott escalator  night

		jerry and tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level
		above the brightwhite lobby  maguire looks down at the
		scene  he breathes in the commotion  in another twelve
		hours he will be at the very epicenter with cushman

													57


						tidwell
				i came all the way here for that
				to walk the lobby

						jerry
				yeah  and it might have even
				worked too

						tidwell
				lets do it again

		jerry doesnt respond  down in the lobby jerry catches a
		glimpse of a familiarlooking agent  its sugar jerry is
		consumed with a thousand other thoughts but tidwell
		continues talking

						tidwell
						 continuing

				nike ad down there  did i ever

		tidwell moves off still feeling good about the walk  a
		small pack of diehard jets fans pass looking for autographs

		int cushs suite  night

		we glide into frank cushmans suite overlooking times square
		its filled with nfl swag  free tshirts athletic bags
		sweatpants and more  halffinished room service food
		abounds  matt keith and cushs stylish college girlfriend
		annelouise mill about the room basking in the glow of the
		man of the moment  cush who holds a guitar in his lap
		wears the odd combination of a nirvana tshirt and a nfl
		jacket  he signs for more room service and continues
		strumming the only song he knows on guitar cobains
		something in the way  jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin

						cush
						 to hotel waiter
				hey what size are you

						waiter
				eleven

						cush
						 grandly
				why dont you grab a couple pairs

		waiter spots a very tall stack of new nikes by the door

						waiter
				dude youre like a god

													59


						cush
						 immediately
				god youre like a dude

		its a great line and the room breaks up  this is charisma
		the future of the nfl  waiter exits as cush continues
		strumming and now jerry speaks importantly

						jerry
				cush matt  we have a decision
				to make

						cush

						jerry
				okay san diego just came in with

		cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father who walks to
		the window and looks out at the big jumbotron with keith

						matt
				what happened to denver

						jerry
				denver got very silent about a day
				ago  san diegos got a fever for
				cush  this stuff tends to happen
				the night before a draft  people
				get crazy  and san diego you
				should know is crazy to the tune
				of seven years for thirty signing
				bonus of eight
						 beat
				million

		annelouise whistles loudly  she is instantly embarrassed
		and puts a hand up  sorry  in the next room the phone is
		ringing

													60

		int bob sugars hotel room  day

		bob sugar talks on his hotel phone

						jerry
				look before i go back to denver
				i think we should put something

				maguire

		he pulls out a yellow legal tablet  he scribbles a few
		lines as matt looks increasingly nervous

						matt
				not right now jerry

						jerry
				do i know everything there is to

						 silent beat

		more silence

						matt
				apparently denver wanted to deal

						cush
				im sorry jerry

						matt
				they say its show business
				jerry not show friends

		jerry takes a breath before he exits he surveys the room
		settling on cush  visible behind maguire is times square in

		flushed and embarrassed he exits  we hang a beat on the
		silent cushman hotel livingroom as cush now continues on
		guitar

		int lobby  night

		jerry exits elevator dazed at full trot  the marriott lobby
		is packed  he is looking for avery  beat reporter patricia
		logan reappears  she relishes asking brutal questions
		innocently

						patricia logan
				jerry is it true that tidwells
				had three concussions

						jerry
				im sorry excuse me

		int ballroom  night

		jerry enters the grand ballroom looking for avery
		endorsement placards in evidence everywhere  nfl reps and
		media workers move tables and work out camera and seating
		arrangements  elevated in a open espn booth six feet off the
		ground host chris berman records voiceovers for tomorrows
		draft  fans heckle him by singing the espn theme  he rolls
		with it expertly  jerry spots avery across the empty
		ballroom moving fast passing out media packets on the empty
		tables

													64


		int adjacent buffet room  night

		jerry finally catches up with avery in the empty sideroom

						avery
				i just heard

						jerry
				what do i do  how do i spin this

						jerry
				i think you added the brutal

						avery
				jerry there is a sensitivity
				thing that some people have  i
				dont have it  i dont cry at

		jerry looks at his fiancee  standing here watching avery
		coldly clasping her media packs to her chest she looks
		different to him

						jerry
				avery 

		she knows whats coming  she moves fast to avoid him

						avery
				dont say it  were both ragged
				out right now

						jerry
				 stop 

		she exits back into the main ballroom  for a moment she
		stops they face off  this is it  they are quickly
		interrupted by overweight talkshow voiced curtis weintraub
		45

													66


						curtis weintraub
				hey  curtis weintraub from the

		she takes a breath  it sinks in  from somewhere the small
		voice of her vulnerability

						avery
				oh jerry

						jerry
						 steps closer
				you know i didnt ever want to
				hurt you

		she gets an odd look shaking her head  starts to step away
		then thinks better of it  she wallops him in the face with
		the back of her hand  jerry stands like a woozy boxer she
		hits him again with a fist then again in the chest  he
		sinks to the floor sagging backwards  she straddles him
		addresses him fully right in his bruised face

						avery
				i wont let you hurt me jerry

						dorothy

				seat ill get you some aloe vera
				for that cut too

						jerry
				do you have something to drink

						dorothy

		she moves to the kitchen door  she is about to exit when
		jerry begins to unburden

						jerry
				my brother works for the white
				house he pretends hes an
				intellectual  he pretends hes
				from the east coast

		she turns not quite sure what his point is  she waits
		politely for jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen

						jerry
						 continuing
				i was supposed to be the
				successful one

													73


						jerry contd

		taking

						dorothy

		int kitchen

		laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window
		dorothy goes for the refrigerator finds a couple beers

						laurel
				i heard

						dorothy
				no kidding  i looked over and saw
				the shadow of two curious shoes in
				the doorway of the kitchen

						laurel
				this guy would go home with a

						dorothy
				thats the girl i love

						laurel
				but you just gotta hear me out on
				one thing  youre very
				responsible with ray and you know
				its not right for a little boy to
				hear some strange mans voice in
				the house

						dorothy
				as opposed to twenty angry women

		dorothy turns quickly and the beer sisters and chicken
		collide in the small kitchen  dorothy deftly catches the
		food in her tshirt and dumps it back onto the plate  but
		her shirt is now stained she starts to quietly implode and
		laurel takes command  they know each other well

						laurel
				come on lets get you another
				top 

		they exit to nearby laundry room

		ext housewindow outside laundry room  night

		now camera starts to move around the house from this window
		showing the two sisters in the laundry room to the living
		room where jerry sits alone  we see ray wander into the room
		and stare at jerry

		int living room  night

		jerry who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table looks
		up to see ray

						ray

				wonderful life do you know what
				most other women my age are doing
				right now they are partying in
				clubs trying to act stupid
				trying to get a man trying to

		she grabs the sexier top and puts it on

						dorothy
						 continuing

						  approaching
				i better go to bed

		ray hugs jerry and exits  jerry sits contemplating the kid
		for a moment  the door swings open and a harried dorothy
		appears in the sexier top but with a distinctly less sexy
		attitude and a tray

													77

 
						dorothy
				drinks  food  plus i called you
				a cab

						jerry
						 slightly confused
				good idea  thank you

		she watches the drunken man who drinks then coughs a
		little then stands

		he collapses onto the sofa embarrassed  shaking his head
		dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair  she breaks the
		personal barrier carefully touching his wound with the wet
		tip of the aloe vera plant

						dorothy
				truth

						jerry
				sure

		dorothy turns to see that laurels two shoes are still very
		visible at the kitchen door  decides to ignore them  she
		gets closer

						dorothy

						 very honest
				  i want to be inspired

		there is something inspiring about the way she says the word
		inspiring

						jerry
				me too

						dorothy

													79


		he is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer  a
		womans affection  their heads inch closer together

						dorothy
						 continuing
				im working with you because of
				that memo

						jerry
				mission statement

		they kiss  it turns rather passionate  she places a cool

		ext tempe practice area  day

		meaningful sounds of revelation as dorothy finds the jacket

		int hallway  night

		dorothy stops in the hallway to see that jerry maguire has

		by a flying hug from ray  he gives the kid an athletic bag
		which is filled with stateoftheart promotional athletic

													88


		ray extends his arms he wants a hug  jerry bends down
		awkwardly to give him one and ray plants a kiss on jerrys
		cheek  all are surprised especially jerry  dorothy is
		struck and moved  shot falls on ray who watches jerry exit
		with wonder even at his age he knows a prize when he sees
		one

		int kitchen night

		laurel looks out the window watches her sister exiting she
		is equal parts jealous and protective  she spots keys on
		counter she grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on
		the lawn all shook down  replacements

		ext dorothys house  night

		jerry and dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see
		are parked on the street and the front lawn  the sound of
		the womens group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind
		them

						laurel
				hey

		as jerry moves ahead to the car dorothy retreats so she can
		have privacy with her sister

						laurel
						 continuing
				forgot your keys 

						dorothy
						 privately
				thats the first time i ever saw

		glue her emotional sister back together  she holds her arm

						laurel
				no no  dont cry at the beginning
				of the date

						dorothy
						 laughing wiping
						  tear
				oh knock it off

													89


						laurel
						 cant help it
				and dont be a shoulder for him to
				cry on either

		we stay with laurel as she watches her sister exit   music
		continues  lit by streetlight dorothy runs like a young
		girl across the lawns of this carfilled neighborhood
		slapping away the leaves of a tree running to jerry down the
		street

		int antonios restaurant  night

		jerry and dorothy sit at the table of this mexican
		restaurant in the background mariachis play

						jerry

		philadelphia fans cheer wildly  the game is turning uglier
		by the minute  jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet
		look at the next play

		on press box monitor

		swenson the arizona quarterback throws a wobbly pass into
		the endzone  tidwell leaps for the catch tucks the ball in
		and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two
		different sides  this hit is bad  worse than bad  tidwell
		flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes with a thud
		ball still in his hands his head hits the astroturf hard
		tidwell is out cold  and the ripple effect of the injury
		shoots through the stadium  jerry stares at the monitor
		stunned by the sudden brutality

		ext arizona field  night

		we are thrust into the vortex inside the game  tidwell lies
		still on turf  overhead the fight music continues for a few
		seconds before disappearing abruptly players and coaches
		begin to gather around the still body of rod tidwell

		tv monitor  slomo

		the hit in replay  it is brutal  and we can see a flash of
		his pride as he catches the lousy pass and then like two
		bulls the philadelphia defenders enter from each side  one
		cuts his legs out from under him and rods taut body
		literally flips  the second defender then hits him at the
		shoulders  tidwell lands on the back of his neck crumpling
		downwards  still holding the ball  still

		int tidwell living room  night

		silence  utter silence

						giffords voice
				   you sure hope his family
				wasnt watching that

		and then in a cry that gurgles from way down deep marcee
		begins to sob  camera catches the face of tyson now
		panicked  scared he embraces his mother

		int bowels of sun devil stadium

		maguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium  he
		turns the corner into the tunnel talking his way past a
		guard heading into the bright tv light of the football
		field

													123


		int tidwell living room  night

		gathering around the television the family waits through a

		manic shoving fingers in front of him  screaming  we read
		their lips  rod rod can you hear us  we see the
		anguish and escalating fear on their faces  the trainer
		leans in close bellowing he spreads his hands wide to clap
		right in front of rods still face  his hands head toward
		each other closer bringing with them the first inkling
		of sound  getting closer and then finally coming together
		bringing with him the sounds of the stadium

		on tidwell

		who blinks back to life  concerned men are yelling very
		loudly right in his face  tidwell becomes aware he is the
		absolute center of attention of the entire stadium  as crowd

		on maguire

		gasping for breath

		on tidwell

		has never felt like this before in his life  it is the pure
		and absolute love of the spotlight  and his fans

		and then its real and he feels it  tidwell breaks out in
		a small but unmistakable move  a flutter step  he does a
		highstepping move all his own for about ten yards

		on jerry maguire

		who watches now in complete disbelief tidwell will not let
		go of the spotlight

		on tidwells living room

		going absolutely nuts  marcee hysterical laughing and

		he moves past jerry maguire on his way off the field jerry
		casually thumps his heart twice jerry maguire is overcome
		with emotion  he sits down on a camera case head in his
		hands  behind him a stadium cheers a new hero

						overheard fan
				i always knew he was great

		maguire rubs his face  overcome photographers and others
		rush past to be closer to tidwell

		int tunnel  later

		jerry maguire surrounded by wellwishers and backslappers and
		sportswriters  success has returned in all of its
		superficial grandeur  he is a star again by association
		we catch the look on maguires face  try as he might he
		cant manufacture the joy of the moment  there is a void
		over the heads of the heatseekers we see dennis wilburn
		nodding holding a thumbs up  he tries to get to maguire
		but cannot  and then a commotion behind them all

						reporter
				its tidwell

		tidwell exits the locker room  press and media surround him
		even the grizzled oldtime stadium workers reach in to
		squeeze him to slap him to touch him  he works his way to
		maguire

		they hug cameras flash  tears roll down from beneath his
		purple shades

						tidwell
				we did it

		and now in the middle of this emotional union a portable
		phone rings  both men reach for their porties  its
		maguires  with anticipation he answers

													127


						jerry
				hello

				couldnt get through on your phone

		tidwell grabs the phone and joyously shares the moment with
		his wife  jerry watches as tidwell leans on his shoulder

													128


		on jerry maguire

		he feels the cover flips through it a little  memories
		flood with the passing pages   shot holds on jerrys face
		as tidwell continues singing in the background  suddenly an
