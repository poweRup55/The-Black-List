                         popularity sagging to 59 largely 
                         due to his civil rights stand for 
                         which he is particularly hated in 
                         the south  texas is a crucial state

                         then flies 15 minutes to love field 
                         in dallas where he takes a motorcade 
                         through downtown dallas on his way 
                         to speak at 1230 at the international 
                         trade mart  later the motorcade 
                         takes him through dealey plaza at 
                         1230

               dealey plaza  that day nov 22 1963

               we see a massive overhead shot of the plaza as it lay then  
               credits conclude under shot  and we have the subtitle 
               november 22 1963

               a young epileptic screams and suddenly collapses near the 
               fountains in front of the texas school depository  he has a 
               violent epileptic fit that attracts surrounding attention  
               dallas policemen run over to him  we hear the siren of an 
               ambulance roaring up

               timecut to ambulance loading the epileptic man and taking 
               off

                                     ambulance voice
                         we are en route to parkland

               back to a montage of the shooting  we see kennedy in the 
               last seconds waving turning the corner at houston from 
               main we see tv footage and a piece of zapruder film from 
               before the shooting fragmented images

               cut to stages shots of crowd people looking on  the images 
               are grainy to match the tone of the zapruder film  people 
               are on rooftops hollering  the crowd is wild with 
               enthusiasm  we pan past jack ruby and slam into him in black
               andwhite  the camera shows a cuban man with a radio a man 
               with an umbrella subliminals  through open windows on the 
               fifth floor of the criminal courts building convicts watch 
               and holler from their jail cells  we see the sixth floor of 
               the texas book depository with open windows and a vague blur 
               of a figure and a rifle

               the clock on the hertz sign reads 1230

                                     voice
                         well be there in about five minutes

               a motorcycle officer paralleling the kennedy car tries to 
               use his radio

               its jammed  the sound of the jammed dictabelt drives the 
               rest of the sequence

               we see zapruder a short middle  aged man shooting his 8mm 
               film from the grassy knoll and then we see jackie kennedy  
               floating on film her voice high soft

                                     jackie kennedy
                              voice restaged
                         and in the motorcade you know i 
                         usually would be waving mostly to 
                         the left side and he was waving mostly 
                         to the right which is one reason 
                         youre not looking at each other 
                         very much  and it was terribly hot  
                         just blinding all of us we could 
                         see a tunnel in front of us  
                         everything was really slow then  
                         and i remember thinking it would be 
                         so cool under that tunnel

               the camera rests on jackie for a beat and then we see the 
               shot of the little schoolgirl skipping on the grass

               cut to the approaching overpass  jfk waves mrs 
               connally turns to jfk  the shot is crazy fractured 
               surreal

                                     mrs connally vo
                         mr president you cant say that

                         no you certainly cant

               then we hear the shots the volley sounds like a motorcycle 
               backfire  we catch a glimpse of a muzzle flash and smoke  
               we see a view from the street of the texas school book 
               depository  all in line with the official version of 
               events  pigeons by the hundreds suddenly shoot off the roof  
               then the screen goes gray as did cbs tvs first bulletins to 
               the country

                         motorcade in downtown dallas

               we hear voices under this from everywhere colliding in 
               confusion and horror

                                     voices

                         area behind the fence  its that 
                         building up there

               we hear sirens and screeching tires  the screen is still 
               gray randomly intercut with the end of the nix film showing 
               the car escaping  there are wildly tracking shots of the 
               crowd running towards the grassy knoll

               the camera pans up the little set of stairs  we see more 
               faces

               someone in a suit stops our camera  secret service

               we see the briefest glimpse from the zapruder film  the 
               camera moves in on the open umbrella next then to the freeway 
               sign then to mrs kennedy out of the car reaching for help 
               then to the agent rushing onto the rear fender  the car 
               finally speeds away  the people on the other side of the 
               underpass wave at the oncoming hearse from hell  these are 
               fragmented mystifying shots  the main effect is one of 
               blackout  of not knowing of being in the dark as we all 
               were back then

               cut to jim garrisons office  new orleans  same day 1963

               pause  the lovely old china clock on the wall reads 1235  
               somewhere a car backfires  we see a closeup of the clock 
               moving to 1236  we hear the sound of a pen on paper 
               scratching we see a shot of jim garrison as a young air 
               pilot in world war ii hear the sound of airplanes  the 
               camera moves to framed photos of jim as a young lincolnesque

               shot of jims grandfather shaking hands with president william 
               taft  the sound of bulldozers carries us to a shot of jim

               works of william shakespeare and a nazi helmet with a bullet 
               hole in it to jim himself writing  pen to paper  we 
               sense the quiet intellect of the 43 year old man  the clock 
               ticks in the awful suspended silence

               its as if the air itself has been sucked from the silent 
               room  this is the last moment of peace before the world 
               will rush through the door in all its sound and fury  to 
               change his life forever  the camera haywires into a close
               up of jim as he looks up and knows

               lou ivon jims chief investigator is already standing there 
               in the room  he is burly in his 30s  his expression

               jim is stunned  his look of horror and shock speaks the 
               same language as on faces all across america that black 
               friday

                                     jim

                         assassination a disturbed portrait 
                         is emerging of lee harvey oswald  
                         described as shy and introverted he 
                         spent much of his childhood in new 
                         orleans louisiana and went to high 
                         school there  after a stint in the 
                         marines he apparently became 
                         fascinated by communism and in 1959 
                         defected to the soviet union

                         to the united states after 30 months  
                         but he is still believed to be a 
                         dedicated marxist and a fanatical 
                         supporter of fidel castro and ultra 
                         left wing causes  he spent last 
                         summer in new orleans and was arrested

                         strike you during one of the most

               garrison study  later that night1966

               the clock on mantelpiece reads 3 am  jim is alone smoking 
               his pipe

               in the stillness his mind crawls all over the place  the 
               camera closes on the thicklyworded pages of the warren 
               report

               flashback to the warren commission hearing room in dallas 
               1964  we hear thin echoey sound as the attorneys question 
               some of the witnesses

               the overall effect is vague and confusing as is much of the 
               warren report  a mr ball is questioning lee bowers the 
               switchman in the railroad yard  bowers in his early 40s 
               has a trustworthy workingman face and a crew cut

                                     bowers
                         i sealed off the area and i held 
                         off the trains until they could be 
                         examined and there was some 
                         transients taken on at least one 
                         train

                                     attorney

                         you told me i havent asked you about 
                         that you can think of

                                     bowers
                         nothing that i can recall

                                     attorney
                         witness is excused

               jim upset reads on another witness sgt dv harkness 
               of the dallas police responds to a second attorney

                                     sgt harkness
                         well we got a long freight that was 
                         in there and we pulled some people 
                         off of there and took them to the 
                         station

               we see another flashback  to the dallas rail yards on the 
               day of the assassination  three hoboes are being pulled off 
               the freight by the dallas policemen

                                     attorney vo

                         were all those questioned

               flashback to dealey plaza an hour or less after the 
               assassination  the three hoboes are marched by shotguntoting 
               policemen to the sheriffs office at dealey plaza  we note 
               that they do not look much like hoboes

                                     sgt harkness vo
                         yes sir they were taken to the 
                         station and questioned

                         yes sir traffic had been cut off 
                         into the area since about 10 but 
                         there were three cars came in during 
                         this time from around noon till the 
                         time of the shooting the cars 
                         circled the parking lot and left 
                         like they were checking the area 
                         one of the drivers seemed to have 
                         something he was holding to his 
                         mouth the last car came in about 
                         7 to 10 minutes before the shooting 
                         a white chevrolet 4door impala 
                         muddy up to the windows

               the cameras point of view is now from the railroad tower 
               near dealey plaza  we are fourteen feet off the ground 
               overlooking the parking lot behind the grassy knoll  the 
               shot includes this last car circling in the lot

                                     bowers
                         towards the underpass i saw two men 
                         standing behind a picket fence 
                         they were looking up towards main 
                         and houston and following the caravan 
                         as it came down  one of them was 
                         middleaged heavyset  the other 
                         man was younger wearing a plaid 
                         shirt and jacket

               inside the railroad tower bowers glances out busy with the 
               main board flashing lights a train coming in

                                     bowers
                         there were two other men on the 
                         eastern end of the parking lot  
                         each of me had uniforms

               we see the parking lot from bowers point of view  at a 
               distance but we have a sense of the cars and see the men at 
               a distance tow uniformed men  the parking lot is bumperto
               bumper with a sea of cars  rain that morning has muddied 
               the lot  these brief images are elaborated on later

                                     bowers
                         at the time of the shooting there 
                         seemed to be some commotion i 
                         just am unable to describe  a flash 
                         of light or smoke or something which
                         caused me to feel that something out 
                         of the ordinary had occurred there 
                         on the embankment

               we feel the growing intensity music drums  but all blurred  
               we see a puff of smoke but no sound because of the window 
               bowers is glancing through  a motorcycle cop shoots up the 
               grassy knoll incline  people run blurring into a larger 
               mosaic of confusion  bowers is confused seeing this

               intercut with jims heart pounding as he reads

               back in dealey plaza sm holland an elderly signal 
               supervisor stands on the parapet of the railway

                         four shots a puff of smoke came 
                         from the trees behind that picket 
                         fence close to the little plaza  
                         theres no doubt whatever in my mind

               we see the scene from hollands point of view  the puff of 
               smoke lingering under the trees along the picket fence after 
               the shooting

               lou gets it and glances up  we flashback to the exterior of 
               544 camp street in 1963  lee oswald comes out the door into 
               a full closeup now clearly seen by us and heads out into 
               the street as guy banister intercepts him on the sidewalk 
               holding a leaflet and point to 544 camp street stamped on 
               it  guy seems miffed at oswald tells him something quickly 
               and then moves on

                                     banister
                              under

                         doing on this piece of paper
                              he moves away

                         bullseye  how do we know he was 
                         here  cause this office address was 
                         stamped on the procasto leaflets he 
                         was handing out in the summer of 63 
                         down on canal street  they were the 
                         same leaflets that were found in his 
                         garage in dallas

               flashback to canal street in new orleans on a summer day in 
               1963  oswald in a thin tie and white shortsleeved shirt 
               and wearing a homemade placard reading hands off cuba 
               viva fidel is hawking leaflets to pedestrians with two 
               young helpers

               a large whitehaired businessman in a white suit very 
               distinguished walks with a friend on canal street  oswald 
               glances at him and meets his eyes  the businessman enters 
               an office building  this man is clay bertrand later known 
               as clay shaw

               some cubans led by carols bringuier now appear  one of 
               them the bull is heavyset with dark glasses  more of 
               him will also be seen

                                     jim
                         he was arrested that day for fighting 
                         with some anticastro cubans but 
                         actually he had contacted them a few 
                         days earlier as an exmarine trying 
                         to join the anticastro crusade  
                         when they heard he was now procastro 
                         they paid him a visit

                                     carlos
                              haranguing passerby

                         believe a word he tells you
                              to oswald

                         communist go back to moscow

               carlos throws oswalds leaflets in the air and pulls off his 
               glasses prepared to fight  oswald only smiles and puts 
               his arms down in an x of passivity

                                     oswald
                         okay carlos if you want to hit me 
                         hit me

               there is no real fight but the police as if prealerted 
               arrive

               arrests are made  we see oswald in a room in the police 
               station talking with fbi agent john quigley  a calendar on 
               the wall shows that its august 1963

                                     jim vo
                         there was no real fight and the 
                         arresting lieutenant later said he 
                         felt it was a staged incident  in 
                         jail oswald asked to talk to special 
                         agent john quigley of the fbi who 
                         showed up immediately  they have a 
                         private session  oswald is released 
                         and quigley destroys his notes from 
                         the interview

               in a television studio in 1963 oswald debates carlos 
               bringuier with two moderators

                                     jim
                         but the arrest gets him a lot of 
                         publicity and as a result oswald 
                         appears on a local tv debate that 
                         established his credentials as a 
                         communist

                                     bringuier
                         but youre a communist are you not 
                         and you defected to russia

                                     oswald
                         no i am not a communist  but i am 
                         a marxistleninist

                                     bringuier
                         what did you do when you were in 
                         russia

                                     oswald
                              defensive
                         i worked while i was there  i was 
                         always under the protection of 
                         that is to say i was not under the 
                         protection of the us government

               flashback to banisters office in 1963  there are cubans in 
               battle fatigues and combat boots duffle bags are lying 
               around  david ferrie in fatigues directs the cubans as 
               they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room  
               martin observes from another desk

                                     martin
                         dave ferrie  you know about him

                                     jim vo
                         was he there often

                                     martin vo
                         often  he practically lived there  
                         it was real cloak and dagger stuff  
                         they called it operation mongoose  
                         the idea was to train all these cuban 
                         exiles for another invasion of cuba  
                         banisters office was part of a supply 
                         line that ran from dallas through 
                         new orleans to miami stockpiling 
                         arms and explosives

               still in 1963 we see the exterior of banisters office  a 
               dozen cubans follow ferrie downstairs into the street and 
               pile into several cars duffels thrown in with them  ferrie 
               drives the lead car

                                     jim vo
                         all this right under the noses of 
                         the intelligence community in 
                         lafayette square

               we see the cars cross the long lake pontchartrain bridge and 
               enter a remote guerrilla training camp  bayou and jungle 
               are all around

                                     martin vo
                         sure  everybody knew everybody  it 
                         was a network  they were working 
                         for the cia  pilots black operations 
                         guys civilians military  everybody 
                         in those days was running guns 
                         somewhere fort jefferson bayou 
                         bluff morgan city mcallen texas 
                         was a big gunrunning operation

               at the guerrilla training camp at lake pontchartrain in 1963 
               we see scenes of basic training  shooting obstacle courses 
               callisthenics  led by ferrie and other trainers  scattered 
               among the cubans are several white american mercenaries  we 
               catch a glimpse of oswald and glimpses of several other men 
               we will see again in sprinklings

                                     jim vo
                         where is banister in all this

                                     martin vo
                         banister was running his camp north 
                         of lake pontchartrain  ferrie handled 
                         a lot of the training  there was a 
                         shooting range and a lot of tropical 
                         terrain like in cuba  a few americans 
                         got trained too  nazi types  
                         mercenaries  but ferrie was the 
                         craziest

               its night at the training camp  fbi agents race up in cars 
               in the middle of the night swarming over the camp rounding 
               up the trainees

                                     martin
                         anyway late summer the party ended  
                         kennedy didnt want another bay of 
                         pigs mess so he ordered the fbi to 
                         shut down the camps and confiscate 
                         the napalm and the c4  there were 
                         a buncha cubans and a couple americans 
                         arrested only you didnt read about 
                         it in the papers  just the weapons 
                         got mentioned cause the first 
                         ones behind bars wouldve been 
                         banister and ferrie but i think the 
                         gmen were just going through the 
                         motions for washington  their hearts 
                         were with their old fbi buddy 
                         banister

               we see fbi agents loading dynamite bomb casings arms 155mm 
               artillery shells etc

                         moscow

               flashback to moscow in 1959  we see shots of the city  
               strange and eerie blackandwhite stills  inside the us 
               embassy oswald slaps his passport on the table with a formal

                         says oswalds performance was not 
                         spontaneous  it seemed coached  
                         oswald gives an interview to a 
                         journalist

               continuing the moscow flashback we see oswald talking with 
               a female journalist in his small room in the hotel metropole  
               again he sounds robotic

                         hate because theyre told to hate 
                         like school kids  its the fashion 
                         to hate people in the us

                         the russians are skeptical  want to 
                         send him back  maybe they suspect 
                         hes a spy  he supposedly slashes 
                         his wrists in a suicide attempt so 
                         that theyre forced to keep him and 
                         he disappears for six weeks 
                         presumably with the kgb

               we see photos of the city of minks in russia oswald with 
               various friends and tourists shots of lee and marina with a

                         finally they shuttle him to a radio 
                         factory in minks where he lives as 
                         high on the hog as he ever has  
                         hes given 5000 rubles a roomy 
                         apartment with a balcony has affairs

                         meets marina whose uncle is a colonel

                         the royal treatment is he did give 
                         them radar secrets  or fake secrets

                         clearance and knew about the u2

                         powers hinted that oswald couldve 
                         given the russians enough data to 
                         hit it  as a direct result the 
                         peace summit between khrushchev and 
                         eisenhower failed  i cant help

                         didnt want the peace conference to 
                         happen maybe oswald was part of

                         de mohrenschildt draws a picture of

                         sidetracked  this is the man bottom 
                         line who nailed oswald to the warren 
                         commission as a potentially violent 
                         man and linked him to the rifle

                         the only russian that suspects oswald 
                         of still being a communist is anna 
                         meller  but her russian friend tells

                         all i can find out about the williams 
                         is their tax returns are classified 
                         and that bill williams a descendant 
                         of the cabots of massachusetts has

                         another one of the nazis we brought

                         build the v2 rockets for hitler

                                     bill
                         and therefore because oswald pulled 
                         the trigger the intelligence 
                         community murdered their own commander

                         even fire a rifle on november 22nd  
                         and on top of that they didnt even 
                         bother to check if the rifle had 
                         been fired that day

                                     bill

                         other a mauser described by deputy 
                         weitzman maybe just maybe lee 
                         oswald was exactly what he said he 
                         was bill  a patsy  take it at 
                         face value  lou susie im going 
                         with my gut here  hes got an alias 
                         of hidell to buy the rifle oh

                         in a name right  in intelligence 
                         theyre assumed to be fake  a name 
                         is sort of like a postbox number a 
                         code  several different people can 
                         use the same name right  then why 
                         cant somebody be using oswalds 
                         name

               we see blank faces around the table

                                     bill
                         but why

                                     jim
                         to frame him obviously  you got to 
                         get in your minds how the hell spooks 
                         think bill  theyre not ordinary 
                         crooks

                                     lou
                         i never could figure out why this 
                         guy orders a traceable weapon to 
                         that post office box when you can go 
                         into any store in texas give a phony 
                         name and walk out with a cheap rifle 
                         which can never be traced

                                     jim
                         unless he or someone else wants him 
                         to get caught  maybe he never ordered 
                         the weapon lou  somebody else did  
                         it was picked up at the post office 
                         early morning when oswalds time 
                         sheet shows him clocked in at his 
                         job  lou come alive  these things 
                         are not adding up

                         i still have to question what the 
                         legal basis is that supports this

                         your hunch was right boss but its 
                         even spookier than we thought  
                         starting in september 63 on two 
                         months before the assassination 
                         there are sightings of oswald all 
                         over dallas buying ammunition 
                         getting a telescopic sight fixed 
                         going to rifle ranges early 
                         november a dallas downtown lincoln
                         mercury dealership where he tells 
                         the salesman albert bogard

               flashback to the lincolnmercury dealership  oswald is 
               deliberately kept in half or three quarter shots  a mystery 
               figure  he kicks the tires on a used red mercury comet 
               cocky

                                         oswald

               the salesman bogard is hesitant  oswald doesnt look 
               like hes got a dime to his name

                                         oswald

                                     sensing bogards hesitancy

                         the next two weeks

               in the next scene we see the car driven by oswald zooming 
               up the ramp and disappearing onto the freeway

                         despite the fact he has no license 
                         and from what marina says does not 
                         know how to drive he hits the curves 
                         like mario andretti at the indy 500  
                         bogard later told his boss he drove 
                         like a madman

               resume the scene at the dealership

                                     bogard

                         salesman remembers him as about 57 
                         but we know from his draft card he 
                         was about 511

                         firing ranges

                         lady in dallas working in the anti
                         castro underground  remember that 
                         name a solid witness  the two cubans 
                         introduce him as leon oswald

               flashback to the corridor of silvia odios apartment in dallas 
               on a night in 1963  oswald drags behind two cubans  one is 
               the bull heavyset with a scar over his left eye who we 
               saw at the canal street incident and the other the indian 
               is quiet and cold  the men ring the doorbell and talk to a 
               concerned silvia as oswald hangs back watching in the 
               shadows  the men give her intimate information about her 
               father who is imprisoned in cuba  the men chatter ad lib 
               in spanish

                                     susie
                         the cubans want silvia whose 
                         parents are political prisoners in 
                         cuba to help them raise money to 
                         assassinate castro  something about 
                         the men bothers her  she tells them 
                         she doesnt want anything to do with 
                         violence about 48 hours later one 
                         of the cubans calls her back

               we see a shot of silvia on the phone in her apartment intercut 
               with a shot of the bull in a gas station phone booth on a 
               night in 1963

                                     the bull
                              on the phone in 
                              spanish
                         this guy leon oswalds great hes 
                         kinda nut  he told us we dont 
                         any guts us cubans cause kennedy 
                         shouldve been whacked after the bay 
                         of pigs and some cubans shouldve 
                         done that its easy to do he says 
                         you know hes a marine an expert 
                         shooter

               silvia odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered  
               the bulls eyes are on oswaldo outside the booth with 
               the indian  theyre hanging out talking to a mystery 
               man an anglo

                                     susie
                         its like hes giving her information 
                         she doesnt even ask for  shes 
                         scared doesnt see them again till 
                         she sees oswalds picture in the 
                         paper  but the warren commission 
                         says she has bad eyesight because 
                         they have oswald in mexico at this 
                         time trying to get back into cuba  
                         the cubans think hes a double agent 
                         so they wont take him  the cia has 
                         a camera outside the cuban embassy 
                         and says this is oswald in mexico
                              hands over a picture
                         you figure it

               jim looks at the famous photo the camera closes in on a 
               heavyset man who looks nothing like oswald  liz has come 
               back in and overhears

                                     al
                         if this is oswald it must be our 
                         third oswald

                                     jim
                         the interesting thing is the extent 
                         to which the warren commission went 
                         to make him a communist  they got 
                         almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of 
                         the report on this mexico trip and 
                         the picture doesnt even match  im 
                         beginning to think the point of the 
                         mexican episode was to lay the blame 
                         at castros door  if oswald or 
                         someone purporting to be oswald had 
                         gotten into cuba come back then 
                         killed the president the american 
                         public once again wouldve screamed 
                         for a cuban invasion

               susie picks up the famous life magazine cover shot of oswald 
               holding a rifle in his backyard

                         i even have doubts about this photo 
                         boss  it pretty much convicted oswald 
                         in the public mind  well according 
                         to captain fritz oswald told him 
                         during his interrogation the photo 
                         was fake

               flashback to the dallas homicide office in 1963  oswald is 
               being interrogated by will fritz dallas homicide chief who 
               shows him the original of the photo from the williams garage

                                     oswald
                         thats not me

                                     fritz
                         it came from janet williams garage

                                     oswald
                         well i never saw that picture  it 
                         is my face but my face has been 
                         superimposed  the rest of the 
                         picture is not me at all  ive done 
                         a lot of photographic work and that 
                         picture was made by someone else

                                     fritz
                         so who the hell are you  alex hidell 
                         or oswald

                                     oswald

                                     susie
                              in the present
                         oswald who worked for jaggarschiles
                         stovall did know spy photography 
                         pretty well  i took this picture to 
                         two experts  look at the way the 
                         shadows on the nose fall in a straight 
                         line like its high noon  but the 
                         shadow here on the ground reads like 
                         late afternoon or early morning  
                         its not the same time  also look 
                         at the crop marks across the chin  
                         it seems like his head is pasted on 
                         somebody elses body implicating him 
                         with this rifle and gun

                         trail of incriminating evidence that

               shaws rich bassoon voice drips with dialect  imperiously 
               smoking a gaulois shaw has about him an air of authority

                         this holiday but i feel this is a 
                         conversation we might better have 
                         out of the everyday bustle in this 
                         office

                         we recently talked to a number of 
                         men who claim to know you  are you 
                         acquainted with a david logan

                                     shaw
                         no  never heard of him

                                     jim
                         a willie okeefe

                                     shaw
                         no i dont believe i know anyone by 
                         that name

                                     jim
                         mr okeefe told us he met you at 
                         the masquerade bar down in the quarter 
                         and several evenings later you had 
                         him over for dinner at your apartment 
                         on dauphine street  do you recall 
                         that

               flashback to clays dauphine street residence in the quarter 
               at night in 1962  the butler opens the door and okeefe is 
               admitted to the townhouse  shaw appears behind the butler

                              in present
                         of course not  i dont know this 
                         man  obviously then i wouldnt 
                         have him to dinner  incidentally i 
                         do not live in an apartment  its 
                         an 1860s house built by gallier  
                         ive restored it faithfully  you 
                         know i am quite an advocate of 
                         restoration

               at shaws house dinner is served at a long table by the 
               black butler  the table is decorated by a sumptuous setting 
               of silver and candelabra

               shaw uses a bell to summon the butler

                                     jim vo
                         perhaps a few more details about the 
                         evening will refresh your memory  
                         mr okeefe told us dinner was served 
                         by a uniformed waiter  a colored 
                         man  he particularly remembers that 
                         you sat at one end and he at the 
                         other  which he found rather unusual 
                         because the table was so long  does 
                         that bring back memories of willie 
                         okeefe

                                     shaw
                              in present
                         not at all  but on the other hand 
                         i do have a lovely chippendale dining 
                         table and i often have a friend over 
                         sitting at one end while i sit at 
                         the other  that is precisely the 
                         point of a long dining table  the 
                         splendor of the meal adds to the 
                         enjoyment of it

                                     jim
                         i would imagine a uniformed waiter 
                         helps

                                     shaw
                         it adds a taste of elegance for which 
                         i must confess a weakness for now 
                         and then  i call him smedley  his 
                         real name is frankie jenkins  but i 
                         could hardly imagine anything more 
                         uncouth during dinner than my turning 
                         toward the kitchen and hollering 
                         frankie  where is this leading 
                         to mr garrison

               willie okeefe and clay shaw leave the dining table

                                     jim vo
                         after dinner you paid him to have 
                         sex with you

                                     shaw vo
                              laughing
                         pffft  absolute nonsense  the 
                         quarter is filled with vivid 
                         imaginations my dear mr garrison  
                         grimy young hoodlums wholl say and

                                     jim vo
                         in the course of that night mr 
                         okeefe said a man named david ferrie 
                         stopped by the house along with 
                         another young man

               at shaws townhouse we see ferrie coming in with another 
               young chicken

                                     shaw vo

                         no  i have never known anyone by 
                         that name  of course never having 
                         met mr okeefe i could hardly have 
                         met mr ferrie

                                     jim vo
                         and that the four of you partied 
                         early into the morning hours

               we see the four men in drag smiling for the flash camera 
               champagne bottles in hand  ferrie sniffs some poppers then 
               shoves a popper in shaws face

                                     ferrie

               ferrie forces more poppers on shaw  the camera movies to 
               shaws bedroom where ferrie scatters a drawer full of leather 
               tools

                                     ferrie

                         article saying you were a member of 
                         the board of centro mondo commerciale 
                         in italy that this company was a 
                         creature of the cia for the transfer 
                         of funds in italy for illegal

                         fascist ties to the french secret 
                         army organization that tried to 
                         assassinate de gaulle in 1960

                         so we have been repeatedly faced 
                         with the cruel irony of watching 
                         negro and white boys on tv screens 
                         as they kill and die for a nation

                                     miller
                         nonsense  you should be in a job

               he leans forward across jims desk tapping his manicured 
               index finger on the desk  clearly visible to jim and to us 
               in a closeup is millers annapolis ring tapping

                                     miller
                         i propose you accept an appointment 
                         to the bench in federal district 
                         court and move into a job worthy of 
                         your talent
                              he leans back and 
                              pauses
                         do you have any idea do you have 
                         any conception of how easily such an 
                         appointment can be arranged

                                     jim
                         and what would i have to do

                                     miller
                         stop your investigation it was a 
                         magnificent effort but its over and 
                         done with  the press is already on 
                         your behind and thats only the 
                         beginning my boy only the beginning

                         how long do you think it would take 
                         me to be appointed

               jims eyes go to bill  he could be wrong but its almost 
               as if bill were going along with the idea now

                                     miller
                              smiling thinking 
                              jim is hooked
                         well ordinarily these things take a 
                         long time  but in your case with 
                         your record it can be expedited  
                         easily  i guarantee it

               jim leans back puts his feet up on the corner of the desk 
               waving them like fans  bill waits

                                     jim
                         who are you mr miller
                              no answer  just the 
                              sound of the overhead 
                              fan
                         you see that helmet over there
                              the nazi helmet with 
                              a bullet hole on his 
                              desk
                         i picked that up at the dachau 
                         concentration camp when we liberated 
                         it in 1945  it was the most 
                         horrifying sight ive ever seen mr  
                         miller  pyramids of decaying 
                         stinking bones and skin one on top 
                         of the other  i dont enjoy looking 
                         at that swastika every day mr 
                         miller but i keep it there to remind 
                         me of what can happen when a country 
                         turns from free democratic principles 
                         to fascism when a few madmen turn 
                         human beings into digits and millions 
                         sit in silence and do nothing about 
                         it

               miller waits  bill waits  jim comes forward with his reply

                                     jim
                         mr miller you and i have met under 
                         a great misunderstanding  i havent 
                         the remotest interest in becoming a 
                         federal judge  and nothing is going 
                         to keep me from going ahead with my 
                         investigation of john kennedys 
                         murder

               millers entire demeanor tightens into a corkscrew of anger 
               and danger

                                     jim
                         bill mr miller and i have finished 
                         our conversation  would you show 
                         him out

               bill has a strange reaction  a sudden exhalation of breath 
               as if an entire house of cards were collapsing  he rises 
               but miller goes first leaving silently  once hes gone 
               bill turns wearily to jim

                                     jim
                         those bastards  thats proof enough 
                         right there of what were up against  
                         the whole goddamn federal government

               garrisons conference room  another day1967

               the staff is assembled  we see the headline in the times
               picayune which says ferrie calls garrison probe a witch 
               hunt

                         boss i tell you something or somebody 
                         is putting tremendous heat on david 
                         ferrie  if we sit on our behinds 
                         any longer i dont think the guys 
                         going to hold on

                              raps the newspaper
                         look at this bullshit  he keeps 
                         changing what he says  we cant 
                         possibly call him to a grand jury

                         my instinct is that ferrie is going 
                         to keep on deteriorating and well 
                         end up getting more out of him when 
                         he finally cracks  if we call him 
                         now he might freeze up and we could 
                         lose the best shot weve ever had

               members of the press are all over yelling questions at jim

               inside ferries apartment

               the apartment is filthy and sinister  hundreds of mice squeal 
               in their cages upset by the invasion of men and light  
               nothing seems to have been washed in years  there is an 
               accumulation of furniture college pennants photos of young 
               boys in training books everywhere ammunition guns a piano 
               maps fake college degrees on the walls  ferries naked 
               body lies on the couch with a sheet over it  he is unwigged 
               his eyebrows unpainted false teeth next to him  jim studies 
               the corpse as the coroner comes alongside

                         like natural causes

               jim picks several empty capless medicine bottles on a table 
               next to the sofa and looks at them  lou and bill come over 
               with a typed suicide note

                         its addressed to no one and no 
                         signature  to leave this life is 
                         for me a sweet prospect  i find 
                         nothing in it that is desirable and 
                         on the other hand everything that 
                         is loathsome

               the words from the note hang there weirdly as jim paces on 
               into the apartment one of them medicine bottles in his hand  
               the music grows and a sinister feel of danger and death 
               pervades the atmosphere  then the sounds drop away

               his eye falls on a neat but faded lace and satin some sort

               something about his manner speaks of authority knowledge

                         plan for getting all us  personnel 
                         out of vietnam by the end of 65  
                         this plan was one of the strongest 
                         and most important papers issued 
                         from the kennedy white house  our 
                         first 1000 troops were ordered home 
                         for christmas  tensions were high  
                         in november 63 one week after the 
                         murder of vietnamese president diem 
                         in saigon and two weeks before the 
                         assassination of our president

               flashback to the pentagon offices in 1963  x strides down a 
               busy hall and into the offices of one of his superiors major 
               general y a lean cold warrior battlefield handsome 
               civilian clothes and several advisors  theres a us flag 
               on the wall  the status of y is only clear by the sing on 
               the desk the name blocked by a passing figure

                                     x
                         a strange thing happened  i was 
                         sent by my superior officer call 
                         him y to the south pole as the 
                         military escort for a group of 
                         international vips  this trip had 
                         nothing to do with my nine years of 
                         work in special operations  it was 
                         sort of a paid vacation

               we hear vague adlib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating 
               a friendly atmosphere and we see stock footage of a c130 
               transport flying to antarctica and ice floes on the surface 
               of the sea

               then at a new zealand airport we see x in a uniform at a 
               newsstand reading of kennedys assassination  the banner 
               headline of an extra edition of the christchurch star 
               screams out kennedy shot dead

                                     x
                         it wasnt until i was on my way back 
                         in new zealand that i read of the 
                         presidents murder  that was 2 in 
                         the afternoon the next day new zealand 
                         time but already the papers had the 
                         entire history of an unknown 24year
                         old man oswald  a studio picture 
                         detailed biographical data russian 
                         information  and were pretty sure 
                         of the fact hed killed the president 
                         alone although it took them four 
                         more hours to charge him with the 
                         murder in texas  it felt as if 
                         well a cover story was being put 
                         out like we would in a black op

               back at the pentagon office we see x returning and meeting 
               y  the atmosphere is cordial but y is slightly different 
               from before  more harried more nervous  he turns away to 
               light a cigarette he doesnt want the usual conversation

                                     x
                         anyway after i came back i asked 
                         myself why was i the chief of special 
                         ops selected to travel to the south 
                         pole at that time to do a job that 
                         any number of others could have done  
                         one of my routine duties if i had 
                         been in washington wouldve been to 
                         arrange for additional security in 
                         texas  the secret service is 
                         relatively small and by custom the 
                         military will augment them  i checked 
                         it out when i got back and sure 
                         enough i found out someone had told 
                         the 112th military intelligence group 
                         at 4th army headquarters at fort sam 
                         houston to stand down that day 
                         over the protests of the unit 
                         commander a colonel reich

               we see an outdoor shot of the texas army headquarters on a 
               day in 1963  inside on the same day col reich is on the

                         have felt an army presence in the 
                         streets that day but none of this 
                         happened  it was a violation of the 
                         most basic protection codes we have  
                         and it is the best indication of a 
                         massive plot in dallas  who could 
                         have best done that  people in my

                         day in fact there were some 
                         individual army intelligence people 
                         in dallas and im still trying to 
                         figure out who and why  but they

                         been destroyed  many strange things 
                         were happening that day and lee 
                         harvey oswald had nothing to do with 
                         them  we had the entire cabinet on 
                         a trip to the far east  we had a

                         get their perception out of the way  
                         the troops were in the air for

                         that kennedy got through wounded  
                         they would have moved in with vehicles

                         question  why  why was kennedy

                         the power to cover it up you

                         kennedys directives were never really 
                         implemented because of bureaucratic 
                         resistance but one of the results 
                         was that the cuban operation was 
                         turned over to my department as

                         if mr shaw had no connection to the

                         investigate him  and why if they 
                         did is his name not mentioned once

                         report even it if is to clear his

                         no i dont think so  mr garrison 
                         has presented absolutely nothing 
                         publicly to contradict our findings  
                         as yet i have not heard one fact to

                         before theyre allowed to produce 
                         sacred cows like the chief justice

                         mr garrison if what you say is 
                         even partly true in this case you 
                         realize you are damaging the

                         let me ask you is a government 
                         worth preserving when it lies to the 
                         people  it has become a dangerous 
                         country sir when you cant trust 
                         anyone anymore when you cant tell 
                         the truth  i say let justice be 
                         done though the heavens fall

                         in the sheriffs report mrs mercer 
                         it says you were at dealey plaza two 
                         hours before the assassination but 
                         that

                         yes it was about 11 in the morning  
                         i was driving west on elm street 
                         toward the triple underpass in a 
                         rented car  a blue valiant  ill 
                         never forget that day

               flashback to dealey plaza in 1963  its a normal scene  
               cars traffic people starting to arrive for kennedys 
               appearance  we catch a glimpse of julia ann mercer 23 
               driving then stopping traffic

                                     mercer
                         there was quite a bit of traffic 
                         and i was stopped alongside a green 
                         pickup truck  it was very noticeable 
                         because it was blocking traffic and 
                         it was parked with two wheels on the 
                         curb  when i saw the gun i thought  
                         the secret service is not very secret

               she glances over at the man in the drivers seat  its jack 
               ruby wearing a green jacket  then she sees a young white 
               man in his mid  20s in a gray jacket brown pants plaid 
               shirt and wool stocking hat getting out of the passenger 
               side going to the rear of the van opening a tool compartment 
               and removing a package that looks like a rifle wrapped in 
               paper  he walks up the embankment in the direction of the 
               picket fence  ruby looks over and stares at julia ann who 
               turns away and notices three police officers standing near a 
               motorcycle on the overpass bridge  her eyes lock with rubys 
               a second time and as the traffic moves she drives on

                                     mercer
                         the next morning saturday i went 
                         to the fbi office and the agents 
                         showed me photographs

               in the dallas fbi office mercer sits at a table looking at 
               photos  two fbi agents stand near her showing her photos  
               she shakes her head no several times until they put a 
               shot of jack ruby in front of her  she holds it up

                                     mercer
                         i picked out three pictures that 
                         looked generally like the driver of 
                         the truck and then

                                     mercer
                         thats the man

                                     fbi agent
                              to second agent
                         jack ruby

                                     second agent
                         what about these others  you said 
                         they might be him

                                     mercer
                         they look a little like him  but 
                         no
                              holding up the ruby 
                              photo
                         im sure this is the man

               back in the present jim continues to question mercer

                                     jim
                         you mean you identified him on 
                         saturday the day before ruby shot 
                         oswald

                                     mercer
                         thats right  when i saw him on tv 
                         i was shocked  i said to my family 
                         that was the man i saw in the truck

                                     jim
                              skeptical
                         but you didnt seem nearly so sure 
                         in your statement to the warren 
                         commission

                                     mercer
                         thats what bothers me mr garrison  
                         you see theyve been altered  my 
                         statements

               jim is silent  mercer picks up the report and finds the 
               pertinent paragraphs

                                     mercer
                         this says mercer could not identify 
                         any of the photographs as being 
                         identical with the person she had 
                         observed slouched over the wheel of 
                         a green ford pickup truck  thats 
                         not true  i recognized him and i 
                         told them so they also said it 
                         was a dark green air conditioning 
                         truck which it was not  and here
                              she goes to another 
                              report
                         on the dallas sheriffs report  
                         this is really strange  see that 
                         notarized signature on the bottom of 
                         each page  thats not my signature  
                         and there never was any notary present 
                         during any of my questioning
                              she hands the papers 
                              back to jim
                         i guess thats all

                                     jim
                         mrs mercer as a former fbi man 
                         its difficult to accept this

                                     mercer
                         i know but mr garrison the fbi is 
                         just not doing their job

                                     husband
                         im a republican mr garrison and 
                         i dont go in for this kind of 
                         government bashing but i must tell 
                         you somethings not right when they 
                         dont even bother to call julia in 
                         front of the warren commission

                                     jim
                         they didnt call a lot of people 
                         mr mercer  i think its safe to 
                         say the warren report is a work of 
                         fiction

               dissolve to dealey plaza1967

               our view is from the roof of the building on the extreme 
               south side of the plaza  jc price the building engineer 
               in hat and overalls points for jim and lou

                                     price vo
                         yes sir right here on this spot  
                         the shots came from near that wooden 
                         fence over there near the overpass

               the camera tightens on the picket fence

                                     price
                         i saw a man run from this spot and 
                         go behind the book depository  30 
                         minutes later i gave this information 
                         to the sheriff

               on the overpass near dealey plaza sm holland a tan 
               elderly leatherfaced signal supervisor points to the picket 
               fence for jim and lou  his accent is thick and rural  we 
               saw him before briefly when jim was reading the warren 
               report

                                     holland
                         i made it very clear to the warren 
                         people one of the shots came from 
                         behind that picket fence  i heard 
                         the report and saw the smoke come 
                         out about 6 or 8 feet above the 
                         ground right out from under those 
                         trees  there is no doubt whatsoever 
                         in my mind

               flashback to the restaged shooting  the smoke hangs under 
               the trees

               cut to richard dodd on the overpass  hes a cowboy type 
               with a hat and an even thicker accent than holland

                                     dodd
                              pointing
                         we all four of us all railroad 
                         men standing here seen about the 
                         same thing  the smoke came from 
                         behind the hedge  and a motorcycle 
                         policeman dropped his cycle in the 
                         street and run up the embankment

               flashback to the motorcycle

               back to 1967  jim and lou walk with dodd and holland near 
               the picket fence  we feel the emptiness of the area now and 
               see the normal amount of traffic driving by

                                     holland
                         we came around here to look for 
                         tracks  it rained that morning and 
                         we found a bunch of cigarette butts  
                         someoned been standing about here

               the camera shows the spot and lou sighting

                                     lou
                         this is a good spot chief for the 
                         head shot

               jim looks reliving the moment

               later jim and lou stand on the south side of elm street in 
               dealey plaza talking to jean hill an attractive 30ish 
               teacher  her demeanor has a rocksolid texas backcountry 
               conviction to it shes a woman not easily frightened

                                     jean hill
                         i was standing here next to my friend 
                         mary mooman who took the photograph 
                         when he was killed

               we see a flash of the moorman photograph  a blurry polaroid 
               with the president in the foreground and the picket fence in 
               background  we will return to this photograph in more detail 
               later

                                     jean hill
                         i jumped out in the street and yelled 
                         hey mr president look over here 
                         we wanna take your picture  he 
                         looked up and then shots rang out  
                         mary fell to the ground right away 
                         shouting get down theyre shooting 
                         get down theyre shooting i knew 
                         it but i was moving to get closer to 
                         him  the driver had stopped  i 
                         dont know what was wrong with that 
                         driver  and then out of the corner 
                         of my eye i saw this flash of light 
                         in the bushes and that last shot 
                         just ripped his head off i mean 
                         blood brains just blew everything

               flashback to the day of the shooting  we hear the sound of 
               shots and see the grassy knoll from jeans point of view

                                     jean hill
                         i looked up and saw smoke from the 
                         knoll  and everything was frozen  
                         seemed like people wasnt even 
                         breathing like youre looking at a 
                         picture  except this one guy  i 
                         saw this one guy running from the 
                         book depository towards the railroad 
                         tracks  and that was the same man i 
                         saw on tv two days later shooting 
                         oswald  that was jack ruby  no 
                         question about it

               blurry image  were not at all sure what or who or if 
               but a seed is planted  we see smoke  the same smoke bowers 
               saw then jack ruby in a brown coat running from the book 
               depository toward the railroad tracks  then we see jeans 
               view as she runs toward the knoll along with others  there 
               are yells shouts and general confusion

                         i dont know what i would have done 
                         if i had caught him but i knew 
                         something terrible had happened and 
                         somebody had to do something

               at the picket fence we see blurry images of police officers 
               railroad workers cigarette butts buddy footprints 
               confusion

               hill 32 years old that day is shown into a third floor 
               office of the county courts building  which has a view of 
               the assassination area  other secret service agents are 
               there  some 18 people are detained there

               time cut to two men interrogating hill

                                     jean hill vo
                         these new people never identified 
                         themselves  they musta been watching 
                         the whole thing cause they knew 
                         everything mary and me had been doing 
                         that day  i guess i wasnt too hard 
                         to find  wearing that red raincoat

                                     man
                         how many shots you say you heard

                                     man

                         book depository and thats all were 
                         willing to say

                                     jean hill vo
                         which is strange cause this is 
                         less than 20 minutes after the 
                         assassination

                                     jean hill

                         not to talk to anyone about this  
                         no one you hear

                                     jean hill vo
                         i was scared  it was all kinda queer 
                         but it sure felt like two and two 
                         was coming up three and then they 
                         took marys five snapshots from me 
                         sent them to washington and when 
                         they returned them weeks later two 
                         of them had the backgrounds 
                         mutilated the only one we saved 
                         was in marys camera  i didnt want 
                         to go to washington when the warren 
                         commission subpoenaed me so the 
                         lawyer come down here and interviewed 
                         me at parkland hospital

               in a parkland hospital office in 1964 a lawyer interviews 
               jean hill  a female stenographer takes notes

                                     jean hill
                         he asked me why i thought i was in 
                         danger and i said

                                     jean hill
                         well if they can kill the president 
                         they can certainly get me

                                     lawyer
                         that doesnt make sense mrs hill

                         president

                         my story about the shots  he was 
                         getting hot under the collar and 
                         telling the woman not to write when 
                         he wanted

                                     jean hill

                         four and six shots  im not going 
                         to lie for you

                                     jean hill vo
                         so off the record he starts talking 
                         about my family and even mentioned

                                     jean hill vo
                         i knew something was crooked as a 
                         dogs hind leg cause no one who is 
                         just taking a deposition gets that 
                         involved and angry sure enough 
                         when i finally read my testimony as 
                         published by the warren commission 
                         it was a fabrication from start to 
                         finish

                                     jim
                         are you willing to testify mrs 
                         hill

               back at the knoll

                                     jean hill
                              without hesitation
                         damned right i would  somebodys 
                         got to tell the truth around here 
                         cause the government sure aint 
                         doing it

               dissolve to a scene inside the texas school book depository 
               in 1967  jim and lou walk the floor and look out the windows  
               lou has a mannlichercarcano in his hand with a sight and 
               clip  we see oswalds supposed view of the limousine as he 
               pulls the trigger  now innocuous traffic goes by but the 
               iris of the camera tightens into a snipers scope

                                     lou
                         the zapruder film establishes 3 shots 
                         in 56 seconds  here  im oswald  
                         time me

               lou cocks the mannlicher for the first shot  jim looks at 
               this watch

               lou assumes the oswald pose crouched at the window aiming 
               out

                                     jim
                         go

               lou pulls quickly recharges the bolt fires recycles fires

                                     lou
                         time

                                     jim
                         between six and seven seconds

                                     lou
                         the key is the second and third shots 
                         came right on top of each other and 
                         it takes a minimum 23 seconds to 
                         recycle this thing
                              he recycles the bolt 
                              for firing
                         the other problem is there was a 
                         tree right there
                              he points
                         blocking the first two shots at the 
                         time they occur in the zapruder film

                                     jim
                         didnt hoover say something about 
                         that  the leaves had fallen off in 
                         november

                                     lou
                         it was a texas live oak boss
                              he shakes his head
                         it sheds its leaves the first week 
                         of march  you try to hit a moving 
                         target at 88 yards through heavy 
                         foliage with this cheap 13dollar 
                         sucker the worlds worst shoulder 
                         weapon  no way  the fbi tried two 
                         sets of tests and not one of their 
                         sharpshooters could match oswalds 
                         performance  not one  and oswald 
                         was at best a medium shot  the scope 
                         was defective on it too  i mean 
                         this is the whole essence of the 
                         case to me  the guy couldnt do the 
                         shooting  nobody could  and they 
                         sold this lemon to the american 
                         public

                                     jim
                         the zapruder film is the proof they 
                         didnt count on lou  we gotta get 
                         our hands on it

                                     lou
                         that means we gotta subpoena time
                         life on it

                                     jim
                              looks out the window
                         why not just shoot kennedy coming up 
                         houston  theres plenty of time  
                         hes out in the open  a frontal 
                         shot

               jim points the carcano south right up houston street 
               following a car that happens to be passing by  a convertible 
               with an unknown woman driving

                                     lou
                         i asked myself the same thing  common 
                         sense  even if you miss the first 
                         shot if he accelerates you still 
                         got him for a second shot  no 
                         the only reason for waiting to get 
                         him on elm is you got him in a 
                         triangulated crossfire  you got him 
                         on a flat low trajectory from the 
                         front at the fence there

               the camera swings to the grassy knoll and the picket fence 
               as seen from the sixth floor of the depository

                                     lou
                         you put a third team there  in 
                         that building on a low floor

               jim pulls the dead trigger reliving the moment through the

               moving at a normal 25 mph they knew the motorcade would 
               have to slow to about 10 miles per hour to make this turn  
               thats where you get him

                         for this  oswald went to see the 
                         fbi two weeks before the 
                         assassination  it seems special 
                         agent hosty made three routine visits 
                         to his house supposedly to keep an 
                         eye on marina oswald

               flashback to dallas fbi office in 1963  oswald is at the 
               counter addressing the female receptionist

                                     oswald
                         i want to see special agent hosty

                         newspaperman it was a warning to him 
                         to stop questioning marina at their 
                         home when oswald was not present  
                         she was not a citizen so possibly 
                         he was threatening to deport her 
                         back to russia

                         but what the note really said no one 
                         knows because his boss shanklin told 
                         hosty

                         hosty tore it up and flushed it down 
                         the toilet  waggoner carr the 
                         attorney  general of texas says he 
                         had evidence from the dallas sheriffs 
                         office that oswald had been employed 
                         as an undercover informant for the 
                         fbi at a salary of 200 a month 
                         beginning more than a year before 
                         the murder

                              in present
                         this is just speculation people 
                         but what if the note was describing 
                         the assassination attempt on jfk
                              the staff seem 
                              surprised by the 
                              thought
                         come on guys think  thats the 
                         only reason to destroy it because 
                         if it was any kind of threat like 
                         hosty said they wouldve kept it 
                         cause it makes their case against 
                         the angry lone nut stronger  
                         remember the new orleans meeting 
                         with agent quigley the day he got 
                         busted

               flashback to oswald under arrest meeting with quigley

                                     jim
                         there again quigley destroyed the 
                         notes of the meeting  i think we 
                         can raise the possibility that oswald 
                         not only was an informant but that 
                         he may well have been the original 
                         source for the telex we have dated 
                         november 17 warning of the kennedy

                         duty here in the fbi office gave me 
                         a copy of this  it went all over 
                         the country  nothing was done and 
                         the motorcade went ahead on schedule  
                         and this wasnt even mentioned in 
                         the warren report  read it al

                         kennedy in dallas texas november 
                         2223  information received by the 
                         bureau has determined that a militant 
                         revolutionary group may attempt to 
                         assassinate president kennedy on his 
                         proposed trip to dallas texas etc 
                         etc

               flashback to new orleans fbi office in 1963  walter the 
               night clerk receives the teletype reads it and runs it

                                     jim vo
                         shortly after the assassination 
                         walter says the telex was removed 
                         from all the files in all cities as 
                         an obvious embarrassment to the 
                         bureau  i believe oswald was sending 
                         information through hosty

               flashback to a dallas safe house in 1963  oswald ruby and 
               several cubans including the bull and the indian are talking

                                     jim
                         i have a hunch that from the get go 
                         oswald had infiltrated this group 
                         probably cubans or rightwing 
                         extremists  he was at the book 
                         depository that day told to be there 
                         by their handlers either to prevent 
                         the assassination or to take part in 
                         it  they coulda told him anything 
                         either 1 they were going to close 
                         down the plotters that day or 2 
                         they were going to fake an attack on 
                         kennedy to whip up public opinion 
                         against russia or cuba and reverse 
                         his policies  it doesnt really 
                         matter what they told him cause he 
                         was under orders he was a foot 
                         soldier

               underneath the voiceover we hear and see oswald with a 
               floor plan of the book depository at the center of the group  
               jack ruby bull and the indian two or three young cubans 
               and a young white shooter  the man in the plaid shirt 
               described by julia ann mercer  are also there

                         turn from main onto houston thatll 
                         do the trick cause itll slow down

               ruby shares a look with bull unbeknownst to oswald and then

                         but as a covert operator in my book 
                         hes wide open for blackmail cause 
                         of his homosexuality

                                     jim
                         shaws our toehold bill  i dont

                         fits and i dont care  i do know 
                         hes lying through his teeth and im 
                         not gonna let go of him

                                     bill
                         so for those reasons youre going 
                         to trial against clay shaw chief  
                         well youre gonna lose  we should 
                         be investigating all our mafia leads 
                         here in new orleans  carlos marcello 
                         santos trafficante  i can buy that 
                         a hell of a lot easier than the 
                         government  rubys all mob knows 
                         oswald sets him up  hoffa  
                         trafficante  marcello they hire 
                         some guns and they do kennedy and 
                         maybe the government doesnt want to 
                         open up a whole can oworms there 
                         because it used the mob to get to 
                         castro  yknow castro being 
                         assassinated sounds pretty wild to 
                         john q  citizen  so they close the 
                         book on jfk  it makes sense to 
                         me

                                     jim
                         i dont doubt their involvement 
                         bill but at a low level  could the 
                         mob change the parade route bill 
                         or eliminate the protection for the 
                         president  could the mob send oswald 
                         to russia and get him back  could 
                         the mob get the fbi the cia and 
                         the dallas police to make a mess of 
                         the investigation  could the mob 
                         appoint the warren commission to 
                         cover it up  could the mob wreck 
                         the autopsy  could the mob influence 
                         the national media to go to sleep  
                         and since when has the mob used 
                         anything but 38s for hits up close  
                         the mob wouldnt have the guts or 
                         the power for something of this 
                         magnitude  assassins need payrolls 
                         orders times schedules  this was 
                         a militarystyle ambush from start 
                         to finish a coup detat with lyndon

                         are our witnesses being bought off 
                         and murdered  why are federal 
                         agencies blocking our extraditions 
                         and subpoenas when we were never 
                         blocked before

                                     bill

               he reads from a script on the desk

                                     johnson
                         first we had your charge that the 
                         cuban exiles killed the president 
                         then the mob then you said the oil 
                         billionaires did it then you said 
                         the minutemen and the ku klux klan 
                         collaborated to do it now your latest 
                         theory seems to be that the cia and 
                         the fbi and the pentagon and the 
                         white house all combined in some 
                         elaborate conspiracy to kill john 
                         kennedy  let me ask you is there 
                         anyone besides lee harvey oswald who 
                         you think did not conspire to kill 
                         the president

               he fixes his eyes on jim waiting for a reply  a weariness 
               has set in on jim  once more into the slaughter

                                     jim

                         jerry  ive stopped beating my wife
                              the audience laughs

                         johnson  we know he has some answers

               the audience loving it cheers  johnson looks at jim 
               blankly and reads the next question on his list

                                     johnson

                         in reputable news media  time 
                         newsweek our own nbc  that you 
                         have gone way beyond the legal means 
                         available to a prosecutor that youve 
                         intimidated and drugged witnesses 
                         bribed them urged them to commit 
                         perjury  what is your response

                                     jim
                         your faith in the veracity of the 
                         major media is touching jerry  it 
                         indicates that the age of innocence 
                         is not yet over  but seriously 
                         jerry people arent interested in 
                         jim garrison  they want the hard 
                         evidence  they want to know why he 
                         was killed and what forces were 
                         opposed to

                                     johnson
                              interrupting
                         some people would say youre paranoid

                                     jim
                         well if i am why is the government 
                         concealing evidence

                                     johnson
                         are they  why would they

                                     jim
                              pulling out his 
                              briefcase
                         thats exactly my question jerry  
                         maybe id better show you some 
                         pictures so you can begin to 
                         understand what i am talking about

               he pulls out a large blowup of the allen photo of the three 
               hoboes and starts to hold it up in front of the camera

                                     jim
                         these arrests were photographed 
                         minutes after the assassination and 
                         were never shown to the american 
                         public  they show

               it takes johnson a few moments to realize whats happening  
               when he does he lunges like a cobra for the photographs 
               pulling jims arm down so the pictures are out of the cameras 
               view

                                     johnson
                              sharply
                         pictures like this dont show up on 
                         television

                                     jim
                              holding the picture 
                              up again
                         sure they do  the camera can pick 
                         this up

                                     johnson
                              yanking his arm down
                         no it cant

               jim swings the picture up a third time but the stage director 
               gives a cut signal  finger across the throat  and the 
               red light on the camera blinks off  the monitor shows another 
               camera panning the audience

                                     jim
                              quickly realizes 
                              hes about to be cut 
                              off
                         those men you just saw were arrested 
                         in dallas minutes after the 
                         assassination  they were never seen 
                         again  no record of arrest no 
                         fingerprint no mugshot nothing  
                         they all got away

               the director frantically gives johnson the cut sign

                                     johnson
                         well be back after these messages

                         wins tonight will certainly emerge

                         the same girl i sent

                                     dymond
                         i see and why are you experiencing 
                         this paranoia

                                     goldberg
                              launching into his 
                              explanation
                         well you see ive been subject to 
                         hypnosis and psychological warfare 
                         ever since 1948 when i was in 
                         korea

               we see the faces of people in the courtroom the judges 
               face obviously goldberg is disturbed or maybe he is 
               telling the truth but it doesnt play well jim looks at 
               al sickly

                                     al

                         chief  im sorry  he was totally 
                         sane when we took his affidavit

                                     goldberg
                         when someone tries to get your 
                         attention  catch your eye  thats 
                         a clue right off

               this is an ugly surprise for jim  we see him at the bench

               also there

                                     judge haggerty
                         im sorry jim but the defendant 
                         did not have his lawyer present when 
                         asked

               flashback to 1967 in the new orleans police station  shaw 
               is being booked  the press is there and habighorst is 
               questioning him

                                     habighorst

                         jesus ed from time immemorial its 
                         been standard booking procedure to 
                         ask an alias  you know that  theres 
                         no constitutional requirement that 
                         says a lawyer has to be present for 
                         routine questions

                         thank you mr shaw

               jim rises slowly out of his chair

                                     jim
                         well a very great actor has just 
                         given us a great performance your 
                         honor but we are nowhere closer to 
                         the truth  let it be noted my office 
                         is charging clay shaw with outright 
                         perjury on the fifteen answers he 
                         has given not one word of this

                                     judge haggerty
                         youre out of order jim boy now 
                         sit down  strike those remarks

               cut to later in the trial  a movie screen has been installed 
               for the jury  jim paces dramatically as if waiting casting 
               looks at the door  members of the press pack the hot room 
               and a fan turns overhead

                                     jim
                         to prove their was a conspiracy 
                         involving clay shaw we must prove 
                         there was more than one man involved 
                         in the assassination  to do that 
                         we must look at the zapruder film 
                         which my office has subpoenaed  the 
                         american public has not seen that 
                         film because it has been kept locked 
                         in a vault in the timelife building 
                         in new york city for the last five 
                         years  there is a reason for that  
                         watch

               the zapruder film 8mm now rolls  we have seen pieces of 
               it before in the opening of the film but now we see it whole  
               it is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several 
               times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily 
               lost on casual viewing  the first viewing is silent except 
               for the sound of the clanky projector  it lasts about 25 
               seconds and then the lights come on  the jury is shaken  
               the judge is shaken  the people in the courtroom murmur  
               even clay shaw is surprised at what he has seen  jim says 
               nothing letting the truth of it sink in  then

                                     jim
                         a picture speaks a thousand words  
                         yet sometimes the truth is too simple 
                         for some  the warren commission 
                         thought they had an open and shut 
                         case three bullets one assassin  
                         but two things happened that made it 
                         virtually impossible 1the zapruder 
                         film which you just saw and 2the 
                         third wounded man jim tague who 
                         was nicked by a fragment down by the 
                         triple underpass  the time frame of 
                         56 seconds established by the 
                         zapruder film left no possibility of 
                         a fourth shot from oswalds rifle 
                         but the shot or fragment that left a 
                         superficial wound on tagues cheek 
                         had to come from a bullet that missed 
                         the car entirely  now they had two 
                         bullets that hit and we know one of 
                         them was the fatal head shot  so a 
                         single bullet remained to account 
                         for all seven wounds in kennedy and 
                         connally  but rather than admit to 
                         a conspiracy or investigate further 
                         the commission chose to endorse the 
                         theory put forth by an ambitious 
                         junior counsellor arlen specter  
                         one of the grossest lies ever forced 
                         on the american people weve come 
                         to know it as the magic bullet 
                         theory

               cut to a drawing which has been put on a chair for the jury  
               jim has also moved al acting as jfk into a chair directly 
               behind the larger numa acting as governor connally  he 
               demonstrates with a pointer

                         the magic bullet enters the 
                         presidents back headed downward at 
                         an angle of 17 degrees  it then 
                         moves upward in order to leave 
                         kennedys body from the front of his 
                         neck  his neck wound number two  
                         where it waits 16 seconds turns 
                         right and continues into connallys 
                         body at the rear of his right armpit  
                         wound number three  then the bullet 
                         heads downward at an angle of 27 
                         degrees shattering connallys fifth 
                         rib and leaving from the right side 
                         of his chest  wounds four and five  
                         the bullet continues downward and 
                         then enters connallys right wrist  
                         wound number six  shattering the 
                         radius bone  it then enters his 
                         left thigh  wound number seven  
                         from which it later falls out and is 
                         found in almost pristine condition 
                         on a stretcher in a corridor of 
                         parkland hospital
                              he shows a mockup 
                              of the pristine 
                              bullet
                         thats some bullet  anyone whos 
                         been in combat can tell you never in 
                         the history of gunfire has there 
                         been a bullet like this
                              the court laughs
                         the army wound ballistics experts at 
                         edgewood arsenal fired some comparison 
                         bullets and not one of them looked 
                         anything like this one
                              he shows mockups of 
                              comparison bullets
                         take a look at ce 856 an identical 
                         bullet fired through the wrist of a 
                         human cadaver  just one of the bones 
                         smashed by the magic bullet  yet 
                         the government says it can prove 
                         this with some fancy physics in a 
                         nuclear laboratory  of course they 
                         can  theoretical physics can prove 
                         an elephant can hang from a cliff 
                         with its tail tied to a daisy but 
                         use your eyes  your common sense 
                              he holds the bullet
                         seven wounds skin bone  this single 
                         bullet explanation is the foundation 
                         of the warren commissions claim of 
                         a lone assassin  and once you 
                         conclude the magic bullet could not 
                         create all seven of those wounds 
                         you have to conclude there was a 
                         fourth shot and a second rifleman  
                         and if there was a second rifleman 
                         there had to be a conspiracy which

                         seizure around 1215 pm 
                         distracting the police making it 
                         easier for the shooters to move into 
                         their places  the epileptic later 
                         vanished never checking into the

               the camera takes the shooters point of view we see down

                         floor lunch room around twelve  
                         around 1215 on her way out of the 
                         building to see the motorcade 
                         secretary carolyn arnold saw oswald 
                         in the second floor snack room where 
                         he said he went for a coke

               in the second floor lunchroom of the book depository we see 
               carolyn arnold a pregnant secretary crossing past oswald 
               who is in a booth

                                     carolyn arnold vo
                         he was sitting in one of the booths 
                         on the right hand side of the room  
                         he was alone as usual and appeared 
                         to be having lunch  i did not speak 
                         to him but i recognized clearly  i 
                         remember it was 1215 or later  it 
                         coulda been 1225 five minutes before 
                         the assassination i dont exactly 
                         remember  i was pregnant and i had 
                         a craving for a glass of water

               on the sixth floor of the depository bonnie ray williams is 
               eating a chicken lunch alone

                         at the same time bonnie ray williams 
                         is supposedly eating his chicken 
                         lunch on the sixth floor at least 
                         until 1215 maybe 1220  he sees 
                         nobody

               on the street arnold rowland and his wife look up at the 
               sixth floor windows and we see from their point of view 
               two shadowy figures

                                     jim vo
                         down on the street arnold rowland 
                         was seeing two men in the sixth floor 
                         windows presumably after bonnie 
                         ray williams finished his lunch and 
                         left

               we see footage of jfk coming up houston  waving

               oswald walks into the second floor lunchroom as policeman 
               marrion baker runs in gun at his side  he is about 30 feet 
               from oswald  roy truly the superintendent runs in a moment 
               later

                         kennedy was running five minutes 
                         late for his appointment with death  
                         he was due at 1225  if oswald was 
                         the assassin he was certainly pretty 
                         nonchalant about getting himself 
                         into position  later he told dallas 
                         police he was standing in the second 
                         floor snackroom  probably told to 
                         wait there for a phone call by his 
                         handler  the phones were in the 
                         adjacent and empty second floor 
                         offices but the call never came  a 
                         maximum 90 seconds after kennedy is 
                         shot patrolman marrion baker runs 
                         into oswald in that second story 
                         lunchroom

                                     baker
                         hey you
                              to truly
                         do you know this man  is he an 
                         employee

                                     truly
                         yes he is
                              as baker moves on
                         the presidents been shot

               oswald reacts as if hearing it for the first time  truly 
               and baker continue running up the stairs  oswald proceeds 
               to get a coke and continues out of the room

               cut to the sixth floor where we see oswald as the shooter  
               after firing he runs full speed for the stairs stashing 
               the rifle on the other side of the loft  our camera follows 
               him roughly down stairs  we hear the loud sound of his shoes 
               banging on the hollow wood  to the lunchroom where patrolman 
               baker and superintendent truly run in  then they start to 
               repeat the same action as seen in the previous scene

                         but what the warren report would 
                         have us believe is that after firing 
                         3 bolt action shots in 56 seconds 
                         oswald then leaves three cartridges 
                         neatly side by side in the firing 
                         nest wipes the rifle clear of 
                         fingerprints stashes the rifle on 
                         the other side of the loft sprints 
                         down five flights of stairs past 
                         witnesses victoria adams and sandra 
                         styles who never see him and then 
                         shows up cool and calm on the second 
                         floor in front of patrolman baker 
                         all this within a maximum 90 seconds 
                         of the shooting  is he out of breath  
                         according to baker absolutely not

               cut to the second floor  oswald ambles past mrs reid a 
               secretary in the second floor office on his way out coke 
               bottle in hand and wearing his usual dreamy look theres 
               a lingering close  up on his face

                                     jim vo
                         assuming he is the sole assassin 
                         oswald is now free to escape from 
                         the building  the longer he delays 
                         the more chance the building will be 
                         sealed by the police  is he guilty  
                         does he walk out the nearest 
                         staircase  no he buys a coke and 
                         at a slow pace spotted by mrs reid 
                         in the second floor office he strolls 
                         out the more distant front exit 
                         where the cops start to gather

               outside we see oswald stroll out the door of the book 
               depository into the crowd  he heads for the bus stop to the 
               east

                                     jim vo
                         oddly considering three shots are 
                         supposed to have come from there 
                         nobody seals the depository for ten 
                         more minutes  oswald slips out as 
                         do several other employees  of 
                         course when he realized something 
                         had gone wrong and the president 
                         really had been shot he knew there 
                         was a problem  he may even have 
                         known he was the patsy  an intuition 
                         maybe  the president killed in spite 
                         of his warning  the phone call that 
                         never came  perhaps fear now came 
                         to lee oswald  he wasnt going to 
                         stand around for roll call

                         the story gets pretty confusing now  
                         more twists in it than a watersnake  
                         richard carr says he saw four men 
                         take off from the book depository in 
                         a rambler that possibly belongs to 
                         janet williams  deputy roger craig 
                         says two men picked up oswald in the 
                         same rambler a few minutes later  
                         other people say oswald took a bus 
                         out of there and then because he 
                         was stuck in traffic he hopped a 
                         cab to his rooming house in oak 
                         cliff

               flashback to oswalds boarding house  oswald enters his 
               room passing earlene roberts the heavyset white housekeeper

                                     jim vo
                         we must assume he wanted to get 
                         back in touch with his intell team 
                         probably at a safehouse or at the 
                         texas theatre but how could he be 
                         sure  he didnt know who to trust 
                         anymore

                                     roberts
                              watching tv
                         my god did you see that mr lee  
                         a man shot the president

               the camera closes in on oswalds perplexed face  earlene 
               peeks out the shades as she hears two short honks on a horn

               outside is a black police car driven by tippit  also in the 
               car is the fence shooter dressed as a dallas policeman  
               the car drives by honks twice waits then moves away  
               during this visual we see the fence shooter changing his 
               uniform into civilian clothes

                         oswald returns to this rooming house 
                         around 1 pm half hour after the 
                         assassination puts on his jacket 
                         grabs his 38 revolver leaves at 
                         104 earlene roberts the 
                         housekeeper says she heard two beeps 
                         on a car horn and two uniformed cops 
                         pulled up to the house while oswald 
                         was in his room like it was a signal 
                         or something officer tippit is 
                         shot between 110 and 115 about a 
                         mile away  though no one actually 
                         saw him walking or jogging the 
                         government says oswald covered that 
                         distance  incidentally that walk 
                         if he did it is in a straight line 
                         toward jack rubys house  giving 
                         the government the benefit of the 
                         doubt oswald would have had to jog 
                         a mile in six to eleven minutes and 
                         commit the murder then reverse 
                         direction and walk 35 of a mile to 
                         the texas theatre and arrive sometime 
                         before 130  thats some walking

               on a street oswald walks alone fast  a police car pulls 
               up alongside him on 10th street  oswald leans on the 
               passenger side of the window  officer tippit suspicious 
               gets out to question him  oswald pulls his 38 revolver and 
               shoots him down in the street with 5 shots

                         its also a useful conclusion  after 
                         all why else would oswald kill 
                         officer tippit unless he just shot 
                         the president and feared arrest  
                         not one credible witness could 
                         identify oswald as tippits killer

               domingo benavides hidden in his truck only a few yards away 
               watches as another unidentified man not seen before shoots 
               and walks away

                         domingo benavides the closest witness 
                         to the shooting refused to identify 
                         oswald as the killer and was never 
                         taken to a lineup

               we see acquilla clemons a black woman looking on  she 
               watches as two men kill tippit  one of them resembles the 
               fence shooter  the other one is a mystery figure seen before 
               in the fringes  the men walk off quickly in opposite 
               directions  we notice a policemans uniform hanging in the 
               back seat of tippits car

                         acquilla clemons saw the killer with 
                         another man and says they went off 
                         in separate directions  mrs clemons 
                         was never taken to lineup or to the

                         who saw the killer run away stated 
                         flatly that the killer was not lee

                         75cent ticket  brewer has the 
                         cashier call the police

               outside the texas theatre oswald walks past the cashier who 
               is out on the sidewalk watching the police cars go by  a 
               double feature is playing  cry of battle with van heflin

                         in response to the cashiers call 
                         at least thirty officers in a fleet 
                         of patrol cars descend on the movie 
                         theatre  this has to be the most 
                         remarkable example of police intuition 
                         since the reichstag fire  i dont 
                         buy it  they knew  someone knew  
                         oswald was going to be there  in 
                         fact as early as 1244 only 14 
                         minutes after the assassination the 
                         police radio put out a description 
                         matching oswalds size and build  
                         brewer says the man was wearing a 
                         jacket but the police say the man 
                         who shot tippit left his jacket 
                         behind  butch burroughs theatre 
                         manager says oswald bought some 
                         popcorn from him at the time of the 
                         tippit slaying  burroughs and witness 
                         bernard haire also said there was an 
                         oswald look  alike taken from the 
                         theatre  perhaps it was he who 
                         sneaked into the theatre just after 
                         130

               inside the theatre cry of battle is on the screen  twelve 
               to fourteen spectators sit scattered between the balcony and 
               ground floor  brewer leads the officers onto the stage and 
               the lights come on  he points to oswald

                                     jim vo
                         in any case brewer helpfully leads 
                         the cops into the theatre and from 
                         the stage points oswald out

               the cops advance on oswald who jumps up as if expecting to 
               be shot

                                     oswald
                         this is it

                         kill the president will you

               scared oswald takes a swing at a policeman  he pulls out 
               his gun  the officers close in on him from the rear and 
               front  a wrestling and shoving match ensues  one officer 
               gets a chokehold on oswald and another one hits him

                                     jim vo
                         the cops have their man  it was 
                         already been decided  in washington

               outside the theatre oswald his eye blackened is led out 
               by the phalanx of officers  they are surrounded by an angry 
               crowd

                                     crowd
                         kill him  kill him

               we see oswald dying on the floor of the police station  a 
               paramedic pushes in and starts administering artificial 
               respiration which only aggravates the internal hemorrhaging

                         this conspiracy  why have they been

                         our leaders  who determines our 
                         national security  what national 
                         security permits the removal of 
                         fundamental power from the hands of 
                         the american people and validates 
                         the ascendancy of invisible government 
                         in the united states  that kind of

                         there is a very simple way to 
                         determine if i am being paranoid

                         lets ask the two men who have 
                         profited the most from the 
                         assassination  your former president

                         property  you pay for it but because 
                         the government considers you children 
                         who might be too disturbed to face 
                         this reality because you might lynch 
                         those involved you cannot see these 
                         documents for another 75 years  im

                         off this mortal coil by then but 
                         im already telling my 8 year  old 
                         son to keep himself physically fit 
                         so that one glorious september morning 
                         in 2038 he can walk into the national 
                         archives and find out what the cia 
                         and the fbi knew  they may even 
                         push it back then  it may become a 
                         generational affair with questions 
                         passed down from father to son mother 
                         to daughter in the manner of the 
                         ancient runic bards  someday 
                         somewhere someone might find out 
                         the damned truth  or we might just 
                         build ourselves a new government 
                         like the declaration of independence 
                         says we should do when the old one 
                         aint working  maybe a little farther 
                         out west

                                     jim
                         an american naturalist wrote a 
                         patriot must always be ready to defend 
                         his country against its government  
                         well id hate to be in your shoes 
                         today  you have a lot to think about  
                         going back to when we were children 
                         i think most of us in this courtroom 
                         thought that justice came into being 
                         automatically that virtue was its 
                         own reward that good would triumph 
                         over evil  but as we get older we 
                         know that this just isnt true  
                         the frontier is where a man faces a 
                         fact  individual human beings have 
                         to create justice and this is not 
                         easy because truth often presents a 
                         threat to power and we have to fight 
                         power often at great risk to 
                         ourselves  people like julia ann 
                         mercer sm holland lee bowers 
                         jean hill and willie okeefe have 
                         come forward and taken that risk
                              he produces a stack 
                              of letters
                         i have here some 8000 in these 
                         letters sent to my office from all 
                         over the country  quarters dimes 
                         dollar bills from housewives 
                         plumbers car salesmen teachers 
                         invalids  these are the people 
                         who cannot afford to send money but 
                         do these are the ones who drive the 
                         cabs who nurse in the hospitals 
                         who see their kids go to vietnam  
                         why  because they care because 
                         they want to know the truth  because 
                         they want their country back because 
                         it belongs to us the people as long 
                         as the people got the guts to fight 
                         for what they believe in  the truth 
                         is the most important value we have 
                         because if the truth does not endure 
                         if the government murders truth if 
                         you cannot respect the hearts of 
                         these people
                              shaking the letters
                         then this is no longer the country 
                         in which we were born in and this is 
                         not the country i want to die in  
                         and this was never more true than 
                         for john f kennedy whose murder was 
                         probably the most terrible moment in 
                         the history of our country  you the 
                         people you the jury system in 
                         sitting in judgement on clay shaw 
                         represent the hope of humanity against 
                         government power  in discharging 
                         your duty in bringing the first 
                         conviction in this house of cards 
                         against clay shaw ask not what 
                         your country can do for you but 
                         what you can do for your country  
                         do not forget your young president 
                         who forfeited his life  show the 
                         world this is still a government of 
                         the people for the people and by 
                         the people  nothing as long as you 
                         live will ever be more important
                              he stares into the 
                              camera
                         its up to you

               he returns to the table and sits  the courtroom is still

               cut to later in the same courtroom  the jury files in 
               having reached a verdict  jim prepared sits with his staff 
               and liz  the jury foreman enters the courtroom

                                     jury foreman
                         we find clay shaw not guilty on 
                         all counts

               theres jubilation and commotion in the court  shaw stands 
               happily shaking hands all over members of the press run 
               for the phones  in the corridor outside the courtroom the 
               press interviews the jury foreman

                                     foreman
                         we believe there was a conspiracy 
                         but whether clay shaw was a part of 
                         it is another kettle of fish

               the camera moves to jim who walks out past the banks of 
               reporters  tv lights are in his face  liz is by his side

                         of the warren commission do you

                                     jim
                         i think all it proves is you cannot 
                         run a trial even questioning the 
                         intelligence operations of the 
                         government in the light of day

                         picayune will call for your 
                         resignation  unfit to hold office  
                         youve ruined clay shaws reputation  
                         are you going to resign

                         continue this investigation for 30 
                         years  i owe that not only to jack 
                         kennedy but to my country

               he and liz squeeze hands as they walk on

               dissolve to washington dc  1970

               jim waits on the same park bench as earlier in the film 
               overlooking the mall or the lincoln monument as x walks 
               up a little grayer a little more stooped wearing ill 
               fitting civilian clothes

                         as 61 they knew kennedy was going 
                         to change things he was not going 
                         to war in southeast asia  who knows
