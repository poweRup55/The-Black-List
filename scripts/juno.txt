                         think we should leave it in there

                         my sister i remember she got about a 
                         million presents they were all lame 
                         though so i wasnt jealous

                         not you know set in stone

               courage for an unusual request

                         like a legend they call me the 
                         cautionary whale

               she grabs vanessas hand and plants it on her stomach

                                     vanessa
                         i cant feel anything

                         its not moving for me

               she says this as though its an admission of failure

                                     juno

                         there even though it sounds all ten 
                         thousands leagues under the sea

               vanessa kneels down next to the swell of junos belly

                                     vanessa

                         can you hear me sweet angel

               vanessa looks like shes giving up hope then suddenly

                                     vanessa

                         is making fun of me behind my back 
                         despite the fact that your little

                         or go to brens dumb unitarian church 
                         or get hit by a tenton truck full 
                         of hot garbage juice all those things 
                         would be exponentially cooler than 
                         going to the prom with you

               mark puts his hands on what remains of junos waist she 
               drapes her arms around his neck selfconsciously

               juno rests her head on marks chest they dance in silence 
               for a few moments then stop moving mark pulls juno as close 
               as he possibly can given her expanding girth

               juno turns to leave then shoots one furious look back at 
               mark

                                     juno

               int loring house  living room  day

               juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the 
               front door only to be intercepted by vanessa whos returning 
               home from work carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased 
               nursing pillow they nearly collide

                                     vanessa

               its obvious from junos tears and flushed face that shes 
               lying vanessa instantly goes pale with fear but she tries 
               her hardest to seem serene and together in front of juno

                                     vanessa

                         ticking clock

               a long hideous beat

                                     vanessa

                                     mark

                         mother

               vanessa looks defeated

                                     mark
                         i never said id be a great father

               we hear the front door closing vanessa and mark look over 
               and notice that juno has escaped the conflict

               ext loring house  afternoon

               juno runs up to her car sobbing she struggles with the keys 
               but finally makes it into the previa and drives off

               ext highway  afternoon

               the previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the 
               shoulder

               int previa  afternoon

               juno buckles over the steering wheel crying unwinding for 
               the first time since she became pregnant

               after a beat she begins to gather herself

               int bleekers bedroom  night

               bleeker is sitting next to his bed noodling on the guitar 
               hes playing a theme that we will soon recognise

               ext corner store  night

               juno lays on the hood of her previa contemplating her future 
               we push in close when she gets an idea

               she hops off the hood and scurries into the previa where she 
               finds a crumpled up jiffy lube receipt she unfolds it and 
               pulls out a pen ready to write something a note

               ext loring house  night

               its quiet after the storm inside we see vanessa sitting 
               alone at her perfect dining room table drinking a glass of 
               wine

               int loring house  dining room  night

               vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events 
               sink in after a beat mark comes down the stairs to join 
               her

                                     mark

                         it collaborative divorce its 
                         apparently all the rage right now 
                         and its easy because we dont have 
                         children

                                     vanessa
                         no its fine thanks for making the 
                         call i guess

               mark nods and sits down

                                     vanessa
                         were actually finally doing this

                         arent you the cool guy

               they stare at the wall speechless and defeated

                                     vanessa
                         i wanted a baby so bad so bad

               ext loring house  entry  night

               mark opens the door theres a folded piece of paper sitting 
               on the doormat he squints and sees juno pulling away in the 
               van

               mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper  it takes a minute 
               because of junos proficiency in teen girl origami he 
               holds it up we can see theres writing on the back

                                     mark
                         it looks like a bill from jiffylube

               vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over 
               examining it

                                     vanessa
                         its for me

               been left on for her and the place looks cozy and inviting

                         different for a while

               she picks a crocus from the unkempt garden near the porch 
               and sniffs it she lifts her shirt and tickles her belly 
               with it then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair

                         you for exactly what you are good

                         of person thats worth sticking with

               we push in over bleeker sleeping in his carbed towards the 
               window we look out onto the lawn to find juno and leah 
               running back to the previa hopping in and screeching off

               ext bleeker house  morning

               bleeker steps out of the house for his usual earlymorning

               stoop bleeker  check the mail

               he walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch 
               on the mailbox

               at least one hundred containers of orange tic tacs come 
               pouring out in an colorful deluge they spill out onto the 
               driveway bleeker smiles

               juno waddles toward the field the guys on the track team 
               ridiculously arrayed as usual are doing hurdler stretches 
               they stare at her quizzically bleeker spots juno approaching 
               and jogs up to the chainlink fence

                         him

               on the dancing elk track theres a very sparse crowd in the

                         tell him that i was having the baby 
                         he had a big meet against manteno

               stopping to explain his mother stands up confused

               int hospital  maternity ward  day

               a nurse reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and 
               gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby

               the nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator

                                     nurse
                         would you like to meet your son

               pull back to reveal shes speaking to vanessa who stands 
               paralyzed several feet away

                                     vanessa
                         i have a son

                         healthy kid too didnt waste any 
                         time getting out

               vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in 
               her eyes she spends a few moments just looking at him

               she feels someone watching her then looks up to see a bren 
               leaning against the doorway

               vanessa blinks away her tears selfconsciously

                                     vanessa
                         how do i look

                              gently
                         like a mom scared shitless

               vanessa laughs

               int hospital  birthing suite  day

               juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room the birth 
               is obviously over theres that air of stillness and 
               accomplishment a task completed the doctors have cleared 
               out mac sits in a chair next to the bed looking like hes 
               not sure what to say

               he holds up a deck of playing cards as if to initiate a game 
               but juno gently pushes his hand away their eyes meet his 
               expression is helpless hers is utterly drained

                                     mac
                         someday youll be back here honey 
                         on your terms

               juno nods and swallows

               over macs shoulder a silhouette appears in the doorway 
               its bleeker in his track uniform

               juno sees him and bursts into sudden ragged sobs mac glances 
               at her alarmed paulie moves toward the bed mac clears his 
               throat gets up and leaves the room

               paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his 
               arm around juno she leans into him letting herself go for 
               the first time in months

               int hospital room  birthing suite  evening

               juno lies on the bed she looks rested and relaxed compared 
               to her earlier crying jag but her face is still pink and 
               swollen bleeker is curled up next to her still in his track 
               uniform and spikes

                                     juno vo
                         bleeker decided he didnt want to 
                         see the baby neither did i really 
                         he didnt feel like ours

               int hospital  maternity ward  evening

               we see vanessa leaning over the bassinet unable to take her 
               eyes off the baby touching its hair reverently

                                     juno vo
                         i think he was always hers

               int loring house  nursery  day

               the nursery is perfectly decorated in vanessas immaculate 
               taste nothing looks as though its been touched we see the 
               antique rocking chair sitting empty

                                     juno vo
                         it ended with a chair

               we pan past the wall vanessa had said needed something 
               theres a framed note on the wall it looks like it was 
               handwritten on the back of a jiffy lube bill we see that it 
               says vanessa  if youre still in im still in juno

               we move to the door and get a view of vanessas bedroom we 
               see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her 
               shoulder feeding the baby for the first time ever vanessa 
               looks disorganized unshowered  and incredibly happy there 
               are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed 
               close to the bed obviously she hasnt been away from the 
               baby for a single moment

               the baby reaches up and grabs vanessas thumb vanessa glows 
               with an expression of pure bliss

               ext macguff house  day

               its a sparkling summer afternoon juno wheels her bicycle 
               out of the detached garage she waves goodbye to bren who 
               is playing in the yard with two weimaraners she looks almost 
               as happy with her dogs as vanessa looked with her baby

               ext suburban streets  day

               juno rides her bike aggressively down the street her guitar 
               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag shes obviously not 
               pregnant anymore she looks happy but older

                                     juno vo

                         to fall in love before they reproduce 
                         but normalcys not really our style

               as she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes she 
               passes the dancing elk track team still running in 
               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas

               juno rides up to a garage where bleeker is sitting tuning 
               his guitar

               ext bleeker house  day

               juno bikes up to find bleeker sitting on the stoop she smiles 
               and takes out her guitar she sits across from bleeker and 
               pulls the pick out of the strings

                                     juno
                         ready

               bleeker nods

               juno begins strumming her guitar and playing anyone else 
               but you by the moldy peaches bleeker joins in at first 
               their playing is discordant but suddenly it works
