extreme closeup of glowing honeycolored stones  their shapes abstract
as the camera examines air bubbles and crystalline patterns

moving up and over this amber abstraction the camera finds unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone  flecks of dirt
hairs cracks  still moving  starbursts of light ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones

camera turns along a creamy stretch of amber  it turns in deeper
abstracting the picture further only to find a tiny blur that suddenly
racks into focus  a bug a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb  it is
folded on its back

slow motion as the tip of a finepointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug  orange flecks fly  the mosquito trembles  the
drill continues stopping just before it touches the tiny body

a shiny pair of thin needlenose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains  these are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide  a conveyor belt starts and the slide moves along
arriving under a longlensed microscope

in microscopic perspective a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue

pincers snare the fragment dropping it into a narrow tube  the tube
spins faster and faster until it is a blur on the screen

the screen floods with an infrared light  gray oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist

										   wash out to

hot sun overhead in a big sky 

ext  badlands  afternoon

lodged in the cracked earth are the partiallyexposed fossilized remains
of a velocirapter a carnivorous dinosaur  widen out to a sweeping
panorama of a dinosaur dig a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone making measurements taking photographs
scribbling notes and conferring with each other

the center of all this activity is one man  in a ropedoff area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor is dr alan grant head
paleontologist  goodlooking late 30s with a think beard

grant lies on his belly completely absorbed in a small piece of bone
a group of twelve students notebooks in hand await his next sentence

close on  the tiny bone  grants nose touches it

grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush  then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it  he licks it  excited by his discovery he gets to his
feet and addresses his students who listen raptly

					   grant
		right calcaneus of an adult female
		raptor  mild stress fractures  whats
		this tell me

students look at each other  a tentative hand  grant continues

					   grant
		it tells me that this bone connects to
		the navicula which we already found
		articulating to the cuboid

offscreen a woman shouts to him

					   ellie off
		dr grant  dr grant

grant looks up

dr ellie sattler late 20s sharpeyed tough if she wants to be runs
like a gazelle across the arid land  exuberant she leaves a trail of
dust behind her

she zips by a student guarding the cordoned area  he tries to stop her

					   student
		dr sattler  dr grant is thinking

dr grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues

					   grant
		so what can we stay for sure  stress
		fractures in the heel 

uncertain students  ellie arrives and immediately gets into it

					   ellie
		she jumps

grant turns around to her and smiles  shes got it  other students to
 they knew is all along

					   grant
		right as rain ellie  now why did she
		jump

no answer  ellie gives it a try

					   ellie
		a defensive posture against a vicious
		bloodthirsty trex

					   grant
		    nodding
		perhaps  or maybe to select the smaller
		more tender leaves in the higher branches
		with which to suckle her young

ellie jumps up

					   ellie
		i bet is was a mating ritual

students laugh  one student eyes grants selfconscious smile at ellie

					   grant
		the science of paleontology cant answer
		these questions  novelists and artists
		who dream a vision of the jurassic period
		can attempt these questions with their
		imaginations  what we scientists can say
		is considering the mass and kinetic
		articulation of these bones this animal
		had a vertical leap of about twelve feet
		not as entertaining as fiction but
		absolutely fact without prejudice

ellie intrudes again

					   ellie
		excuse me dr grant  but  fact is
		were late  theres the car

she points  on the horizon a limousine speeds toward them leaving a
dusty wake

grant sets the rules for his departure giving instructions individually
as ellie pulls him away carrying their bags

					   grant
		jim you keep making up the plaster
		batches  whatever ratio youre using
		its perfect  nora no digging after
		five  when the temperature drops those
		bones are just too brittle  bill i
		dont want any tourists walking over my
		raptor  i dont care if the governor of
		montana is with them just you guys

grant and ellie continue walking  she interrupts his continued barrage

					   ellie
		you know if every scientist stuck to his
		method like you there would be no body
		of theory  no quasars no big bang 

grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes

					   grant
		jesus a limousine  were reentering
		hammonds world thats for sure  beat
		remind me why were doing this ellie

ellie is gentle  shes telling him something theyve discussed before

					   ellie
		were leaving the raptor dig 

					   grant
		 at a critical time 

					   ellie
		 because gennaro is paying us sixty
		thousand dollars to observe some resort
		of hammonds in costa rica and thats 

					   grant
		 enough money to keep us free of
		commercial affiliations for two summers
		all right all right  good

then halfkidding with ellie

					   grant
		financial independence for fraternizing
		with the enemy  beat  ill do it

she laughs  but he cant quite leave  he grabs a computer printout

					   grant
		this is all could come up with skip

skip turns the printout rightside up in grants hand  grant smiles

					   grant
		wise guy  lets go ellie

grant and ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students
the limo pulls away

ext  high tech building  biogenetic corporation hq  sunset

a purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building

int  biogen hq

a peanut flies in the air  then falls into a big open mouth  thomp

					   mouth
		five hundred thousand is peanuts

he tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth  this is dennis
nedry a 40 year old computer programmer  hes fat with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit  his slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclines

across a gleaming granite coffee table is bill baker businessman  a
smooth meticulous dresser baker is disgusted by nedrys sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink

nedry finishes a coke  over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view

					   nedry
		im not reneging  im reevaluating

nedry holds the can of coke upsidedown drains the last drops

					   nedry
		you think im a scumbag i know

nedry chuckles lines up three peanuts on the table  one after the
other he throws them in the air  he gulps down two misses one it
skids across the glossy floor

bakers head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at nedry

					   nedry
		look pal you make a career in biogenetic
		industrial espionage and youre bound to
		run across a scumbag or two  guaranteed
		part of the job description  look whos
		to say who is the real scumbag  after
		all i know what you guys need so bad
		ive heard of reverse engineering

as nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and chomps and speaks

					   nedry
		let the other guy put in all the work
		all the r and d  you take the finished
		product work backwards breaking it down
		to reveal its genetic code  presto  in
		a few measly months you have knowhow
		that took researchers ten years to
		determine  you know how much hammond has
		invested of his own personal wealth
		over five billion dollars  and if you
		guys get the jump on his  in no time
		the markets wideopen

nedry starts the laugh as he eats and talks

					   nedry
		but boy hes really got his product
		oh yes siree massive gargantuan money
		making neverheardofprofitlikethat
		product  it is a sight  yes indeedy

nedry laughs explosively  he begins to choke coughing and gasping

baker is repulsed  he stares out the window as the sun sets

nedry in true distress clutches his own throat  he clumsily runs
toward baker toppling chairs as he goes  nedry grabs bakers hand and
squeezes it tightly imploring baker for help  baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves nedry to the floor  baker looks down at the prone
and desperate nedry

					   baker
		scumbag  we have a deal  that deal is
		not open to renegotiation  or even re
		evaluation

bakers kneels down next to nedry who is beginning to turn blue

					   baker
		the deal stands  take it or leave it

baker glances at his watch

					   baker
		ill give you a few minutes to decide

nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head  baker nods back
and slams his fist into nedrys solar plexus  it works

nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air  he sits up rubbing his belly  as
baker leaves the room

					   baker
		make sure the eggs are on that supply
		ship  just make sure

camera leaves nedry and exits the window    it swishpans the concrete
canyons of wall street and enters another office

int  conservative law office  day

donald gennaro handsome  meticulously dressed paces the highly
polished glassy corner suite  his boss ross is seated  hes a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm

					   ross
		we cant trust hammond anymore  hes
		under too much pressure  theres the
		epa hes behind schedule and the in
		vestors are getting nervous  there have
		been too many rumors too many accidents
		we cant screw around with this

					   gennaro
		ive asked hammond to arrange independent
		site inspections every week for the next
		three weeks

					   ross
		what does he say

					   gennaro
		insists nothings wrong on the island

					   ross
		you know him  do you believe him

					    gennaro
		no i dont  i spent a lot of time with
		him five years ago when we raised the
		capital  and it was a wild ride  hes
		unpredictable a dreamer

					   ross
		potentially dangerous  we should never
		have gotten involved  whats our position

					   gennaro
		the firm owns five percent

					   ross
		general or limited

					   gennaro
		general

					   ross
		we should have never done that

					   gennaro
		it seemed wise at the time  we all
		wanted the park to happen  it was in
		lieu of fees

					   ross
		in any case i agree an inspection is
		overdue  who are your site experts

gennaro tosses a list on ross desk  he check it out

					   ross
		will they tell the truth

					   gennaro
		i think so  that guy grants a hotshot
		in his field always goes his own way 

					   ross
		 good  youre making all the arrangements

					   gennaro
		hammond asked to place the calls himself
		i think he wants to pretend the park is
		not in trouble  that its just a social
		invitation showing off the island

					   ross
		all right  good  but lets be very
		clear about one thing  i dont know how
		bad this situation actually is donald
		but if theres a problem on that island 
		dont be afraid to screw hammond and burn
		jurassic park to the ground

gennaro shakes hands awkwardly with ross and leaves  ross paces  fed
up he whispers to himself

					   ross
		costa rica my ass

he whacks his desk globe sends its spinning

camera moves in on spinning globe as we hear the rotor blades of a
helicopter and dissolve to

intext  helicopter in sky  dawn

on the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads isla nublar

inside grant ellie and gennaro are in the right back row  ellie
dozes her head occasionally dropping onto grants shoulder to his
discomfort  gennaro looks at papers trying not to look through the
clear plexibubble at their feet  next to the pilot nedry chews a
candy bar  he offers candy to the back row

grant loses himself looking out the window

grants pov  the aquamarine blue of the ocean  below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life  dolphins leap in the air
suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds

there is turbulence  ellie wakes glances at grant then out the
window  there is mist and she absently traces her finger in it shaping
a dinosaur figure  now land comes into view and for a moment the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling

					   pilot
		thats isla nublar  buckle up the
		descent is a little hairy

gennaro cinches his belt tightly and halfshuts his eyes  nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt  ellie looks every way

					   ellie
		this is exciting

					   grant
		what is ellie  where are we going

grant looks out his window the helicopter rushes forward low to the
water  ahead grant sees the island rugged and craggy rising sharply

					   grant
		looks like alcatraz

the pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand

					   pilot
		theres bad wind shear on this peak

grant nods  gennaro sweats watching the pilot tighten his own belt

ellie smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down  now a blanket
fog  grant cant see a thing out his window  ellies startled

					   ellie
		how the hell is he landing this thing

no answer  grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist  some are very close  ellies hands grasps her seat cushion

					   ellie
		this is not fun

grant looks through the plexibubble at his feet  he sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below  lights flash at corners of the cross

					   grant
		relax ellie  im sure they wouldnt
		land if it werent safe

the copter suddenly shakes violently  ellie grabs grants hand
gennaro sits straight up eyes squeezed shut

					   grant
		gennaro  this guy knows what hes doing
		right  hey gennaro  im talking to you

another violent shake  grant squeezes ellies hand back

closeup  nedrys hand crushes a packet of crackers

gennaro is soaked  he opens one eye and looks about very frightened
he speaks a mantra

					   gennaro
		no problem  relax relax

the pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly  the copter sails
sharply the other way

					   grant and ellie
		whoa

close on  the pilot jerks back the stick

the copter zooms upward  grants beverage flips to the ground pours
across the floor

nedrys lunch does flying  sandwich candy and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air  now it all freefalls onto nedrys lap

grant and ellie lean tightly into each other

					   ellie
		i dont like this feeling 

the pilot swings his gaze left then right looking at the pine forest
trees are close then far then close  the helicopter drops rapidly
ellie and grant shut their eyes  they brace themselves for the worst

in and out of the mist the copter descends  tail raised high nose
low for a moment it looks like a strange bugeyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen  in a flash it corrects itself  the copter touches
down on a helipad  the sound of the rotors fades and dies

for a second no one moves  grant lets out a great sigh of relief
gennaro mouths a silent prayer  the pilot stretches his fingers

grant and ellie selfconsciously shake their hands free of each other
nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap  he turns

					   nedry
		just think gennaro 
		    laughs harder
		 you gotta agree its funny  these two
		they dig up dinosaurs  its wonderful
		isnt it

nedry pats grant on his shoulder

					   nedry
		dr bones youre going to love this place

nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door

a smile comes across gennaros face  as he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesnt mean any harm  grant and ellie stare at him

					   pilot
		come on folks  gotta get back theres a
		storm alert

rotors turn  outside a man reaches the copter  he wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and hes dressed in phony safari garb  he
shakes gennaros hand  this is ed regis 35 head of public relations
he throws open the copter door next to grant  big cheerful smile

					   regis
		hi  ed regis  real big welcome to isla
		nublar dr grant dr sattler  little
		tough landing here i know  but you did
		it  come on down were so happy to have
		you  now watch your step

ellie and grant jump into the world of jurassic park

ext  lush tropical forest  morning

grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain  this place is the
opposite of the badlands  there is elaborate planting everywhere
huge hairy ferns exotic spiked flowers berries of every color
rushing vines  peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
and flying squirrels  the strange prehistoric world impresses grant
and ellie  even nedry and gennaro take in the vegetal wonder

then the sound of men working grunting from exertion  ahead muldoon
directs a group of workmen  flamethrowers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage  as they attack a new area regis waves muldoon
over  muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them

					   ed regis
		this is robert muldoon great african big
		game hunter  and hes working for us now
		doing a bangup job too

muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with grant and ellie

					   muldoon
		eds a little more bs than pr  mr
		gennaro nice to have you back

gennaro nods warmly as muldoon limps back to work

regis leads on taking gennaros arm and talking to him like and old
friend  nedry lumbers in the middle alone  at the rear grant and
ellie study everything they see  grant calls to regis but is ignored

					   grant
		mr regis what is the nature of this park

ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on  she nudges grant who has seen the same

					   ellie
		aggressive growth huh

					   grant
		hammonds trademark

a distinct hooting in the distance  then a loud trumpeting  grant and
ellie stop  nedry doesnt look up  regis flashes his salesmans smile

					   regis
		out animals are greeting you

they pass a crude sign nailed to a tree  welcome to jurassic park
grant cringes at the sign  ellie nudges him to loosen up

					   grant
		i hope this isnt one of those animatronic
		exhibits in a jurassic botanical setting

					   nedry
		nope

gennaro wipes his brow  they enter a green tunnel of overarching palm
that leads to the visitors center a modern complex in the distance

ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush  she nudges grant

their pov  camera slowly climbs a fifteen foot high chainlink fence
the needlespiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush

this fence is only the prelude

sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence
woven throughout the fences mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire  there is a prominent warning  danger  electric fence ten
thousand volts  keep off

camera keeps climbing to the top  ominous barbed wire curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun

grant strains to understand  the quickens his steps to catch the others

they reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting  a crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk  an empty swimming pool is being filled by a man with a pumper
truck  next to him workers water the large ferns

					   regis
		i hope you brought your bathing suits
		doesnt this mist and these plants really
		create a bonafide prehistoric feeling

regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof

					   regis
		theres the visitors center

a crane lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid  an animal trumpets

int  visitors center  day

close on  the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight
above masked workers weld it on  sparks fly

grant stares up at it thinking  footsteps echo behind him as regis
ellie gennaro and nedry look around the unfinished building

the visitors center is two stories high a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports  its incomplete  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor  even so
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion  behind several
spanish workers unpack masonry supplies

					   grant
		wheres hammond

					   regis
		mr hammond is dying to see you guys

grant strides over to an exhibit as gennaro paces impatiently

					   gennaro
		hot hot hot  ten billion bucks and the
		air conditioning sucks

regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls  giant leaves and vines burst inside

grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled when dinosaurs rules the
world  this is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day  many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs  man receives the last second of the day  ellie joins grant

					   ellie
		the audicity of man to get here at the
		last second and think he runs the show

grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm  he looks at a painted
mural of a raptor on one of the walls in the halfcompleted gift shop

nedry is at a coke machine feeding in change  it doesnt work  he
slams his hand against it and finally a cup drops down the chute
upsidedown  it pours  coke splashes nedry  he curses and exits

the rotunda  ellie pulls grant over to a raised round display with a
catwalk  in this unfinished display a skeletal trex and a raptor are
locked in combat  scaffolding is up around it and painting supplies
are scattered all around

regis glances at his watch looks up and smiles

at that moment doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically
a soothing female voice comes out of the public address system

					   voice on pa
		please come to the theater  in a moment
		our film will begin

the voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages
regis waves everyone into the theater   nedry doesnt join them  he
climbs the stairs to the second floor

int  screening room  day

small and plush  regis sits in the front full of enthusiasm  grant and
ellie sit further behind  gennaro stands in the back and smokes

celestial music fills the room  mist covers and curls on the stage
floor  colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion
overall effect is the touristy wheres ny highgloss production

years young with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect  he wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket  like an elder carl sagan he addresses the group

					   hammond
		welcome ladies and gentlemen  welcome
		to an ancient and mysterious world a
		world long before humankind inhabited it
		with all out remarkable dreams and
		questions  enter a world that existed
		one hundred million years ago  when our
		changing earth was the abode of
		magnificent creations

		today the late twentieth century has
		witnessed a scientific gold rush of
		astonishing proportions  the headlong
		and furious haste to unravel the mystery
		of genetic engineering has become more
		than just a subject for science fiction
		writers

on grant  he whispers to ellie

					   grant
		 the furious haste to commercialize
		genetic engineering

back on hammond  he warms to his subject

					   hammond
		biotechnology promises the greatest
		revolution in human history  it will
		outdistance atomic power and computers in
		its effects on our everyday lives  well
		see square trees for easy lumbering and
		white trout for super visibility to
		fisherman  why it will transform every
		aspect of human life out medical care
		our food our health even our very
		entertainment

on grant  confirmed in his thinking he whispers again

					   grant
		here we go

back on hammond  he concludes

					   hammond
		nothing will ever be the same again
		its literally going to change the face
		of our planet as we know it

music soars  hammond smiles appreciatively removes his rose  a screen
descends behind him

					   hammond
		 jurassic park  what we do here is
		made possible through the miracle of dna
		replication commonly known as cloning
		to explain what cloning means im going
		to need my own clone  john hammond

another hammond appears projected on the screen beside the real one

					   2nd hammond
		hi john

					   hammond
		hi john

in the audience  ellie laughs aloud  grant shaking his head smiles

back on hammond  the original speaks to the clone

					   hammond
		okay john hold out your finger

					   2nd hammond
		why

					   hammond
		i need some of your genetic material

					   2nd hammond
		now just a minute here john

					   hammond
		your genetic material is the same in
		every cell of your body  you have a
		hundred billion cells  you wont miss a
		couple

hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clones finger with
a thorn

					   2nd hammond
		ow  that hurt  hey whats 

the clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as we see a magnified view
of the bloodstream  animation begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions  hammond provides voiceover for the visuals

					   hammond
		john lets look into your blood the
		river of life  theres your white cells
		exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
		wastes  and theres a mighty nucleus
		the heart and brain of a cell  this
		nucleus has an amazing property  it can
		split in half and reproduce itself
		thats how it grows  and then those two
		can do it again  and again  making copy
		after copy of itself

back to the two hammonds  joined by a third then a fourth and so on
until the screen is crammed with hammonds elbowing each other for room

					   new hammonds
		hi im john hammond  hey im john
		hammond  no i am  i am

					   hammond
		come on thats enough of this  and i
		thought to reproduce myself i had to do it
		the oldfashioned way

new mist fades out this show  the lights go up  regis applauds  grant
joins in the laughter with ellie and gennaro

hammond jumps down from the stage and greets gennaro and regis

					   hammond
		thats all weve got so far  a lot of
		fun isnt it mr gennaro

					   regis
		you bet

hammond greets grant and ellie warmly  then hammond baits grant

					   hammond
		its been a long time alan  i know the
		preceding was not your sort of enter
		tainment  popular science 

					   grant
		no i dont mind popular science  i dislike
		the commercialization of science  it breeds
		a sloppiness a disregard for method

					   hammond
		well i dont disregard method  but think
		of mutation  which is nothing more than
		sloppy communication on the cellular
		level  think how triumphant mutations
		have been in natural selection

		oh but i know what youre saying  its
		true that i have never been afraid to make
		money with science  ive always
		considered profit to be a measure of
		success a barometer of public reaction

					   grant
		mr hammond the essential truth of a
		scientific law has nothing to do with
		public reaction  water freezes at
		thirtytwo degrees whether you pay for
		it or not

hammond turns to gennaro  gennaro smiles nervously at their clash

					   hammond
		donald in bringing my old friend alan
		grant youve brought an excellent critic
		to observe the viability of my island and
		out venture  i look forward to winning
		you over dr grant

					   ellie
		just what is it youre trying to clone

ext  a sprawling lawn  day

outside hammond leads gennaro grant and ellie  he points out the
staff living quarters a group of graceful teepees  next to their
homes workers hang laundry and cook on grills

they pass a large mechanical building  the generator housed within is
very loud  the wind increases rippling clothes

suddenly the sound of a speeding jeep  grant turns

racing across the rolling green landscape is a red jeep  muldoon is at
the steering wheel  two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep
they are timmy 9 and lex 6 brother and sister  the jeep stops

					   lex
		grandpa

hammond looks up delighted  arms open  gennaro pulls him close

					   gennaro
		    incredulous
		mr hammond this is a serious investiga
		tion of the island not a weekend
		excursion or a social outing  were
		talking about the safety of this place

hammond waves to the children

					   hammond
		im aware of that  but i built this
		place for children  you cant
		investigate it without their reactions
		theyre what this place is all about

hammond beams to grant and ellie and indicates the running kids

					   hammond
		my grandchildren  genetics were kind
		theyre more like my exwife than me

lex jumps right into her grandpas arms  timmy shyly walks up and
embraces him  hammond shines  gennaro holds in his fury

int  hammonds quarters  day

hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite
ellie looks out a small window at the teepees and the contrasting
lifestyle below  she then focuses on the high fence circling the
perimeter of hammonds quarters  above is a skylight with metal bars

grant whispers to her indicating the obviously modified window frame

					   grant
		who makes a windows  smaller

timmy smacks him forehead points to grant

					   timmy
		i know you  you wrote my book  lost
		world of the dinosaurs  its awesome

					   lex
		timmys got dinosaurs on the brain

					   grant
		dont worry  hell grow out of it

					   ellie
		dr grants embarrassed that his book was
		so widely successful  he wrote if for
		graduate students

hammond smiles intensely  but hes patient  he stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape

					   hammond
		although dr grant suspects otherwise
		this is not an illconceived halfbaked
		poorly funded plan that ive headed
		this is a plan to which i committed all
		of my personal resources literally
		billions of dollars  and donald gennaro
		here has kindly helped me raise that sum
		again from wealthy japanese  they love
		theme parks  i have recruited pre
		eminent scientific minds from hallowed
		universities and weve taken the time to
		do things right

lex peeks under the cloth  hammond smiles at her and recovers the table

					   hammond
		jurassic park is the most advanced
		amusement park in the world  we work
		with genetics  lifes essential building
		blocks  to create new worlds  i set out
		to make biological attractions  living
		attractions  attractions so astonishing
		that theyd capture the imagination of
		the entire world

					   grant
		what exactly do you mean  biological
		attractions

					   hammond
		as you well know long ago creatures ten
		times larger than whales roamed our
		adolescent earth  and then mass
		mysterious extinction created a time
		barrier unscalable until  now

beat

					   grant
		yes

					   hammond
		dinosaurs
		    superbly proud
		ive been cloning dinosaurs

camera pushes in on grants incredulous face

hammond whips off the drape revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort

					   hammond
		ladies and gentlemen jurassic park  not
		a resort not a scientific conservatory
		just a little piece of prehistory that
		every child in the whole wide world will
		insist on visiting

hammond grins with delight

					   gennaro
		at least every rich child

grant and ellie come forward to examine the model  the kids crowd in

camera snorkels through the model  revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs moats fences roads a river

					   hammond
		apatosaurs in the lowland  gallimimus in
		the grassy plain  dilophosaurus above
		the river  the mighty tyrannosaurus rex
		238 fabulous creatures so far

					   timmy
		real dinosaurs grandpa  dont they want
		to just kill each other

hammond excitedly punches a button  colored display grids light up

					   hammond
		timmy theres electric fences and moats
		and video surveillance at all times
		there are monitors every hundred feet
		whatever we could plant them on the
		island  a computer to tabulate it all

					   ellie
		you created dinosaurs  who gave you the
		right to do that

					   hammond
		i didnt create them  i found a way to
		wake them up to stir them out of their
		prehistoric slumber

					   grant
		we dont have the science  theres no
		source of dinosaur dna

hammonds proud excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly

					   hammond
		yes  there is

int  hallway upper floor visitors center  day

hammond leads grant ellie gennaro timmy and lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor  a workman on crutches passes them

they go through a series of security doors  to get them open hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door  each time it lights up
with an xraylike image of his hand and each door hisses open

closeup  security xray of hammonds hand  beep  a red line writes
through the screen  cant get in  complaining under his breath

					   hammond
		glitches

hammond tries again

int  control room  day

the door hisses open revealing an elaborate technologycrammed room
in dim light clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow

nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him
typing away  john arnold 45 park supervisor sits directing the
activities of the park and chainsmoking  there are large windows
looking out to the park one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a team of workmen

hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage  hes the
ringmaster

					   hammond
		and this is the right side of my brain
		the entire park is safely controlled from
		here  john arnold that genius over
		there is the master control operator
		    with genuine concern
		john dont smoke so much youre far too
		valuable a man to me

					   arnold
		oh youd survive just fine without me

arnold exhales smoke and waves goodnaturedly  nedry stares darkly at
hammond who ignores him

					   hammond
		everythings controlled from here
		remote everything cars feeding
		programs medicine dispensers fecal
		clean up  and that can be tons in a park
		like this  we run this place with twenty
		workers  this computer does it all  and
		it polices each and every single animal
		out there

					   ellie
		    whispers to grant
		who polices the computer

hammond points up  overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair like a throne in a court  a large
video screen faces this chair

					   hammond
		thats where i will watch the astonished
		watchers  okay lets go

they practically race as a group to keep up with hammond  the security
door seals shit leaving nedry and arnold alone again

					   nedry
		thanks for the kind word mr hammond

					   arnold
		come on dennis he knows your technical
		contributions have made it all possible

					   nedry
		right

back on hallway 

hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked
caution teratogenic substances  timmy backs off grabs lexs arm

					   timmy
		that stuff turns you into a mutant

he contorts his face into strange shapes  as hammond leads them all in
lex pulls on his pocket

					   hammond
		dont mind the signs  theyre only legal
		precautions

gennaro frowns  the door opens and lex peeks in

					   hammond
		my laboratory lex  it will be yours and
		timmys someday

int  amber room laboratory  continuing action

grant and ellie share a baffled look  grant stares

grants pov  pan across a room filled with honeycolored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pullout trays  each stone is tagged
and numbered

grant leans down studying the stones  he bumps right into gennaro
lex jumps excitedly

					   lex
		its  gold

					   timmy
		its amber  fossilized tree sap

					   lex
		grandpa found gold

grant shushes the kids and looks to hammond

					   hammond
		youre both right  amber is our gold
		the alpha or our alchemic alphabet  the
		precious course of our genetic material
		you already know amber is the fossilized
		resin of prehistoric tree sap of course

grant and ellie nod impatiently  hammond sets the scene

					   hammond
		imagine  millions of years ago tree sap
		flowing over insects as it does now as i
		speak in thousands of forests and backyard
		trees everywhere  imagine that ancient sap
		trapping a little struggling insect and
		consuming it in a syrupy death  millions
		and millions of years pass and we come
		along and discover this prehistoric insect
		if were lucky hes perfectly preserved in
		a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
		is now amber  and as we examine more and
		more amber we find many perished insects
		including among them biting insects 

					   grant
		like mosquitos 

					   hammond
		like mosquitos precisely dr grant

					   grant
		mosquitos that sucked the blood of
		dinosaurs  thats your source of dna
		material  my god  it just might work

int  extraction room laboratory

a technician carefully positions a piece of amber under a finepointed
drill  with a nod the technicians goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill  hammond yells over the loud whirr

					   hammond
		the extraction room speaks for itself

close on  drillbit boring into the amber  orange fleck fly

					   grant
		it does

the technician shuts the drill  placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves he operates an automated pair of needlenose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito  he drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides

					   lex
		thats a million year old mosquito

a conveyor belt starts carrying this tray on to the next technician
the group follows  this technician puts the first slide under a
microscope  grant watches on a video monitor as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug

					   ellie
		put in a piece of amber find a mosquito
		drill it out  right

					   hammond
		right  you are witnessing the extraction
		of tissue from the thorax of this humble
		insect  if this mosquito has ingested any
		foreign red blood cells  say it bit a
		hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a trex   we
		will extract those blood cells and obtain
		paleodna the howtobuild instruction
		book of an extinct creature
		so you see ellie im not creating dino
		saurs fossils left behind the information
		the map of how to bring them back  im
		helping them escape from the confined of
		time

					   grant
		but even thousands of mosquitos wouldnt
		give you enough tissue to determine a
		complete dna strand

					   hammond
		right you are dr grant  more like
		hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
		necessary to provide even a partial
		strand of dna  and without a complete
		strand we dont have a dinosaur

int  genetics room

a loud humming sound  along the walls are rows of waisthigh stainless
steel boxes  in the rooms center are two sixfoothigh round towers
at a single console a man studies a monitor

dr wu 35 looks up from his study and beams at his guests  he jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee  assistants clean the area as wu
comes forward and actually hugs grant much to grants embarrassment

					   hammond
		ah i knew you two would hit it off  dr
		grant this is dr wu my chief geneticist

					   wu
		finally you are here  ive been working
		without the encouragement of my peers for
		too long  welcome welcome

he kisses ellie who takes it in stride  gennaro we already knows

					   wu
		mr hammond never lets me publish and
		hes interested only in results not in
		science

					   hammond
		dont forget to thank me when you pick up
		your nobel prize

hammond and wu resume the tour

					   hammond
		you are standing in the middle of the
		most powerful genetics factory created
		since the expulsion from eden

					   wu
		these are hamachihood automated gene
		sequencers those are cray xmps
		supercomputers that take dna information
		and organize it  in this room we take
		fragmented or incomplete dna strands and
		compare them to other incomplete strands

					   hammond
		its like finding the missing pieces of a
		jigsaw puzzle

					   wu
		the computers make several trillion
		calculations to provide us with a
		complete dna strand  the genetic code of
		an extinct animal

int  incubation room laboratory

a vast room bathed in infrared light filled with long tables  the
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges each bearing dozens of
test tubes  wu leads the group

					   grant
		okay you have your complete dna
		strand  how do you grow it

					   wu
		we use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
		breeding medium

					   hammond
		our primordial soup

					   grant
		and how do you know what it is youre
		growing

wu shrugs

					   wu
		well we have computer techniques to try
		and map out finds on an evolutionary
		basis  but mostly we just grow it and
		find out what it is  if its something
		were interested in and it survives we
		keep it

grant and ellie share a concerned look

					   gennaro
		and if youre not interested

wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skullandcrossbone warnings
timmy regards the poison with excitement

lex calls from deeper in the room

					   lex
		come look

here plastic eggs lay on the long tables their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables  the eggs are all gently rocking
as technicians roam up and down the aisles

hammond walks ahead of the group  as wu speaks hammond listens and
enjoys it as though hes hearing it for the first time

					   wu
		this is the incubation room  we keep the
		temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
		relative humidity of one hundred percent

					   grant and timmy
		jurassic atmosphere

timmy smiles at grant  hammond winks at timmy

					   wu
		we also run a high oxygen concentration
		up to thirtythree percent so if you
		feel faint please tell me right away

lex feigns a faint timmy cracks a small smile they move forward
waistdeep in the mist  a strange green light emanates from the
incubators  lex is halfconsumed by the mist she mimics the witch

					   lex
		im  melting

ellie laughs and pulls lex close

					   wu
		reptile eggs contain large amounts of
		yolk but no water at all  the embryos

		must extract water from the surrounding
		environment

					   grant
		thats why you create the mist

wu nods  hammond just enjoys the scene as grant and ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next touching each with a
flexible wand beeping  lex and timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange big
eggs they hold

					   wu
		children please do not touch  the eggs
		are permeable to skin oils

grant that very close to an egg  he sniffs it

					   grant
		what kind of eggs are these  are these
		shells plastic

					   wu
		yes they are  the embryos are
		mechanically inserted and then hatched in
		this room  but weve managed to
		sufficiently mimic the actual biological
		process  these creatures rupture the
		plastic membrane that theyre contained
		in when theyre born  like real births

they reach an endless row of incubators lined up along the wall
beneath a viewing area like those found in an obgyn ward

					   wu
		eggs that are determined viable spend
		their last couple days in our specially
		designed incubators which help
		accelerate the prenatal developmental
		stages  which is interesting because
		were having a problem with the adult
		animals 

hammond claps a hand over wus mouth and laughs

					   hammond
		theres no problem dr wu cant handle
		now who wants to see the real thing

as they exit the camera pans the misty aisles studying the eggs

ext  visitors center  day

blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the visitors center

grant and hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour  a little ahead is gennaro and ellie  gennaro chatters on
while ellie energetically explores the area looking at the plants

					   gennaro
		 so naturally hammonds going to
		present everything in the best light  i
		need to know that this park is safe

					   ellie
		ill tell you something that troubles me
		from the start  the carnivores are all
		wellfed and kept separated from their
		natural prey  thatll keep em alive
		but it wont keep em happy

					   gennaro
		how do you mean

					   ellie
		the carnivores will want to hunt  its
		an instinct  and that instinct will have
		to be satisfied or suppressed

further up the hill moving slowly hammond eyes the pair suspiciously

					   hammond
		gennaro is putting negative ideas into
		ellies head  hes a naysayer  i have
		no affection for that type of thinking

					   grant
		dont worry  ellie makes her own
		judgments

at the base of the hill timmy and lex toss a baseball

ext  tour start  day

the group gathers  two electric cars glide to a stop behind them
regis leans out of the first one

					   regis
		hey  great day for a tour

					   gennaro
		looks like rain to me

					   regis
		no  i told the raingod to hold it off
		till we got back

the kids pile in next to regis and explore the hightech cars  timmy
finds a a pair of very think strangelooking goggles with dials on top

grant ellie and gennaro climb in the second car

					   hammond
		kids mind mr regis  hes in charge now

the cars begin to move and pass hammond  he waves

gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush  hammond waves

					   hammond
		gennaro for once in your life let
		something really move you

in the cruiser gennaro rubs his neck  he turns to grant

					   gennaro
		ever get the feeling were just hammonds
		damn guinea pigs

					   grant
		i like to wait and see

ellie motions ahead with excitement and apprehension to a huge gate
regis and the kids wave behind to grant ellie and gennaro

the gates doors swing open and the cruisers move forward  the kids
squeal out a yahoo that floats through the air to grant  but grant
wears a cautious face his skeptical eyes scan the landscape

a fanfare of trumpets and then a prerecorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser  video screens display a welcome message

					   prerecorded voice
		welcome to jurassic park  you are now
		entering the lost world of the
		prehistoric past a world of mighty
		creatures long gone from the face of the
		earth which you are privileged to see
		for the first time 

regis uses his walkietalkie to contact grants cruiser

					   regis on walkie
		thats richard kiley  we spared no
		expense

					   prerecorded voice
		well begin our tour today with the
		herbivores 

intext  cruisers first tour stop  day

between massive tree trunks a spectacular view  storm clouds touch
mountaintops  below the lagoon ripples in pink crescents

					   prerecorded voice
		 and the grasses are a species of
		juniper and samples can be purchased at
		the gift shop  now if everyone will
		take a look to the right 

all eyes swing that way  grant doesnt see a thing  nor do the others

ahead timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location  lex grabs the night goggles  timmy pulls them from her

					   regis
		look 

					   lex and timmy
		i dont see anything  do you see
		anything  theres nothing there

					   regis
		somethings out there 

in the second car a fly buzzes on grants windshield  grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement  nothing

suddenly the trees in front of them move  a deep trumpeting sound and
two brachiosaurs rumble away from the side of the road  the ground
shakes as they walk their bellowing fills the air  led by grant the
passengers rise through the open top of their land cruisers to look up
at the dinosaurs far above

drooping from above leaves and little branches shower on grant  utter
amazement fills grants face then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh  he simply cant believe his eyes his laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric

					   grant
		ellie  can you imagine the excavation
		team seeing this

behind him ellies whole person is awestruck immobile  gennaro
squints straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality

in the car ahead lex and timmy stare openmouthed  regis looks at the
animal and then at the groups reverie  he smiles knowingly hes been
there too  he bends and whispers

					   regis
		congratulations youre the first kids in
		the whole wide world ever to see real
		dinosaurs

the kids look up at regis with wonder in their eyes

grant cant stop laughing  still chewing a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man  the brachiosaurs huge head stops inches
away from grant  grant awestruck stares and them 

close on  grant as his eyes slowly roll back and  he faints

the dinosaur casually moves away as ellie comes to grants aid

					   ellie
		alan  alan
		    sort of delighted
		he fainted

gennaro waves to regis that all is okay  grant slowly revives  he
looks back at the brachiosaur groggily smiling away  he looks at
ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual sharing a
look of serene delight

gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him  a
glazed look fills his face

					   gennaro
		my god were going to make a fortune
		here

camera pushes in on the majestic gentle beauty of the brachiosaurs
jungle sounds dominate growing louder and louder

int control room  day

hammond sits at his throne happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group  he laughs raucously and calls to arnold

					   hammond
		he fainted  ive waited fifteen years to
		impress that young man

					   arnold
		oh mr hammond im sorry to interrupt
		you but muldoon needs you by the pit

					   hammond
		oh balls

intext  cruisers second tour stop  day

the cruisers come to a stop  in the distance a herd of gallimimus
graze  they stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew  baby gallimimus scamper
around the adults eating leaves that drop from the larger animals

					    prerecorded voice
		 gallimimus known as the ostrich
		dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders
		have a very strong nesting instinct 

grant doesnt listen  he is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle grazing dinosaurs  suddenly he looks away with a deep
concern  ellie looks at him questioningly

					   grant
		ellie  what the hell are we going to do
		with the rest of our lives

ellie smiles at him puzzled

					   ellie
		what to you mean

					   grant
		cant you see it ellie  were the ones
		that are extinct now

intext  cruisers third tour stop  day

					   prerecorded voice
		 lots more to see in the herbivore
		section of our park  but as we come
		alongside out jurassic jungle river to the
		left lets try and catch a glimpse of a
		very unusual and dangerous carnivore
		look across the river and above 

a lovely mossy clearing  and to the side bounded just by a thicket of
bushes a precipitous drop to a tropical river lush and clear  the
river runs fast but it is narrow  on the other side is a sharp rise

					   prerecorded voice
		and there they are

standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are two dilophosaurus mansized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks  grant and ellie chime in with the prerecorded voice

					   all three
		dilophosaurus

timmy and lex point enthusiastically  regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm

					   prerecorded voice
		dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
		carnivores  scientists once thought
		their jaw muscles were too weak to kill
		but now through the miracle of their
		cloning we know dilophosaurs spit venom
		a poison which causes blindness and then
		unconsciousness

their distinctive hoot drifts across the afternoon air

					   gennaro
		poisonous dinosaurs theres a liability
		issue without a lot of precedent

closeup of the nearly motionless dilophosaurus  one yawns wide

					   grant
		    assessing
		its like a gila monster of a cobra  its
		a poison 

					   ellie
		spitter

the spitters bound off as grant watches transfixed  a flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky  trees filter the light

					   ellie
		are we dreaming all this

ext  raptor pit  day

a big hole in the ground covered with a think wire mesh  suddenly a
dark claw pushes against the wire web a shower of sparks  a screech
animals growl and snarl  an animal slams its face into the mesh  sparks
illuminate a set of razorsharp teeth

muldoon stands next to the pit carefully loading an assault rifle
hammond comes in a hurry  muldoon sees hammond and puts down the rifle
he walks to hammond talking before he gets there

					   muldoon
		these raptors are too damn dangerous one
		of them tunneled out this morning  he
		ripped a boys arm off before i could get
		a bullet in him

					   hammond
		a bullet  muldoon  no  now what  i
		have five left

					   muldoon
		john theyre mean as scorpions and smart
		as chimps  their little fingers make
		them natural cagebreakers  we should
		terminate the raptor program  theyre
		just too smart  too damn smart

					   hammond
		oh balls  i will not terminate the raptors
		just because theyre behaving normally
		theyre hunters  why cant we contain them
		properly

hammond starts to walk away  muldoon follows hes not finished at all

					   muldoon
		john remember back in 88 when we
		started to build the containment devices
		we ordered cattle prods tasers guns
		that blow out electric nets  theyre all
		too slow for these guys if were going
		to keep the raptors i want tow missiles
		and laserguided devices

hammond laughs warmly  he pats muldoon on the back

					   hammond
		its just a zoo muldoon  a zoo  figure
		out a way to contain them  and well sit
		down and have a nice long discussion about
		raptors  after my guests leave okay

hammond walks away  muldoon stares after him jingling keys in his
hand  muldoon lumps over to a worker

					   muldoon
		okay  get a dozer start digging round
		the pit  were gonna bury some fence
		and wear your rifle when youre working

int  control room  afternoon

hammond enters and crosses to his throne  hammond swivels to arnold who
exhales smoke  nedry looks over keeps typing

					   hammond
		where are they  punch em up

					   arnold
		theyll be by the trikes in a moment
		trikes sick again

					   hammond
		how can you say it so matteroffactly
		the trikes  you casually accept it but
		i never can  you know what it means when
		you say by the trikes  by the
		trikes means that theyre out there by
		the species  triceratops horridus  it
		astounds me every time what ive done
		here  what magic what alchemy  we
		turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur
		i will never be complacent about that

arnold smiles and punches a button  we hear the prerecorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids

eavesdropping on the tour is interrupted by a radio transmission to the
control room  arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring
the picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock

					   radio
		hello john  this is the anne b at the
		dock  im looking at the storm patterns
		just south of us  requesting permission
		to leave before unloading the last three
		food containers

nedry looks up quickly listening carefully

					   radio
		dont want to be stuck here if this chop
		gets much worse

hammond reacts with quiet dismay  nedry quietly gets up

					   nedry
		coffee anyone

hes ignored  arnold defers to hammond who leans to the microphone

					   hammond
		hello skipper john hammond how are you
		tonight  i certainly dont want to
		imperil anyone  but can you give us one
		more container of food  then well feel
		comfortable is the storm delays your
		return  could you help us out here  of
		course if it looks too choppy just go
		but youd be doing us a big favor

					   radio
		well  well do our best sir  well
		get one more container off hows that

hammond thanks him and signs off  arnold looks at the darkening clouds

intext  cruisers fourth tour stop  late afternoon

the cars twist through dense vegetation with a grinding of gears  the
first car comes to a jerky stop

there is a huge triceratops lying on its side moving very slowly
breathing laboriously  harding the tall balding park vet kneels on
the ground  he peers into the animals mouth with a large flashlight

before the second car can stop completely grant leaps out races to the
trike  regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase grant and ellie

grant joins harding on the ground  the trike lets out a low moan
shes too sick to move  ellie and lex squat by the animal

					   lex
		i feel so sorry for her  shes so sick

					   vet
		we dont know whats wrong with freda
		every six weeks she gets like this

					   regis
		oh shell be up and around in no time
		after a big night i feel the same way

grant very gently opens the trikes mouth

					   grant
		poor girl  whats the matter  ellie
		look at this

a dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth  ellie shines the
light on it illuminating silvery blisters  gennaro turns away

					   ellie
		microvesicles  interesting

grant scratches one of the blisters with his ballpoint pen  it oozes
the kids share a grossedout look

					   lex
		doesnt she have a mommy and a daddy

					   harding
		we make these dinosaurs in the lab
		sweetheart  but they do form attachments
		freda has a little one that follows her
		around thinks fredas his mom

grant starts to look around

					   ellie
		what does she eat  where does she feed

					   harding
		animal this size takes in a minimum of
		six hundred pounds of plants a day  we
		truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
		times a day  thats all she touches

grant studies the nearby grass and bushes  timmy quietly follows grant

ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops  a runny eye just stares

grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand  these weeds have little purple berries  ellie looks over

					   ellie
		west indian lilacs

					   grant
		thesed give anybody a stomachache

					   harding
		im telling you the animals dont eat
		dont eat that stuff

regis keeps a babysitters eye on the kids  timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones  he approaches grant shyly

					   timmy
		dr grant sir  how bout these
		theres lots of little piles of these

grant fingers one distractedly then suddenly comes to attention

					   grant
		hey ellie take a look at his  good
		work timmy

ellie gets up brushes herself off comes over and examines the stone

					   ellie
		extremely smooth  purple stains could
		be those lilac berries

she and grant smile and each other and nod  gennaro is curious

					   harding
		i dont get it

					   grant
		looks like your trike swallows stones to
		help her digest her food  walking
		around she crushes berries against the
		stones  and even just a little crushed
		berry is eventually enough

					   ellie
		so she poisons herself periodically

					   harding
		bet we tested her saliva for any trace of 

					   grant
		but with the stones she swallows them
		and probably bypasses any mucosal
		contact  straight to the stomach  i
		would test her excrement

					   lex
		yo yuk

a light rain begins  automatically with a soft hiss the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit  gennaro taps regis and indicates the cars

					   gennaro
		hey regis where are your rain gods
		its gonna pour  lets finish our tour

grant agrees heads for the cruisers  he turns and looks for ellie
ellie stands by the trike  she gives grant a meaningful look

					   ellie
		im staying

grant smiles at her decision

					   grant
		soil samples

					   ellie
		you read my mind
		    confidentially
		i think shes sicker then theyre saying
		her skin is dry and flaky  and her gums
		are pale  im going to talk to dr wu

					   grant
		good idea  ill keep my eyes open

gennaro climbs in with grant  the two cruisers start off and timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at grant  regis and lex wave to the
trike  grant looks back to ellie who has already begun to work

on trike  a mosquito lands on its back  the trikes tail slaps it dead

int  machine room  late afternoon

with difficulty nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment  he stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor  he gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio  he transmits

					   nedry into radio
		jim what the hells with you   i know
		a storms coming i cant  its all so
		tightly planned  thats not enough 
		ok twenty minutes ill be there  damn

nedry returns the radio to its hiding place  he sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space

intext  cruisers trex feeding area  dusk

the cruisers stop on the rise of a hill  they over look a forested area
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon

					   tour
		the mighty trex arose late in dinosaur
		history  dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
		hundred and twenty million years but
		there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
		fifteen million years of that period 

farther south they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the waters edge  their bodies mirrored in the moving surface
break apart with the continuing drops of rain  hear lightning rhythmic
ally pulses the sky  all is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain

regis calls grant on the walkietalkie

					   regis to walkie
		you know dr grant hammond likes to

		come here in the evening and just sit

					   grant over walkie
		where is the trex

					   regis to walkie
		good question

on grant  as he takes that in nodding to himself studies the land

					   grant
		maybe shes down hunting apatosaurs

over walkie  regis laughs his voice tinny over the radio

					   regis over walkie
		would if she could believe me  some
		times she stands by the lagoon and stares
		at those animals and wiggles those
		little forearms of hers in frustration
		but the trex territory is completely
		enclosed with trenches and fences
		believe me she cant go anywhere

					   grant
		then where is she

they hear a soft bleating  in the center of the field a small cage
rises into view lifted on hydraulics from underground  the cage bars
slide down  a goat remains tethered in the field bleating plaintively

the tour group stares out their windows expectantly

back on control room 

hammond pleased watches the giant screen that displays the tour group
muldoon limps into the control room  arnold looks over

					   muldoon
		just checking in  everything ok

					   hammond
		look at them  leaning out the windows
		so eager  they cant wait to see it
		they have come for the danger

					   muldoon
		thats what im afraid of

muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers

back on cruisers trex feeding area 

grant watches quietly

the bleating becomes louder more insistent  the goat tugs frantically
at its tether racing back and forth kicking

					   lex
		whats going to happen to the goat  is
		the trex gonna come eat the goat

grant senses something  he sits straight up  looks out intently

					   grant
		hes here

the goat is tethered in the middle of the field thirty yards from the
nearest tree  grant scans the tree for the trex

the goat senses something too  it struggles and strains bleating
frantically  suddenly the mechanical sound of the cage coming up  its
bars surround the goat with safety once again

					   regis
		looks like the rex will have its snack a
		little later today

					   recorded voice
		the sensors dont see the rex around
		she usually comes within five minutes of
		hearing dinner if she doesnt that
		means shes sleeping  we might have
		access to her at the picnic area

lex and timmy let out a sigh of relief  the tension is gone

					   lex
		i didnt want to see him get eaten  i
		liked the goat

back in the control room 

hammond studies the large video monitor  he watches grant and gennaro
their voices are heard in the control room

					   gennaro monitored
		what is a carnivore got out

					   grant monitored
		thered be no stopping it  huge with no
		natural enemies and a suppressed hunting
		instinct

hammond glares  arnold aware shuts off the screen

					   hammond
		damn those people  they are so negative

					   arnold
		its natural  they cant fully
		appreciate that weve engineered the
		animals and the park for total safety

					   hammond
		they comb this island like a bunch of
		accountants  they dont experience the
		wonder the awe of it all

					   arnold
		you cant make people experience wonder

hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park
the quartz floodlights outside their area come on with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection

at his console nedry looks at hammond  hammond stares out the window
the rain picks up and bounces off the window  hammond speaks to arnold
without turning

					   hammond
		its like the garden of eden out there
		this is the most beautiful time of day

					   arnold
		better rout the tour back  they can
		start again sunup tomorrow morning

					   hammond
		yup  call the kitchen  those kidsll be
		hungry when they get in

arnold picks up the phone  static  he glances over at nedry

					   nedry
		sorry bout that  ive taken all the
		lines to upload some data

hammonds annoyed but contains it  arnold looks at nedry who smiles

					   nedry
		ill clear a couple of lines for you at
		the end of the next transmission sir
		here you go now this will make it all
		better mr hammond

nedry punches in a code

close on  nedrys fat finger punching a last key

close on  amber video display terminal as a countdown begins

as the screen counts down from ten to zero nedry peers at hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes

back on screen  three two one the countdown hits zero

nedrys datafilled screen blinks off  nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors  unnoticed by hammond or arnold two more monitors go blank
then a third one

back  on cruisers rest area  night

the electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park  huge quartz lights reveal a dramatic view down to the ocean
there the supply ship the anne b unloads its last crates

rain increases  on the other side of the road are picnic tables an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms  to the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island  a guardrail separates visitors

to the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall electrified fence  surrounding the electric fence is a
smaller protective fence

					   prerecorded voice
		 enjoy a healthy snack  this is also
		a good time to 

					   lex
		hey is that bathroom working

					   regis
		sure
		    he uses his walkie
		rest stop

the kids take off towards the bathroom running through the rain  grant
gets out of his cruiser strides to regis  he indicates the fence

					   grant
		is that still the trex paddock

					   regis
		yes  but she never comes here  i dont
		know why not  probably too much
		construction

gennaro jacket over his head against the rain looks down to the ocean

gennaros pov  the anne b unloads he last cargo crate

grant looks at the concrete moat  studies its deep curve  he looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10000 volt warning  he sees
conventional power lines on the opposite side of the road

camera examines the empty cruisers  inside the prerecorded voice is
chatting on  it slows eerily and stops  video screens blink out

back on control room 

nedry yawns loudly

					   nedry
		yup  looks like a neverending weekend
		for me  im gonna get a diet coke
		dont touch my console ok  line will
		be clear in five minutes

nedry leaves  hammond swings around and growls under his breath

					   hammond
		slob

					   arnold
		well at least he knows what hes doing

int  upper floor visitors center  night

nedry races through the series of security doors  he ignores the
security xray device and just shoves each door open with his hand

back on cruisers rest area 

the quartz lights go out leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
steady rain  theres a ripple of surprise from the group  regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the cruisers

					   regis
		everythings just fine  its a temporary
		glitch due to the rain  no doubt
		theyre going to rerout some circuits
		back at the mainframe  well have the
		power back on in moments  lets get back
		in the cruisers they may start up and
		id like us all to be seated in them

the cruisers are still  in the rear cruiser gennaro turns to grant

					   gennaro
		i knew we shouldnt have kids here

a vivid flash of lightning  in the first car  lex covers her eyes
then she looks up at regis with a frightful face

					   lex
		mr regis are dinosaurs  nocturnal

					   regis
		no darling of course not

					   lex
		mr regis  whats  nocturnal

another lightning flash  lex cries  regis comforts her

					   regis
		dont you worry about dinosaurs  theyre
		all very safe in their paddocks just like
		animals in a big strong zoo  theyre not
		going anywhere we dont tell them to go

timmy looks out the window excitedly

int  incubation room laboratory  night

all those eggs on tables  no moving sensors  nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall  its
electrical cord goes flying  furiously nedry fills the incubator with
eggs one after the other

					   nedry
		okay little ones  here we go

nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it  the
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits

back on control room 

hammond looks out the large window as the lights extinguish  he twirls

					   hammond
		whats going on arnold  i want those
		lights on  i dont want my grandchildren
		scared

					   arnold
		jesus the computers gone down

					   hammond
		well i want the computer up  this is
		the wrong weekend for glitches

arnold still examines his console  he looks out with worry

					   arnold
		thats not the worst of it

					   hammond
		oh yeah  please tell me whats worse
		than the lights going out

wu smashes through the door

					   wu
		all the security doors are open  someone
		has been in my laboratory and the eggs
		have been disturbed

the camera pushes in on hammonds face

					   hammond
		where the hell is nedry  where is he
		did anybody check the damn john

hammond storms out

int  corridor visitors center  continuing action

hammond enters the hall  muldoon racing from the other direction yells

					   muldoon
		john the generators shut down  who cut
		the power

					   hammond
		arnolds on it  you go out and bring
		back the tour right away  i dont need
		any of this

muldoon is already running back the way he came

int  garage  night

several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room  there
is a glassedin area where muldoons weapons are stored  assault
rifles tasers tear gas canisters

to the side of the garage s muldoons red jeep  in the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher

nedry storms in wheeling his incubator  he stop suddenly and listens
approaching footsteps

					   nedry
		oh shit

int  basement stairs visitors center 

muldoon runs down a long corridor stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage  he runs out  his boots resound on the concrete

back on  nedrys panicked face as he listens to the footsteps
wheezing with great difficulty nedry bends his knees and strains  with
everything hes got he lifts the incubator waistheight  and holds it

back on muldoon  muldoons footsteps echo as they come closer and closer
to the garage  muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs  his jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister yanks him to a stop

close on  muldoons jacket as it rips stays caught

back on  nedry as he tries to heave higher cant  beads a sweat roll
down his brow

muldoon frees his caught jacket and then keep going

nedrys face drips with sweat  the incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms  catches it with his knee  nedry curses and with one forceful
boost he lifts the incubator shoulder height

close on  muldoons feet on long stairwell boom boom boom

nervous nedry breathes in a labored fashion  he looks this way and
that  he closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep  nedry exhales

at that moment muldoon enters the vestibule between stairs and garage

nedry eyes the shadowy figure in the vestibule  nedrys frightened face

muldoon stops and reaches in his belt  he pulls out his pistol  he
takes out long shiny cartridges  he loads the pistol

nedry leaps in the front of the jeep pushing aside the rocket launcher
and zooms into the night

a moment later muldoon enters the garage  he sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air  he looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone  he bends and inspects fresh tread marks he looks up his
face straining to understand

ext  park road  night

nedrys red jeep flies down the park road

close on  nedrys wheel as he turns it

his tires skid sideways then regain traction  the jeep bolts up a
smaller access road  he skids to a stop at the top of the hill

nedry jumps out and looks up  his high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled  danger  10000 volts

two safety fences separate nedry from the electric fence  he races to
the first one pulls out a key chain  he tries one key then another
and another  it fits  nedry unlocks the gate swings open the door

nedry runs to the second gate  he slips in the mud  he slides to the
ground dropping keys in a muddy pool

close on  nedrys hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water  got them   unlocks the second gate

he races to the electric fence  rain pelts him now  water beads on his
face  lightning flashes on the 10000 volts warning

he grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open

nedry heads back to his jeep his fat body strobed by its high beams
he jumps in the jeep and drives through  behind him the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night

back on garage

ellie and harding pull in in their own gaspowered jeep  muldoon is
waiting for them  now theres a rifle slung over his shoulder  harding
jumps out of the jeep

					   muldoon

					   ellie
		no  im going with you muldoon

they race out

ext  dock  night

headlights blazing in the darkness nedrys jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the anne b is preparing to leave  the water is very choppy

nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground  he begins to
drag it through the mud toward the ship  captain farrell comes to meet
him along with a couple men who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship

					   captain farrell
		good  glad to see you  were you seen

					   nedry
		nah  im back in five minutes theyll

					   nedry
		in about eight hours spray down all the
		eggs with this stuff  itll keep em
		warm but not too warm  i hope baker has
		it together with the dock

back on cruisers rest area 

rain drums down on the cruiser  timmy stares out at the dark  lex
stares nervously out the side window  timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on

					   timmy
		hey these thing work great  i can see
		in the dark and i can see far

he swivels away from the trex paddock and looks out toward the ocean
he reaches up and adjusts the knob

					   timmy
		hey  i wonder if that boats still
		there  it is i think theyre getting
		ready to go

tims pov  the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on

timmy hands her the night goggles lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean

					   lex
		hey that fat guys down there is he
		gonna come get us and take us to grandpa

the captain  men heave the incubator onto the ship

		they help the baby eggs grow up

					   timmy

		whens the damn power coming on

intext muldoons jeep other back roads

muldoon and ellie drive into the storm  suddenly he slams on his
brakes  in front of him a tree has fallen completely blocking the
road  muldoon curses swerves around and skids to a stop

as muldoon gets out and assesses the situation ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep  she pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet quickly muldoon and ellie drag the tree
as they struggle

					   muldoon
		strong legs

					   ellie
		lot of track in college

back on cruisers rest area 

in the first car regis drums his fingers on the dashboard  timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain  lex shifts her body around
trying to get comfortable to rest

					   lex
		im hungry  when can we get going

					   regis
		when the electricity comes back on
		honey  these cars run on electric cables
		buried in the road

in the second car grant tries the radio to no avail  gennaro smokes
grant looks forward toward the first cruiser  he can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain  occasionally lightning reveals all

timmy pulls gum out of his pocket  feels a tiny shake looks around
he puts it in his mouth chewing quietly  suddenly the whole car
vibrates  regis sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor  the kids look at him

					   regis
		must be turning on the electricity

lex sits up looks around groggily

					   lex
		feels like a vibration

int  trex paddock  night

the trexs huge hind feet crash down one large foot following after
the other in long powerful strides

back on cruisers rest area  first cruiser

there is a thud and then a thud and then a thud   tim and lex share a
frightened look  now the thud grows louder  there is a crashing sound
the whole cruiser shakes  then silence  then another shake

camera pushes in till close  timmy stares out with his night goggles

tims nightscope pov in close  trex paws rest on the electric fence

tim takes off his goggles stares transfixed  regis picks them up

extreme closeup  of muscular forepaws with pebbled grainy skin and
thick curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand

the trex moves his body forward of the brush pushes against the fence

in the second cruiser 

grant and gennaro stare out unseeing in the rain and darkness

close on lex 

tears roll down her cheek  she cries silently with an unknown fear
regis pulls the goggles from his eyes starts to gag checks it

					   regis
		jesus christ

					   lex
		bad language

					   regis
		jesus christ  the fence isnt
		electrified

					   lex
		is that bad

regis turns looks out the side window away from the trex

regis is shaking uncontrollably  suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain leaving the door open  no move from the rex

regis races by the second cruiser  grant stares out at him

					   tim
		mr regis  mr regis where are you
		going

					   lex
		he just left us  he just left us all
		alone  timmy timmy how could he do
		that  were all alone  were all alone

flash of lightning  flash  the rex butts his head

tims pov  the fence bangs down on top of his cruiser

timmy and lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car

in the second cruiser 

grant and gennaros pov  through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence  an unseen weight pulls on it further causing its
electric wire to pop like overtuned guitar strings

timmy reaches 

out into the rain for the open door handle

another lightning flash and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers atop the crushed fence  his head turns back and
forth hes deciding on his prey  grant and gennaro or tim and lex

timmy slams the door shut  he looks directly at the rex just a few
feet away  the rex turns to him stares back

lex screams and timmy claps a hand over her mouth

there is a whisper over tims walkietalkie

					   grant on walkie
		timmy be quiet dont move

back on grant 

he snaps off the walkietalkie

his pov  the rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs  the animals head is outofview above the
rooftops of the cars  the rex lifts its huge hind leg

					   gennaro
		holy shit  any suggestions what we do
		now

					   grant
		cant think of a thing

the trex slowly circles grants cruiser

back on tim 

he watches the beast move

back on grant and gennaro 

as they twist and turn trying to find a circling rex in dark and rain
the rex pauses right next to gennaros window  he lowers his head
looking for movement inside

close on  the beady expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket

grant whispers hardly moving his lips

					   grant
		dont move

gennaros leg trembles uncontrollably

in the first cruiser 

very frightened lex discovers a flashlight  she flicks it on and off
distracting herself  the beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic

					   lex
		its too too dark out there

tim waves his hands in caution

back on grant gennaro and the rex 

the rex bends down bumps the windshield with his nose  just stays
there breathing heavily  in the distance the flashlight goes on
again  the rex raises his head suddenly  grant grabs his walkie

					   grant to the walkie
		shut that flashlight tim

as the rex heads off a casual swipe of his tail smashes the side of the
cruiser throwing grant and gennaro across the inside of the car

on tim 

he lunges for the flashlight  lex dodges him keeps it lit

					   lex
		no its mine  please i need it

tim looks up through the sun roof  the massive head of the
tyrannosaurus rex appears  tim watches transfixed  lex looks up
irrational with terror she aims her flashlight like a gun  blasts him
her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain  she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and screams

the pool of light bathes the rexs face  he smashes his head down onto
the plexiglass bubble  it crunches and falls into the car crushing
the children  tim uses his feet to push it to the side

above the rex displays is gaping maw drooling toward the opening

grant 

watches the rex raise his mighty head again above the kids cruiser

timmy and lex 

have a halfinstant of relief  then slam  the rex butts his head
against the cruiser  the rex comes back down tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser  pushes his head close to the glass looking

the dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser his whole chest heaving
his forelimbs pawing the air

timmy whispers to lex

					   timmy
		are you ok  be quiet and dont move

lex barely nods and grabs timmys hand

the tyrannosaur places his head next to the car  he begins to shove the
cruiser with his head  the cruiser rocks  the back window bursts
shards go flying

inside the kids are thrown back and forth shoved against each other
and finally flung against the top of the car as the cruiser flips

the whole world tilts crazily  trunks of palm trees slide by the
ground above the blazing eye of the rex the tops of palm trees

the cruiser slams down on its side the windows splat in the mud  lex
falls helplessly against the side window and lies motionless  timmy
falls beside her banging his head  he reaches for lex

					   timmy
		    softly
		lex  lex

silence  no movement from lex

the animal toys with the cruiser  like a dog with its bone the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head  he pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment  each shove
sends the children flying again

the cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment
the cruiser slams to a stop completely upsidedown  the trex steps
right on the cruiser crushing the roof against the ground

inside  the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides

the rex  gnaws at the car grabs a tire with his teeth  it ruptures
with a pitiful pop  the rex grabs at the axle with his teeth begins to
drag the car back  the kids halfoutside are pulled with the car

grant dances 

with a flare  the rex is distracted

close on  the rex as he roars  the flare gleams in his eyes

the rex starts toward grant  he tosses the flare over the halfstanding
part of the fence  the rex lunges after the flare

gennaro has reached his limit  terrorized he leaps out and screams

					   gennaro
		extinct animals should stay extinct

he bolts  the rex sees him and starts after him thundering by grant
who stays frozen in place

gennaro sprints for his life  hes not even a distant match for the t
rex jogging behind him

gennaro dives into the ladies room

inside  he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door
pounding footsteps approach  gennaro backs up into one of the stalls
louder pounding the walls begin to vibrate  gennaro assumes a tuck
position

on the interior door  the rex smashes right through the steelclad
door  pieces go flying

gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the rex sniffs around

grant runs back 

to check on the kids  he reaches a hand underneath the flipped car
sitting in the mud  lexs soft voice can be heard

					   lex off
		dr grant

grant fishes under finds lexs hand drags her out  he quickly checks
her for broken bones

					   grant
		lex are you okay

					   lex
		timmys unconscious he wont move

lex screams  grant turns to see the rex return  he squeezes lex tight
the animal goes right past them back to his toy  tims land cruiser

the rex bellows a huge cry  timmy awakens and sees the rex above him
he screams

lex squeezed in grants arms sees her imperiled brother

					   lex
		timmy

the tyrannosaur looks up growls across the upsidedown cruiser opens
its huge jaws menacingly all the time staring at grant and lex

inside the car  timmy tries to unwedge himself  a thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead  hes jammed between the crushed roof and
the bent bench seat  he cant free himself

the rex begins to shove the cruiser toward grant and lex  they back up
but they have very few feet left  theyre almost at the embankment
but if they dont move theyll by crushed by the oncoming car

grant slings lex onto his back  she grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides  grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment  its a huge drop

grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and lex over the side of
the embankment

just in time as the rex shoves the cruiser further  now the cruiser
teeters right on the edge turning again on its side  tim hangs halfway
out of the car unable to get out further

grant with lex on his back slides down the cable rappelling down the
embankment  above the car looms over them rocking on the edge  lex
looks up and grabs grant so tightly she chokes him unknowingly

grant eyes bulging sees the danger from above  he pushes off the wall
and swings them toward the next hanging cable  he reaches out and 

 grabs the next cable just as 

 the trex bellows and lowers her head and gives a final shove  timmy
and the cruiser sail into space  timmy screams

grant and lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them  lex
screams squeezing grants neck even tighter   they watch helplessly as
the cruiser bounces off the wall and crashlands into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall

grant and lex stare down at the wreck in the tree  timmy cant be seen

the rex paws the air grunts in frustration and stalks off lightning
flashes

ext  nedrys jeep back roads 

nedry speeds along the rainslick road fishtailing as he goes

close on  nedry at the wheel

nedrys pov  the dark wet road running alongside a tenfoot chainlink
fence  suddenly a beastlike visage blurs across the road

nedry swerves  the jeep skids  nedry tries to oversteer cant bring
the careening jeep under control

the jeep crashes though the fence bounces down a cement culvert and
dives into a raging gully

nedry curses  he spins the wheel  the tires spin and spray  the
jeeps hopelessly stuck in the gully  from nedrys seat in the jeep he
cranes his head around examining his situation

nedrys pov  on the opposite side of the gully there is an equipment
graveyard  by the titled jeep headlights steely monsters all around
can be seen  discarded earth movers graders and tractors

nedry gets out of the jeep grabs the winch from the jeeps back end
and wades over to an abandoned tractor

					   nedry
		shit im going to have to change clothes

he loops the winch around the tractors base  suddenly he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle hooting  he squints looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headlights

hoot  hoot  a distinctive hooting  nedry looks up in fear  silence

nedry starts moving toward his jeep  again the hoot  nedry stops
looks right looks left  a rustle in the trees  nedrys head cocks

looking through trees lit by the strong beams nedry sees a spitter in
the eerie mist  now its gone  now its back  it circles nedry
warily hunting him  nedry stares

					   nedry
		i hope this is one of them herbivores

nedry scrambles the other way fulltilt  hop hop and the spitter
drops in front of nedry from the other side  hoot

nedry jumps back lands on his butt  the spitter zips in from the side
 hoot

nedry doubles back racing through the abandoned equipment ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer spinning past a tree  he splashes down
the embankment trying to get to his jeep  he uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current  he finally reaches the jeep
swings open the door  and surging out of the water like a demonic
apparition is the spitter  nedry backs away directly into the glare
of the headlights

close on  the spitter  its plume opens bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck  something squirts beneath its jaws

a big glob smacks nedry on the arm  he brushes it off

					   nedry
		gross

extreme closeup  the spitters head  the jaws puff the hood flares
out the neck snaps forward  and  it spits

this glob misses nedry splashes off the steaming headlight

very extreme closeup  the spitters swollen poison sacs are inflated
they fire

this glob hits nedry in the eyes  he screams

					   nedry
		im blind im blind

he falls against the jeep rubbing his eyes  the spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded nedry weave drunkenly in the
water  nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
drivers door  the spitter stalks watching him

nedry pulls open the jeep door thrusts his head in slams it against
the door frame  now nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep  the
spitters long ostrichlike legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on nedry

nedry sits behind the wheel unseeing as the spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way

a long beat  the spitter leaps forward the camera pulls back wider and
wider  nedry lets out an earsplitting scream and the car horn blares

int  timmys cruiser

timmy lies against a spidered side window his head pressed against the
door handle  he pushes himself up on one elbow opens his eyes and
tries to focus  rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

timmy tries to straighten up but hes too dizzy  he stops and hears a
creaking and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth  with a
further effort he raises his body so that hes standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof

tims pov  dense foliage moving in the wind hard to see through  an
open space and  the ground forty feet away

intext  cruiser  continuing action

tims cruiser is lying on its side stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside

					   timmy
		oh shit

timmy pulls his body up carefully trying to get a better view  he
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand

crack  the cruiser slips a few inches down the tree  timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes  the car sways in the wind

crack  the car slips a quick and rocky two feet

					   timmy
		oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit

timmy hears something  he raises his head very carefully  climbing up
the tree pulling himself on a nearby branch is dr grant

					   grant
		timmy  are you ok

					   timmy
		thank god youre here  wheres lex

					   grant
		below  shes fine  lets get you down

timmy nods

grant peers through the broken roof of the cruiser analyzing timmys
predicament  he cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree  grant turns back to timmy

					   grant
		try the door youre leaning against
		nice and slow

timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs trying to open the door handle  stuck  crack  the
cruiser drops another foot

grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again  he motions for timmy to hold still

grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle  this one opens and very slowly he pushes open the door  grant
gingerly holds it halfopen in midair

					   grant
		crawl this way  slowly

carefully testing his weight with each step timmy lowers his body down
he pushes his legs out the door  they kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch  he lets himself down  now he sits on a
branch a few feet below the cruiser

crack  the cruiser drops  grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone  his legs hang in space  the cruiser
hangs precariously above timmy  theyre all twenty feet in the air

					   grant
		were going to have to make a jump for
		it timmy  okay

timmy agrees

					   grant
		one two three jump

timmy lets go and drops  grant follows  so does the cruiser  its
hurtling right at them

timmy bangs against the wet treetrunk and slides down  branches whip
against his face his hands scrape against the trunk  grant bounces
them  they scramble down as quick as they can

timmy pulls his hands along the sapsticky surface of the tree  crack
grant is stopped for a terrible instant  doubled over a branch he
flips himself over dropping further  the cruiser jolts along just a
halfstep behind them

timmy dives the last six feet and hits the wet earth with a thud  grant
crashes next to him  before they can roll out of the way the cruiser
keeps coming  grant and timmy look up at it

grants pov  the cruiser dropping dropping toward them  and finally
stops just inches away its dented grill grinning at them its cracked
headlight glaring

oil drips down on grant  he grabs timmy who grabs the night goggles
the two roll away  that second the cruiser smashes to the ground

grant brushes himself off painfully extends a hand to timmy  timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing

					   timmy
		thanks dr grant

					   grant
		you owe me one

grant turns around in a slow fluid circle checking out the forest

					   grant
		whered lex go

they hear a faint whimpering

					   timmy
		theres lex

he runs  grant follows

int  drainpipe 

lex is curled up inside the drainpipe  her baseball glove is in her
mouth and she is rocking back and forth rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe  she whimpers

on the hillside 

grant and timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at lex

					   grant
		come on out now lex

lex continues to band her head  timmy tries again

					   timmy
		its your turn to wear the goggles lex

she shakes her head  he holds up her baseball but she doesnt look

					   timmy
		i found your baseball

					   lex
		you did

but she doesnt move  grant speaks encouragingly

					   grant
		cone on lex it must be cold in there
		and tight  why dont you come out

					   timmy
		the animals are gone

ext  roadside

regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders  he looks
around carefully  he peels mud off his face and rubs his neck

he touches his cheek

close on regis swollen cheek  he rubs it with his finger  suddenly
he swats at his own mouth  he reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood  he hurls it to the ground spitting  he grabs another off his
arm and rips if off leaving a bloody streak  he digs in his pants and
pulls out another  he screams

as soon as he has done so he knows hes made a mistake  he looks
around frantically  sees the rex trot down the road toward him

					   regis
		noooooo

back on hillside 

grant and the kids crest the hill  grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward regis  the kids cant see that far

					   timmy
		whats going on

grants green pov  regis and the rex bounding after him  regis hugs a
tree unmoving

grant whispers to the kids

					   grant
		its regis and the rex is after him  but
		its okay  regis knows the rex cant see
		him  evidently he can only see move
		ment  regisll be ok if he stays still

after a long moment the tyrannosaur walks away disappears into the
shadows  regis waits another long moment and releases his tree

grants pov  the tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks regis
to the ground  regis jumps up and backs off  the animal knocks him
right back down  regis jumps up again and screams at the beast

					   regis
		you dont want to hurt mr regis  go
		away  eds your friend  back off

the rex watches him dance around  it goes toward him  this time its
jaws are open  regis screams and in the middle the scream cuts off

grant lets the goggles fall off his face  they hit the ground with a
metallic clink  the rex turns toward grant and the kids

					   grant
		lets go

grant grabs both the kids hands and they begin to run

back on  tour rest area 

drops of water splat on a big fern  light swims in the little puddle
in the sky above clouds hurry by intermittently revealing a half
obscured moon

the torn fence lies in a crumpled twisted mess  the wheel of a land
cruiser spins  a little lizard runs in place on it

the sound of the jeeps engine  its muldoon and ellie

their pov  a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road

					   ellie
		oh my god  wheres the other one

before the cruiser stops she jumps out   muldoon shouts a whisper

					   muldoon
		ellie

ellie turns in the headlight beams  muldoon tosses her a flashlight

					   muldoon
		wait up

muldoon skids to a stop leaps out of the car  he catches up to ellie

they share a frightened apprehensive look  muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area

					   muldoon
		trex tracks

ellie looks out into the forest

					   ellie
		then they must be out there  they must
		be out there  i know it

					   muldoon
		perhaps

					   ellie
		no  theyre out there

					   muldoon
		ive seen a lot of animal attacks in the
		bush  its not as gory and horrifying to
		see as youd think  no pools of blood or
		exposed bones  there is usually little or
		no evidence left behind  and if victims
		are small a predator can kill by just
		shaking the little thing to death eating
		it and leave not so much as a button

a definite rustling in the brush

ellie jumps and screams  muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down  they both squat by the cruiser  silence  ellie
swallows  muldoon slowly gets up  ellie follows

their flashlights swing back and forth in the night  twigs crack under
their feet

ellie hears the rustle at the edge of the forest  she shines her light
into the brush  she catches her breath  her hand shakes

ellie flashes her beam right left up down  jumps  something is
coming at her rolling at her  she gasps steps back  its too late
its gennaro  his limp body stops at her feet  she covers her mouth
muldoon runs to her

gennaro is facedown  muldoon takes his pulse

					   muldoon
		thank god  beat  we have to carry him
		first i have to 

he stands and removes his jacket

close on  muldoon tears the jacket into long strips

he wraps gennaros wounds

					   muldoon
		hes losing a lot of blood  help me

muldoon and ellie carry gennaro to the jeep  they lay him on the back
seat  muldoon jumps in back with him  he keeps wrapping the wounds
ellie starts the engine looks back at him

					   ellie
		looks like youve been through this
		before

muldoon looks up

					   muldoon
		i told you ive seen big game attacks in
		africa

she starts the engine

					   ellie
		right

ellie skids out of there

int  control room  night

the dark room is lit with two outdoor torches  light flickering on
their faces arnold and wu stare at the console screen

					   wu
		why

					   arnold
		because nedry messed with the code
		thats why im checking it

					   wu
		but that could take weeks  what would be
		faster  try keychecks

arnold snaps his fingers grabs wu

					   arnold
		thats true  keychecks will give me a
		record of every button nedry pushed

with a rapid series of keys arnold initiates keystrokes  the
computer displays a short series of commands  arnold runs his finger
down the screen

					   arnold
		jesus thats all he did all afternoon
		he was just dicking around maybe waiting
		to get his nerve up

wu points to a line  it reads  whterbtobj

					   wu
		whats that

					   arnold
		some sort of object  lets see if we can
		trace it

arnold types find whterbtobj  nothing  he tries define whterbtobj
still nothing  list whterbtobj  the screen fills with data  each
line defines another security system that has been shut off  security
perimeter fences off   security  interior fences off  security 
laboratory doors off etc

					   wu
		whats it mean

					   arnold
		it wasnt a bug  it was a trap door that
		fat bastard left for himself  when he
		hit whterbt obj it initiates a set of
		commands that turned the whole goddamn
		park off  hammond was right about him

					   wu
		if i did that id leave a way to turn it
		back on  in case i had to  im sure
		nedry did  youre find it

arnold nods grimly

int  cafeteria  night

hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth  this room is lit by dozens of candles

muldoon walks in stares at hammond in the semidarkness

					   muldoon
		we found gennaro  hed badly injured
		hardings tending to him in your
		quarters  hell be all right if we can
		radio for help  your grandchildren and
		grant are somewhere in the park  i
		believe theyre alive but i dont know
		where they are

					   hammond
		im sure youll find them

					   muldoon
		i certainly hope so

					   hammond
		im sure we will  after all i keep
		telling everyone this park is made for
		children

					   muldoon
		just so you understand that theyre
		missing sir

					   hammond
		missing  of course i know theyre
		missing  you just said that  look bob
		lets not get carried away  weve had a
		little breakdown from the storm or
		whatever and as a result weve had a
		regrettable unfortunate accident  and
		thats all that happened  were dealing
		with it  arnold will get the computers
		cleaned up and the radio and phone lines
		open  youll find those kids and my good
		friend dr grant  im sure theyll want
		some of this ice cream  its very good

int  hammonds quarters  night

blood from gennaros injuries stain the rich leather  gennaro babbles

					   gennaro
		that rex didnt even give me his full
		attention  thats what hurts  i was
		just an afterthought  i gave him my full
		attention

					   harding
		hes had a lot of morphine

					   gennaro
		    sings
		not enough

					   ellie
		i need to find wu  i have to run a few

		okay lex

grant picks her up

					   grant
		oof  youre heavy

the full moon is blurred by drifting clouds  their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond  grant is lost
is thought trying to decide where to go

					   grant

lexs heavy eyes open  her eyes grow big  she taps grants shoulder

					   lex
		the fence

					   grant
		    squinting
		no

					   timmy
		oh i do right there

lex lets herself slide off grant and runs into the woods  timmy
follows  grant follows squinting  finally he sees  a big smile

the kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence  timmy gulps

					   lex
		timmys scared of heights

timmy spins in fury

					   timmy
		shut up

lex and timmy stare at each other  no fighting  now  they relax

					   grant
		okay with the fence timmy

timmy eyes it  nods hesitantly  they start to climb  lex climbs easily

					   lex
		    mumbles quietly
		fraid of heights

timmy climbs tentatively  a dinosaur roars in the distance

close on  timmys foot loses its grip

timmy hangs for a moment held only by his straining hands

all three stop  wait  timmy regains his balance  slowly they proceed
up and over

on the other side grant looks around  more high trees  beyond a field

					   grant
		a herbivore grazing area  excellent

grant starts to walk toward it  timmy stops  lets sits on a tree root

					    tim
		we gonna walk all night

grant looks at his watch

					   grant
		twelve hours before that ship reaches the
		mainland

					   tim
		we need sleep

true and grants thinking the same thing  he looks around surveying
the misty forest  he looks straight up into the beautiful tall trees
that ring the wideopen grassy meadow

					   grant
		up there

					   tim
		climb  again  i cant climb again

grant smiles

					   grant
		sure you can

grant checks out and rejects tree after tree  near the meadow he finds
it  a good basic climbing tree

ext  upper branches of the tree

grant helps lex get comfortable on his lap  timmy tucks himself in
between grants outstretched legs  grant looks out  back to kids

timmy and lex are already snoring  lex turns and hugs grant close to
her  she murmurs in her sleep  grant starts to pat her shoulder when
timmy without waking reaches to her and strokes her hair

int  incubation room laboratory  night

ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope

the dark room is lit by flashlight  battery packs power the microscope
wu paces the room regarding his eggs with dismay  sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them  no thermal sensors

					   wu
		what is taking arnold so long  this room
		is too cold  my eggs will be damaged

ellie swings the lens to wu  not so interested but peers in politely

					   ellie
		no sign of those berries  really
		interesting  there are indications of a
		similar virus in every tissue sample
		but its not in the ground  could i look
		at some of the discarded embryos

wu reluctantly agrees  he opens a cabinet and brings her samples

					   wu
		im sure youll find your virus  or a
		similar one  all animals carry many
		viruses in a dormant condition  its
		almost impossible to say with certainty
		which are the same strains

ellie begins a test on a sample  she adds a reagent and marks up a
slide  as she works

					   ellie
		and yet from what harding tells me many
		of you animals have similar symptoms 
		besides the microvesicles a lack of
		hunger loss of reproductive urges sores
		in the mouth and gums

wu waves his arms

					   wu
		what the hell does harding know  hes a
		veterinarian not a pathologist

back on  control room 

arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
muldoon walks in  muldoon asks hopefully

					   muldoon
		what is it

arnold points to the screen

					   arnold
		thats it

muldoon comes closer

					   muldoon
		thats what

					   arnold
		i found the command to restore the
		original code  it resets the linked
		parameters

					   muldoon
		the fences and the power

					   arnold
		right  and it does something else it
		erases the code lines that refer to it  it
		destroys all evidence it was ever there

					   muldoon
		nedry could steal the eggs get back and
		reset the whole show  no one would ever
		miss him

					   arnold
		watch this

arnold types in a command  the screen flickers and changes  arnold and
muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park

					   arnold
		hot damn

					   muldoon
		are the fences back on

					   arnold
		you bet they are  it will take a few
		seconds to get up to full power because
		weve got fifty miles of fence out there
		and the generator has to feed the
		capacitors along the way  but in a half
		a minute well be back in business

arnold points to the transparent map of the park  on it bright red
lines snake out moving throughout the park as electricity surges
through the fences

					   muldoon
		motion sensors

					   arnold
		got them too   it will be a few minutes
		while the computer counts  then ill
		tell you where grant and the kids are and
		you can go and get them  but every
		things working  half past ten and weve
		got the whole thing back up and running

muldoon picks up a phone shakes his head

					   muldoon
		just hiss

back on  grant and kids in tree 

grant snores  a mosquito buzzes around him  he waves him away and
continues to sleep

muldoon looks at arnold anxiously  arnold looks down

					   arnold
		hmmmm  i dont see them  maybe theyre
		out of range of a sensor

					   muldoon
		shit  i dont know where they are  i
		wish i could go out there   but i havent

		and then im going to turn in myself

wu doesnt need to be told twice  he climbs off his stool

					   wu

into the huge face of a duckbilled hadrosaur a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes  its head moves up through the canopy of the trees  then the
head swoops way down below  and returns to grants level and stares at

lex rides through low brush ducking down as she goes  then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest  she crosses a stream on a log
bridge  light showers down through the branches  the water shimmers
lex in is paradise

behind her grant and timmy shout for her to stop  she waves kicks the
triceratops like its a horse and yells

					   lex
		giddyup

the trike takes off in a rush  it trips over a fallen tree downed by
the storm  the trike takes a spill and lex goes flying

					   lex
		whoa  take is easy

she passes over the trikes head in the air and screams as she flies

					   lex
		i cant swim

she splashes into the stream

timmy first to arrive on the scene dives in heroically  he comes up
sheepish and muddy  and sees lex standing in a foot of water

the baby dinosaur rolls to a stop mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes  it stands up dizzy and out of breath

timmy wipes mud off himself  grant helps the kids out of the water
the baby triceratops follows them  grant yells to the baby trike

					   grant
		go home now  home to freda

					   lex
		oh let him stay  he likes me to ride
		him  he could carry me instead of you
		dr grant  please let him stay

grant shakes his head

					   grant
		go  go away  go  get out of here

the trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on  lex is
heartbroken

					   lex
		will i ever play with him again

grant looks across the field abundantly beautiful in the early morning
he has to keep them going   he points across the field

					   grant
		we gotta get to that motion detector
		its still a ways

lex looks behind her  in the distance more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees  some cool off in a shallow lagoon  they
drink lowering their flat heads meeting their own reflections in the
still water  when they look up again their heads swivel  at the
waters edge a baby hadrosaur ventures out squeaks and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently

ext  off road park  morning

muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot  the compys trail
off in different directions  muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups

a bearded worker follows his party of compys  he looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead  their heads are bent to the ground

a bald worker has reached another cluster of compys  kicking he
scatters them

muldoons tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where nedry was
lost  he sees his stolen red jeep  he rushes to it  on the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher  he opens the door to retrieve it
when he leans in his eye catches the tilted sideview mirror  the
image is of many compys bent over the ground  he comes around yelling

					   muldoon
		i found nedry

in the distance the call is echoed

					   bearded worker off
		i found him

					   bald worker off
		found him

int  hammonds quarters  day

hammond peeks in the door and sees gennaro heavily bandaged dozing on
the couch  gennaros eyes flutter and hammond enters and smiles

					   hammond
		he donald  glad youre awake  i hope
		youre not going to take this little
		mishap you had and hold it against my
		park  it would be terrible if the
		finishing funds were in any way held up

gennaro just grins and shakes his head  hes very high on morphine  he
wants to speak but hammond keeps talking  after each sentence gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod

					   hammond
		you really shouldnt have gotten out of
		the vehicle  the park is actually quite
		safe  a disenchanted worker sabotaged
		some equipment  arnold muldoon and wu
		all loyal employees are righting damage
		as we speak

					   gennaro
		oh good cause i love the park  its
		more than we ever dreamed  those
		brachiosaurs are so big  and those
		spitters 
		    he spits
		 incredible  i only have one problem
		arent we going to have pterodactyls
		    he frowns smacks his forehead
		oh theyd fly away

gennaro looks off watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away
hammond takes out a bag

					   hammond
		take a look at these donald  have you
		seen these  these are great

hammond dumps things out of the bag  they are souvenirs of the park

					   hammond
		windup toys  spitter umbrellas

gennaro is thrilled

					   hammond
		i got some great tshirts  dinosaur
		bingo hey 

hammond leans closer

					   hammond
		wu says he can make a foot high
		triceratops  well sell pets as living
		souvenirs  bioengineered to eat only
		food we sell of course

gennaro cant take it  great idea  he highfives hammond repeatedly

harding enters and gently taps hammond on the shoulder

					   harding
		youll have to bear with him mr hammond
		hes doped to infinity and back

int  incubation room laboratory  day

sunlight pours through the windows  ellie sits with her head in hands
she looks around and wanders the lab  notices a drawer slides it open

xrays  she shuffles through finds some marked freda

ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station  she studies the x
ray  she looks up in surprise   studies it again

the viewing light is snapped off  ellie looks again  wu stands there

					   wu
		who gave you permission 

ellie attacks back

					   ellie
		im here to investigate this park and
		theres plenty you havent told me

					   wu
		thats absurd

					   ellie
		these bones arent fully formed

					   wu
		youre qualified to interpret xrays of
		living dinosaurs  i doubt it  it took
		me many months to learn

					   y
		ill tell you something else freda isnt
		an adult just a huge juvenile

					   wu
		youre making a lot of assumptions here

					   ellie
		right  what the hell is going on wu

they stare at each other in the bright sunlight

					   hammond off
		growth hormones

the two swing around  hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room

					   wu
		she didnt have a right to explore my lab

					   hammond
		lets not argue wu we have a serious
		problem
		    to ellie
		these animals dont last  there is a
		regularity a predictability about when
		they die  its always  very young
		we dont know why  given time im sure
		wu will figure it out  its just 

					   wu
		just some adjustment in the code is
		required

					   hammond
		but there are deadlines  the park opens
		next summer and it requires fullgrown
		specimens  so wu uses growth hormones to
		achieve the desired size in a short
		amount of time  but they all keep dying
		and we dont know how to stop it

ellie and wu stare at hammond  he steps forward  the light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition

					   hammond
		i was going to tell you all this myself
		dr sattler after gennaro stopped
		breathing down my neck  thats why i
		wanted you and dr grant here on my
		island  you have to help me keep the
		dinosaurs alive  wont you please help
		me

										    cut to

in the sky the sun momentarily burns through the clouds 

int  hammonds quarters  day

ellie enters  on the couch gennaro snores lightly  in a chair nearby
harding sleeps a roll of gauze grasped in his hands

ellie walks over to the large model of the park that hammond revealed
she looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park  she picks up the plastic rex examines it drops it back in

she brushes by harding and studies gennaros pasty sleeping face  air
blows in and out of his dry lips  she examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg  it seeps with blood

int control  day

arnold works at his console  hammond and wu lean over his shoulder
ellie bursts in very agitated  hammond looks up

					   ellie
		gennaros losing a lot of blood  he
		needs transfusions  we gotta get a
		rescue helicopter  arnold whats with
		the phones

					   arnold
		ah hell i just cant find it

he sips his coffee and stares blearyeyed at the screen

					   ellie
		find what

					   arnold
		nedry jammed all the communication lines
		he inserted some command a lockout into
		the program code  i cant find it
		because i gave that restore command and
		it erased part of the program listings

					   wu
		so  just reset  shut the system down
		and youll clear the memory  everything
		will be in the normal wakeup mode

					   arnold
		shut the system down

					   wu
		and reset

					   arnold
		ive never done that before  and im
		reluctant to do it  maybe its true all
		systems will come on but maybe they wont

					   ellie
		look there is a sick man here who needs
		medical attention or hell die  four
		people are out there missing in your
		park  we need search teams  we have to
		have a phone or radio

arnold still hesitates

					   ellie
		well

					   arnold
		well its just that the safety systems
		dont function with the computer shut
		down and 

ellie boils over

					   ellie
		 turn the goddamn safety systems off
		cant you get it through your head that
		we have no choice

arnold looks at hammond who now stares out into the park  without
turning hammond nods his consent

					   arnold
		okay

arnold gets up and goes to the main panel  he opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swinglatches over the safety switches  he pops them
off one after another

					   arnold
		you asked for it  and you got it

he throws the master switch

the control room goes black  all monitors go black  arnold wu and
ellie stand in the dark

					   ellie
		how long do we have to wait

					   arnold
		thirty seconds

ext  field in the park 

grant and kids walk through a clearing  lex stops

					   grant
		what is it

					   lex
		i hear something

					   grant
		come on

timmy looks around the morning is still and peaceful branches are
motionless  only a little bird jumps from one branch to another

					   lex
		hear it now

					   timmy
		youre hearing things  come on we gotta
		get back and warn them about the boat

lex hesitates but doesnt want to be left behind  she runs between
grant and timmy  then they all hear it

honking  it comes from the herd of duck bills behind them  first the
honking of a single animal then another animal joins in then another
and another until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry

					   timmy
		whats going on

					   grant
		theyre agitated

the duckbills twist and turn  they hurry out of the water circling the
young ones to protect them

with a roar the trex bursts from the trees just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs

					   lex
		i told you i heard something

the earth shakes  a low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of grant and the kids

					   grant
		outta the way kids run

grant grabs lex lifting her bodily off the ground and carries her like
a football  timmy runs beside them

hadrosaurs run alongside of them  grant hears the crashing of trees
he takes a glance over his shoulder

grants pov  a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction  the hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of grant lex and timmy  they all scream

back on  control room 

the quiet black room  hammond stands by the big window  his pensive
presence affects all in the room

arnold looks at his illuminated watch

					   arnold
		memory should be cleared by now

he pushes the main switch back on  nothing on

					   arnold
		damn

arnold pushes the switch off and then on again  still nothing  he
glances at hammonds back  sweat forms on his brow

					   ellie
		whats wrong

					   arnold
		oh hell  i have to turn the safety switches
		back on before i restart the power

arnold flips on three safeties and covers them again with latch covers
holding his breath he turns on the main power switch

first there is the computer beep  ellie jumps  then relaxes  the
lights come on  the screens hum  hammonds shoulder twitches slightly

					   arnold
		thank god

the room is jubilant  hugs and cheers  ellie picks up a phone

					   ellie
		arnold  theyre still not working

					   arnold
		no it sounds dead but after a reset all
		system modules have to be brought on line
		manually

arnold quickly goes back to work at his console  hammond turns

					   wu
		    to hammond
		arnolds about to get the phones up

arnold pushes the chair back

					   arnold
		okay were up again

ellie grabs the phone back up

					   ellie
		no were not  phones still dead

arnold swings her way

					   arnold
		cant be 

					   hammond
		my god look at this arnold

hammond points to the transparent map  a tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way  moving fast in a kind of swirl

					   ellie
		whats happening

					   arnold
		    tonelessly
		the duckbills

					   wu
		my good god

					   ellie
		what

					   arnold
		its the rex 

					   hammond
		theyve stampeded 

back on  the hadrosaurs  low angle on the stampede 

grant and kids run for their lives  behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed  their enormous bodies charge in a tight group
kicking up dirt rocks whole trees as they thunder along

close on  a charging duckbill as he honks eyes wild with fear

a horrible roar of the trex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot

close on  a huge adult foot almost tramples the infant

frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom  the frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust

grant and lex and timmy run wildly  the stampede is very close behind
grant and the kids faces are covered with sweat and dust

another deafening roar of the trex

grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers
the animals continue to close

close on  the running feet of the stampeding animals  the ground
vibrates every time it is struck by the huge feet

grant and the kids scramble onto the rocks  they frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them  lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks  grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks

grants pov  the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass  another
slams its big tail against the rocks leaving a splash of hot blood

stampeding legs send clods of dirt flying in the air  above even the
birds are running  disoriented they fly frantically along

grant and the kids are enveloped in dust  just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs  bellows of pain as animals wheel and circle

a boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward timmy  he dives out of his
rocky hiding place  the boulder continues on toward grant and lex
they dive after timmy  the group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks  the boulder continues on smashing
the rocky enclave they have just left

grant and the kids huddle and watch the last underbellies oscillate
above them  the stampede goes past  they lie there unable to move
they watch the herd trample on

close on  the rexs foot as it crushes a motion sensor

lex screams  grant and timmy cover her mouth

the trex hunts down the herd  he targets his prey  a young hadrosaur

as the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline the rex lunges
fiercely  the rex and its victim are enveloped in dust

grant holds lex close  she watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror  timmy makes the first move to leave

					   timmy
		lets go  now

the herds remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle

grant lex and timmy run in the opposite direction

back on  control room 

hammond arnold wu and ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears  hadrosaurs scatter

now the rex is calm and quiet  back to camera he gnaws on something

					   hammond
		no  oh no  he make a kill  he killed
		one of my animals  wheres muldoon

					   arnold
		im sorry mr hammond

					   hammond
		my animals  my animals

muldoon enters limping in  hammond is very upset

					   hammond
		where have you been  my rex killed a
		hadrosaur  you should be out there
		doing something

					   muldoon
		i just came to tell you  youre minus
		one computer expert

ext  by the river park  day

the water rushes a few hundred yards away  grant and the kids have
finally rested enough  grant nods to timmy

					   grant
		well walk by the river  that leads back
		to the visitors center

					   lex
		not me  im not walking anymore

					   timmy
		come on lex ill carry you

					   lex
		nope  too scared

timmy looks up at grant  grant kneels down by lex  lex embraces grant

					   grant
		you ready

she wipes her tears

					   lex
		can we go on the raft  then we dont
		have to walk so close to the animals

					   grant
		what raft

lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars  it is
twenty yards away

					   lex
		where i found fredas baby

grant start to stand  hes thinking

					   grant
		its still midmorning  i bet we have at
		least ten miles to go  if we take the
		raft along the river we can make much
		faster progress

					   timmy
		lets do it

int  maintenance building 

grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building  he pushes
past drums of herbicide treepruning equipment spare tires coils of
cyclone fencing huge fertilizer bags stacks of ceramic insulators
empty motoroil cans worklights and cables

					   grant
		lex i dont see any raft

timmy looks at lex  where is it  lex doesnt know

					   timmy
		keep going

grant keeps pushing through bags of cement lengths of copper pipe
piles of green mesh  two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall

					   grant
		bullseye

timmy is relieved  lex smiles

					   lex
		told you

grant grabs them  looks around still 

					   grant
		no raft where did you see it lex

					   lex
		actually i never really saw one just
		assumed

					   grant
		assumed

she nods  grant and timmy resume looking

in the rear of the building  lex walks below a barred window  slats of
light fall on her back  she sees a dark closet door ajar  she brushes
the handle  it swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her knocking her to the ground

lex screams frantically pushing the life preservers off

grants head pops up  timmy runs to her side  she is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers  timmy drops to the ground

					   timmy
		lex  lex  youre okay youre okay

lex is overcome with fear  timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on

					   timmy
		look lex  look

she looks at him realizes and bursts out laughing  timmy laughs with
her  grant joins them  he sits on a box and laughs

					   grant
		im afraid theres no raft

grant gets up  he reaches for the hands of the kids  timmy sees it 
the box grant sat on is labeled raft storage  timmy smiles

at the rivers edge 

grant pulls a cord

with a loud hiss the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette  then with a whopping hisswhap it
pops fully open on the deck a large bright yellow rubber raft

timmy and lex climb in wearing the life preservers  grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars

the small disturbance causes the cicadas to roar  the raft drifts out
into the lagoon  grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks

grant surveys the river

					   grant
		looks pretty calm

thump  the raft stops moving  they are aground  lex looks overboard
she reaches in about elbow deep

grant stands and puts the oars in the water  he pushes with all his
might  there is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor  but it moves  and the raft goes into deep enough water

a general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream

a wide area of the river 

grant energetically works the oars

close on  lex lets her hand trail in the water

					   lex
		ill row dr grant

					   grant
		no

but hes sweating and takes a moment to rest  lex looks down at her
hand in the water  it still trails

					   lex
		hey were still moving

grant looks into the water  shes right

					   grant
		theres a current

grant lays back against the rubber gunwales closes his eyes  the two
kids look at him

					   lex
		you cant sleep

					   grant
		    eyes closed
		im not sleeping yet

					   lex
		ill do it

lex picks up the oars and begins

					   timmy
		we gotta warn them about the boat

grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky  he sighs and
takes up the oars again  he rows powerfully with the current

a bend in the river 

current picks up speed  the water begins to rush and roar

					   timmy
		cool

white foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids  they burst out
laughing  grant smiles at them but there is concern in his eyes

another bend 

now the raft is really racing  the kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked  white water crashed over drenching the kids  when grant takes
a moment to look he is soaked by a huge wave

the raft tosses right and left  timmy holds the rubber grips  hes
yanked to one side  hes knocked to the raft floor  quickly gets his
grip again  shouts to grant

					   timmy
		thought is looked calm

					   grant
		guess i was wrong

grant looks ahead  the river widens  the raft really starts to fly

lex gripping very tightly looks out  water sprays her again and
again  her face is serious

					   lex
		i cant swim

grant grabs the rafts tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings
he lashes it around lex and timmy  then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips

					   grant
		hold on real tight

they go flying down the river  the roar deafens

the raft lifts out of the water  and crashes down rocking every way

jagged rocks appear  grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline  the kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees

grant looks ahead  he blanches

his pov  the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall

theyre almost there  at the huge waterfall water rushes violently
heaving over the magnificent precipice

timmy tries to tighten lexs vest but is thrown back down   he yells

					   timmy
		hold my hand  hold my hand when we go

the raft spins in the rushing water  everyone is thrown around

the rope holding the kids to the raft tautens the oars are wrestled out
of grants hands and go flying through the air spilling over the edge

at the last moment grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade
with all his might he stands and holds his balance long enough to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch

they stop right at the waterfalls edge

grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch  but the water keeps
rushing  his strength ebbs

					   timmy
		dont let go

grants veins pop out in his arms  his hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark  lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip

the rubber raft jumps and leaps below him  water pours into the raft
lex tries fruitlessly to let it out  timmy holds down grants feet

					   timmy
		you can do it

					   grant
		im trying  im trying  ooooo 

his hands slipping slipping 

					   grant
		no

										    cut to

close on  the trex face down in the mud

int  control room  afternoon

arnold wu muldoon and ellie stare raptly at the monitor

					   muldoon
		sonofabitch  hes taking a nap
		hasnt been this well fed  ever

hammond is above in his throne  he calls down

					   hammond
		could he drown in that position  thats
		a very valuable animal

					   muldoon
		i know its a valuable animal

muldoon takes a step up toward hammonds throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth  in the foreground wu calls arnold over

					   wu
		whats that john

wu points to the screen behind arnolds head  in the upper righthand
corner it blinks a yellow warning  aux pwr low  ellie regards it

					   ellie
		you running on auxiliary power

					   arnold
		im not

					   wu
		looks like you are

					   arnold
		cant be

					   wu
		print the system status log

arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys  in the corner a printer whirs to
life  moments later it spins out a single page  arnold tears it off

ellie continues to stare at the screen  it now flashes red  aux pwr
fail  an alarm klaxon blares

hammond holds his ears against the noise  he stands up

the room lights begin to flash  theyre reflected in hammonds eyes
hammond roars above the chaos

					   hammond
		what the hell is going on

onscreen numbers begin to count backward from ten  hammond lurches
at zero the lights go off the monitors even the computer  just the
alarms keep screaming

					   hammond
		youre ruining my ordered precise park

arnold ignores him keeps pressing buttons  hammond rushes toward
arnold  arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise  hammond screams

					   hammond
		fix my park arnold  fix it

arnold crosses his hands in front of his face blocking hammonds
attack  hammond grabs arnolds wrists and the two twirl to the ground
breathing heavily hammond clutches his hand to his own chest

arnold stands up brushes off  he puts himself together looks at
hammond  he shouts over the siren

					   arnold
		i know its hard i know its hard but
		im going to put it all back together for
		you  i promise  i will

back on raft at waterfall 

grant still clings to the overhanging branch holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall  lex and timmy hold onto his legs

the roar of the water diminishes  and the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river  and then to a gentle stream  a trickle
nothing

grant slowly relaxes lets go  so do the children  around the raft
the water level begins to drain  gradually grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water  around them
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water

					   lex
		the waterfall stopped

					   timmy
		waterfalls arent supposed to stop

					   grant
		i think they cut the power  hey 

he points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured  theres a shimmering rainbow and beyond that in the mist
is the visitors center

					   grant
		well theres our pot of gold  lets go
		kids

they grab his hands and clamber out of the raft running toward shore

back on control room 

muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark

in a hot corner ellie squats over a prostate hammond mopping his brow
with a cool cloth  he murmurs only barely intelligible

					   hammond
		told him fix my park fix my park

wu brings the printout to arnold  the printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart  it is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power  wu yells above the alarm

					   wu
		you shut down as six thirtyfour this
		morning and when you started back up it
		was with auxiliary power

					   arnold
		jesus  the auxiliary generator fires up
		first and then thats used to start the
		main generator because it needs a heavy
		charge  the main generator has to be
		manually reset

					   wu
		outside  in the generator building

arnold nods  muldoon points to a line in the printout

063522   warning fence status nb  operative  aux power

					   muldoon
		this doesnt mean the fences have been
		off since sixthirty does it

arnold grabs the paper looks at it slams it down

					   arnold
		backup power doesnt generate enough
		amperage to power the electrified fences
		so they were automatically kept off
		thats also why we had no phones or
		radio

					   muldoon
		all of the fences

					   arnold
		yes

					   muldoon
		including the velociraptor mesh

					   arnold
		    disgusted exhausted
		yes yes yes

in the corner hammond lifts his head and ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position

					   hammond
		do you mean those raptors could be loose

					   arnold
		im afraid so

					   muldoon
		no no way  last time it took em two
		days to chew through that mesh  but give
		em enough time theyll get out  we
		better get that power on now

					   hammond
		regardless check the pit  make sure
		there five of them there

ext  visitors center  afternoon

muldoon and arnold run across the lawn  muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position  in the distance the alarm still sounds
lights flash a continued warning

they reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed  its

familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms  the closer they
approach the louder and brighter these alarms are  grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building obscuring everything

					   arnold
		whats that steam coming out of my
		generator room

					   muldoon
		relax its just refrigerated air
		theres a leaky cooling pipe  i fixed it
		a couple times before but the original
		installation was at too sharp an angle

arnold accepts this  he is about to enter when muldoon instructs him

					   muldoon
		just go and turn on your generator then
		get right back to the control room

arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steamshrouded door

ext  raptor pit  afternoon

muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight  the thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open  with heavy gun
in one hand muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit  its empty

muldoon looks up

muldoons pov  the dense forest surrounding the visitors center

muldoon examines the ground  he locates the raptor prints leading away

muldoon breaks into a run

intext  generator room  afternoon

muldoon comes back to the generator room still running fulltilt  he
kicks open the door  steam pours out  standing in the thick steam
muldoon yells for arnold  no answer  he steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around

muldoons pov  only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam

muldoon yells again  no answer at all  muldoon curses and leaves

as soon as muldoon is gone there is movement  even above the sirens
an animalistic breathing grunting can be heard  obscured by steam and
flashing lights a reptilian claw clutches a shadow  a pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground spilling out on the floor

int  control room  afternoon

muldoon enters and confronts hammond ellie and wu

					   muldoon
		raptors chewed their way out  all five
		are out there

					   ellie
		arnolds not with you

muldoon looks around grimly  he shakes his head

					   muldoon
		i was hoping he was back here already

hammond takes charge

					   hammond
		this is why my quarters were specially
		fortified  to assist in an emergency just
		like this one  lets go  muldoon round
		up the workers  theyll go with us too

muldoon stares at hammond then drops it  they prepare to go

					   ellie
		wait  what about arnold

ext  hillside park 

grant and the kids come over the hill  timmy sees the big fence and the
visitors center close behind

					   timmy
		were home

lex and grant happily run down the hill

ext  electrified fence in park  afternoon

grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence
this huge fence is much higher than what timmy has had to climb  grant
turns to him apologetically

					   grant
		sorry tim  we gotta climb up

					   tim
		thats all right dr grant  you owe me
		one

ext  hammonds quarters  afternoon

wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
hammonds quarters  next to him is ellie  behind both of them
launcher at the ready is muldoon  watching from the window above
hammond waves  ellie and wu wear radio headsets

					   muldoon
		okay wu ill have you covered at every
		moment  but this shell carries quite a
		punch so if youre too close itll take
		a piece of you  ellies on the headset
		with you  if another ones come at you
		let her know  then ellie  you start
		jumping and yelling  the buggers are
		easily distracted  theyll come running
		and let wu get that power on  then both
		of you get behind this fence as quick as
		possible

wu and ellie nod seriously and test radio contact  we starts his way
across the lawn muldoon limps behind with his launcher  ellie stands
ready at the open gate

wu takes slow steps  muldoon follows  wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building

close on  wus tense face

the attack is sudden and fierce  it comes from the brush  the raptor
leaps onto wu in an instant  wu and the raptor roll on the ground  wu
struggles for his life  muldoon cant get a safe shot  he scream

					   muldoon
		wu get away  give me room to shoot

ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate  she jumps up and
down waving her hands and screams

					   ellie
		hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur you cant
		catch me  hey come and get me you
		flatsnouted mongolian beast  hey

the raptor is distracted by this  he lets wu go for a moment shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws  instantly wu rolls away  muldoon
fires the rocket launcher  with a sizzle the missile fires  boom
direct hit  the raptor is blown to tiny pieces

muldoon grabs wu and pulls the injured man to safety

					   muldoon
		you ok

in reply wu gets to his feet looks where the raptor was

					   wu
		now theres four

muldoon helps wu back inside the fence  he waves for ellie to come in
and join them

ellie takes off toward the generator building  she yells

					   ellie
		im going in  muldoon cover the door
		after i go in  wu guide me

muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan

ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn  shes very fast and
graceful  she ducks into the generator building

above it all hammond watches at the small viewing window

back on  grant and kids at fence

the three are at the top of the fence now  grant carefully lifts lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down  grant grabs tim and lifts him next  tims tense
face is a river of sweat

int  generator building 

ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall
her face is lit by a flashing yellow light  she bangs her head on a
pipe  she rubs her head

					   ellie
		damn i banged my head

					   wu over radio
		oh thats good that must be the water
		pipe  youre really close now theres a
		cabinet just above your head  reach up
		and open it  the handle turns to the
		left

ellie turns the handle  the cabinet opens

					   wu over radio
		its a large throwswitch  pull it down
		count to three and push it back up
		thats all there is to it

ellie throws it down  she counts

					   ellie

grant and timmy jump down  lex is just behind  her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern  she pulls on it

back on ellie 

					   ellie

she throws the large switch back

back on lex 

she jumps off the fence  her sneaker comes off falls to the ground

camera pushes in on lex  it celebrates her narrow escape

grant casually leans against the fence to help lex with her shoe
nothing  still no electric fences

the visitors center is in sight  they all turn to each other  elated

					   lex
		we did it

					   tim
		we made it

lex jumps up and down  grant smiles highfives timmy

back on ellie 

the siren and the flashing lights stop  the room lights go on  ellie
turns to go back upstairs  her foot slips she falls to the ground
she has slipped on a pool of blood  she jumps up recoils

its arnold  she squelches a scream covering her own mouth

smash  ellie screams as a raptor lunges at her   he jumps down from
above the water pipe ellie banged her head on

ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft  she dives into it
the raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall

ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and using her legs to push
against the wall begins to climb up

the raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside  ellie
scrambles up  the raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned

ellie continues her scramble up the shaft  at ground level she slams
her feet hard against a vent popping it open  scraping the wall and
banging against pipes she races toward the door

ext  generator building  continuing action

ellie runs fulltilt toward the fence surrounding hammonds quarters
wu injured lies within the safety of the fenced area  muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for ellie
ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn

					   ellie
		raptor

the raptor explodes through the door of the generator building after
ellie

muldoon fires at the raptor misses  no time to reload

the raptor gains on ellie  muldoon ducks inside the fences heavy gate
he slides the gate halfshut waving ellie on

ellie dives inside the safety of the fence losing her headset as she
goes  the gate is almost closed  the raptor lunges

muldoon slides shut the heavy gate bashing the raptors head with all
his might  the raptor shudders caught in the gate  stunned for a
second it doesnt move

ellie and muldoon run to the building  they push open the steelclad
security door and dive inside  wu limping chases after them  with a
curse muldoon pushes the door back open waves for wu

ellie and muldoons pov  wu runs frantically  the raptor jerks out of
the gate inside of the fence  he races after wu

					   wu
		keep it open  im coming

wu runs faster  the raptor gains on him  wu screams runs spastically
wu and the raptor are neckandneck equally close to the open door

					   ellie
		come on wu  come on  run

the raptor is inches from wu  both are closer and closer to the door

					   ellie
		theyre coming inside

					   wu
		help

wu and the raptor are at the door

					   muldoon
		no theyre not ellie

muldoon slams the door shut on wu and the raptor  wus screams are
horrific

int  hammonds quarters  continuing action

ellie drops to her knees her chest heaving pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand  muldoon affected turns to her

					   muldoon
		i couldnt compromise everyones safety

ellie nods catches her breath

					   ellie
		why didnt the power go on

					   muldoon
		you just reset the power  now the
		computer has to be booted

muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security door

muldoons pov  there is already almost no sign of wu  the gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut  the raptor looks up  he is trapped within
the perimeter fence of hammonds quarters

camera slowly tilts to the viewing window above  hammond stares down

int  visitors center 

grant and kids walk through the open security doors  all is empty and
quiet  they call out but there are no answers

					   lex
		where did everybody go

grant thinks

					   grant
		probably your grandfathers quarters
		lets go

a distant bellow  grant reconsiders

					   grant
		actually stay here

he corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the gift shop

					   lex
		no i want to stay with you

grant looks around tensely

					   grant
		no keep an eye on things round here for
		me  ill be back with the others

					   timmy
		what about 

grant looks at timmy

					   grant
		ill radio the ship as soon as i find
		somebody  beat  youre in charge now
		dont move from here  unless you have
		to ok

timmy nods  lex is happy sinks to the floor

					   lex
		goody  im gonna rest

she finds a box of windup dinosaur toys she winds one sends it
walking to timmy

					   timmy
		tired  he carried you the whole way

grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the trex and raptor in combat  he looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor  he shouts back

					   grant
		be right back

int  hammonds quarters 

its a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of hammond  gennaro is
singing at the top of hislungs while harding tries to restrain him
scared workers huddle together many are injured  hammond sits on the
floor in a meditative trance

ellie and muldoon stare out the window

their pov  the raptor is jumping in the air  with every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building

muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully

					   ellie
		why dont you just nail that bastard

					   muldoon
		no more ammo  i requisitioned six
		charges but the beancounter 
		    he thrusts a finger at hammond
		 cut it down to two

ellie looks up to the ceiling  there is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun

ext  the anne b at sea  day

the ship continues along smooth sunlit sea  land is in distant sight

int  stateroom 

the cracked egg is nudged open  the cute scaly head of a sixinch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell  it shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the remaining eggs

										    cut to

close on  the windup dinosaur skitters across the polished floor  it
bands against the  the wall again and again

timmy looks down at it and smiles at lex

					   lex
		any candy behind the counter

					   timmy
		hungry

					   lex
		starved

timmy looks behind the counter  he sees boxes of goods  he moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way  lex gets up and pulls one out

					   timmy
		nothing

					   lex
		lets go to the kitchen

she smiles and pops to her feet  timmys not sure

					   timmy
		dr grant said 

					   lex
		 lets go  well come right back

close on  timmys torn face  hes hungry too

he makes the right decision

					   timmy
		nope  were waiting here till dr grant
		gets back  hell help us get some 

interrupted by a sound  a rhythmic horrible breathing   now some
light and rapid steps  and a sniffing  its definitely an animal

lex backs off in a hurry she knocks the umbrella over  it skirts
across the floor  it spins and opens by itself  printed on it is the
ferocious face of the spitter the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop

the breathing gets closer and closer  the children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop  they scream

its a raptor lean and ferocious  more like a cyborg than a hunter it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance  his eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat

timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs  he winds one up and sends it off
across the hall  the raptor glances over at the moving toy  timmy
grabs another whispers as he winds it

					   timmy
		start winding now

lex and timmy wind toy after toy send them across the hall  the raptor
leaps crushing one in its jaws  others waddle by  the raptor dodges
and darts grabbing this one smashing that one

the kids go running out into the hall  they race down the visitor
center corridor  timmy pulls lex behind him toward the restaurant

					   lex
		where are we going

					   tim
		the kitchen

intext  hammonds quarters 

with a huge leap the raptor finally makes it to the roof of hammonds
quarters  he jumps lightly onto the skylight  glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below  total commotion and screams

the raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight  below they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners  ellie turns to muldoon

					   ellie
		how long

					   muldoon
		well they seem to be getting faster all
		the time i would say  fifteen minutes

ellie notices something out the window  its grant approaching the
gate  she hammers on the glass

grants hand reaches for the knob

the raptor stops gnawing its ears perked up

ellie screams and screams

grant notices some of wus remains inside the gate  he stops and looks
up  at the window ellie waves her arms warning him not to enter
grant stops  he sees wus headset on the grass reaches through the
fence grabs it puts it on

ellie jumps up and gets her headset  she barks into it

					   ellie
		theres a raptor on the roof of this
		building  open that gate and youre a
		dead man

grant stares up at ellie in the window  he waves  she presses her hand
to the glass

					   grant
		ellie im go glad 

					   ellie
		shut up and listen  we have about
		fifteen minutes here  the computer has
		to be rebooted  thatll turn on the
		electric fences  besides the raptor
		stuck in here with us there are four
		more 

grant races back to the visitors center as she continues to fill him in

int  kitchen visitors center  continuing action

the kids hurtle through this huge industrial kitchen  the kitchen is a
maze of turns from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area  the kids
dart and duck from one area to the next taking shortcuts under tables
crawling behind counters scattering pots and pans behind

relentlessly with a casual speed the raptor stalks them  it avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts it just continues around

timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer  lex starts to
hurry inside  timmy grabs her

					   timmy
		well freeze to death in there

					   lex
		hes going to eat us

timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile of steaks  he tosses one
toward the raptor  the raptor gobbles it in one bite  timmy shoves lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor  one after the
other he tosses them in a row closer and closer to the open freezer

the raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks following their path  he
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of tims bait

tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut  lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of timmys

					   timmy
		push

the heave and the lock catches on the door  from inside there is a
strangled cry and the door is slammed repeatedly  the metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break  the door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give

the kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor  in just a moment
timmy is back on his feet

					   lex
		what is it timmy

					   timmy
		i just remembered something  raptors are
		born in large litters  theres probably
		more coming  we gotta hide

he grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen
theres a stairway and they race up

int  gift shop 

grant wearing his headset calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern  he sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys  he sees some animal scales on the floor  he hears a noise above
and begins to run

int  upper floor hallway visitors center 

the kids hear this noise too and its closer to them  they bust into 

int  amber room laboratory 

the kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room

int  extraction room laboratory 

automated drills whir as tim and lex crash through knocking equipment
to the ground  the drills still whir on the ground

int  genetics room 

the hamachihood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by

int  incubation room laboratory 

the kids slide into this room  they race to its far corner past
incubators and display cases of chemicals  they look back and see 

kids pov  a raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs  hes
been in this room their place of refuge the whole time

close on  the raptors glistening eyes register the children

he begins to stalk  the kids scream  this time there is nowhere to go

the raptor closes in on the kids  timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister

close on  the raptor licks its lips lizardlike

at the other end of the room grant enters quickly  he surveys the
situation  quickly he grabs an egg off a table  he reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with poison warnings prominently displayed  he
comes out with a syringe and a vial

the raptor is almost on the kids  grant coughs conspicuously  the
raptor whirls studies grant  he looks back at the children

grant speaks into the headset

					   grant to radio
		talk ellie just keep talking

he tosses the headset on the ground  ellies voice crackles out  the
raptor studies it transfixed

grant injects the egg then gently rolls it on the ground  the raptor
forgets the headset  he comes forward and sniffs the egg then sucks it
up swallowing it whole

the raptor turns back to the kids  he takes two steps toward them
tenses to pounce  and keels over  dead

the kids race around the dead raptor to grant  grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room  grant addresses timmy as they run

					   grant
		timmy you know anything about computers

					   timmy
		well i just got an xt at home  i told
		my dad i wanted a 386

					   grant
		ok good youre elected

int  control room 

grant and tim and lex study the quiet room  grant speaks calmly into
his headset

					   grant to radio
		okay weve reached the computer room
		who can tell timmy how to reboot

					   ellie over radio
		ah alan nobody here knows how to boot
		the computer  please hurry weve only
		got a couple minutes left

					   grant
		tim you got to book the system  they
		reset the power and there are no phones
		we gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
		stop that ship

					   lex
		are they going to be ok

					   grant
		if we can get help very soon

					   timmy
		sshh you guys im thinking

he studies a grid on a large console  he reaches out and touches a part
of the screen  there is a beep and a warning sign  invalid argument
please try again

back on  hammonds quarters 

the raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars  panic below
in the middle of it all ellie is focused listening on her headset

back on  control room 

timmy tries something else  beep  lex raises a hand  grant stops her

					   grant to radio
		ellie were working as fast as we can
		here

timmy tries a screen section  beep  again beep  again  beep  beep

timmy shakes his head  in desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen  he punches the escape button

the screen lights up a new message  system reset completed  all
systems normal

back on  hammonds quarters 

the raptor has just chewed through  he squeezes his body into the space
as the bars electrify  spastically the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him  he cant get out

finally with a whimper he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created  with a thump he drops to the floor below

ellie muldoon hammond and the workers look on in shock

back on  control room 

grant cheers and hugs timmy  lex whoops

					   ellie on radio
		ok were all right here for now
		thanks

					   grant to radio
		dont mention it  it was timmy

					   ellie on radio
		but theres still one more raptor  so be
		careful

timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now
communications  radio  vehicular   he gets the one he wants

he indicates the radiomike to grant

					   tim
		i think this is the boat  they called it
		the queen anne or something

grant grabs the mike

					   grant
		queen anne do you read me  queen anne

the radio crackles to life

					   radio
		this is the queen anne b  i copy
		whats up

					   grant
		report your position

					   radio
		ah were just about to dock here in
		puntaremas  who wants to know  please
		identify yourself

tim punches the screen which displays farrell frederick d capt
grant reads it and nods  his voice is tough as nails

					   grant
		try this for identification captain
		farrell  you are in possession of stolen
		biological materials  if you dont turn
		that boat around and return to isla
		nublar immediately with your contraband
		cargo you will be found in violation of
		section 509 of the uniform maritime act
		you will be subject to revocation of
		license penalties in excess of fifty
		thousand dollars and five years in jail
		do you copy

silence

					   grant
		do you copy captain farrell

					   radio
		i copy  all ahead stern

a blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor  grant nods to timmy who terminates the radio contact

					   timmy
		whats the uniform maritime code

					   grant
		who the hell knows

grant and timmy start to celebrate again when lex interrupts

					   lex
		what good does that do  to have the ship
		turn around

grant turns to her seriously

					   grant
		well it gives us ten more hours
		    to timmy
		lets see if we can raise the costa rican
		coast guard on that thing

the last raptor smashes into the control room through hammonds viewing
window  glass goes flying  grant and kids go running into the hallway

int rotunda 

with the raptor in hot pursuit the kids and grant come flying  tim and
lex jump over the railing leaping onto the skeletal display  grant
goes for the stairs jumping down them three at a time

the raptor goes after the kids scrambling over the balcony onto the
display  the kids scamper down the display knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go  the raptor is just one beat
behind and his snarling face is splashed with red paint as he chases

the kids burrow into the rib cage of the rex  they break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor  the raptor is undeterred
closing the gap on the kids

the kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage  its closed off by the
skeleton and they cant break through  theyre imprisoned  the raptor
is pushing through the rib cage bones crackling as it goes

grant leaps up the scaffolding grabs a beam swings his weight onto it
and slams it into the trexs neck  the neck shatters and the massive
head of the trex drops free

it falls directly onto the last raptor squashing him flat  dead

					   grant
		    grimly
		and then there were none

ext  helicopter pad  dusk

muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter  two workers carry
gennaro on a stretcher  ellie boards with the kids on each side of her
holding her hands

grant and hammond walk together toward the helicopter

					   hammond
		dr grant dont abandon this beautiful
		place  i need a man just like you to
		help me get my park back on its feet
		again  and it will be on its feet again

					   grant
		we have to leave now

hammond stops

					   hammond
		oh you dont know  there are wonderful
		plans in the works sites already
		purchased for eurojurassic and jurassic
		japan

grant is unimpressed  he holds a hand out to hammond  hammond tries a
new approach

					   hammond
		dont you see ive exalted human
		potential here  you must see it  you
		must feel it  i called back a life form
		listen dr grant dont go  be a part
		of this  im inviting you to do just
		that  let the others go if they want

					   grant
		you interrupted natural law  there are
		regulations rules that nature follows
		that make her knowable

					   hammond
		you mean there are rules that nature
		follows that create barriers to our
		knowledge

					   grant
		barriers  like the seasons  the earth
		spinning orbiting the sun  the entire
		solar system in interlocking motion  our
		own beings in biological step with it
		all  mr hammond youve disrupted the
		pattern and look what its done

					   hammond
		i know what its done  ive made
		triceratops and gallimimus and a trex
		ive got a batch of iguanadons being born
		on tuesday  what do you say to that

					   grant
		dont count on it  now get in

grant jumps in the copter holds out a hand to hammond

					   grant
		you created mutant forms that you further
		mutated to create amusement attractions
		you made biological puppets with
		heartbeats and an early death sentence

					   hammond
		i created genetic miracles

					   grant
		you created a park to generate a profit
		making merchandising operation

					   hammond
		the merchandise is just a byproduct
		souvenirs for people to reflect on the
		wonder  you fainted when you saw the
		brachiosaur  alan look lets not
		argue  the problem is that my employees
		were not up to par with my dream  they
		failed me  the park i promise you is
		safe  it really is

grant grabs hammonds arm starts to tug

					   grant
		you park is doomed  now come with me

					   hammond
		it is not  its blooming  in the throes
		of labor  you are one more more negative
		voice in a universe of negativity
		youll amount to nothing  youll be a
		bonebrusher all your life  i pity you

hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the rotors start up  hammonds suit whips in the wind  grant calls to
him reaching out his arm

					   grant
		come back mr hammond  its over

hammond keeps walking  he disappears over a grassy knoll

grants outstretched hand drops to his side when the attack comes

with a huge bellow the trex comes charging at the helicopter  the
pilot screams for all to board as he starts to lift off

the rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape  the
copter angles dangerously as the rex holds on

ellie fires a fireextinguisher into the furious face of the rex and its
jaws relax  the copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky
the rex paws after it then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail

the tail swishes through the air and cracks against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops  the pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air

with a roar of its own the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars
away leaving an angry trex alone  unnoticed by the frustrated rex
hammond slips away and walks into the jungle

in the copter 

slowly pan the exhausted faces of muldoon and his workers lex and timmy
holding onto each other and grant huddles next to ellie  he reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder  she reaches up and pulls his
arm close

					   ellie
		theyre so beautiful  theyre condemned
		arent they  even those embryo fragments
		had the same viral contamination

					   grant
		i have a theory

ellie looks up in surprise  she give him a big smile

					   ellie
		you have a theory

grant smiles back at her

					   grant
		i think that they could never completely
		isolate the dinosaur dna  there was
		always some microscopic mosquito
		contamination  but at the molecular
		level that was enough  every dinosaur
		received the same genetic massage the
		encoding that every mosquito gets to
		terminate life after a season

					   ellie
		so the very process itself was flawed

shes sad  grant hugs her  over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island  a green jewel in a blue sea  suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds

camera pans away and swoops down from the copter  it crosses the sky
the camera descends to isla nublar slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle

in the jungle  magic hour

hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth  he
almost reaches the top when he slips  he falls to the soft ground and
rolls he tumbles helplessly rolling and spinning down the sharp drop
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water  face
down his head splashes into the puddle  no movement just the sound of
labored breath

camera pans to hammonds hand halfsubmerged in water  camera moves
into extreme closeup as a mosquito lands on his hand

								 rack out and dissolve to

ext  ocean  night

the army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the queen anne b
slowly drifting across the moonlit water

										    fade out
