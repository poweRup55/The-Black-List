	a speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of isla sorna


2 	ext boat  day 							2

	illegal costa rican parasail operator enrique cardoso helps
	americans ben hildebrand and twelveyearold eric kirvy 
	already wearing lifevests  strap themselves into a two
	person parasail harness


3 	ext boat  day 							3

	ben and eric clamber onto a makeshift platform that hangs over
	the back of the board dangling from bens neck is a camcorder

				ben
		you make sure to get us as close as you can
		okay if its a good trip ill give you a 
		little extra 

				enrique
		dont worry i take you close but not too 
		close
			rubbing erics head
		you dont want them to eat you

	enrique heads toward the drivers seat and a large secondhand
	winch bolted to the deck

				enrique contd
		ready amigos

	ben and eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action

	enrique jams the down the throttle down and with a loud raor the
	speedboat shoots forward soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean

	strapped together ben and eric lean back over the passing
	water intently watching for enriques signal

	as the boat picks up speed enrique eyes the speedometer

	ben grabs the end of the ripcord attached to the harness he and
	eric braces themselves

	enrique finally signals with a pulling motion he pulls
	the winch ben yanks the cord and  

	wooosh a brightly colored parasail blossoms behind the boat
	hoisting ben and eric aloft in a big block letters on the
	parasail is stitched dinosoar

	the townline unsold rapidly from its enormous reel

	ben and eric climb higher and higher

	enrique keeps an eye on the clients when they reach a certain 
	height he locks off the reel

	high overhead ben and eric are floating in wonderful quiet
	splendor the motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant

	down below the boat enters a think blanket of fog

	eric points excitedly at the islands as ben films him with the
	camera

	then a sudden tug on the thing line cause ben to drop the camera
	which now dangles from his neck

				eric
		what was that

	a second tugand now the faintest of screams

	ben and eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of fog

	by the time the boat emerges on the far side of the misttheir
	is no sign of enrique the deck is splattered with blood

	as ben considers the driverless boat

				eric contd
		ben

	ben glances over at eric staring in horror at something 
	below following his gaze ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into a large reef

	sticking out of the water the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves

	as the boat smashes into the reef it splinters into a
	number of pieces

	a panicked ben turns to eric

				ben
		unclip your line

	eric and ben frantically unclip their lines catching an
	updraft the parasailers float upward

	a strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of isla sorna


4 	ext suburban backyard  day 					4

	two plastic dinosaurs enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a childs ferocious sounds

				child os

		rrrrrow grrrrrr

	winder to reveal 

	charlie a threeyear old boy plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs alan grant squats next to him and
	watches with great delight

	ellie satler stands over them an infant in her arms  a
	picture of the perfect family

				grant
		oh actually charlie those two are
		herbivores they wouldnt be interested in
		fighting each other but these
			picking up two other dinosaurs
		see these are carnivores and this one here
		 see its claws  this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent…

	as grant demonstrates with some grunt and groans of his
	own he only succeeds in frightening the boy

				ellie
			interrupting
		uh alan


				grant
		hmm

				ellie
		hes three why dont you wait till hes a
		little older


				grant
		oh right
			back to charlie
		happy dinosaurs

	he bounces them along the sandbox edge

	then the sound of a car engine turning off and a door
	slamming is heard

				ellie
		that must be mark
			calling out
		mark we’re back here

	ellie and grant turn to see 

mark degler coming through the gate carrying a briefcase hes their age handsome but not annoyingly so with a friendly
	balance demeanor

	he and ellie kiss tenderly on the lips

				ellie contd
		good day

				mark
		keeping the world safe
			re baby
		here let me take her

	ellie hands off the baby

				ellie
		mark this is alan grant

				mark

		you

	the two men shake hands and we now realize it is grant
	who is the stranger in this household little charlie runs to
	his father showing his dinosaur

				charlie
		daddy this is a herbabore

	grant smiles uncomfortably a third wheel


5 	int dining room  night 					5

the bird with a cookie holding a it just out of reach

				grant
		whats my name come on jack say it is my
		name alan say my name

		the bird doesnt respond

				grant contd

				ellie
		sorry alan its been six years

	grant shrugs gives jack the cookie and heads towards the table
	the three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee the
	the children have been out to bed

	an awkward moment of silence uncomfortable smiles then 

				mark
		more coffee

				ellie
			relived
		yes great

	mark stands and collects their cups

				ellie contd
		so marks working at the state department
		now

				grant
		really 
to mark
what do you do there

				mark
			with mock bravado
		i could tell you about it but than id have to
		kill you

				grant
		indeed

	mark smiles nodding then he goes into the kitchen another
	uncomfortable silence

				ellie
	so what are you working on now

				grant

	we have a new site in montana at least until
	the money runs out

				ellie
		anything good

				grant
		raptors mostly

				ellie
		my favorite

	grant leans forward realizing ellies one of the few people he
	can talk to about this

				grant
		you remember the sounds they made

				ellie
		i try not to

				grant
		weve done cranial scans and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber i have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence the way they can work
		together as a team

				ellie
		you think they could talk to each other

				grant
		to a degree we never imagined

	and from the cage in the corner of the room

				jack
		bullshit

	both look back at the parrot ellie smiles

				ellie
		you taught him that


6 	ext suburban street  night 					6

	ellie and grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway

				ellie
		good luck with the fund raising

				grant
		it was never easy but before jurassic park
		you could find money somewhere now fossils
		are out everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur

				ellie
		times change alan but youre the still the
		best i mean that

				grant
		the last of my breed

	a long moment passes between them as both consider where
	theyve ended up

				grant contd
		id better get going

				ellie
		let me know if i can help alan you’re bad
		about asking for help but please ask me
		anything anytime

				grant
			deep down knowing he never
			 will
		okay goodbye ellie

				ellie
		goodbye alan

	not sure what the right thing to do is they finally end up with
	a friendly hug they keep it short

	grant gets in his car starts the engine

	hes about to pull off when ellie knocks on the window he rolls
	it down

				ellie contd
		when i met you i thought that one day
		millions of years ago all the dinosaurs
		became extinct wiped out but you told me
		otherwise when conditions changed
		dinosaurs changed they became other things
		they evolved

				grant
		a wellaccepted theory

				ellie
			simply
		alan dont be afraid to evolve

	grant hears her but ellie knows it didnt really get through
	a forced halfsmile than grant waves goodbye

	ellie watches as he drives off


7 	int auditorium  day 						7

	the last stop on grants fundraising tour its a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation there are scientists and
	students here but also a lot of dinofans some even with
	costumes

	grant finishes his speech to what was a full house  some
	attendees are grabbing their coats and sneaking out this
	wasnt the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting

	a new slide comes up just black and white and indecipherable

				grant
		its through the painstaking study of the
		interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate that
		lets us theorize  theorize mind you  that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird
		like vocalizations which as you can
		imagine would be a tremendous breakthrough

	hes finished but no one seems to notice at first then the
	sympostum leader stands up leading a smattering round of
	applause

				sympostium leader
		thank you very much dr grant now does
		anyone have a question

	nearly every hand goes up grant doesnt seem surprised

				grant
		does anyone have a question that doesnt 
		relate to jurassic park

	quite a few hands go down

				grant contd
		or the incident in san diego which ill
		remind you i did not witness

	now most of the hands are down picking one of the few
	remaining

				male student
		your theory on raptors is good and all but
		isnt all this conjecture kind of moot

	the students buddy nods in agreement

				male student contd
		i mean once the un and costa rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves

				tooclever science reporter
		isnt paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction

	recognizing those as fighting words the symposium leader is
	about to step in but grant will take this himself

				grant
		no and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago
		whats left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover
								   more

				grant contd
		what john hammond and ingen created are
		theme park monsters nothing more nothing
		less

		the class clearly disagrees with his assessment

				another student
		youre saying you wouldnt want to study
		them if you had the chance

				grant
		no force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island


8 	int derelict cockpit  day 					8

	looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass


9 	ext aircraft graveyard  day 					9

	nash a wry intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane finished he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane

	we now see that red teeth are painted on the crafts nose it
	looks absurdly like some angry beast

	we are one the edge of a dry lake bed part of an aircraft
	graveyard wrecked planes lie all around

	we hear a phone ringing


10 	int cargo plane  day 					       10

	a ringing satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases

	udesky the leader of this crew answers it 

				udesky
		udesky
			beat
		yes sir were good to go ill lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment

	with the phone still to his ear udesky wanders out of the
	craft


11 	ext cargo plane  day 					       11

	udesky looks over at nash and cooper another mercenary

	coopers the quiet muscle of the bunch a weapons specialist he
	finishes loading a massive gun essentially a handcannon its
	aimed at nashs grimacing aircraft

				udesky
		thats right two of the very best i could
		find no i havent worked with them
		personally but they come with the highest
		recommendations

	then 

	cooper fires at the grimacing aircraft a projectile rockets
	into the plane and explodes with a fireball

	nash and cooper exchange a satisfied smile

				udesky contd
		youve got nothing to worry about sir this
		is going to be a piece of cake

	pieces of the demolished craft come raining down


12 	ext excavation base camp pt peck lake mt  day 	12

	close on a mans hand carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil we follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow revealing him to be billy brennan 25 an
	associate professor and site manager hes a charmer

	looking past him we see cheryl 21 a junior at junior of state shes one
	of a dozen college students working at the site and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor

				cheryl
		billy i dont think im doing this right

	he scoots over lying down beside her checks her work

				billy
		you need to go slowly see just take it little
		at a time

	shes not listening just watching his eyelashes

				cheryl
		i can never tell whats bone and whats rock

				billy
		technically its all rock the calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization but
		you can feel the difference see rough
		smooth rough smooth

	he runs her bare fingers over the two different patches showing
	her after a pause she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin

				cheryl
		rough

	and along his lips

				cheryl contd
		smooth

	billy may not have started this flirtation but hes not ending
	it either its then that a

	shadow

	falls across them billy looks up to see

				billy
		dr grant

	grant has just returned a bag over his shoulder

				grant
		mr brennan

										cut to


12a	ext walking to the main tents  day 			12a

	billy takes one of grants bags talking as they go

				billy
		how was your trip profitable

				grant
		well be broke in four weeks

				billy
		three weeks i had to rent some equipment

	the cross into one of the tents which only has two walls on
	a dusttaped table a dusty macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator a mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand

				grant
		you rented an automated litter box

				billy
		its a rapid prototyper i feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints one layer on top of the other
		its the future of paleontology

				grant
		not if it cant dig

	the arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a persons fist

				billy
		i give you a raptors resonating chamber

	grant hates technology but he cant help but be amazed by the
	result he lifts the strange object up shaking out the
	remaining sand

	billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell
	the resulting sound is unique and piercing the cry of an 
	nonexistent animal grant is speechless with excitement and so he
	uses it again and again producing different sounds and
	variations

	in the distance flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off

	billy looks up to see a man and a woman getting out of 	
	a cadillac cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent 									

				billy contd 				
			falsely casual 					
		oh i forgot to tell you some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you i 
told them youd be happy to see them 
		maybe even have dinner with them 						

				grant 					
		absolutely not 						

				billy 						
		theyre here 							

				grant 					
		what 								

	only now does grant realize these two people
who were walking up to them
putting on a friendly smile billy goes up to them

		dr grant 							

				grant 					
		yes 								

				man 						
			extending his hand					
		paul kirby kirby enterprises				 	
			reaching into his pocket 	
		my card 							

	paul kirby is a talkative optimist with				
	no off switch his wife amanda kirby just
as friendly is harder to read there seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes 					

				grant 					
		what can i do for you mr kirby 				

				paul 						
		well sir i am a great admirer
of yours and i have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss would you let my wife

				grant

	behind kirby bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together indicating the guy is loaded

	grant musters a weak smile

				grant
		its be my pleasure


13 	int hell creek bar and grill jordan mt  night 	13

	they’re only halfway through the entree but grant is ready to
	bolt its only billy whos keeping him from being rude they walk
	over to paul and amanda’s table and sit down

				paul
		first off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts
		amanda and i have admired your work for
		years

				amanda
		it is truly what’s the word inspiring

				grant
		thank you

	its everything grant can do just to be polite he desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig

				paul
		amanda and i well we just love the outdoors
		heck weve been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with galapagos k2
		the nile

				amanda
		we even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight

	billy nudges grant

				grant
		hmmm

				paul

		we wanted to do something really special
		something

	he places his hand on his wifes

				amanda
		onceinalifetime

				paul
		weve arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over isla sorna and we want
		you to be our guide

	the kirbys look to grant as if theyve offered him an amazing
	gift but grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth

				grant
		thats a very nice offer mr kirby but im
		afraid im much to busy if you like i can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified

				paul
		no no see dr grant youre the best youve
		seen these animals in the flesh no one else
		has come close to you

				grant
		im flattered but ive taken this little
		adventure tour and with the air
		restrictions theyve imposed after the
		incident in san diego you can’t fly low
		enough to see anything of interest

	paul is momentarily stymied but amanda rallies

				amanda
		you see thats just the thing paul and i
		have special permission to fly low

				billy
		how low

				paul
		well im no aviation specialist but i do
		know its hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else

				amanda
		from what i understand its pretty much
		whatever we want

				grant
		thats hard to believe

				paul
		lets just say that through my business 
		importsexports emerging markets  ive
		made some friends in high places in this
		case the costa rican government

				amanda
		dr grant you dont know how important it is
		for us to have you come along it would make
		all the difference

	grant is trying to find another way to say no when paul pulls
	out his checkbook

				pual
		and of course were prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here

	billy looks at grant dont say no

				paul contd
		i can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check just tell me what exactly it would
		take

	we hold on a conflicted dr alan grant

	grant resettles trying to get comfortable billy is across
	from him finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case

				grant
		even with what i pay you you could get a
		better bag

				billy
		no way this is lucky couple years ago
		some buddies and i went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in new zealand updraft sent me
		right into the side boom

				grant
		that does sound lucky

				billy
		it was this strap alone that saved my life
		got caught on a rock as i was falling

				grant
		reversedarwinism survival of the most
		idiotic

	because he hasnt really said it

				billy

		intend to be alone with these people

	on paul and amanda

	sitting near the front of the plane paul draws a long nervous
	breath and looks at amanda she seems just as tense

	finally finding a comfortable position grant puts his hat over
	his eyes ready to take a nap

	done with his camera billy turns to someone just off screen

				billy
		so how do you know the kirbys

	and we reveal

	mercenary cooper the weapons specialist we met earlier hes
	wearing sunglasses so dark you cant tell whether hes staring
	at you or fast asleep

	he doesnt answer did he even hear and then

	his mouth

				raptor
		alan

	and than it strikes


18 	int plane  day 					       		18

	grant wakes up with a start disoriented billy is leaning over

	by his expression we see billy would have to lie

				billy
		i think theyre looking for someone


28 	ext landing strip isla sorna  day 			       28

	the jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vinecovered
	runway the airplane is parked at one end

	bullhorn

	billy and a groggy grant emerge from the airplane paul trots
	over

	we are looking down on cooper from behind as the plane

	a shadow

	falls over the injured mercenary then with brutal speed an
	enormous beast seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air

	from this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creatures back

	paul hands the bulky phone up to nash who dials out

	the door opens a few inches before hitting a branch

	he looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	a huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window everyone
	else screams now
	
	the plane lurches  and we hear a deep growl
	
	the passengers hold tight paralyzed nash buckles himself into
	his seat

	suddenly the plane is yanked from the side to side battered this
	way and that the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats
	
	finally the horrible sounds of wrenching metal as the nose of
	the plane is ripped right off

	nash and udesky are suddenly sitting in open air the nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards the jungle floor far below

	the passengers hang almost vertically in their seats

	debris tumbles out the open end of the plane some of it
	striking nash in the head

	udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin nash follows

	suddenly a long snout with daggerlike teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats opens wide and

	clamps down

	on nashs legs

	the pilot cries out in agony the others passengers grab onto
	his arms trying to pull him back but its no use the dinosaur
	rips nash out of their grasp and down the aisle

	nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion then watches in
	horror as the fabric rips away hes pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground a giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot

	its horrifying sight but no one can turn away

	pleased with the appetizer the creature comes back for the
	main course

	grant tries to force open the jammed rear door billy tries to
	help but the door wont budge

	the dinosaur jams its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	amanda in the first row she yanks her legs back as the jaws
	snap shut

	behind amanda billy reaches forward unsnaps her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back

	the others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment

	the shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards

	the passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane dazed
	by the impact everyone is cut and bruised

	out of the open cockpit they see two approaching dino feet

	a window near amanda fogs over with condensation when it
	clears she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes

	then all hell breaks loose as the plane is slammed across the
	jungle clearing

	the passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane
	tumbling like socks in a dryer debris seats and luggage fly
	everywhere


41	ext jungle floor  continuous  day			41

	the plane comes to an abrupt halt as it smashes into a tree

	a gargantuan foot steps on the fuselage and flattens it like a

	inside windows explode raining glass over the passengers as

				billy
		over here

	udesky dives into the narrowing gap and billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through

	billy is as terrified as the rest of them but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline
	
	then a huge claw digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly peel the plane open grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear

				grant
		this way

	grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit they
	make a mad dash for the jungle

	a tremendous roar causes billy to look behind him he cant
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying but utterly
	fascinating animal

	grant yanks him forward


43	ext jungle  day						       43

	with grant in the lead and udesky taking up the rear the group
	tears through the jungle

	concealed by the dense undergrowth the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them  mowing down the young trees which topple all
	around them

	grant spots a grove of

	heavier trees

	and leads the group into it

	the dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks it roars at
	the fleeing humans searching desperately for a route after
	them

	the group continues their relentless pace putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast paul
	kirby looks like hes about to have a heart attack even billy
	is gasping for air

	they stop thinking theyve outrun it

	grant directs the group through some underbrush and into 


44	ext clearing  continuous  day				44

	our friends stop dead in their tracks amanda stifles a cry

	before them lies an immense unmoving sauropod

				grant
		dont worry its dead

	then a fullgrown bull

	tyrannosaurus

	rises up behind the carcass it was feeding its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion

	grant freezes

				grant contd
		nobody move a muscle

	remember the trex tracks motion

	obeying the group freezes for a few long beats then udesky
	takes off running

	and trex roars

	everyone runs trex is right behind them


45	ext jungle  day							45

	dashing back the way they came the group suddenly comes face
	to face with 

	the first monster

	we now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature spinosaurus aegypticus over forty feet long and
	twentyfive feet high the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back its head is crocodilian with rows of long curving teeth
	sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws

	nowhere else to run the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward their roars thunderous

	paul and amanda scramble into one direction billy and udesky in
	the other but grant cant go anywhere  his foot is stuck 
	between two branches

	he manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach
	theyll have to deal with each other before eating the humans

	grant dives down between two fallen trees as the spinosaurus and t
	rex circle one another like gladiators each searching for the
	others weakness

	laying flat on his back grant lets out a terrified gasp as the
	giant foot of spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face

	spinosaurus lunges forward powerful jaw open wide

	trex sidesteps the assault its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way

	in the tress paul and amanda scurry again for cover

	between the fallen trunks grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees

	trex presses the attack slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary spinosaurus is knocked back and grant is again
	forced to duck for cover

	as spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance trex dives
	forward spinosaurus is driven backwards as trex tries to
	grip its throat

	amanda yanks paul out of their path they scramble over to
	billy

	now on its side spinosaurus fights back ferociously it slashes
	at trex with its long arms and razor sharp claws then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot

	tyrannosaurus staggers back wounded

	down below grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans

	spinosaurus lunges for the trex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple trex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground

	with an earthshuttering crash the dinosaur lands between
	grant and the rest of the group

	the companions scurry out of the way but as they do so the
	head of the trex now lands almost directly on top of them

	plastered against an immense tree the group watches in horror
	as trex starts to rise but is thrown back down as spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat

	spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary and trex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends

	finally grant reaches the others

				grant
		come on

	spinosaurus lets out a victorious howl and the blooddrenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth


46	ext jungle  day							46

	winded from running paul is caught offguard as a furious
	grant slams his back against a tree only one thing he wants to
	know 

				grant
		why did you bring us here

	paul is too startled to speak udesky tires to step in but
	grant gives him back a look

				amanda
		our son is on this island we need your help
		to find him

	still crunched against the tree paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket

				paul
		this is him eric he’s thirteen now hes
		just about the greatest kid in the world

	letting go of paul grant takes the photo a searsstyle
	portrait of the boy we saw parasailing at the beginning he
	shakes his head disbelieving he hands the photo to billy

	the group splits into two sides  paul and amanda grant and
	billy  with udesky stuck between dialogue overlaps in
	places

				amanda
		hes with a man named ben hildebrand

				billy
		whos that

				paul
		her new boyfriend

				amanda
		a friend we were vacationing eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs so ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing
		they never came back

				paul
		we called everyone did everything we could
		because of all the controversy over this
		island no one will step in costa rica says
		its a nofly zone its their own damn fault
		guys at the us embassy  our us embassy 
		said we should accept the inevitable you
		believe that

				grant
		so you hired these mercenaries

				udesky
		we prefer recovery specialists we do
		overseas custody issues and

				grant
			interrupting
		then you duped us into coming here

				paul
		we needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land somebody whod been to this island before

				grant
			disbelieving
		i have never been on this island

				paul
		sure you have you wrote that book

				billy
		that was isla nublar this is isla sorna
		the second island

				paul
			low to udesky
		i didnt know there were two islands

				amanda
		still you have survived the dinosaurs before you
		saved those kids

				grant
		a few of us survived a lot more died and we
		were better prepared and better armed
			finally
		how many days have they been missing

	a look between amanda and paul

				paul
		eight weeks

	grand and billy are speechless it might as well be eight years

				grant
		after what youve seen today you really
		think your son could be alive

				amanda
		hes smart dr grant and he knows so much
		about dinosaurs

	before anyone else can talk grant puts his hand out he wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move

				grant
		no im sorry but no well savage what we
		can from the plane then we head for the
		coast there may be a boat left something to
		get us off this island

				paul
		dr grant were not leaving without our son

				grant
		you can stick with us or you can go and look for
		him either way youre probably not getting
		out of here alive

	with that he leaves a beat later billy follows he has
	genuine sympathy for the kirbys but hes logical enough to
	know grant is right

	back with paul and amanda

	they look to udesky

				paul
		what do we do

	udesky is clearly at a loss but for everyones reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio

				udesky
		well i think we should start searching for your
son in the direction theyre going

				paul
		excellent

	they follow after grant and billy


47	ext plane crash site						47

	anything useful the task is grim mindful of grants 
	warnings they move quickly and quietly

	udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water the barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees unless

	billy finds his camera intact

	digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change hes in his underwear
	before he notices amanda is also there changing

				paul
		sorry

				amanda
		nothing you havent seen before

				amanda contd
		how much weight have you lost

		swimming at the y

				amanda
		you hate to swim

				paul
		people change

	a nod to mean thats the truth

				paul contd
		you look good

				amanda
		so do you

	they make brief eye contact which amanda breaks

	around the side billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane grant
	looks over

				grant
		how would you classify it

				billy
		obviously a superpredator
			best guess
		suchimimus that snout

				grant
		they never got that big

				billy
		baryonyx

				grant
		not with that sail
			billy gives up
		spinosaurus aegypticus

				billy
		i dont remember that on ingens list

				grant
		thats because it wasnt on their list who
		knows what else they were up to

	billy looks past grant to see paul approaching hes struggling
	with the straps on his backpack turning in circles

	billy regards him with suspicion

				billy
		so mr kirby tell me when you climbed k2
		did you base camp at 25 or 30000 feet

				paul
		thirtythousand i think closer to the top

				billy
		about a thousand feet above it actually
			closer
		most mountainclimbers remember how tall
		that mountains were

	paul knows hes caught

				grant
		there is no kirby enterprises is there

				paul
		there is i own a place called kirby paint
		and title plus were out in the westgate
		shopping center in enid oklahoma the
		plus is for bathroom fixtures fireplaces
		accessories patio furniture stuff like 
		that

				billy

				paul
		mortgaged everything we had to do it even
		the store and if we make it off this island
		with my son i swear ill make good on the

		hey got something here

				amanda
		thats bens

	the power switch on the camcorder but the batterys dead

	udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to amanda

				udesky
		here give that to me

	and as udesky fiddles with the flashlight grant and billy
	consider the parasail

				billy
		it looks intact

				grant
		we should take it with us to signal any planes

				udesky os
		i think ive got it

	udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder

	he brings a live wire to back of the camcorder a red power
	light comes on

				amanda
		it works

		i filmed this the morning they left

	eric runs over and ben puts his arm around him as they run to

	paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue

	the video screen 

	the image now cuts to a shot from aboard enriques boat
	speeding towards isla sorna  the start of the movie eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera

	we replay the opening moments of the movie from ben and erics

	now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos screams from the both

	as the camera is buffeted in all directions

	with a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away swaying back and forth
	beneath ben and erics feet

		i dont know i think so

		were okay its going to be okay here get

	into the frame landing on the ground rolling he stands and
	looks back up at ben

				eric
		im all right

		were going to get out of this pal

	and on that the power and picture fade away

	a branch

	they pull harder the branch bends but the sail wont come
	loose one last tug and than snap the branch breaks the chute
	falls away to reveal…

	a skeleton

	it swings down directly at amanda she screams

	finally the others are able to pull her away as they untangle
	the lines the men are able to get the first view of the remains

	she tries to calm herself but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional shes surprised as paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her but she doesnt fight it

				paul
		im sorry amanda i am and im sorry for

		no its

				paul
		i know you liked ben i had no right to

		it’s not about him its eric hes alone out
		here somewhere our baby is all alone

	saying it aloud the reality sinks in for both of them

				amanda contd
		i guess i was hoping that with ben around
		thered be someone to keep him safe

	checking in on clients udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket something raises the hairs on the back of his neck

				udesky
		dr grant

	he nods for the others to take a look at this they head over
	grant at the rear

	as he approaches billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack he stops short from what he sees

	looking down we circle across the jungle floor here we find a
	strange hollowedout construction made of sod and branches
	maybe six feet around

	just now noticing the others stare paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet a halfburied nest its filled with
	footballsized eggs laid in a spiral

	and this isnt the only nest amanda counts twelve in all laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern

	the last to arrive grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant

		in colonies

	theyre not going to be driving anywhere

	a troubled grant peers through a windshield partially caved

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the

	absorb the incredible array of technology enormous cryonic
	freezer their plug pulled years ago empty incubators tanks

	billy looks around the lab he cant help but be impressed

				billy
		okay if i take pictures

	grant nods

	billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable two years
	from now astute observers of the dvd will not that billy
	doesnt actually take his camera from the bag he was carrying
	it because there wasnt any room inside

	billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut

	across the lab

	amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with halfformed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde  genetic experiments gone
	awry finally she reaches

	a gigantic manified raptor head

	floating in the one tank

	something about this specimen catches amanda’s attention she
	bends forward getting very close to the glass she peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature then 

	an actual raptor

	lunges at her form behind the tank she screams

	fortunately the raptor cant get between the closely spaced
	tanks amanda runs

	and as the group races through the lab the raptors find a

	there are several rows of oversized steel cages apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs many of the cage doors are
	standing open

	the group races down a lone aisle close behind the raptor
	bursts into the room roars

	as the raptor gains ground udesky and billy run into one of the
	open cages slamming the door behind them

	grant paul and amanda duck into another before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them however the raptor slams
	into it driving the door into the cage

	they are forced back against a chainlike wall trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door the angry
	raptor is now inches away through the cage door

	then suddenly the raptor looks up we follow its gaze the top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open

	the eager raptor climbs up the chainlike door catching the
	tail of an idea amanda grabs the door and nods to the others

				amanda
		push

	they push hard on the cage door swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage

	now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space the door
	going right to the ceiling

	amanda slides the doors bolt through the chain like wall
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur

	the raptor struggles desperately grawling and snarling but
	the cage door seems to be holding

	as everyone rushes back to the door

	the raptor begins to make a low haunting moan

	as the others head for the door grant lingers a step listening
	to the beasts simple melodic cry it has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber

				grant
		shes calling for help


60	ext compound  day						60

	the group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard the call of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line

	now they moan is answered from distant jungle quarters

	the responses quickly multiply to the groups dismay they
	soon find themselves virtually surrounded by raptor cries both
	distant and near

	grant looks around with amazement its vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication but it couldnt come at a worse
	time

	responding to the growls a herd of grazing hadrosaurs suddenly
	flees across the open space then in the distance behind the
	herd

	a pack of raptors

	emerges from the jungles coming their way

				grant
		head for the trees

	from the lab building the raptor we left imprisoned now bursts
	out one of the doors and howls to the pack  the same cry we
	heard in the lab

	the raptor pack moves into the hunting formation one alphamale
	raptor slightly larger than the others leads the charge up the
	middle

	grant risks a looks back but doesnt stop running

				grant contd

	in an effort to escape the oncoming raptors grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs

	suddenly all is chaos hadrosaurs race past splitting up the
	group

	letting the others get ahead of him grant looks back much to
	his dismay the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs

	indeed the pack weaves its way through the herd  the raptors
	only want them

	in the chaos of the stampede everyone loses sight of each other

	up ahead billy trips and falls as he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks he doesnt notice its missing until hes
	already back on his feet and running

	amanda and paul keep close to each other further back grant
	spots billys fallen camera back he grabs it as he runs past

	looking back billy sees that grant now has his back

	as the hadrosaurs whip past paul and amanda climb up into a
	tree a raptor leaps at paul barely missing his leg

	trying to pull paul up amanda nearly loses her balance this
	time paul catchers her

	billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of paul and amanda

	udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	headed off

	by a raptor he turns to the other way but finds

	there are more raptors

	he picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach not more than a few feet away the leader of the trio
	stops peering at him

	udesky swings hard but the dinosaurs feints from behind him
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs severing his
	muscles udesky cries out and drops to the ground

	in the treetops

	paul amanda and billy can hear him

				paul
		udesky

				amanda
			listening
		hes this way

	from here the thick branches overlap forming a kind of
	second floor above the ground its not easy but you can move
	from branch to branch tree to tree

	on the floor

	unable to walk udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals
	the effort clearly causes him great pain strangely the
	raptors suddenly dont seem interested in him anymore

	rather theyre talking among themselves udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive

	suddenly one of the raptors slashes at him again but its
	delicately not a mortal blow just a very painful one udesky
	cries out louder this time

	in the trees

	hearing the new cry paul amanda and billy move faster now
	finally seeing udesky on the ground hes facedown barely
	moving but still moaning

	the raptors are gone

	in the lead amanda starts to climb down but paul grabs her
	holds her back

				paul
		its not safe

				amanda
		we have to help him

				billy
		hes right a predator wouldnt leave a kill
		wounded

				amanda
		hes not a kill hes still alive

	she breaks from pauls grip and drops to the ground shes only
	a foot away from the tree when

	all four raptors

	lead out from their hiding places they almost catch her as
	billy and paul pull her back up on the limb

	the raptors stare up at them angry their plan didnt work

				paul
		they couldn’t climb up so they were trying
		to get us to come down

				billy
		they set a trap
			amazed
		they actually set a trap

	bored with waiting the raptors go back to finish off udesky
	making a meal out of it up in the branches the survivors are
	horrified and sickened

	then from the deep in the forest a new raptor cry the feasting
	raptors look up listening then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle

				paul
		wheres grant


69b	ext elsewhere in the jungle  day				69b

	climbing higher in a tree grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors he scales one branch the next finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs cant jump to

	looking down

	the entire pack is now standing still watching him in the
	center the alpha male lets out a sort of bark responding to the
	cry the other raptors call back

	as terrified as he is he cant help but be fascinated by their
	communication like a hellish bird song theres a rhythm to it
	a structure theyre clearly talking about something

	under his breath grant is able to mimic its patterns

				grant
		what does that mean what are you saying

	of course they cant answer they just keep using the same
	phrase

	ready to ditch billys camera bag in order to climb higher 
	hes had to hold it by the strap  grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime he looks down at the camera bag and thats
	the source its oozing out the bottom

	he unzips the bag to find

	a broken raptor egg

	inside the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell theres another intact egg beside it

	this is what the raptors where chasing

				grant contd
		god damn you billy

	ever the scientist dr grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it
	they suddenly go crazy howling the same phrase but louder

				grant contd
		it means give us the egg doesnt it we
		want the egg

	he gently drops the bag to the ground although the raptors are
	interested pulling out the unbroken egg theyre still by no means
	placated the song may have changed but they still want grant
	dead

	they begin to jump at him eventually hopping up on each
	other’s backs its only a matter of time till they reach him

	grant moves to climb higher but sees no branches he can reach
	and than he hears the low creaking a crack the branch hes
	on is starting to give in

	he looks down at the face of his enemies knowing hell be
	their next meal and then

	a small canister

	lands at the base of the trees immediately spraying out a thick
	cloud of oily fog its the first of

	five canisters

	that land in the area creating a thick cloud its not just
	smoke though something far more caustic

	as it hits the raptors they immediately recoil those closest
	to the canisters shrieking in pain tumbling in the dirt
	there may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well  they
	seem panicked disoriented

	pack mentality takes over and after the first ten raptors take
	off running so do the rest some tripping over their feet
	blindly

	this may be dinotear gas but its not good for humans either
	up in the tree grants eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	he squints to see through the fog where he spots

	a human shape

	at the edge of the smoke

				voice
		come on theyll be back

	grant halfclimbs halffalls out of the tree rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke

	a small dirty hand

	grabs his pulling him along

	the other person pulls him along its only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	the boy he was brought to rescue a lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks its not just dirt and muck  hes the filthiest
	child youve ever seen  something primal has come out in him

	something wild

	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a datsun lit by
	a small batterypowered lantern this is where eric has been

	the minute grants inside eric goes back to work resealing
	the door this 13year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive

				grant
		eric

	the boy holds up a hand he listens for a moment he doesnt
	hear anything outside

				grant contd
		eric your parents are both here

				eric
		in costa rica

				grant
		on the island

	eric truly cant believe it he hoped to be rescued but

				eric
		theyll never make it i mean they cant
		manage when the cable goes out

				grant
		youd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too

	eric studies his guest finally certain he recognizes him

				eric
		youre alan grant arent you
			off surprised reaction
		i read both of your books

				grant
		which one do you prefer

				eric
		the first one before you where on the island
		you liked dinosaurs back then

				grant
		back then they hadnt tried to eat me

	grant takes a better look around erics tiny hideaway
	impressed with what hes been able to scavenge among the many
	items we see another smoke canister some batterypowered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers this kids been living on
	chocolate for weeks

				eric
		when ingen cleared out they left a lot of
		stuff behind

				grant
		any weapons radios

	eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show grant

				eric
		found this but the batterys dead

				grant
		its a wonder you arent im amazed eric i 
		barely lasted 30 hours you lasted eight
		weeks

	the line catches eric strangely its the first moment of true
	emotion weve seen him in

				eric
		is that all its been i thought it was longer

				grant
			trying to be positive
		the important thing is we both made it
		thats something we have in common

	eric rips into a candy bar after a moment he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well

	grant takes it a lone beat than grant just has to know

				grant contd
		did you read malcolms book

				eric
		yeah

				grant
		what did you think

				eric
		i dunno i mean it was kind of preachy

	snakes on the loser

				paul contd
		eric has always been headstrong and you
		throw ben hildebrand into the mix and well

		well damn it i dont speak ill of the dead
		what im trying to say is it’s was just a crazy
		accident the exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me you cant go
		beating yourself up about it

	him

				amanda
		this wouldnt happen if he was with
		you i mean you drive five miles below the
		speed limit i totaled three cars in fives
		years

				paul
		that one time was just the bumper

				amanda
		he would have been safe completely

		i would have him to see more of the world than
		enid oklahoma i wanted to see more of the

	as grant and eric walk both stop hearing a strange sound but
	for a change its not an ominous one

	its a human one

	a phone is ringing very faintly without a word to each other
	grant and eric decide its coming from the right

69l	ext jungle  contunuous day					69l

	paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike
	risking tripping on every step then amanda stops short shes
	the first to hear it

	the same ringing

	after a beat everyone else can hear it too and recongnition
	finally lights on pauls face

				paul

	suddenly paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch

				amanda
		you had the phone the whole time

				billy
		where is it

				paul
		i dont know i dont have it with me

		when did you have it last

	realization amanda couldn’t bear the wait

		i loaned it to nash he must have had it on

	the hideous implication of his words slowly sink in


69m	ext jungle  day							69m

	still following the faint ringing grant and eric turn to find

	a sail

	moving through the low trees we recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus we might think its any random spinosaurus
	except for the ringing coming from somewhere inside it

	grant and eric press back against a tree keep perfectly
	still as they hear the thoooomb thoooomb thooomb of the
	creatures footsteps reverberating its tail rustkes against
	the brush

	its moving behind them and its close

	we hear the ringing move from left to right as it passes so
	far its has no idea theyre there

	looking across the clearing eric is startled to see

	paul and amanda

	are no more than 20 yards away also hiding an involuntary
	reflex eric calls out

				eric
		mon dad

	grant immediately covers the boy’s mouth but its to late
	the dinosaur has stopped we still cant see it we dont know how
	close it is

	paul and amanda spot eric with grant theyre a thousand
	emotions at once relieved disbelieving terrified overjoyed
	they want to run to him to yell out to him but the monster is
	close

	grant takes his hand off erics mouth they both stay
	completely silent

	all this time the satphone is ringing

	than it stops

	and after an agonizing beat the beast moves at first were
	not sure which direction its headed but finally we can tell
	its moving away

	once the sail is finally out of sight eric breaks from grants
	hold and dashes to his parents arms they coop him up hug
	him kiss him their affection unquenchable hes crying

				amanda
			reassuring him
		sweetheart youre okay
			reassuring herself
		youre okay
			disbelieving
		youre okay

				paul
		never had a doubt never did us kirby men
		we stick around huh

		we do

	looking at her grubby son amanda licks her shirttail trying
	to rub his face clean

				paul
		honey theres not enough spit in the world
		for that

	billy crosses the distance to grant

				grant
		we need to keep moving

		billy i cant talk to you now

	he walks off billy follows him

				billy
		please okay just yell at me call me an
		idiot an asshole stupid tell me i screwed
		up because i know i did

	grant doesnt respond

				billy contd
		i thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland we could get serious money
		for it enough to fund the digging for 10
		years more whatever it took

	grant shakes his head disgusted but doesnt stop

				billy contd
		you have to believe me i did it with the
		best intentions

				grant
			finally turning on him
		some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions you
		rushed in with no thought to the

		youre no better than the people who built

		how about if we try this way

				eric
		i want to be an astronaut

	leap out at any moment grant scans the river banks

				grant

	paul cuts the motor and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action

	the barge finishes rounding the curve and the ringing grows
	louder the suspense is excruciating until finally

	their eyes widen at some horrifying sight more horrifying
	than anything theyve yet seen

	seven mounds of dinosaur dung sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank

	as our friends consider the sight an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously

	heavy sigh grant shuts off the phone

	in all the excitement none of them notice a fierce horned
	carnotaur right behind them the giant creature roars ready
	to eat them

	but as it gets in close it smells them even a dinosaur wont
	eat something that is covered in shit after a beat the

	in the dinosaur cage

	the fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of

	the cage scrapes across the deck and slams into the gunwale
	toppling off the barge and

	into the river

	the other three arent as lucky the cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down trapping

	in the cold murky depths they pull frantically on the bars
	debris and equipment float around them

	paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat if anyone is going to save his family it
	has to be him

	and so he dives

	pushing with all his might he manages to tip the heavy
	structure just enough so amanda eric and grant can get out

	like a jungle gym

	all the while theyre trying to spot paul

	grant is the last to climb reaching the first section as

	try as it might the beast cant climb the crane so instead it
	rams it shakes it trying to knock them off eric slips but
	amanda catches him

	about to shed his bag to climb higher grant finds one last
	hope its the resonation chamber model a beat before he
	decides it may not be the best choice but its the only choice

	he blows through it the same eerie pitch we heard before on
	the third try hes able to approximate the egg cry he heard
	the raptors give he keeps it up repeating over and over

	spinosaurus stops for a beat confused how this sound could be
	coming from a nonraptor but then keeps smashing

	we can hear the mounting bolts strain soon the whole crane
	will tip

	but not before a matching cry is heard in the jungle grant
	stops not certain he heard it but there it is again

	he keeps blowing

	the crane is close to tipping when a single raptor appears
	from the darkness chirpbarking at the spinosaur who simply
	bats away

	but then more raptors come and even more soon there are
	dozens gathering circling

	grant stops signaling all three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins

	looking at his adversaries spinosaurus roars and suddenly
	the raptors attack

	spinosaurus easily handles the first few but like ants they
	just keep coming they climb up his back slicing into him with
	their razorsharp claws

				grant

	all three drop from the crane arm into the water

	meanwhile the fight continues spinosaurus rallies shaking
	off many of the raptors but they just keep coming their
	hooked claws dig in scraping the meat to the bone

	spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end but finally
	collapses dead the raptors continue to shred it to ribbons
	then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away

	but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush it goes back to

	grant spins to the far side of the ladder the pteranodon goes

	the pteranodon is still working its way free pulling itself closer
	and closer

	grant uses it to rip the line the fibers break and fray but

	paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon whacking it straight
	in the head it felt good and damn if it didnt slow it down a
	little

	grant has cut through the cord he started on the second when
	the pteranodon snaps at him going for his hand theres
	nowhere for grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him

	and idea grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line

	the pteranodon falls away from the helicopter catching wind

	symphony
