               ext  night

               its raining like hell flashes of lightning reveal momentary 
               glimpses of a decayed urbanindustrial landscape far below 
               us a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the 
               drowning earth we descend toward the rock sporadic flashes 
               of lightning distort our perspective of the stone it looks 
               strangely beautiful like a diamond stuck in the dark mud 
               closer closer

               suddenly strong male hands cut across the frame and wrench 
               it free from its muddy grave even closer and we discover 
               that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with 
               every kind of slithering repulsive insect flash 
               lightning obliterates the frame

                flashes of light from lightning car headlights 
               photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout 
               the following sequences as recurring transitional devices

               city street ext night

               we can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of 
               an inner city  what we can see looks half demolished 
               flash

               through chain link fencing the blinding headlights of a 
               70s chevy arc into frame for an instant we see the fleeting 
               image of a pretty teenage girl on her feet a pair of bright 
               red high heeled shoes the chevy pulls up next to her

               int 70s chevy  night

               flash an oncoming cars headlights streak across the beat 
               up chevys windshield revealing the driver 45ish as 
               he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door

               the pretty teenage girl slides into the car dressed only in 
               a skirt and tshirt shes soaked to the skin makeup runs 
               down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders she 
               seems nervous scared even

                                     pretty teenage girl
                         thanks

               as she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has 
               been injured its bound with coarse white toweling and 
               stained with blood in her other hand she clings tightly to 
               a cheap yellow leather purse he reaches forward and puts 
               his hand on the gearshift the back of his hand brushing 
               against her leg she moves away he slides the gearshift 
               into drive

               out into the night

               int roofless old warehouse  night

               suddenly a powerful photographic strobe light ignites 
               revealing a decrepit warehouse interior silhouetted briefly 
               against the paint chipped walls are two figures a man brian 
               kessler 25 short chopped hair dressed in black on black

               flash photo

               ext construction site  night

               emerging from the blackness the same strong male hands 
               that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket 
               clear of his torso a crude bandage wrapped around one of 
               the fingers the rock is slipped up under his jacket up 
               against his bare chest the jacket is pulled down to conceal 
               the rock and the faceless figure drifts away

               int roofless old warehouse  night

               the beam of brians flashlight sweeps through the darkness 
               revealing another room

                                     brian
                         this is it this is the where hed 
                         take her whenever he had the urge to

               the flashlight finds the corner in question flash the 
               warehouse lights up again revealing a huge machine room

                                     brian
                         of course nobody would have heard 
                         her cries over the noise of the 
                         machines

               int 70s chevy  night

               a male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his cars 
               front window the windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the 
               constant sheet of rain beyond

                                     driver
                         damn this defroster never works

               the driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs 
               he finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work 
               the girl leans forward into the stream of warm air

                                     pretty teenage girl
                         mmm feels good

               nervous smile

                         the corner shot through the head

               the flashlight continues to search through the darkness

               very close on the girls yellow purse as the metal zipper 
               is pulled open the driver notices her opening the purse

                              unconvincingly
                         sure

               the driver watches as she reaches into the purse out a 
               soggy pack of matches she looks at them i look to the 
               driver

                                     pretty teenage girl

                         wifes car ah there it is

               he pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat out of the corner 
               of his eye he sees the girls hand slip back in her purse 
               and stay there she stares at the car lighter and waits 
               the driver glances at her then back to the lighter

                         must have felt returning to this 
                         place did she use that to help her

               illuminates the night rain streaming in through the fractured 
               remains of the ceiling

               a blinding flash

               as a semitrailer crosses paths with the 70s chevy

               close on the girl an intent expression on her face as she 
               watches and waits for the cigarette lighter to eject his 
               hand reaches deeper into her purse the driver tenses as he 
               sees this suddenly

               pop the lighter ejects

               the driver reaches for the dash the girl hurriedly lifts 
               something out from inside the bag the driver yanks the 
               lighter out and whips a look to the girl

               int roofless old warehouse

               brians flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the 
               rafters and catwalks scanning listening brian and 
               carrie glance tentatively at each other then slowly carrie 
               lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing 
               into the rafters carrie fires a shot triggering a brilliant 
               flash

                                                                    cut to

               flash out of the inky black the glistening wet rock 
               emerges hurtling downwards tumbling end over end through 
               the night rain

               int 70s chevy

               the girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse she 
               looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling 
               slightly

                                     pretty teenage girl

               the girl reaches out steadies his trembling hand and 
               pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips

               when in a thunderous crash the glistening wet rock comes 
               smashing through their windshield

               ext freeway  night

               the chevy brakes skids across the rainslicked pavement 
               and turns a somersault landing upside down on its hood

               another angle closer

               the camera drifts across the fractured front end of the 
               overturned chevy the twisted hunk of metal hisses 
               steams groans the front tire spins lazily to a halt on 
               its mangled axle

               in the background  high overhead

               we see a man standing on a highway overpass hes leaning on 
               the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car

               closer

               lying in the deserted highway the driver crawls out covered 
               with blood still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette

               down his face closer yet on his eye and right into 
               the dilated pupil

               as we enter it  its like being in a dark winding tunnel 
               filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping 
               of powerful machinery

               from somewhere in the blackness

               the distant echo of a womans voice

                         well the first thing is you need

               early jumps in and throws a pair of devils horns up behind

               photographs the moment

                         year old daughter

               just then a nine year old girl comes running from around

                         could i speak to your parents

               after an awkward pause the little girl silently crosses the 
               yard to the porch and opens the front door

               the house looking for her father inside the kitchen right 
               next to the window is a side table with a telephone and a

               interest she stands on the seat of the swing and begins 
               swinging

               at the rear of the house

               early tries to push up the kitchen window it barely lifts 
               three inches before jamming through the room we see the

               the purse so he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it 
               toward him the purse slides closer inch by inch all the 
               while he keeps one eye on the farmer across the room

               at the far end of a narrow hallway carrie finds an ice 
               machine rumbling away noisily the only illumination a single 
               fluorescent light bulb hangs suspended above it

               at the ice machine

               with her arm buried inside the ice machine carrie scavenges 
               for what little ice there is when out of the corner of 
               her eye she notices

               someone standing at the other end of the corridor the 
               silhouette of a man

               carrie stops her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for 
               another way out there is none

               she tries to ignore the situation grabs another handful of 
               ice cubes the man approaches carrie stops again her mind 
               races the mans face slowly becomes visible as he nears the

               solitary cube he puts it in his mouth sucks on it his 
               torso is drenched in sweat he catches carrie staring at 
               him

               carrie is driving brian is contending with a major hangover 
               there is still a silent tension between brian and carrie 
               from the argument the night before early is in the back 
               with adele brian moves his head and moans

                         tomato juice

               from the front seat brians hand springs up in a desperate 
               plea for an end to adeles colorful description

               through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her 
               suddenly the wail of an approaching ambulance gets carries 
               attention it roars by carrie glances in the mirror again 
               the next instant unexpectedly

               ext lincoln

               she furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt

               carrie nods toward the back seat brian turns and sees adele 
               looking back at them questioningly beside her early rustles

                                     brian
                         what is it

                         look again

               brian notices that adeles rummaging has revealed an automatic 
               pistol in the open canvas bag brian stares at it earlys 
               eyes open

               ext parked lincoln  later

               a deserted plain its very quiet here until the silence is 
               broken by the sound of gunshots reveal early teaching brian 
               how to shoot a row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old 
               car its obvious that brians enthralled with the idea of 
               shooting the gun even if he isnt hitting anything

                                     early

               to see her reaction but shes already on her way back to 
               the car and shes furious concerned brian starts to follow 
               after her but early grabs his attention

                         dangerous place

               brian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand

               she catches a glimpse of early curled up in adeles lap she 
               watches a moment longer and realizes that they are making 
               out beginning to kiss and touch one another

               ext highway near abattoir  late afternoon

               the lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road in 
               the distance we see a large rundown building

               int an old deserted abattoir  afternoon

               the lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure brian 
               glances to the back seat to make a remark to early and adele 
               and sees that they are amorously engaged

               brian and carrie start to gather their stuff carrie opens 
               the glove compartment inside are boxes of film and the 
               45 automatic she takes a few packs of film and closes the 
               glove compartment

                                     early
                         tell ya bri im still a little 
                         sleepy think adele and me are

               carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition 
               locks the glove compartment and pockets the key both she 
               and brian exit the car as they start to walk toward the 
               structure brian hears a sound he turns back to see adele 
               leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincolns big white 
               top starts to come up

               int abattoir

               even in daylight the interior of the dilapidated old building 
               is equal parts unnerving austere and menacing the last 
               rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows 
               the light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat
               hooks hanging from the ceiling

               carrie is getting her camera equipment ready shes quiet 
               and uncommunicative

               new angle

               close on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest 
               on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room 
               brian pops a cassette in the player

               camera in hand carrie begins to move about despite the 
               fact that this place repels her

               brian presses a button on the audio cassette player the 
               small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we 
               slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman

               she sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling

               early falls to the ground on his back brian lifts himself 
               to his feet

               he sees that carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway
