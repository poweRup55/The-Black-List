ext skies over france 1917  day

camera drifts towards a large puffy cloud floating 6000ft above the 
french countryside 

 a roar of engines  sounding like angry buzzing bees  and three 
 six  nine sopwith camel fighter planes emerge from the cloud 
flying in tight formation these are frail looking but deadly single 
seat biplanes each armed with twin vickers machine guns the height of 
1917 aircraft design built for the sole purpose of blasting german 
planes out of the skies

super france 1917

jack driscoll and his buddy matt hamon are flying two of the camels at 
the rear of the formation an uptight brit  mckecknie is flying along 
side them hes as jumpy as hell scanning the skies for enemy planes

matt looks around furtively none of the other pilots are looking in 
their direction with practiced skill matt reaches down for something 
in his tiny cockpit  he stands up wedging the control column 
between his knees and turns back towards jacks camel  a baseball in 
his hand with equal proficiency jack jams his control column between 
his knees and stands brandishing a baseball bat both pranksters have 
to fight against the fierce slipstream as matt throws the balli across 
fifty feet of sky towards jack he prepares to swing but the ball 
falls short getting minced in jacks propeller a quick look around to 
make sure no one is looking and matt reaches down again grabbing 
another baseball out of the bag of balls he carries in his cockpit

matt pitches it back towards jack  he swings and smashes the ball 
into the side of mckecknies plane he leaps with fright his camel 
wobbling in the sky as he frantically spins around thinking hes been 
hit by enemy fire

jack and matt sit in their cockpits innocently looking the other way

sudden machine gun fire  the squadron leader has fired his guns to 
attract the attention of all his pilots he gestures down 

jack looks down  3 large german bombers escorted by 6 sleek 
albatross fighters are heading towards allied lines about 1000 feet 
below

with a wave of the squadron leaders arm the nine camels peel away 
towards the german planes the fun is over for jack and matt as they 
grimly steer their planes into the steep dive 

wood creaks wire whistles as the camels shudder against the wind 
resistance wings sometimes crumple like matchwood in dives as steep as 
this jack squints as he lines up an albatross in his gunsights the 
germans have not spotted the fast approaching camels 

the camel pilots open fire virtually simultaneously  18 machine guns 
send yellow tracer bullets ripping into the german planes within 
seconds 3 albatros are destroyed one spins away in flames another 
literally collapses under a hail of bullets and the third collides with 
one of the bombers causing both planes to tumble out of the sky

its a turkey shoot as the camels fly through the german formation 
turning sharply to attack again before the enemy pilots can recover

mckecknie blasts at the nose gunner of a german bomber pumping so many 
bullets into his plane the nose section disintegrates and the german 
falls out  this is in the days before parachutes 

clunk the german gunner lands on jacks wing he desperately hangs 
on spread eagled fingers gripping the wing edges  jack stares at 
him amazed 

this is one of those defining moments in life  with a flick of his 
control stick jack could send this guy sailing into space it is a 
moment he will remember till the end of his days  jack makes eye 
contact  the german is terrified helpless 

jack reaches out to him

jack
yelling above noise
here

jack struggles to keep his plane flying as smooth as possible  all 
around the swirling dogfight continues the german reaches out for 
jacks hand 

bam bam bam a sudden burst of gunfire hits the german he looks at 
jack with a kind of confused sorrow  and rolls off the wing

jack 
shocked
no

another camel is flying just a few feet off jacks tail   it dives 
away

tracer fire rips into jacks plane  he spins around confronted with 
a terrifying sight

the 24 gaudily painted fokker triplanes of von richtofens flying 
circus are diving down towards them the hunters have just become the 
hunted before jack can react the triplanes swoop into the dogfight 


the sky is suddenly filled with nearly 50 planes wheeling around in a 
desperate life and death struggle from a distance they look like a 
swarm of angry bees against a spectacular backdrop of cumulous cloud 
rising in towering columns

close in its stomach churning noisy and violent as terrified pilots 
throw their planes around the sky in a desperate attempt to blast 
bullets into each other you may have seen movie dogfights before but 
you havent seen one like this

jack wrenches the control stick sending his camel through a series of 
tight turns wincing as boiling castor oil from the rotary engine slaps 
into his face there are so many planes that collision is as threatening 
as the deadly tracer fire that zips in all directions

matt fires at a triplane the blast of his guns causing his plane to 
tremble violently the triplanes top wing breaks away sending the 
german into a fatal spin

jack stares in horror mckecknies camel is on fire  and flying 
straight towards him he frantically tries to steer his plane away but 


crrummpp jacks plane clips mckecknies and goes into an immediate 
spin jack tries to regain control  his right hand wing tip is in 
tatters

matt sees his buddy going down and dives after him blasting at a 
couple of triplanes that are closing in on the crippled camel

jack uses all his strength to haul the control stick back and pull out 
of the dive he is dangerously close to the ground  the shell torn 
landscape of no mas land matt levels out along side as jack loses his 
last few feet of height and smashes into the ground his undercarriage 
breaks away and the camel slides to a stop in the mud

ext no mans land  day

jack leans back in the cockpit his nose bloody from the crash but 
otherwise unharmed 

bang bang bang machine gun bullets suddenly rip into his plane  
german soldiers are firing at him from the trenches the camel bursts 
into flame as bullets puncture the gas tank

jack quickly rolls out of the cockpit and crawls away just as matt 
roars low overhead strafing the machine gun nest with a withering 
stream of tracer fire

jacks plane explodes  he slides safely into a muddy shell hole 
pulling his service revolver out of the holster jack rips his flying 
helmet  goggles off  we see that he is just a 17 year old kid

from out of the thick black plume of smoke from the burning plane 
matts sopwith camel suddenly appears gliding very low  hes 
attempting to land

matt carefully guides the plane between shell holes and almost gets 
away with the landing  just as the plane slows to a stop it hits a 
coil of barbed wire and flips on its back matt releases his seat
blet falls to the ground and pulls off his flying helmet  matt is 
about 20 years old

matt 
yelling
jack

matt races towards the burring wreckage  gunfire from the german 
trenches kicks the mud up around his feet and he dives forward into a 
large shellhole

jack
matt

matts only a few yards away from jack but they have to stay in their 
respective shellholes as a ground shaking volley of artillery fire 
thunders around them

jack contd
yelling
what the hell are you doing

matt
yelling
saving your lousy ass

jack
yelling
youre not saving anybody youre in the shit like me

matt and jack start chuckling

matt hears a low noise turns around and screams 

low angle pov a burly german soldier rams his bayonet towards camera

close on matts face  he gasps in shock as he is stabbed in the 
stomach

jack contd
shocked yell
matt

jack staggers over the top of the shellhole confronting the three 
german soldiers who have descended on matt he fires his revolver at 
them  killing each soldier

image slows down  turns into grainy black and white jack sinks to his 
knees sobbing with grief

camera rises into the sky 

dissolve to

ext sumatran dig  day

 

close on a grotesque face  eyes bulging tongue wedged between 
teeth

pull out from the bizarre stone carving of a man riding a buffalo as 
the side of a wooden packing case swings shut sealing the ancient 
figure into a tea chest marked british museum london a couple of 
sumatran laborers hammer nails into the chest  crane up to reveal an 
extensive archaeological excavation underway in the foothills of the 
bukit seguntang mountains near palembang

super british museum archaeological dig

super sumatra 1933

the dig is nestled in a lush humid valley a spectacular waterfall 
thunders into a river that bisects the camp  a group of tents with a 
union jack fluttering from a makeshift flagpole 8 british 
archaeologists are spread around huddling over shell pits and 
primitive stone monuments  painstakingly freeing the remains of a 12th 
century hindu shrine from the grip of the sumatran jungle

the most spectacular monument is a huge loft stone buddha set into a 
shallow cave below a rocky cliff it sits serenely casting an 
impassive gaze over the entire site

numerous samutran labours move about carrying buckets of dirt away 
from individual dig sites close on a young womans hands excitedly 
scraping mud from a buried artifact she has just discovered  a small 
bronze statue of a warrior in a fierce war mask pitted with age one 
arm broken off it carries a spear made from ivory

ann darrow is an attractive young english woman in her early twenties 
she wears baggy khaki trousers and a cotton shirt her blonde hair tied 
back in a pony tail she issues orders to mentawei  a sumatran 
laborer

ann
mentawei fetch some warm soapy water

mentawei
 yes miss darrow

mentawei races away ann marvels at her find as she gently frees it 
from the mud  a shadow looms over her and she quickly stands up 
her confidence suddenly draining 

lord linwood darrow is in his late seventies but still cuts a dashing 
figure his only apparent concession to age  a stout walking stick

lord darrow 
what have you got there

ann
nervous
a neolithic bronze  reminiscent of the nias island cultures  it  
s very curious defiantly pagan the use of ivory for the spear is 
quite unique  what do you think

lord darrow
i think youre trying to run before you can walk ann

anns face drops  lord darrow takes the statue and gently leads her 
away from the site

lord darrow contd
youre here merely to observe leave the digging to people who know 
what theyre doing my dear

they approach an elaborate stone pillar carved intricately

lord darrow contd
now look at this fine example of early hindu art  i dont recall any 
sketches of this passing across my desk 

ann
i photographed it extensively father

lord darrow
photography teaches you nothing ann click one second and youve seen 
all youre going to see i want you sitting here with your paper and 
pencils  i want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking 
accuracy understand the carving and you will understand the people 
that ann is the key to archaeology

lord darrow walks away leaving ann scowling at the statue

douglas a british archaeologist slowly scans the small figure lord 
darrow stands beside him a perplexed frown on his face

lord darrow contd
it makes no sense dougie  pagan artifacts below a hindu site

douglas
its like all the others  its human bone

douglas carefully places the statue on a linen covered table  mary 
other small artifacts  clearly the work of the same culture  cover 
the table all are bronze and all have bone accessories

douglas contd
my guess is its sacrificial some sort of offering

lord darrow
an unknown culture  a barbaric race with no regard for human life

the beast god cult flourished up until the fifth century it originated 
on a remote island and quickly spread to the mainland where the 
worshipers were systematically hunted down and killed by the hindu no 
likeness of kong was allowed to survive all trace of this culture was 
eliminated as if it had never existed

are you suggesting a pocket still survives on this island

lord darrow
maybe  but from what we know of the culture i wouldnt set foot on 
the island of the skull with anything less than full military back

speed up behind them

theyre gaining on us

the chase accelerates out of the jungle and down a narrow mountain 
road  a sheer 300ft drop on one side jack throws his truck around 
corners with recklessness the stony track is barely wide enough for a 
vehicle not one sliding around tight corners  at times one wheel 
hangs out in space ann clings to her seat

jack has gained on the military vehicles as they reach the bottom of 
the hill racing on a dirt road beside a muddy river  jack looks 
back  failing to take a corner 

ext river  night

the truck flies off the road splashing into the river

jack and ann brace themselves as the truck lurches to a halt  it 
lies half submerged in the river beside an old wooden pier the water 
level is just above the bottom of the trucks windows within seconds 
the water fills the cab up to their necks

the first military vehicle roars past  but the second stops our old 
friends  soldiers 1  2 get out and approach the pier

jack
whisper
get out  stay under the pier

before they can move a large crocodile suddenly lunges at ann its 
snapping jaws thrust in through her side window

ann falls back into jacks lap  the crocs shoulders are too wide 
for the window  it gets wedged snapping at ann inches short of her 
nose more crocodiles descend on the truck clawing at jacks window 
and the windscreen  it threatens to break under the strain

a flashlight beam plays on the car  the two soldiers approach 
holding rifles

yelling
shoot them

more crocs scramble onto the tray snapping through the broken rear 
window jack and ann huddle together their mouths at water level 
teeth snapping all around them jack can see the two soldiers through 
the side mirror  theyre enjoying the show  cracking a private joke

yelling

the two soldiers dont respond

yelling

in a singapore bank i want you to have it

two soldiers warily approach their rifles trained on jack

jack contd
i know you guys arent sadistic evil scum i know youre really good 
boys at heart and i want you and your families to get some pleasure 
from my lifetime of hard work

jacks pov the two soldiers edge closer along the pier totally 
prepared for any trick jack might pull  behind them  a huge fat 
croc has climbed the river bank and is waiting stealthily onto the 
pier

jack contd

dont get him mixed up with sulkin khan  the guy works at the next 
desk and is a total asshole wont give you anything

the soldiers nod  the fat croc is getting near but moving very 
slowly ann too is watching the approaching croc through the mirror

a snapping croc nips jacks shoulder drawing blood he gasps

jack contd
ill give you the account number you should write it down  one  
seven  guys im real worried youre going to forget this ive got 
enough stress at the moment  write the damn thing down

soldier 1 lowers his rifle and pulls a notepad out of his pocket  
just as 

the fat croc charges he covers the last few feet moving at lightening 
speed he takes soldier 2 in his jaws and with a flick of his tail 
sweeps soldier 1 into the water all the crocs leave the truck and 
descend on the thrashing soldier like a pack of piranhas

ann grabs the floating map pushes the door open  she and jack 
quickly wade to the bank the water behind them a churning maelstrom

singing withdrawing her fathers silver fobwatch from her jacket

darrow benefit screening well invite the king of england  hell 
well get the whole royal family along itd be good for them and good 
for us

seven years ago i picked up a castaway  the skipper of a norwegian 
barque

the group listen to englehorn in silence

englehorn contd
i have never seen a man so mentally ravaged he had gone blind not 
through any injury but because his mind could no longer deal with the 
terrible sights he had witnessed i sat with him during his last night 
on earth listening to his fevered whisperings he spoke of sailing 
into a thick fog and of running aground on an uncharted island he 
spoke of a huge wall built by a long forgotten civilization and of a 
creature  neither man nor beast  that lived behind that wall  of the 
thirty crewmen who made it ashore he was the only one who looked into 
the eyes of the beast and survived

ann instinctively grasps jacks hand

if we sail into that fog it will be the death of us all

like creatures perched along a rotten mainspar

occasional areas where stones have fallen in

collectively gasp at the sight of over a hundred mummies lining the 
walls they are all neatly arranged in alcoves and are dressed in some 
kind of ceremonial clothing  a huge statue of kong stands sentry at 
the far end of the chamber  which clearly carries on through another 
archway the place has the atmosphere of a cathedral

ready

wider a steadily increasing group of skull island natives are emerging 
from the thick undergrowth between the ruins denhams eyes flick left 
and right as he becomes aware that his small party is becoming 
surrounded

the skull island natives are similar to solomon islanders their skins 
are very dark their features broad  but that is where the melonesian 
likeness stops  like the architecture their dress headwear and 
weapons suggest an inca or egyptian level of culture but with a 
fierceness or even violence suggested in their design this is not 
afro and grass skirt territory  these people are scary  we will 
refer to them as natives 

the natives have their weapons poised  a tense moment it could go 
either way denham offers his hand to the lead native

hi carl denham  hows it going do you boys mind if we do a little 
filming

the lead native raises a knife  denham blanches  fingers tighten 
on triggers 

the lead native produces a leather gourd and stabs it milky liquid 
flows out he takes a mouthful and offers it to denham

 walk into a large chamber about the size of a squash court daylight 
floods in through openings carved in the representation of the eyes 
nose and mouth of a skull  the mouth being the doorway which leads 
straight into the heart of the native city the ritualistic sounds are 
very loud

the group hurry across the chamber and peer out of the doorway careful 
to remain concealed  they stare in wonderment at the sight ahead 

ext native city  day

spectacular ruins surround an open square  it is filled with natives 
 in the midst of a weird ritualistic ceremony  a young woman sits 
bedecked in flowers atop an altar in the center of the square 

 dwarfing all else is the wall it rises directly from the square 
towering 5 stories into the air a stone structure with ornate 
carvings and decorated with huge tusklike bones and bronze kong 
figures in the center of the wall is an enormous 40 foot wooden gate 
strongly built and very old from the vines and weeds that grow from 
cracks it has clearly not been used for many years the wall is not 
vertical on this side  it slopes like the pyramids allowing quick 
access to the top

jack frowns  denham englehorn herb and the two sailors are taking 
part in the ceremony they are totally out of it  denham is stripped 
down to his boxer shorts and gartered socks he is in a frenzied dance 
with 2 native girls drinking greedily from the gourd milky fluid 
spilling down his chest  englehorn is on his knees in some kind of 
fervor maidens smearing paint over his bare chest a witchdoctor 
piercing his nose with a ring herb and the two sailors are in similar 
states of drug induced delirium

the natives suddenly drop to their knees all facing the young woman 
who remains strangely serene they start chanting softly  kong  
kong  kong

whispering
she looks like a bride  is it a wedding

clubs quickly closing in on denham englehorn herb and the two sailors 
 who are still off their faces oblivious to their own impending 
deaths

too late sailor 1 is clubbed to the ground jack targets another 
native about to kill englehorn 

bang the native is shot off his feet  the ceremony suddenly goes 
quiet without the incessant noise we can clearly hear denham singing 
a music hall tune

jack steps out into the square swinging the rifle from side to side 
 the loud gunshot has stunned the natives but jack knows they 
havent got much time

ext native city  night

close on ann  she is being prepared for sacrifice natives are 
holding her arms  a bridal headdress is placed on her head 
covering her hair she is in the middle of the crowded square lit by 
flaming torches

she closes her eyes  strangely subdued

the witchdoctor dances in front of her flicking oils from a small pot 
over her body

ann suddenly lashes out she kicks the witchdoctor in the nuts 
simultaneously pulling her hands free and running through the crowd 
towards the beach

she only gets 5 paces 

ann is tackled and roughly hoisted onto the altar her hands are tied 
securely to 2 ornately carved pillars tears flood into her eyes

kong  kong  kong the chant begins

natives start turning a huge wheel and the altar starts to climb the 
slope towards the top of the wall moving on tracks like a primitive 
cable car

close on native faces screaming and chanting building up to a frenzy 
they climb the walt behind ann carrying flaming torches

native sounds fade away  beautiful sad music drifts in giving the 
sequence an ethereal atmosphere

ext walljungle  night

ann is weeping as the altar reaches the top of the wall for the first 
time we get a glimpse of the other side 

the wall falls away vertically into a rocky grotto that leads into the 
dense tangled jungle of s island

the altar stops on top of the wall over 100 natives arrive just 
behind ann and spread out along the parapet 2 natives in ceremonial 
costume kneel beside the altar quickly and expertly adjusting bolts 
and levers  they signal back down to the square 

ann gasps as the altar suddenly lurches out over the edge of the wall 
it is being slowly swung out over the grotto by a pair of cantilevered 
arms hinged at the base of the wall

close on native torches light pools of oil contained in cavities at the 
top of the wall small dams are released allowing the flaming oil to 
flow down chutes and channels cleverly cut into the cliffs on either 
side of the grotto

the flaming oil ignites larger pools in huge hollowed out chambers 
within the cliffs  carved into the shape of skulls the skulls burst 
into glowing life  just like 40 foot high halloween pumpkins

 

wide shot ann looks tiny atop the altar which has almost reached the 
ground  the enormous glowing skulls illuminating her  the wall 
towering up behind her natives line the top of the wall holding fiery 
torches the altar settles into neatly carved recesses

the huge gong starts tolling 

ann is facing the inky black jungle  she is panting hard trying to 
face her death with as much composure as she can muster

a loud splintering sound comes from within the jungle something very 
big is moving towards the grotto

natives chant kong  kong  kong

ann instinctively pulls at her bonds  to no avail she can now see a 
dark shape approaching her oily smoke from the fires drifts across 
obscuring her vision  she can now only hear the footsteps it is a 
huge creature breathing heavily  it stops in front of her  smoke 
still blocking her vision  she looks down  a giant leathery foot is 
visible she looks up into the murk  tears roll down her cheeks

the natives suddenly go silent

kong  a 25 foot silverback gorillaa his fur is matted ancient 
scars mark his body  evidence of life and death struggles with unknown 
beasts his face is aged  silver hair predominant he is resting on 
his knuckles

kong rises on his hind legs and beats his chest  ann screams

all the natives launch into their piercing monkey screech  it winds 
kong up he leans down roaring only inches from anns face then 
suddenly starts pacing furiously from side to side  like a caged 
animal he roars at the natives atop the wall

kong suddenly charges at the wooden gate he crashes against it 
causing the entire wall to shudder violently  a native loses his 
balance and topples off he thuds into the ground at kongs feet  
kong quickly scoops him up and bites his head off in a pg 13 kinda way

the natives roar like spectators in a gladiators arena

kong leans over ann  the strength suddenly drains out of her legs 
and she slumps between the pillars kong reaches forward and with an 
almost delicate touch he lifts her in his hand she screams as she 
rises into the air  towards his mouth he roars at her and turns 
abruptly back to the jungle

the natives chant kong  kong  kong

suddenly bam bam bam natives topple in a burst of gunfire

ext native city  night

jack is leading the charge into the ruined city 40 guys  most armed 
with tommy guns  are blazing in all directions the natives flee in a 
mad panic as jack runs straight for the gate

he rushes up to a small observation grill 

jacks pov kong disappearing into the jungle clutching ann  she is 
screaming and kicking

jack turns back to the sailors 

jack

jack backs away from the wall and starts firing his tommy gun at the 
bolt securing the wooden gate other sailors join in splintering the 
timbers in a hail of lead

ail 40 sailors push the huge gate and it slowly opens exposing the 
jungle beyond denham runs up sweating and panting

ext skull island jungle  night

beyond the great wall skull island is like no place youve ever seen 
before 

the volcanic rocks form a jagged tortured landscape of deep asses and 
towering cliffs the vegetation is thick the jungle dark ancient 
knarled trees twist out of the ground thick lichen and long mosses 
hang form branches and tangled vines steam rises from festering 
swampsps  deeper into the island the steam is volcanic  hissing 
out of fissures and bubbling mud pools the way light and contrast 
plays on the landscape is reminiscent of the etchings of 19th century 
artist gustave dore

it is into this jurassic park from hell that jack leads denham and 
the party of twenty sailors herb is limping along with the heavy 
camera  tripod on his shoulder

denham suddenly looses his footing and sprawls on the ground  his 
eyes widen at the sight of the deep kong footprint he has just stepped 
in

denham

everyone suddenly has their fingers on the trigger eyes nervously 
scanning the thick jungle

a noise cracking branches  heavy footsteps the sailors panic the 
start firing in all directions the flashes from tommy guns and rifles 
blinding in the darkness

jack
yelling
hey stop cut it out

silence  smoke drifts away from the guns as the group listens for 
sounds 

like a pair of mighty trees being felled two dead prehistoric 
creatures  30 foot tall lambeosaurs suddenly topple out of the gloomy 
foliage and thud to the ground in front of the startled sailors

they warily approach the dead dinosaurs

hey i thought these things were supposed to be extinct

on his knuckles 

ann looks up at kong  she doesnt move  he leans over her and 
roars ann suddenly scrambles to her feet and runs within seconds kong 
has

overtaken her and blocked her path  ann turns and runs in the other 
direction again kong blocks her path  it is clear that he is playing 
cat and mouse

ann trips on something and falls over  a human ribcage juts out of 
the muddy ground ann sobs as she sees all around human bones some 
still encased in the remnants of bridal dress and headwear 

this place is kongs killing ground

kong scoops ann up  lifts her towards his mouth she screams and 
struggles in his grip his mouth opens and she kicks and beats his 
fingers in a seemingly hopeless attempt to fight for her life

suddenly  the native headdress falls off her long blonde hair falls 
onto her shoulders

kong suddenly pauses  ann is frozen  she is looking into kongs 
eyes trying to anticipate his next move

ann
scarcely audible
lullaby and good night go to bed and sleep tight

ext skull island vista  dawn

the sun rises over the rocky crags of skull mountain

ext pinnacle valley  morning

close on kongs footprint  in a sandy driedup stream bed jack 
looks up at the direction kong has taken 

the tracks head towards a sheer cliff on the side of a narrow dry 
valley an area deep in the heart of skull island dominated by 
spectacular pinnacles of stone jutting out of the ground like giant 
fingers the valley is less than 75 feet wide flanked by sheer 
seemingly unscalable cliffs

jack wipes the sweat from his brow looking for a possible route up the 
cliff further down the valley denham and the sailors are grouped 
around the camera 

close on an ankylosaur is being pelted with stones 

herb is filming whilst denham and the sailors try to coax some action 
out of the slowwitted cowsized dinosaur  it staggers around in 
confusion

denham
frustrated
peopleil think its a goddamn guy in a suit

denham suddenly gets an idea 

denham contd
 
hey i gotta great idea we could turn this place into a huge amusement 
park sorta like coney island with dinosaurs
excited
its a goldmine ill cut you boys in for twenty percent were gonna 
be rich

the sailors cheer

jack
hey

jack is yelling from up the valley waving for the group to join him

jack contd
this way come on

frowns at jack

denham
lets keep this between ourselvesassholes are not included

sailors laugh

at that moment  the ground trembles

the sailors look around  alarmed jack almost loses his footing as the 
ground under him literally bounces he looks up the winding valley 

a dust cloud suddenly spills out from around the next corner  
immediately followed by the breathtaking sight of a herd of twelve 
brontosaurs running in a wild panic down the narrow valley a pack 
of 15 carnotaurs  9 foot tall meateaters  are pursuing them

spectacular tracking shot with the stampede  a carnotaurus leaps 
onto the back of a fleeing brontosaur causing the it to falter and 
slide against the cliff two more carnotaurus leap onto the ailing 
brontosaur as the rest of the pack stream past

jack turns and starts running the stampeding dinosaurs are stretched 
across the valley behind him less than fifty yards away and closing 
jack runs down the rocky slope towards denham and the sailors  who 
seem to be frozen in fear

jack
yelling
run

everyone turns and flees guns and equipment are abandoned  herb 
hoists the tripod  camera on his shoulder and limps after the others

jack is running as fast as he can  he glances over his shoulder  
the walt of thundering brontosaur legs are about to engulf him jack 
changes direction slightly to make sure he is between dinosaurs  
they overtake jack and he suddenly finds himself in a sea of huge legs 
like wildly pounding redwood trees the carnotaurs are snapping and 
snarling at the legs  they see jack his only hope of survival is 
too stay within the stampede out of reach of the meateaters

peek is running faster than the others he is way ahead still clutching 
his tommy gun  as the stampede engulfs denham and the other sailors

quick images 20 sailors in the sea of legs  a sailor trips and is 
crushed under foot a couple of sailors lump clear of the brontosaurs  
only to be set on by the carnotaurs denham  herb    sailors 
everyone is running madly dodging brontosaurs carnotaurs and trying 
not to trip

a carnotaur focuses on jack  it skillfully weaves in between and 
under brontosaurs and emerges right behind jack its snapping jaws 
inches away from his head jack suddenly sidesteps bringing the 
carnotaur right along side  he shoulderbarges it sideways  under a 
brontosaurs legs the carnotaur is instantly trampled

peek is managing to stay ahead of the stampede  possibility running 
faster than any human before him a carnotaur races out in front of the 
stampede and bears down on peek with incredible speed peek desperately 
waves the tommy gun back towards the carnotaur towards the stampede

jack sees it coming 

jack contd
yelling
no

peek fires missing the carnotaur 

 but he hits the lead brontosaur in the chest the brontosaur 
collapses at full speed it cartwheels over its huge neck and tail 
thrashing out the other brontosaurs plough into it tripping and 
rolling

jack denham and the sailors suddenly find themselves in the middle of 
an amazing fleshy freight train pileup sailors are crushed as 
brontosaurs come down on top of them a carnotaur is squashed when two 
brontosaurs slam together

jack throws himself onto the ground rolling against a rock as 
mountains of brontosaur tumble all around him the space of seconds 
the mighty herd of behemoths is reduced to a vast pile of dead or 
wounded animals  the carnotaurs immediately go to work leaping onto 
brontosaurs ripping into fleshy stomachs

amazingly jack denham herb and at least 9 sailors have survived  
however they must now escape from the blood crazed meateaters

jack crawls past huge heaving bellys and twitching legs  he looks 
around for some escape route  he spots peek  desperately scrambling 
up a steep rocky slope it leads to a narrow fissure in the cliff  a 
possible way out

jack staggers out of the dinosaur pileup  he turns back at the 
sound of loud hissing  a carnotaur is climbing over a dead brontosaur 
intent on jack  he can do nothing the carnotaur leaps 

bam bam bam the carnotaur is suddenly riddled with bullets and falls 
dead at jacks feet

kurt hurries towards jack clutching his tommy gun

kurt
ill keep the bastards at bay

jack nods  he waves at surviving sailors that are emerging from the 
pileup

jack
yelling
this way

surviving sailors scramble past jack and head up the steep slope 
denham puffs his way past  not looking at jack  totally focused on 
personal survival by some miracle herb limps out of the pileup 
covered in dust but still carrying the camera  tripod on his 
shoulders

kurt blasts at a carnotaurs  it topples backwards he turns to jack 


kurt
go jack

jack heads up the slope kurt backs away  two carnotaurs suddenly 
charge at him he fires the tommy gun shredding them with bullets but 
cannot react fast enough when a third attacks from the other direction

kurt screams briefly as he falls to the ground under clawing feet and 
snapping jaws

the four surviving carnotaurs head up the slope

jack
hurry 

jack and the others are desperately scrambling up the steep shale slope 
 loose stones that are impossible to get a grip on  sailors start 
sliding backwards in their panic the carnotaurs are sliding too but 
their powerful legs are working furiously propelling them closer and 
closer to the flailing sailors

a sailor loses his footing completely  he rolls past two carnotaurs 
before being grabbed by the jaws of the third

the sailors grab hold of weeds rocks  anything to get away from 
the dinosaurs they move into a network cf narrow fissures between 
pinnacles  the carnotaurs can barely squeeze through

one sailor is trying to escape up a sheer rock face  he slips and 
falls back into the carnotaurs clutches

the sailors reach safety  a narrow fissure  too small for the 
carnotaurs  leads into steamy jungle beyond the vatley jack looks 
back 

herb is struggling a carnotaurs snapping at his heels jack climbs 
back down the slope to help pull him up the carnotaurus lunges at 
herb grabbing his foot in its jaws herb screams and rolls over on 
his back the camera on his chest the carnotaur is crushing his ankle 
between its teeth luckily its herbs artificial leg

denham looks at the frantic struggle

another carnotaur is scrambling up behind the first  jack rushes 
forward scooping up a large boulder he smashes it down on the 
carnotaurs head it releases herbs foot and rolls away down the 
slope collecting its buddy on the way

scramble to safety through the fissure

 dead twisted trees stick out of the surface  a thin film of fog 
hangs in the air small flying lizardtype things flit about from tree 
to tree

the first raft reaches the shore  a narrow sandy beach leading into 
gloomy dense jungle

water me the pole driscoll seems to be on the verge of a breakdown 
 he steps towards jack nearly tipping the raft over jack throws 
the pole at him and tries to balance himself

yelling

tipping it over

the swamp is about 8 ft deep  the jack denham and the three sailors 
fall straight to the bottom as if weighted

stringy 5 foot weeds rise from the bottom like tentacles jack looks 
around  the water is dark and murky the sailors are trying to kick 
back up to the surface with no luck  for some reason this water has 
zero buoyancy

suddenly a terrifying creature emerges from the gloom it is some kind 
of prehistoric axolotltype thing with wide teeth it is about 25 foot 
long  the size of a huge white shark

with a frightening grace the axolotl sweeps a sailor up in its jaws

two more giant axolotls glide out of the gloom another sailor tries 
to run but is taken by the second axolotl

the third axolotl comes straight at jack he throws himself down and 
the creature glides over the top of him jack gets back on his feet  
he does the only thing he can to escape  run for the shore along the 
swamp bed pushes through the thick forest of weed his cheeks bulging 
as he struggles to retain his air suddenly something grabs his ankle

jack looks down at denham  he is desperately clinging onto jacks 
foot an axolotl suddenly sweeps by causing jack to duck he grabs 
denhams arm and starts dragging him through the weeds

survivor from the clear of the water  the raft crawls onto the beach 
too herb has his tripod set up and is filming it all

jack is gasping for air  denham lies moaning

an axolotl rockets out of the water these things have legs and it 
scuttles towards the group with incredible speed within seconds it has 
grabbed the sailor survivor in its jaws and disappears back into the 
swamp 

another axolotl charges out of the swamp  it comes straight at herb 
who has no choice but to abandon his camera and quickly back away  
the axolotl lunges at the camera  tripod swallowing it with one gulp

bam bam bam peek blasts the axolotl with his tommy gun it slumps to 
the ground dead   its mouth hanging open

herb

holds his feet and pushes him down the creatures throat

in wet moss and quite slippery he is totally vulnerable  he watches

behind a bulky lichen covered stump he carefully sneaks a look at kong 
 who is still peering over towards the log

ext swamp beach  day

de peek and the last 4 sailors are still on the swamp beach gathering 
what remains of their equipment together

they turn in unison  as a triceratops lumbers towards them along the 
beach these are 30 foot long rhinolike dinosaurs denham and the 
sailors step back warily as the triceratops slowly wanders past them 
 not paying them any attention

close on the triceratops innocently steps on peeks tape recorder 
instantly crushing it

bam bam bam the triceratops fatts dead  peek advances forward 
his tommy gun smoking  a look of disbelief on his face as he looks 
at the mangled remains of his beloved equipment

peek
that cost me seventyfive bucks

peek kicks the dead triceratops

an anguished bellowlow whip pan onto 3 more triceratops including a 
large bull roaring with grief

denham and the sailors react with horror as the triceratops charge  
they move with surprising speed  huge horns lowered for the kill

bam bam bam peek fires but the bullets ricochet off the bony frill 
that surrounds the triceratopss head

the group turns and flees into the jungle

ext jungle glade  day

kong and react to the sounds of gunfire and men yelling kong snarls 
 he scoops ann up and places her high in the branches of a dead 
tree some 30 foot off the ground

kong bounds away towards the chasm

ext log chasm  day

jack is still clinging to the log  he turns at the sounds of the 
approaching sailors 

peek rushes out of the jungle first followed by denham the sailors 
and 3 angry triceratops a sailor trips and is immediately engorged by 
a triceratopss horn

peek races onto the log in a blind panic followed by the 3 surviving 
sailors and denham  peek only just realizes jack is in his way and 
almost collides with him  peek looks up suddenly and screams

whip onto

kong standing at the end of the log bridge towering above peek he 
beats his chest roaring fiercely the sailors are trapped on the log 
bridge between the enraged triceratops on one side and the enraged kong 
on the other

kong reaches dow and lifts his end of the log bridge jack denham and 
the 3 sailors cling on for dear life  peek desperately leaps from 
the log and clings onto vines hanging over the cliff on kongs side of 
the chasm

kong vigorously twists and shakes the log bucking the men into the 
air  jack manages to hang onto the stump but behind him sailors are 
falling off

bottom of chasm sailors plummet to the bottom  one sailor crunches 
onto rocks but the other two have their falls broken by a thick 
network of vines and appear to land relatively unhurt

jack and denham cling on  kong roars with frustration and hurls the 
end of the log into the chasm denham  who is close to the far side  
manages to leap to the bank but jack rides the log down

crash the log smashes into the rocks and jack flies off it  he 
bounces off vines and lands on the ground stunned

a sailor is crawling along the ground with a sprained ankle 

suddenly a round dirt lid  larger than a manhole cover  pops open 
and a huge door spider darts out it grabs the sailor and drags him 
screaming into its lair the lid neatly closing again

jack scrambles to his feet ail around monstrosities of nature emerge 
from dank burrows and crawl towards him and the last surviving sailor 
 these are huge insectlike things  combinations of spiders crabs 
mantises and centipedes

jack snatches up a long stick and uses it like a spear to fend these 
creatures off he looks on helplessly as the sailor attempts to climb 
the wtt out of the chasm but slips in the pincers of some 
crabspider thing

a group of spiders with 7 foot leg spans close in on jack behind them 
hangs a long vine leading directly up to the top of the chasm  jack 
charges at the spiders leaping as high as he can he lands on the back 
of the first spider and using the bounce he propels himself onto the 
back of the next and the next  like a series of minitramps he 
leaps off the last and grabs hold of the vine pulling himself away 
from the frenzied spiders

jack is climbing hand over hand 

suddenly he starts rising fast 

kong is perching on the edge of the chasm pulling the vine up  like 
a fisherman reeling in a catch

jack is helpless

ext jungle glade  day

ann looks around feary from her perch  high in the branches of the 
rotten tree  she has heard the screams but has seen nothing

a huge shape moves beneath her  ann freezes at the sight of an 
allosaur entering the clearing this is a 25 foot tall meateaters  
skull islands most fearsome predator

the allosaur snatches a dead raptor off the ground and crunches it in 
powerful jaws  it pauses as if sniffing the allosaurs head is 
only a few feet below ann  she is too scared to breathe

the atjosaur suddenly looks up  straight at ann he immediately 
circles the tree in big powerful strides  ann shifts her position to 
keep the allosaur in sight  it is clearly getting very agitated

with an almost delicate movement the allosaur nudges the trunk with 
its head  the tree lurches dramatically ann hangs on desperately 
 the allosaur pushes her sending the tree toppling to the ground

ann rolls away from the tree jumps to her feet and runs

she races through the jungle dodging trees leaping over fallen logs 
smashing through bushes  the allosaur pounding after her it s 
breath rasping    footsteps thumping the huge jaws open  only 
inches from anns head 

she screams

ext log chasm  day

kong has almost reeled jack in when he hears anns scream

he immediately drops the vine sending jack plummeting back down the 
chasm fortunately the coils of loose vine at the top of the chasm 
tangle stopping jack with a jerk about half way down

kong rushes off towards the sounds of anns screams

ext dense jungle  day

ann is stumbling  the allosaur positions its head for the final 
lunge  jaws open 

from out of the dense jungle  kong charges he meets ann and the 
atjosaur headon at full speed kong swings his fist smashing into 
the allosaurs head  ann has to throw herself against a tree as the 
dinosaur sprawls onto the ground beside her  in a flash kong is on 
top of the allosaur pounding his fist down 

the allosaur lies still  anns legs turn to jelly and she collapses 
kong is clearly startled  he gently takes her in his hand 

at that moment the second allosaur attacks he comes charging into 
shot grabbing kongs arm in his jaws kong roars ripping free just as 
the third allosaur strides into the clearing the first allosaur 
scrambles back to its feet kong holds ann protectively as he braces 
himself for the fight of his life the three allosaurs circle around 
him

they attack kong and ann  what follows is a breathtaking fight to 
the death kong fights like a madman  not only does he have to do 
battle with the allosaur he is also protecting ann  constantly 
transferring her from one hand to the other as the allosaur snap at her 
throughout

kong punches and smashes with his fists but he also uses wrestling
style headlocks and flips  for a brief moment ann rolls free on the 
ground and has to dodge 25 foot dinosaurs and the goritj as the 
frenzied fight thunders all around her

the first allosaur is taken out when kong pulls a large jagged tree 
trunk out of the ground and rams it into the allosaurs mouth pushing 
it out the back of its head

the second allosaur he kills by grabbing it in a headlock flipping it 
over his shoulder but reversing direction suddenly  breaking its 
back with a sickening crunch

ann is suddenly grabbed by the last allosaur she is taken in his jaws 
 it bites down  just as kong grabs his jaws in both hands he rolls 
the allosaur onto its back ann still wedged in its mouth the razor 
sharp teeth dig into her as kong desperately uses all his strength to 
force the allosaurs mouth open  ann slides out raking her back 
against the teeth

kong forces the jaws open until they rip apart at the hinge the 
allosaur sprawls back dead

kong is panting heavily  he has been bitten raked and cut he puts 
his foot on the last allosaur and beats his chest triumphantly

ann is hurt  bleeding  kong carefully picks her up and hurries 
into the jungle

 

ext log chasm  day

jack is clinging onto the vine trying to pulling himself onto the top 
of the chasm  but his strength is weakening  just below the edge

peek leans over  he looks terrified still gripping his tommy gun

jack
urgent

for a moment youd think peek is actually considering the idea of 
kicking jack back down into the chasm  he reaches down the pulls 
jack to safety

ext junglemountain  day

anns pov  upside down shot whipping through foliage with long 
loping strides

ann is draped in kongs hand as he powers through the jungle at high 
speed she is weak  her eyes glazing sweat dripping from her brow

anns pov  becomes more fevered

kong climbs out of the jungle scaling a nearly sheer cliff  he uses 
one hand to climb  the other holds ann to his breast

as kong climbs higher and higher ann drifts into unconsciousness  
her last fevered pov being that of the vertigo inducing drop down the 
face of the cliff

ext kongs lair  evening

fade up 

anns fevered pov kong pacing anxiously  he leans down towards  
roaring nervously behind him the sky his bathed in an orange sunset

wide kong is in his lair  a large round cave with a ledge that juts 
out high over skull island  in fact his cave is one of the eyes of 
the skull visible from the coast over the ledge is a dizzying drop of 
at least 1000 feet down to the jungle

the venture can be seen  moored off the tip of the island some 3 
miles away

sinister battype creatures hover in the skies  these have 8 foot 
wing spans and taloned feet their faces are more reptile then bat

ann is lying on a bed of straw in an alcove on the ledge  one of the 
batthings swoops in 

anns fevered pov  large flapping bat wings fill her vision

kong snatches the batthing out of the sky and rips its wings off he 
gently lifts ann and retreats further inside his cave

ext wallruined city  night

englehorn puffs on his pipe  sailors armed with rifles and tommy 
guns are patrolling the wall the area is effectively cordoned off 
everyone is relaxed

sentry sailor
yelling
hey somebodys approaching

sailors rush to pull the great gates open 

denham staggers in and collapses he is even more disheveled than when 
we saw him last his clothing is torn  blood seeps from cuts  
hes lost the gun

englehorn gives him a drink from a canteen denham is gasping heavily

englehorn
just take it easy  where are the others

denham
panting
they re dead

englehorn
shocked
oh my god  ann

denham pauses 

denham
quietly
shes dead  driscoll too weve gotta get back to the ship

englehorn nods

englehorn
yelling
prepare to break camp men were heading back to the venture

theres a sense of relief amongst the crew two sailors lift denham up 
and support him between them

at that moment a zipping sound fills the air  a volley of arrows 
darts and spears fly towards the sailors within seconds 7 sailors fall 
dead including the two supporting denham he runs with incredible 
speed and throws himself behind a wall englehorn and the 12 surviving 
sailors take shelter and fire wildly in all directions

denham
panicked
weve gotta get outta here
grimly
thats going to be more difficult than you think 

numerous heavily armed natives are fleetingly visible  darting 
behind ruins and trees  cutting the sailors off from the beach

ext kongs lair  night

anns fevered pov surreal images of kong statues  of flapping bat
things  of allosaur jaws  of fiery carved faces  and finally 
of kongs eyes  staring lovingly at her

dissolve to

ext kongs cave  early morning

close on  ann she wakes up looking rested and calm

it is clear that her fever has passed

wider  ann is cradled in kongs hand he is lying on his side 
asleep  holding ann close to his face like a child would sleep with 
a teddy bear kong stirs suddenly opening his mouth in a huge yawn he 
opens his eyes and for a few quiet moments he and ann stare at each 
other

kong sits up placing ann on the ground  they are deeper into kongs 
cave ann can see that the back of the cave leads to a way out as 
daylight streams in a small but deep lake fills part of the cave 
surrounded by smaller rock pools

kong sits on his haunches looking for all the world like the king of 
his domain a shadow flutters over ann as a batthing makes an attempt 
to grab her  kong reaches forward and snatches it out of the air he 
bites the head off the batthing  rips off one of its legs  
drops the bloody leg on the ground in front of ann

ann looks aghast at the offering as kong eats the rest of the batthing 
with a certain amount of relish she backs away from the meat  kong 
leans forward and pushes it closer to her ann steps away and shakes 
her head

ann
no  thank you

kong shakes his head  and pushes the meat closer  ann holds her 
nose and p a face kong puts a finger up to his nose and pulls a face 
he pushes the meat closer  ann takes a big step backwards and  
trips over a rock kong looks alarmed for a moment

ann contd
im ok  see 

ann stands and with great dramatics she deliberately falls over kong 
gets excited  he slumps backwards against the wall  ann stands up 
and with a squeal she goes into a forward roll kong is highly 
excited he rolls forward on his side

ann laughs at him  she does a cartwheel kong paces from side to 
side like an overexcited kid he suddenly turns and disappears out of 
the back entrance of the cave

ann is a little nervous  she clutches her shoulders against a cold 
rush of morning breeze  she hears a fluttering of batthings wings

kong hurries back into the cave he holding a tiny object between his 
thumb and forefinger with great delicacy he drops a ripe mango at 
anns feet ann bites into it suddenly realizing how hungry she 
actually is

ann contd
eating
good more more

kong acts coyly at this praise  he rushes out of the cave again  
returning with the entire mango tree which he drops at anns feet 
ann laughs and kong rolls forward  out onto the ledge

in the distance we can see the venture and just hear the distant 
sound of sporadic gunfire from the native city

kong sniffs the morning air  he frowns  suddenly gets agitated 
kong looks up 

 over 20 batthings are massing on the cliffs above the lair 
clearly preparing an attack to get ann

kong races into the cave just as another 20 batthings flutter in 
through the back entrance he scoops ann to his breast roaring 
defiantly at them

close on a narrow fissure in the volcanic rock towards the back of the 
cave jack and peek are hidden from view as batthings flutter above 
them peek looks around terrified  jack spies on kong and ann

the batthings suddenly attack en mass they swoop on kong and ann 
like a swarm of giant bees kong roars and thrashes out at them in the 
frenzy with every sweep of his arm several batthings are knocked to 
the ground kong keeps moving twisting and turning to make it harder 
for them to get at ann  she presses herself close to kongs chest 
batthing talons strike at her slashing kongs fingers instead

with the batthings totally occupied jack takes his chance to get 
closer to ann  he leaves the shelter of the fissure and hurries 
across the cave ducking into the shadows on the far side he crouches 
behind a rock but is totally vulnerable

several batthings are gripping and clawing kongs back in an effort to 
weaken the huge ape  he suddenly pounds his back against the walt 
of the cave squashing them all

the batthings wheel away from kong hissing angrily  16 lie on the 
cave floor stunned or dead they flutter around preparing their next 
attack kong swipes at batthings that get too close

peek hears a noise  he turns and whimpers at the sight of a bat
thing peering at him through a crack in the rock the batthing 
screeches  attracting others they cant reach peek but that 
doesnt stop him dissolving into a frightened panic sweat spills down 
his face  he claws at the floor of the rock fissure  picks up a 
rock

peek throws the rock across the cave towards jack

peek
panicked whisper
get him

the rock clatters at jacks feet some batthings react to the noise 
 they swoop towards jack

jack runs across the cave  talons reach for his head  jack 
suddenly throws himself forward 

 diving into a deep rock pool

underwater jack holds himself under the water as talons claw at the 
surface a couple of feet above his head

the batthings are working themselves into a frenzy diving at the 
rockpool  diving at kong and ann

peek is left alone  he sees his chance to escape quietly climbing 
out of the fissure peek turns to flee out the back entrance of the 
cave 

he runs straight into the enormous jaws of an elastomosaur  a large 
seaserpent dinosaur with a long neck

the elastomosaur has emerged from the lake having crawled up onto the 
shore  it lifts peek high into the air he s as the jaws crunch his 
torso

all the batthings instantly dive towards peek  in a frustrated 
bloodfrenzy they rip into peek and the elastomosaur

kong snarls  he places ann on the cave floor  under an overhang  
and charges at the batthings

kong thunders past the rock pool just as jack surfaces gasping for air 
 he scrambles out racing towards ann

ann
 amazed
jack

jack embraces ann

theres not much time  kong is preoccupied swatting batthings at the 
back of the cave  jack desperately looks around for an escape route 
 nothing but a 1000 foot drop off the ledge into the jungle below 
they are trapped

at that moment a stunned batthing beats its wings and lifts off the 
cavern floor  jack runs leaps and grabs its feet

jack
urgent
ann grab my shoulders

ann hesitates  the batthing flaps furiously trying to lift jacks 
weight off the ground  it drags jack towards the ledge

jack contd
yelling
jump on 

kong sees jack  he charges towards the ledge

ann is torn  she looks at jack  looks at kong 

jack contd
yelling
ann

ann runs towards jack and throws herself forward hanging onto his 
waist  just as kong reaches out for her 

jack hangs onto the taloned feet as he and ann sail out into space the 
batthing flapping madly above them  they descend rapidly  about 
twice the speed of a parachute ann buries her face into jacks waist  
not wanting to look back at kong roaring with grief from the ledge

ext river  day

the batthing wobbles crazily in 5he sky rapidly losing energy  
jack looks down a fast flowing river is 50 foot below he releases his 
grip

ann screams as she and jack fall into the river  they are 
immediately picked up by the current and swept away jack grabs ann 
under the arms and hangs onto her tightly

in the distance  an enraged kong is quickly descending from his 
mountain lair

dozens of natives sailors empaled with spears and arrows its like a 
scene from the movie zulu

blocks atop the great walt denham englehorn and three sailors are 
looking exhausted and defeated denham fires at a group of natives with 
a tommy gun  it empties

grimly

pov two boatloads of reinforcements from the venture are rowing 
towards the beach

its too late 

a massive tide of 300 natives are advancing towards the wall denham 
englehorn and the sailors reach for whatever weapons they can find

at that moment

jack doesnt notice the battle debris  he pushes the gates closed 
yelling for imagined help 

jack
urgent yelling

jack turns  is confronted by the sight of 300 natives closing in 
around them  the natives have abandoned the attack  all eyes are on

recites some complex incantation

denham and englehorn stare in disbelief

englehorn
they think anns a demon

jack and ann are backed right against the gates the natives are 
pushing closer and closer to them  they raise their spears ready to 
thrust them into jack and ann

kong roars jack hears his footsteps pounding towards the gates at 
high speed jack grabs ann and pushes her along the walt just clearing 
the gates as 

kong crashes through the gates are smashed off their hinges  7 
story tall gates  weighting 35 tons  land on the natives with a sound 
like someone stepping on eggshells

kong strides into the square beating his chest and roaring

denham
holy shit

the surviving natives scatter kong rampages after them stomping on 
them and biting their heads off  in a scene that not only gets a pg 
13 but is praised by the mpaa for its sensitivity

denham englehorn and the sailors take their chance to slip away 
towards the beach

jack pulls ann away from the gates slipping behind cover to avoid 
being seen by kong  they run through the giant carved head  into 
the tunnel complex that leads to the beach jack snatches a native 
spear off the ground on the way

a few brave native warriors hurl spears at kong  but they either 
bounce off or only just penetrate the skin

kong picks up a large bronze kong statue and hurls it at a group of 
spear throwers perched atop a stone building

jack and ann are racing through the mummy chamber when the statue 
smashes through the roof ann stumbles and rolls kong roars as he sees 
her through the demolished roof he reaches for her sweeping mummies 
onto the floor with his groping hands

throwing spears and shooting arrows they thud into his chest  he 
pulls them out charging the natives in a fury

englehorn and the 3 sailors come running out of the jungle behind them

screaming

jack and ann race out of the tunnels and onto the beach  just as 
kong charges up behind them they get halfway across the sand before 
kong scoops ann up triumphantly he strides past jack  without 
hesitation jack throws the spear with all his might  into the back 
of kongs leg just behind the knee

kong roars in pain as his leg collapses  sending him sprawling on the 
sand  still clutching ann protectively

denham leaps out of the boat brandishing a new tommy gun staying out 
of reach he aims at kongs head  squeezes the trigger  ann 
screams

denham hesitates  as if a sudden thought enters his head he swings 
the aim onto kongs knees  and fires

kong roars he releases ann onto the beach sailors leap out of the 
boats as denham starts clubbing kong with the gunbutt

the sailors attack kong clubbing him on the head with gunbutts and 
oars

leaps out of the cab and flees into the night

and smashing his fists on them panicked drivers pile into each other

wheels are spinning wildly at the moment the cab touches down on the 
street  in a cloud of burning rubber the cab rips free of kongs 
grip speeding down the road weaving in and out of the path cut by 
kongs destruction

kong bounds after the cab running on fours with incredible speed

jack crosses an intersection driving up on the sidewalk to get a 
clearer driving lane  pedestrians scatter  not only from the cab 
but from kong who is in hot pursuit

the cab slews across the street disappearing up a tiny alley only 
just wide enough for the cab but too narrow for kong

jack glances back at kong roaring with frustration at the alialley 
entrance

ann groggily wakes  as jack steers the cab wildly through ailses of 
clothing scattering shoppers in all directions

kong crashes into the shop in pursuit the 15 foot height is too low 
for him to stand but he bounds along on his knuckles

jack sends the cab into a couple of tight turns  at the speed kong 
is traveling he slides on the polished floors at each turn wiping out 
an area the size of a tennis court before regaining his grip

jack rounds a bend and drives straight into a camping equipment 
display  tents collapse  covering the cab before it slams into a 
wall jack and ann are thrown forward on impact

kong slides around the corner and bounds past the covered cab  he 
desperately looks around for jack and ann  getting anxious and 
enraged kong smashes his way out of macys into 35th street

jack watches ann disappear into the night  tears well up in his eyes 
 for a moment he angrily fights them off

the battlefield 

jack slides down the wall of the empty street head in hands sobbing 
loudly

ext midtownstreets  rooftops  night

kong is moving along a rooftop  about 10 stories high he is holding 
ann close to his breast he looks down at the streets  now largely 
deserted all around him the manhattan skyline resembles some gaudy 
primeval landscape

suddenly   

bam bam bam  heavy machine gun fire ricochets all around kong 
roars  ann clutches his fingers as he bounds along the roofs at high 
speed a searchlight suddenly swings onto kong from below 

army vehicles are racing along the quiet streets  an armored car is 
firing at kong  followed by a truck carrying a mobile searchlight

the streets are teeming with these vehicles as the army spreads out 
across town in the hunt for kong

as bullets whizz around him kong leaps across the street  10 stories 
high he lands on the opposite rooftop and bounds away 

another searchlight finds him  and another the army are closing 
in machine gun fire rips past him as he leaps another great distance 
across the street ann clings on her eyes tightly shut

armored cars and mobile searchlights coverage on kong  he has run 
out of rooftop  ahead of him across the cavern of 34th street 
rises the sheer wall of the empire state building

kong leaps across the chasm crashing into the side of the empire state 
building glass rains down 12 stories to the street as kong uses 
windows for hand and foot holds he is onehanded  his other hand 
still holding ann protectively to his chest

four searchlights swing onto kong  a mobile antiaircraft gun 
screeches to a halt on 34th street this is obviously the armys 
killing weapon of choice within seconds the large gun targets kong 

pov looking up crosshairs at kong high on the side of the building  
a total sitting duck

gunner

the gunners laugh  the commander raises his binoculars to watch the 
spectacle

out over the street

his fur

state building

he wanders down an empty street  a few abandoned cars are dotted 
around but all is quiet his shoulders are slumped his stride falters 
 he looks like a broken man

the street he is outside a cinema showcasing some new epic movie 
about world war one flying aces an overly romanticized poster features 
a jean harlow type in an embrace with a pilot

the streets are wet  lights glisten off the surface jack pauses  
glancing at the reflection 

pov wet street  the underside of an airplane is reflected in the 
water

jack slowly looks up 

two old airplanes have been strung high across the street to promote 
the movie  a fokker triplane  and a sopwith camel

the sopwith camel lands with a bounce on the street jack has released 
the support ropes  he hurries over to the plane quickly assessing 
its condition

distant plane engines

looking at manhattan from the harbor  the empire state building 
rises from the midtown area like a giant solitary finger reaching for 
the heavens

six naval biplanes suddenly roar into shot sweeping low over the 
downtown business district  and closing in on kong these are two
seaters armed with twin machineguns for the pilot and a flexible 
machine gun for the observer

a cold wind blows anns hair as she stands on the lip of the dome 
watching the planes approach kong is uneasy about these buzzing 
predators as they circle above him

smoke  and roars into life

road he offers it to jack

the kid steps back clutching the envelope as jack opens the throttle 
the engine winds up and the sopwith camel starts moving down 39th 
street

it builds up speed very quickly racing past abandoned cars and 
buildings  the tail lifts off the ground 

suddenly

a military vehicle drives across an intersection directly in front of 
the plane jack pulls back on the stick and the sopwith camel lurches 
into the air it skims over the vehicle climbing into the air rapidly

down on the dome circling

 lining him up in their sights

at that moment  jacks sopwith camel zooms right past kong and ann 
flying straight at the naval planes jack is visible in the cockpit 
hair blowing in the wind

yelling

the naval planes are forced to scatter in all directions as the tiny 
sopwith camel meets them headon

jack turns tightly and flies at the regrouping naval planes sending 
them into disarray

lead pilot
over rt

the six naval planes fly at kong from different directions machine 
guns start firing jack throws his plane around like a madman trying 
to deflect their aim

kong roars and snatches at the naval planes as they zoom by  he 
flinches as he is hit by btulets ann screams

jack dives at a naval plane causing it to turn sharply straight into 
kongs grip kong grabs the naval plane ripping its wings off he 
hurls it down towards the street

jack nearly hits the lead pilot who desperately veers away

lead pilot contd
over rt
lets take this guy out

the naval planes open fire on jack  he dodges around the sky 
avoiding streams of tracer fire  nearly hitting the top of the 
chrysler building

jacks luck runs out  the sopwith camel shudders as bullets smash 
into its engine black smoke streams out as jack quickly loses 
control

jack knows its all over  he grimly steers his crippled plane 
straight at a naval plane attacking kong 

with a crunch jacks wheels clip the naval planes wing sending it 
spinning out of control the naval plane smashes into the side of the 
empire state building

jacks sopwith camel flips on its back 

cruummp kong grabs jacks plane he waves it above his head jack 
falls out of the cockpit he slides down kongs outstretched arm 
rolls on his shoulder and just manages to grab the fur on kongs back  
preventing a 1000 foot fall to the street

ann
 shocked
jack

jack dangles and swings as kong continues to swat at the attacking 
planes machine gun fire strikes kong in the back just below jacks 
feet kong slumps giving jack the chance to roll off his back  jack 
lands on the dome sliding towards the edge

ann reaches out grabbing his hand she pulls jack to safety

at that moment  kong picks ann up jack can only watch as kong 
tenderly holds her  the great ape is weakened by bullet hits and 
clearly in pain  yet he looks mesmerized at ann as her long blonde 
hair blows in the wind

the naval planes are regrouping in the distance  the four remaining 
planes turn towards kong and form a straight line

lead pilot

down with the ape here we go

he very gently lowers ann and returns her to jack jack holds ann 
tenderly as she starts sobbing

kong looks fearfully at the approaching planes  he is breathing in 
gasps  very distressed

ann
kong look at me  please

kong looks at ann  he gently touches her hair she clutches his 
fingers hugging them trying comfort him tears stream down her face 


all sound fades away  except for a gentle breeze 

ann contd
singing softly
lullaby  and goodnight go to bed and sleep tight 

the fear leaves kong  he looks at ann with tenderness and love she 
fights back the urge to burst into tears

ann contd
singing softly
close your eyes start to yawn pleasant dreams until dawn

close on kong  he suddenly winces sound crashes back in  with the 
deafening roar of the planes flying past

for one last precious second ann hugs kongs hand  he slowly topples 
back  disappearing off the side of the building

ann sobs with grief  jack gently takes her in his arms  she 
buries her face in his chest

ext fifth avenue  morning

crowds are gathering to stare at kongs body  we only see his hand 
on the edge of frame

a policeman ushers people away 

policeman

sadly
