close shot of tom grunemann attractive young
executive sitting at the head of the dining room
table carving a turkey for thanksgiving day dinner

pans around the table revealing the happy family
and guests among them are klute and cable

camera stops at mrs grunemann who sits at the foot
of the table opposite her husband she smiles
across at him with pleasure we cut to tom
grunemann smiling back at her we cut back to a
closeup of mrs grunemann  looking back at her
husband with love we cut back to tom grunemanns
chair  only now it is empty the joyous sounds
disappear on this cut it appears that tom
grunemann has disappeared before our eyes one
moment he is there and the next moment he is gone
the camera pans back down the table only now it is
empty except for grunemanns children and mrs
grunemann she is now dressed in something dark
she and the three children sit eating another meal
in emptiness she has changed from a joyous woman
to a woman bereaved

into frame glancing perhaps idly a little
impatiently in this direction at some loud
industrial goingson just beyond camera then

int research plant directors office  day

camera pulls back inside window to klute staring
outside as if still pondering the fate of tom
grunemann the group in the office includes ross
holding a report trask a new york detective
cable and the plant director streiger

			ross
	 has disclosed no evidence of
	crime or criminal intent within the
	jurisdiction of this bureau and
	since subject thom 

			cable
		turns sharply
		interrupts
	its been almost a year tom
	grunemanns been missing for a
	year and all the fbi has to offer
	is a report that must bore even
	you

			ross
		restraint
	well sir

			streiger
	are you closing the case

			ross
	no sir we dont state that were
	countin 

			cable
	but you dont find it worth much
	effort

			ross
		injured dignity
	well mr cable youve got me here
	from the bureau you got lieutenant
	trask here from new york
	representing his department and i
	dont frankly consider 

			streiger
		moderating suggesting
	why couldnt you ever find out
	anything from the girl

			ross
		refers the question
	trask 

			trask
		summarizes from notes
	we first hold her under
	surveillance expectin your boy
	grunemann to show up there didnt
	then we bagged  we arrested her
	on a cp charge convicted two
	months womens city prison offer
	to reduce sentence she cooperated
		counts
	four interrogations she thought
	she remembered grunemann  from
	those letters from before she made
	that connection  but she hadnt
	seen him since and couldnt
	identify his photograph and she 

			streiger
	why not

			trask
	oh a good call girl shell turn
	sixseven hundred tricks a year
	the faces get blurred
		resumes
	and since then recent months
	shes reported several you know
	incidents like breather calls
	anonymous phone calls also
	somebody maybe following her
	watching her things like that so
	its i guess you could say
	conceivable grunemanns still
	around there just hangin around
	her spooking her but you know
	that 

he shakes his head gestures doubtingly ross caps
it

			ross
	the subject got emotionallv
	disturbed he just dropped out

	position ours is a little
	different we have an investment in

			ross
	private investigation you mean
	yes sir of course youre entitled
	and theres some very competent 

			streiger
	klute offered us his services
	weve accepted

uneasy

and sipping from a carton of milk he is obviously
a man pressed for time klute sits beside him
across from them some prisoners are taking their
exercise through the metallic netting that
surrounds them we see the skyline of new york

caged

purple the record player stands on the altar over
the crowd pews are massed around the dance floor
stained glass windows are lighted from behind and
are circled with light bulbs that flash on and off
for all of its obviously bizarre visual quality
there is a sense of relaxation it is a late night
gathering place of many who belong to the sexual
underworld of the city

bree and the other girl advance to a pew a man
sitting there the other girls pimp with a third
girl brees companion greet him shyly tenderly
she and bree sit down join in conversation

vestibule of the crurch

among the people around the bar pimps whores and
a sprinkling of hopeful johns and curiosity
seekers the camera picks a familiar face cable
he watches bree with a mixture of amusement and
contempt a girl comes over to him and tries to
proposition him they appear to be discussing
price just as she thinks it is set he walks away

figure in evening dress bree gets out approaches
the building glances around either secretly or
apprehensively  presses a buzzer waits gets
answering clicks enters the dark hallway of the
building starts upstairs

ext across the street  night

klute shifts into view looking in the direction
brees gone a little puzzled all in all he
doesnt immediately follow he waits

int garment building  cutting rooms  night

we look past racks of clothing as bree arrives up
the dark stairway into dark rooms  the scene
mysterious a little sinister she seems fearful of
it herself advances slowly looking around calls 


			bree
	hi 

angle past mr faber to bree

mr faber is silhouetted for a moment standing
watching her from along an alleyway of garments
she sees him is startled then relieved

			bree contd
	oh 

he moves toward her

reverse angle to mr faber

mr faber is a man of 65 or so rather handsome
and for this occasion very spruce very erect very
nattily turned out bree complains cheerfully

			bree contd
	you scared me mr faber

he smiles kisses her cheek tests the fabric of
her evening dress  in passing as a matter of
expertise

			mr faber
	good material not too good cut
	id do better for you

then he turns lifts down a womans dress cape
carrying it  graciously gestures her to precede
him 

corner of cutting room

a dim pool of light here a private area here
sectioned off by rows of garments a couch rug
coffee table a chair or two  a place for buyers
to take their ease bree and mr faber enter her
manner is suddenly elegant assured regal his
befits a man of the world he fits the cloak around
her shoulders and gestures to the couch she sits
he pours a glass of wine for her for himself she
speaks with a neat continental accent  doing it
fairly well really  a member of the
international set

			bree
	oh thank you

he sits in the chair opposite sips his wine

			mr faber
	enjoy
		then
	well 

			bree
		diffident
	its good to see you well  could
	we do it first and then just talk

			mr faber
	sure dear yes

			bree
	well  well im just back and 
	i must tell you  something quite
	wonderful

			mr faber
		intently
	yes

			bree
	and cannes was quite fun quite
	and we played baccarat and
	chemindefer and there was a nice
	little italian marquis quite
	enthusiastic for me  but a young
	man can be so silly 

			mr faber
	mm

			bree
	and then one night  at the gaming
	tables  well i just saw him a
	stranger  looking at me  and i
	knew suddenly that all my life id
	been 

she hesitates strangely her fingers at the neck of
the cape faintly 

			bree contd
	 may i its so 

			mr faber
		quickly
	please 

she stands unloosing the cloak letting it fall on
the couch but she doesnt sit again  begins to
move here and there about the enclosure her hands
wandering about her dress and body  an erotic
restlessness

			bree
	not young he wasnt young  gray
	at the temples he  well actually
	he looked like you

			mr faber
		tensely
	yes

			bree
	and nobody could tell me who he was
	 an exiled prince or a mercenary
	or a bullfighter or  but i felt
	it stirring inside me this  this
	wild pagan feeling 

ext garment building door  night

klute arrives from across the street it takes him
a while with a loid probably to slip the lock
he eases door open moves inside 

int corner of cutting room bree  night

bree is farther along in her narrative more
fervent in manner mr faber sits at the edge of
his seat ducking his head now and then in
pleasure but making no move to molest her

			bree
	and next day at the beach  our
	beach pavilion  i saw him again
	his eyes burning into me i was
	helpless without his even speaking
	to me without his even touching i
	knew that somehow  somehow 

she casts away an accessory garment mr faber
burns her with his eyes 

int garment building  cutting rooms  night

klute mounts into view at the head of the stairs
prowls along the aisles of clothing looking 
sees 

pov past garment racks to mr faber

klute sees mr faber first  clearly a senior
citizen  sitting transfixed fastened in some
private dream then bree drifts into view  stands
 lets fall the evening dress about her ankles
poses  drifts out of view again 

klute

klute watches in that direction a moment longer in
his expression a certain curiosity  a prurience 
but rather more strongly disappointment a measure
of disgust not his affair he turns away from it
into camera and 

ext brees brownstone  night

near the entrance outside the door to klutes
apartment below we open on bree she shouts
angrily miserably 

			bree
	whynt you just cut out

we widen to include klute now she begins to get
it he turns opens door to his room below she
comes slowly down steps

int klutes room  day

she steps in the door looks slowly around at his
various appurtenances  the bed the necktie over
the mirror etc  and then the tape recorder and
then the stack of tape boxes softly venomously 

			bree
	oh you bastard

but then she adjusts  a frightened but matterof
fact hooker 

			bree contd
	is it the shakedown hon you picked
	a loser i just dont have it

			klute
	no im look 

			bree
		vehemently again
	if i was taking calls full time
	would i be living in this kip id
	be back on park avenue i could
	support the whole national guard

			klute
		gestures upward
	could i ask some questions

			bree
	or youll get me shoved back in the
	brig you mean another month with
	the bulldykes

she seems to have expressed it the balance of
power she turns goes out heads upstairs klute
unhurriedly takes up his folder of notes then
follows

int brees apartment  night

bree disposes her belongings klute moves to table
there is a group of plants on the table that long
since died of neglect he notices them and the
disorganization of the room without comment opens
his folder rummages for the photographs then
exasperatedly 

			bree
	look i told the police everything
	i dont even remember the schlub

klute doesnt respond klute sets out a photograph
for her to look at

insert photograph tom grunemann

klute bree

			bree
	they showed me that one i

meaning we dont know what he tosses another

questioningly

			klute
	company outing or picnic or
	something like that

			bree
	isnt that sweet
		then
	well it could be any one of them
	bubi i get to see them all

she separates from klute around the table but
remains standing restless klute puts photo
aside prepares to take notes as she pleads 

			bree contd
	look  please  will you just try
	to get it from my side a year ago
	i was in the life fulltime i was
	living on park with leather
	furniture and a million dresses
	then they dropped on me the fuzz
	they caged me  they started
	asking me about a man some man
	im supposed to have seen a year
	before that two years ago two he
	could be in yemen

she waits for klute to respond  he doodles
permissively on his pad of paper  she goes on

			bree contd
	a name grunemann nothing and
	they showed me pictures like this
	and they meant nothing then they
	asked me well had i been getting
	letters from someone out there in
	cabbageville 

			klute
	 tuscarora 

			bree
	all right yes i had been those
	sick wild letters  im watching

	you kill you et cetera well they
	said all right thats grunemann
	so try to remember when you and he 
	 when  well i dont know there

	like that dumper 
		explains
	dumpers they get their kicks
	beating you up a man hired me
	once then tried to really kill me 
	 thatd be about two years ago

without warning she wheels to the open windows and
shouts out fullvoiced  both startling and
somewhat intriguing klute 

			bree contd
		shouts
	ok tommybaby allieallieinfree
	kid i got the gumdrops

turns around again to klute cheerfully 

			bree contd
	you remind me of my uncle

			klute
	what
		then 
	what do you remember about that 
	dumper

			bree
	nothing except he wasnt kidding
	usually its a fakeout you
	probably know they pretend to tie
	you up and you wear a dress with a
	cloth belt and they pretend to whip
	you or you 
		beat
	hell its their money ill hang
	from the shower rod and whistle
	maytime except this guy was really
	tripped out on it he 

			klute
	but you cant say that dumper was
	tom grunemann

			bree
	i cant say he was anybody

a brief pause klute sorts his notes she may take
it that hes packing to leave  hopes so anyhow
for an instant we see the undefended girl
underneath 

			bree contd
	so  ok  thats all

then again she changes manner  remembering a
practical problem approaching it as a matterof
fact hooker

			bree contd
	well could i have them back now
	hon  those tape recordings
	youve got downstairs  ok  and
	if you want you can have a good
	time and ill have a good time and

			klute
	what about everything since

she draws back again up to now shes been
reasonably on top of things starting now we see
her driven toward the things shed really rather
not talk about  and increasingly more shaken

			klute contd
		prompts
	everything thats happened since
	tom grunemann disappeared the
	phone calls and the 

			bree
	just phone calls right they ring
	you answer they dont say
	anything just blank kids getting

the phone rings she startles then approaches with
some difficulty  but then answers with complete
calm in her smithgirl voice

			bree contd

broken she hangs up recites

			klute

him by trask in the same manner as before 

			klute

			bree
		trembling
	look im sure thisll amuse you
	too ilia trying to get away from

	what about the old gentleman the
	other night mr faber

she freezes again looking at him then savagely 

			bree
	you saw that goddamn you you saw

	he started cutting garments at
	fourteen his whole life hes
	maybe had a weeks vacation im

she chokes  then goes on 

			bree contd
	klute tell me whats your bag

	things 

she grabs up the company picture raging on 

			bree contd
	 you perverted hypocrite square
	bastards

			klute
	ok

something in his inflection  very slight 
cautions her she falls silent as suddenly as she
began then cheerfully 

			bree
	gee i hope this doesnt make my
	cold any worse

			klute
	tell me about frank ligourin

			bree
		casual pleasant
	mm oh he was my old man we broke
	up

she wanders away toward a bureau her shirt seems
to itch her she scratches her ribs then opens
drawer takes out a different shirt as 

			klute
	when
		beat
	when did you and ligourin break up

she pulls off her shirt unhooks her brassiere and
discards it apparently quite unselfconscious
klute reacts then carefully maintaining his cool 


			klute contd
	mind not doing that

she turns to him in total innocence holding the
shirt rather carelessly in front of her  a new
attack

			bree
	what this

			klute
	 ok

			bree
		ingenuously
	i thought you could trick me for
	those tapes dont you get lonely
	in that little green room or let
	me get you someone i have terrific
	friends wild

			klute
	no thanks

at this point  or about this point  klute takes
note of something a little above her he grows
more watchful but containing it carefully we
dont understand the change in his manner  or
even notice she doesnt in mock dismay 

			bree
	gee ive had men pay two hundred
	dollars for me  here youre
	turning down a freebie
		pause
	you can get a perfectly good
	dishwasher for that

he has risen is approaching her slowly  carrying
his notes as if to check something she is hopeful
again 

			bree contd
	youve changed your mind you do
	want to play

			klute
		quietly steadily
	i dont want you to look up
	theres someone on the skylight

she gasps terrified  immediately  almost
beyond control he taps the pencil on his notes

			klute contd
	easy  pretend youre looking here
		more insistently
	 here

she manages to take hold of a corner of the notes
trembling he goes on 

			klute contd
	now im going to walk around  you
	just keep talking straight
	through straight through

he strolls away from her his destination is the
area of the door  out of view from the skylight 
from where he can head for the roof but he doesnt
head that way directly  first takes a turn in
another direction his bearing casual prompting 

			klute contd
	tell me about acting  what are
	you doing tomorrow  where do you
	go

			bree
		manages barely
	i go on rounds

			klute
	rounds what are they  dont
	watch me keep talking

			bree
	you go see agents  or equity
	calls open casting calls and ad
	agencies  commercials  you
	dont get work you just go around

klute has strolled out of view from above 
instantly flattens himself against the wall eases
the door open about to slip and charge as bree
labors on 

			bree contd
	and theyre always polite  show
	people  they say thank you very
	much you lie there covered with
	blood smiling they say 

int landing and ladder to roof  night

footsteps across the roof above as the watcher
discovers klutes ruse klute opens the door 
climbs ladder to roof

ext rooftops  night

 klute out looking around 

ext rooftops past klute to fleeing figure  night

the figure  the man  scissoring over the low
walls where one brownstone joins another klute
gives chase  over ridges past water tanks
oddments of roof furniture 

ext several rooftops beyond  night

the figure races to a roof door disappearing into
abandoned building

int stairwell  abandoned building

camera follows klute as he cautiously makes his way
down the stairwell of the boarded up old
brownstone he gets to the first floor he can see
no exit in the building he opens door that leads
to a narrow staircase into the cellar

int cellar  abandoned brownstone

it is as black as a dungeon and as low he lights a
match but sees no one there is a sound of
movement coming from the floor above he runs up
the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint
light coming through one of the closed apartment
doors carefully takes out a gun and then with one
quick movement he breaks through the door

int abandoned apartment

the walls ceiling floors are entirely covered
with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings
the room is lighted by some candies stuck in
bottles sitting on a blanket on the floor are
several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party
they have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves
in the abandoned house it is a moot point whether
they or klute is more stunned at the sight that
faces them he puts his gun away in embarrassment
again he has been made to feel like an awkward
peeping tom in this hidden world of the city

int cellar  abandoned building

camera wanders restlessly through the blackness and
stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low 
door camera goes through opening into long narrow
furnace room with the ceiling so low that an
ordinary man could not stand up we hear the sound
of breathing camera follows the sound through the
darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the
corner looking like some strange animal from a
painting by bosch it is cable

int brees apartment  night

bree has wrapped herself in the quilt  standing
up against a corner shivering immobilized we hear
klutes footsteps descending  she flinches  he
enters

			klute
	i couldnt get him

he sees her condition gently 

			klute contd
	its all right

he reaches to touch her  she quails away from
him

			bree
	well do you think it was him

			klute
	what do you think

			bree
	cant you get him

			klute
	maybe if you tell me the things
	you havent

			bree
		pause
	you asked me where i got that date
	with the dumper  frank sent me on
	it

			klute
	do you know where he got the
	dumper

			bree
	he never told me

			klute
	well lets go down and ask him

door closing it behind them

int hallway outside ligourins apartment  day

hand comes into frame and removes the tapes

			bree
	oh lover  oh you thrill me  oh
	its beautiful  oh yes yes  oh
	like that like that yes 

					  dissolve 

faces

klute gasps deeply  entering orgasm as soon as
she hears it judges it she drops her hands from
his shoulders stills her own movements lies
utterly passive smiling calmly letting him finish
for himself he cant stop  cries out  cries
out again burying his face against her  is done

then he slowly raises up shuddering looking down
at her he knows what shes done to him is
helpless to do anything back he rolls slowly out
of the embrace of her legs and lies silently 
looking upward very much as we saw him at start of
scene

favorivg bree

she waits still smiling for a while but shes
not done with him yet she rolls to lie with her
upper body on his trailing her fingers across his
face affectionately as a good whore

int another late night spot  night

we dolly with klute  bree as they walk in front of
a row of tables this night spot is totally black
except for a series of huge slide projections on
the wall in back of the tables the slides which
change every few seconds are elegant
representations of the beautiful people living the
good life as seen in such magazines as vogue town
 country  harpers bazaar the customers sitting
in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to
the pictures in back the silhouette figures of
bree  klute stop at a table seating three people
two call girls and a pimp camera moves in

			first girl
	arlyn page

			second girl
	youll never catch up shes
	grooved out

			bree
	gil

the pimp looks distrustfully at klute who reassures


			klute
	im not looking for her personally 
	 someone she might know about

			pimp
		shrugs to bree
	try janie dale

int janie dales penthouse

it is a very small penthouse klute  bree stand in
the small living room waiting for janie dale there
are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting
around the living room one sits at an upright
piano playing of all things strangers in the night
another one sits on a couch talking to a wall
street broker who is spending his lunch hour klute
finds himself staring down into a pile of
pornography magazines on the coffee table bree is
amused at his discomfort
janie dale the madame who has been on the phone
in the back puts the receiver down and crosses to
the girl on the couch janie looks and talks a bit
like lauren bacall

			janie dale
		to girl on couch
	its old mr clean from cleveland
	he wants to know when he can fly in
	and clean up the apartment and see
	you i told him i have all the
	cleaning equipment and that he can
	come anytime but its up to you

girl on couch rises

			girl
	you know he wants us to be
	dominant

			janie dale
	tell him that hed better have his
	ass in here by one oclock on
	monday afternoon or you wont let
	him clean the bathroom floor and
	tell him the price has gone up
	twenty bucks  old dutcn
	cleansers not as cheap as it used
	to be

she shrugs and turns to klute  bree

			janie dale contd
	you wanted to know about arlyn
	honey i had to let her go dear
	arlyn stopped being reliable
		explains to klute
	i deal with a high type client
	business people you understand i
	cant send them someone thats all
	the time half zonked out

			klute
	do you know where she went

			janie dale
	try momma reese

this is a cheaper apartient than janie dales

the girls look cheaper and the customers rather
than wall street lawyers and brokers look more
like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor
inns

momma reese is older than janie dale heavier and
with no pretense at chic she indicates that she
has not seen arlyn in some time

			momma reese
	try bill azure if you can find
	him

int eight avenue bar  about 4 in the morning

this is a hangout where black and white pimps wait
to meet their whores after their night of street
walking this streetwalker world is far removed
from the world of the call girl or the world of
janie dale camera pans past a group of pimps at
the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the
most money that night camera then goes on to
reveal klute talking to another pimp azure azure
represents a clear step down from frank ligourin 

we catch only part of their dialogue

			azure
	 a couple weeks then shed drift
	off a couple of weeks you know
	what i mean

			klute
	have you heard from her recently

			azure
	she liked me all right but she had
	what she liked better you know

 and cut to 

int lingerie shop proprietress bree klute

			proprietress

ext outside adult movie theater klute
streetwalkers  day or night

outside theatre or bookstore  peepshow an 8th
avenue establishment silent action this or voices
under klute confers with one girl who summons and
consults another they seem to know of arlyn 
havent seen her recently  refer him elsewhere 

ext apartment house mrs vasek klute  day

a shabby place in a shabby neighborhood mrs
vasek the landlady shifts barrels at the same
time that she barks at klute in heavy accent

			mrs vasek
	the whore yeah i threw out

			klute
	do you know where she went from
	here

			mrs vasek
	live like animals her and the man
	out

			klute
		reacts
	was she living with a man

we see klute persisting  dissolve

ext wide shot slum street  day

we still hold wide to establish the scene this is
a genuine slum we see bree klute move along
street we see bree drop back a little klute
waiting for her to catch up

ext street bree klute

			klute
	whats the matter

			bree
		glances about
	what the hell do you thinks the
	matter
		then suggests
	i could wait for you someplace

			klute
	if arlyn page is living with tom
	grunemann 

			bree
		eagerly
	 then you dont need me

			klute
	but if its someone else i do

he starts on simply assuming that shell follow
there is a degree of acquaintanceship in their
manners now  a reluctant collaboration

			bree
	you sure pull a lot of mileage out
	of a hundred dollars

 and follows on he checks numbers then crosses
street diagonally toward a halfframed house

int newark house  day

a downshot from second floor level toward the entry
way where klute  bree appear klute strikes a
match to inspect the names of tenants he and bree
climb through stench and litter to the second floor
 a door from somewhere near at hand come the
sounds of someone retching a square of wood has
been sawed out of the door itself removing handle
and lock  light sifts through klute hesitates
decides against knocking pushes in

int arlyns apartment  day

the retching sounds are coming from the connecting
room no one visible here a very few barren pieces
of furniture we hear arlyns voice ask from the
next room 

			arlyn os
	cappy

arlyn enters rather eagerly she sees klute first
then bree  recognizes her  retires flat against
a wall holding one palm outwards to shield her
face she is unbelievably gaunt inside one elbow
looking rather like a birthmark we see a lacework
of purple where her veins have pulped together

			bree
	arlyn honey
		then
	look its all right

from the connecting room a mans voice bergers
calling out hoarsely

			berger os
	is it cappy cappy 

			bree
	arlyn its all right

berger hastens stumbles into the doorframe
carrying a carradio with wires dangling speaks
before he sees them

			berger
	cappy i got a radio

he stops for an instant facetoface with klute
then turns plunges out of view again arlyn breaks
after

			arlyn
	no 

we hear the mumble and whisper of their voices from
the connecting room as she reassures him bree
looks inquiringly at klute is that grunemann he
shakes his head pause then arlyn reenters
wrapping her fingers together timidly  wanting
them out  her only purpose

			arlyn contd
	bree  honey  please were
	waiting for someone

			bree
	arlyn he just wanted to ask some
	questions  something you could
	help us about

			arlyn
	cant you see im strung out
		cries out
	please were waiting for it 
	hes got to have it

			klute
	well go just something you could
	tell us first

arlyn seems to accept the bargain he indicates to
bree to proceed stands away a little arlyn covers
her elbow with one hand bree manages as best she
can

			bree
	honey a couple of years ago with
	jane and frankie  jane sent me a
	dumper 

			arlyn
	please if he sees you he wont
	come

			bree
	arlyn just tell me did jane have
	a dumper one of her regular johns

			arlyn
	what about him yes

			bree
	did he come around often

klute hands grunemanns picture to bree bree shows
it to arlyn arlyn inspects it then uncertainly
weakly 

			arlyn
	no he was an older man hon the
	dumper was older

			klute
	do you remember his name what can
	you tell me about him

we hear footsteps  under dimly  mounting the
stairs bree notices them first klute persisting
with arlyn 

			berger os
		shouts desperately
	arlyn get them out

			arlyn
	please i am begging you

			klute
	its important

			arlyn
	thats not the dumper thats all
	he was an older man

			klute
	can you give me any more
	description than that

arlyn catches the footsteps dodges past him toward
the door intending to reassure 

			arlyn
	cappy 

 as the pusher cappy steps in all of this is
very quick simultaneous a confusion of voices
cappy takes one look at klute 

			arlyn contd
	its all right theyre all right 

 turns and runs

			berger os
	cappy  cappy

cappys footsteps race away down the stairs berger
plunges out from the connecting room still
carrying the car radio shouting pursuing 

			berger contd
	cappy its all right i got a radio
	 dont run dont 

we hear him stumble and fall on the stairs outside
the sound of body reeling down arlyn shrieks and
races after klute and bree follow

int house lower hall  day

we see berger lying at the foot of the stairs as
arlyn clatters down toward him berger sways up
onto his knees his nose is bloodied he cries
arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him pulls
his face against her croons to him soothes and
tends him

			arlyn
	oh baby  no its all right  oh
	my baby baby baby 

klute and bree are only a halfstep behind klute
offers to assist arlyn puts him away ferociously

			arlyn contd
	get out
		to berger again
	dont cry my baby ill find him
	ill get it baby baby dont cry
		to klute savagely
		incoherently
	leave us alone get out and get out
	and leave us alone
		to berger
	my honey my baby my baby 

we dissolve to 

int subway train reflection in window of bree and
klute sitting side by side

camera moves in closer so we only see reflection of
bree looking at herself and at the world seeming to
speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the
tunnel zoom past her face what she sees is the
figure of a woman with life screaming past her out
of control

int subway

subway slows to a stop and a door opens bree sits
with klute staring at the open door and then
without warning  gets up and runs off the train
the door closes leaving klute locked in the train

subway exit

shot of brees feet rushing up the stairs in
darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits
the sunlight she pauses for a moment  relieved to
be out of the darkness

ext rooftop of brees brownstone  night

camera pans from night view of new york city to
klute sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to
comprehend all he has seen the mystery of tom
grunemanns disappearance in this world and the
mysteries of the behavior of bree

skylight into brees apartment  night

alongside of him the skylight of brees apartment
lights up he looks through the skylight and sees
bree enter her apartment he can hear bree talking
to somebody and then he sees that she is talking
to frank ligourin

klute watches through the skylight and hears bits
and pieces of the scene between bree and frank he
sees the same kind of symbiosis the same kind of
parody of loving that he saw between arlyn 
berger as the scene becomes more intimate he
leaves

int cables city office on klute  day

the pristine antiseptic elegance off cables
office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized
as the sexual underworld klute has been exploring
with bree and klute looks as out of place in the
one as he does in the other trask sits beside
klute facing cable who is impeccably dressed he is
the total image of the executive in control

			cable
	she wouldnt be reliable anyhow 
	a narcotics addict

			klute
	i believed her pete

			trask
	hes right you know waiting for
	the pusher shed tell you
	anything

			klute
	i believed her the dumper was not
	tom grunemann

			cable
	all right suppose it wasnt tom
	grunemann where does that get you

			klute
		smiles ruefully
	its where it doesnt get me ive
	got nothing left that connects to
	anything

			cable
	then close the case

			klute
	i better keep looking

			cable
	where how

			klute
		the best he can offer
	i could try arlyn page again she
	saw much more of the dumper than
	bree daniel

			cable
	you just finished telling me she
	had nothing to offer not tom you
	said the dumper was clearly not
	tom

			klute
	its got to make sense some way

cables secretary appears for a moment tapping her
watch significantly

			secretary
	mr cable  they are meeting in
	mr camaras office

			cable
	yes evvie thanks gentlemen im
	sorry

they rise dismissed he sorts a paper or two
continues to klute

			cable contd

	things

			klute
	how is it back there

			cable
	i think youre homesick
		reflects
	ill be out at my camp over the
	weekend nice right now that touch
	of fall in the air that skim of
	frost in the early mornings very
	peaceful
		briskly again
	john ill be back here again
	thursday ill be in touch
	lieutenant thank you

klute and trask depart

cable closes the door and returns to his desk he
pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his
desk rewinds it and turns it on we hear a
playback of the previous scene with klute and
trask he stands at the window listening with some
satisfaction as if listening to what klute
revealed keeps him in control of the situation

ext window  cables office  day

the camera pulls back from a cu of cable standing
at the window to a wide angle looking at cable
through the window the window is 30 or 40 stories
high the wide angle lens almost makes the building
look like it is standing on point and cable a man
suspended in space

ext wide shot docks  day

a tugboat has pulled in the sound of its heavy
engines idling runs underneath this entire
sequence a police vehicle or two has parked at the
head of the dock we see several figures on the
rear deck of the tug but its not clear at this
distance what theyre doing the police car with
klute arrives he dismounts and proceeds from dock
to tugdeck

ext tugboat deck group  day

trask glances toward klute as he arrives but
doesnt greet him his attention like the others
is directed downward and

offscene to the surface of the water actually
just outboard of the tug we see beside trask two
uniformed cops sugarman and spence and deckhands
and we hear along with the throbbing of the
engines a stirring about of the water and a
peculiar third noise  rather commingled with the
engines  which we cant at first identify

klute joins the group watches

spence brings into view and shakes out a giant
neoprene body bag instructions among the group ad
lib under 

			trask
		toward klute
	they were bringing a freighter down
	through kill van kull propellers
	washed it up on top

sugarman brings into view a metal basket attached
with short ropes he complains 

			sugarman
	why didnt you bring it up on deck

			deckhand
	would you bring it up on deck

they slip the basket downward out of frame into
the water

			deckhand contd
		to other
	mickey get something get the eels
	off

			spence
		calmly
	theyll drop off theirselves when
	she comes out

we cut to 

berger  day

we see berger sitting huddled against the tugboat
cabin  we havent seen him before  with his
hands bunched in front of his mouth we identify
the noise which may have puzzled us before  his
sobbing

downshot surfaice of water basket body

we catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being
lifted just before it breaks the surface of the
water

favoring klute

klute looks on as effects trace the processing of
the body spence kneels down out of frame to slide
the bag around it trask kneels down to make a
brief examination  straightens again to klute 

			trask
	itll go to the examiner but i
	dont see nothin that means nothin

we move with klute as he turns and moves away a few
feet along deck here he stands then sugarman
moves into view holding a clipboard routinely 

			sugarman
	you help us with id we cant get
	nothin from him

he indicates the direction of berger klute
examines the clipboard data

			klute
	arlyn page was probably an alias
	she went by the names terry arlyn
	and june price she may have been
	from pittsburgh someone told me i
	can give you a list of people who
	knew her if that would help to 

			sugarman
	no point thanks

			klute
	is he claiming the body

			sugarman
	uh uh thatd mean funeral
	expenses

he spits moves back in the direction of the group
klute continues to stand berger moves in his
direction brokenly 

			berger
	man could you help me

klute doesnt understand his purport reacts
instantly sympathetically 

			klute
	yeah what

			berger
	you know help me out thats my
	baby there dead i got to get up

klute stares at him  a quiet horror  as berger
insists 

			berger contd
	man you dont know what that does
	to me my baby dead 

			klute
	 youve got to get up

			berger
	yeah

klute shoves a bill in his hand turns away very
sharply off the tugboat

ext dock klute  day

klute walks a longer distance this time sits down
on one of the pilings of the dock watching him we
see what might be a profound awe and grief at all
these things  but is in fact a good deal more

effects os as police vehicles are loaded driven
away and as tug toots runs up engines puts out
again

trask moves into scene sits on another piling
looks at him speculatively silence then 

			trask
	thats how the other one died you
	know in the water

			klute
		nods
	i looked it up

then  we are assuming a complete understanding
here between klute and trask nonverbal what
trask is asking in effect is is this meaningful
do we both suspect the same man

			trask
	well

			klute
	yeah

int brees apartment  day

it is late afternoon but bree is in her pajamas
curled up in her bed there are some magazines
scattered around the bed and the television set is
on an old movie there are cracker crumbs in the
bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut
butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on
the floor by the bed it would seem that bree has
spent most of the day in bed she looks like an
unkempt child the phone is ringing but she does
not answer it the phone no sooner stops than the
door bell rings reluctantly she gets out of bed
and goes to the door she looks through the spy
hole and sees klutes face she undoes two locks
and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the
door

			bree
	well hello  come on in

he barely enters the room his manner is cool and
remote

			klute
	i thought you ought to know arlyn
	page is dead

			bree
	how

			klute
	the same as jane mckenna

			bree
		she betrays no reaction
	thanks for the jolly news i
	thought maybe youd left town by
	now you kind of just disappeared
	but you boys from tuscarora have a
	habit of disappearing dont you

klute looks around the disorderly room the plants
in the windowsill have never been in worse shape
they look as if she deliberately let them die of
thirst

			klute
	the next few weeks i would like to
	know where you are all the time

			bree
		harshly
	why

			klute
	just let me know when you are going

klute goes

int klutes apartment  day

the empty apartment he enters switches a light on
dusk tosses aside jacket bookcase etc then
sits down on the edge of his bed with one foot
propped up on it

footsteps and a rap at the door he looks up but
doesnt move doesnt answer bree opens it
enters there are teartracks down her face but
shes no longer crying she tries to smile tries
to explain her wants then with the unhurried
graven composure of absolute desperation she sits
on the edge of the bed

			bree
	if i asked you something would you
	not laugh  asked you to look at
	something

she pushes up her sleeve points at tiny spot on
her arm  a freckle he peers at it then at her
puzzledly

			bree contd
		apologetic
	i thought it was maybe changing
	shape or something

klute looks at it again judiciously 

he shows her a spot or two on his own forearm she
compares is reassured embarrassedly she tries to
smile it is unsuccessful she gets up and moves
about her manner in general is totally unguarded
honest undramatic searching

			bree contd
	look  i hate everybody and im
	sorry for everybody and im scared
	all the time

he only grunts a sound like ok or all right 
an invitation to leave but she wont be driven
away more urgently helplessly

			bree contd
	look i dont know either its
	like the only thing i know how to
	do  i feel safe

shes left the door a little ajar he widens it for
her

			klute
	its been a full day

she pushes it out of his hand pushes it shut a
little more angrily

			bree
	please

			klute
	we did this before

			bree
	no
		then
	well all right but you want to and
	i want you to and we both know it
	and all right

			klute
		evenly slowly
	i dont like getting splashed

she accepts it decently tries to smile again
nods

			bree
	ok  ok

she gestures tries to find something more to say
moves by degrees toward the door  and would
succeed in leaving but then

			klute
	 bree 

standing still she starts again to cry  and
bravely to keep the crying to herself the child
bereft he contends with himself then crosses to
her puts his arms around her soothes her hair a
completely asexual gesture at this point a giving
of comfort she clings trembles burrows then 
a series of dissolves the street outside at
different times of night interposed with bree and
klute at different times of love as follows

ext the street  day

the street as we saw it just previously still
daylight still somewhat populated but drawing
toward dusk

					  dissolve

int klutes apartment bpee klute  night

darkness now or close to dark the room heavily
shadowed bree and klute sit together on the bed
he still strokes her hair he has pulled a blanket
around her shoulders the transaction is still not
overtly sexual but the tenderness is more overt
he rubs his cheek against her forehead she herself
is quieter comforted she begins to stir against
him

					  dissolve

ext the street  night

the street at night eleven oclock lets say
some lit windows a single car moving past

					  dissolve

ext the street  night

all the windows dark this time the deepest night
just before the sky begins to lighten

					  dissolve

int klutes apartment bree klute  night

klute is alseep  more or less  on his stomach
bree beside him lies awake she trails her fingers
about his back a rather tentative exploratory
business her expression is more wondering than
anything else  what does she have here and can
she get used to it

					  dissolve

ext the street  day dawn

the streets first stirrings from not far off the
sounds of trash cans being collected

					  dissolve

int klutes apartment bree klute  day dawn

klute half sits up in bed bree is fast asleep with
her head pillowed on his midsection some humor in
this shot he wants to move but doesnt want to
wake her at a point he risks it reaches out for
something beside the bed her eyes open
immediately he puts his hand on her face trying
gently to press her back

			klute
	go back to sleep

but she takes his hand  and retains it  rolls
onto her back still relaxed but a little more
separate thoughtful  a mixture of the bree weve
seen before and the bree weve glimpsed the
possible bree she observes

			bree
	im still scared
		beat
	i mean different but still
		frowns
	look i made it very clear from the
	start youre a yokel you dont
	excite me you dont even interest
	me and so i only have one question
	which is what the hell are you
	doing in my bed

			klute
	my bed

she grins then starts to reach for him still
receptive  then feels another and genuine pang
turns her head away sharply

			bree
	oh

he looks at her with concern but only caresses
her she manages to explain 

			bree contd
	i am scared the things i do the
	things i could do to you

			klute
	mm

			bree
	no not just mm you dont know
	what i 

he settles himself beside her makes overtures she
responds but

			bree contd
	oh boy say you think youre
	pretty good

			klute
	yup

she pretends to bite  they tussle  she feels a
suddenly growing excitement seizes him fiercely
welcomingly full out

			bree
	oh 

and we cut directly to

int spanglers office bree spangler  day

bree standing angry antagonistic demanding in a
way  a breelike way  shes seized psychiatry
by the throat

			bree
	the son of a bitch seduced me

she waits spangler says nothing

			bree contd
	i know its ridiculous but its
	tearing me up and i dont know why
	and look all right i came here
	didnt i and if i have to ill
	keep coming here the works and
	talk about my mummy and my daddy
	and ill even pay for it but will
	you kindly for gods sakes say
	something

			spangler
		smiles
	id just be guessing

			bree
	guess

			spangler
	maybe this wasnt just a trick
	maybe youre in danger of real
	love real involve 

			bree
		primly distintly
	i do not love him

			spangler
		undeterred suggests
	youve spent your life avoiding
	this youll try hard to deny it
	youre quite likely to destroy it

					  we cut to

ext the plaza of lincoln center

sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and
elegant architecture
groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the
civilized monuments to mans search for culture
camera pans to ugly street across the way revealing
klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse
topped by an absurdly placed copy of the statue of
liberty this is the municipal storehouse

int municipal storehouse  day

the abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us
in almost total darkness as we follow klute we are
in a huge storeroom as we grow accustomed to the
darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous
objects scattered along klutes path  old pieces
of furniture lamps piggy banks etc  the
remnants of the lives of the plundered the
destroyed and the dispossessed some is stolen
property some evidence for homicide cases and
some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed
dead

a custodian  an ancient retainer sort a civil
servant leads klute into an old elevator cage

int elevator

klute and custodian as elevator ascends looking up
the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a
series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead
nowhere the whole sequence has the feeling of a
dream of being lost in a black limbo

klute and custodian leave elevator on higher floor
and walk down the long very low corridor past rows
of locked vault doors the custodian stops at one
and opens it we are in a small dungeonlike room
filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling
the custodian counts to himself 

			custodian
	four  five  what numberd i
	say

			klute
	four ninetyseven jane mckenna

custodian finds it unlocks for klutes inspection
reaches for paper klutes holding

			custodian
	 and i keep the authorization
	please

			klute
	i thought thered be more

klute pokes through a small collection of personal
effects  perhaps an ankle bracelet rabbits foot
faded snapshot of a child some letters pitiful
remnants of jane mckennas life klute closes the
drawer and the front of the drawer is marked
mckenna jane

over the visual material of klutes trip through
the warehouse we hear wild track voice over bits
and pieces of bree talking with the psychiatrist

			bree vo
	all right loneliness
		space
	well  separated from other
	people forgotten
		space
	well as if i can be here i can go
	through the motions right but the
	truth is i dont belong

		prompts mildly

			bree vo
		snappishly
	do you always have to repeat

			spangler vo
	sorry
		then

			bree vo
	well its more than loneliness

	watching me and following and
	waiting to hurt me  you know im

			spangler vo

			bree vo
		snaps
	i said that
		resumes
	well so you have a choice you can
	either feel lonely  you know the
	hate  or

		plunging
	so you take a call and go to a
	hotel room and theres some john
	youve never seen before but he
	wants you he must hes paying for
	it
		beat
	and usually theyre nervous and
	thats all right too because
	youre not you know this thing

	really pay attention youre all
	there is
		beat
	and its not real and you dont
	have to even like them  you can
	even hate them its all right it
	safe  you know

int projection room  missing persons bureau

on the left a portion of the original obscene
letter on the right a series of comparison
documents  beginning with a portion of a personal
letter we hear trasks klutes voices over and
occasionally cut to them as 

			trasks voice
		skipping summarizing
	all right theres tom grunemann
	youre right different margins
	different spacing absolutely
	sloppy right

			klutes voice
	mm

			trasks voice
	all right try this next guy

the righthand document is switched

klute trask

klute reacts

			trask
	think this is our guy

			klute
	i dont know it looks familiar to
	me

			trask
	thought it might its off an
	arrest report you typed two years
	ago man you wanted samples of
	everybody

then  with subdued satisfaction switching the
projector again

			trask contd
	now the next cat mm

screen documents

			trasks voice
	same margins top and sides he does
	best with his middle fingers you
	get fainter registration from
	outside keys like q a l p and
	like that next thing look around
	apostrophes how he hits the space
	bar before 

klute  trask  staring at projections

			klute
	but what reason could he have what
	possible reason

			trask
	unless he was involved with
	grunemanns disappearance

			klute
	i knew tom never wrote that letter

			trask
	what else do you know

			klute
	i never could believe that tom was
	a split personality i never
	believed he was a dumper and i
	dont believe he disappeared of his
	own volition and i dont believe
	hes alive

			trask
	we have some very tentative
	circumstantial evidence of freeky
	behavior but theres no evidence
	of murder  theres not even a
	body

			klute
	i dont believe toms alive

as klute talks he paces back and forth in the
darkness he crosses in front of the lighted
screen the letters projected on the screen ripple
over his face

			klute contd
	but why why

int missing persons bureau

klute and trask are seen entering from the
projection room in the background we see an old
black woman sitting in front of the picture file of
unidentified dead carefully studying each picture

in the foreground klute sits down at a phone and
dials

			klute
	yes mr cables office please

camera goes in close on klute

			cables voice
		through telephone
	john how are you

			klute
	ill be sending you on a report

			cables voice
	its a beautiful day in tuscarora 
	i dont envy you that humidity in
	the city

			klute
	its not so bad

waiting for one or the other to make the next move

			klute contd
	would you like to know whats in
	it the report

			cables voice
		obligingly
	whats in it

			klute
	i think tom grunemanns dead ive
	been a lot of places  ive asked a
	lot of people ive found no proof
	hes around ive found no proof he
	was ever around

			cable voice
	how do you go from that to the idea
	toms dead suicide youre
	suggesting he killed himself

			klute
		plodding unemphatic
	he couldve been murdered

			cables voice
	im sure the fbi and the police
	explored that possibility

			klute
	no they never did really but
	thats what im going to recommend
	the next step unless something 

			cables voice
	have you discussed this with them

			klute
	its in the report

			cables voice
	do they have the report have you
	discussed it with them

			klute
	i wanted to give it to you first

klute hangs up

			klute contd
	he was always at their house on
	holidays tom and holly always had
	him over on holidays tom felt
	sorry for him  his whole life was
	work tom felt sorry for him

the old black lady motions to trask who crosses to
her she points to a picture in the file she has
obviously found her missing person among the
photographs of the unidentified dead she starts to
stand but then sits again obviously shaken
klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of
the chair he sees in her face the same sense of
loss he feels for his friend

ext outdoor markets  eight avenue  night

klute  bree

bree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation
of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper
she is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity
and klute is amused by her enjoyment

outdoor nursery  eight avenue  next to market

the nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of
greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the
avenue

klute and bree wander through the plants

			bree
	i saw mr faber
		beat
	you remember mr faber dont you

			klute
		controlledly
	yeah

			bree
	is that all you have to say

			klute
	what am i supposed to say

			bree
	well i told him i wouldnt  uh 
	go there any more
		pause
	i know its tough to understand
	but it wasnt easy you see he was
	nice to me i mean it wasnt just
	him i got something out of it too
	i guess anyway i told him i
	wouldnt go there anymore

she is like a child awaiting praise from her
teacher klute says nothing they continue walking
among the plants and he picks up a few that she had
admired

			klute
	well heres your gold star

considering his contempt for all the dead plant
life he has seen in her apartment in the past she
is pleased by this act of belief in her

			bree
	spangler says we have a
	relationship

			klute
	what

			bree
	you and i  a relationship

			klute
	i was wondering what that was

			bree
		beat
	hell theres nothing so mysterious
	about the square life

ext brownstone entryway  night

bree klute approach unhurriedly along the
sidewalk she is holding his arm hums to herself
enjoys the evening

int stairwall  night

we follow them up

int angle into bree apartment  night

the apartment is a shambles  furniture
overturned decorations ripped from the wall
bedding scattered and ripped

int bree apartment  night

klute jettisons the grocery bags thrusts himself
inside looks quickly about finds no one bree
follows more slowly whispering

			bree
	oh jesus oh jesus

			klute
	dont touch anything

he moves quickly to the rear of the apartment
looks at the rear window which has been broken
inward in a litter of glass  then returns to the
table at the front of the apartment his folders
bree cracks wise unsteadily

			bree
	you suppose hes a married fella

angle to table folders

the contents of the folders have been spilled
across the table and  we zoom in  the
photographs of tom grunemann sorted out and ripped
apart even the company picnic photograph has been
painstakingly torn specifically to destroy the
image of grunemann in the front row

klute

he stands looking down taking no notice as 

			bree
	he got in my clothing

then a moment later she cries out again more
sharply

			bree contd
	oh oh

he turns quickly she is holding out at arms
length a pair of her underpants with a disgust so
extreme she can only laugh

			bree contd
	oh look what he did in them

			klute
	drop it

she doesnt respond he seizes her arm shakes the
garment back onto the floor she starts to gag
slaps her hand over her mouth starts for the
bathroom klute yanks her back

			klute contd
	stay out of there

she twists free of his hands backs away the same
elementary terror weve seen before

			klute contd
	listen to me its all right ive
	been expecting something

			bree
		full out vengefully
	my god i thought it was over and
	here i am daddy right back at the
	start

			klute
	bree 

			bree
	right back at the start right

			klute
	go down in my room

			bree
	you said it was over right you
	said not to worry any more all
	over right

shes broken for the door its questionable that
shes even heard him he hasnt time to pursue 
shouts again 

			klute
	go down in my room and wait

then he turns back into the apartment

int brees apartment  day

a downshot to underpants as if from klutes pov
connecting directly to the previous shot  then a
flashbulb goes off and a hand and pair of tongs
enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting
box and we widen to reveal that its now daylight
and the scene has been invaded by police
technicians one is a photographer another a
fingerprint man is spraying surfaces with a can of
fixative in the foreground klute and trask are
talking with ross the fbi man ross is looking
through a dossier on cable that klute has compiled
over the following conversation we show closeups of
material in the dossier it contains photographs of
cable and his life from childhood to the present 
including pictures of him with his mother and
father  she a very dominant looking lady and he a
very passive looking man
also graduation pictures and pictures with his
former wife taken when he was still a very young
man they are the personal images of a life time

			ross
		to klute
	but if cable killed grunemann why
	would he get you hired to look for
	grunemann

			klute
	because he knew i couldnt leave
	the case alone and this way at
	least hed keep track of it and
	me

			ross
	what about grunemanns letters to
	the girl everything like that

			trask
	cables letters cables phone
	calls cables everything else
	hes been a dumper a long time he
	just passed off his own peculiar
	habits on the other man  it kept
	things goin

			ross
	ok pretend i believe you tell me
	how you get an indictment

			trask
	cant yet oh we got everythin
	else first rate evidence cable
	typed those dumper letters to bree
	daniel and jane mckenna klute
	found a couple in her personal
	remains we got dates of cables
	trips here coincidin with phone
	calls to bree daniel also the
	dates of death of mckenna and page
	we got some hints of his personal
	history his father unsuccessful
	salesman committed suicide when he
	was 13 his mother pinned all her
	hopes on her son he won a national
	science youth award at the age of
	eight they had no money but she
	hired special tutors for him in the
	summer time she saw a good thing
	he graduated from high school at 14
	 college at 16  no friends 
	the kids in his class thought of
	him as a freak he got his phd at
	18  married at age 21 to his then
	employers daughter the marriage
	lasted 4 weeks her father had it
	annulled she says he was impotent
	world war ii he got in bad trouble
	about a german girl no details we
	think we know why he killed
	grunemann  he found out cable was
	a dumper cable couldnt take that
	we think we know why he killed
	mckenna  she wanted to blackmail
	him for it all fine but we got no
	body no direct witnesses we cant
	go anydamnwhere

			klute
	thats the reason i told him we had
	no evidence tom was still alive we
	wanted to shake him into another
	phone call or another letter it
	didnt work out just that way

the technicians meanwhile have packed to depart
the first technician scoops the torn up photographs
into another collecting box trask retrieves the
company outing photograph

			trask
	gov want to leave me that one how
	come he got to play with this one
	anyway

			klute
	i left them here i was doing some
	work here

trask eyes klute for a moment as if a querying his
relationship with bree klute is clearly
unresponsive trask resumes

			trask
	its damn lucky you didnt have the
	dossier on cable here

			klute
	nobodys seen that

			trask
	if we get anything from the lab
	well have it by noon and just
	think  all he really had to do
	was write us a letter

			ross
	sounds to me you better shake him
	again put him in a spot he has to
	do something more  but this time
	give him a time and a place to do
	it

			klute
	he called this morning from
	tuscarora asked me to meet him at
	300 at the downtown heliport hes
	on his way to chicago

			trask
	he sure chalks up a lot of flight
	time

klute starts gathering his papers we cut to 

int stairwell bree  day

bree coming up the stairs meets the technicians
coming down  stands aside to let them pass 
starts up again and comes face to face with klute
on her part we see a wish to be reconciled  a
shyness mixed with defiance  but klutes manner
is arduous she smiles nervously asks 

			bree
	ah schmendrick  whats the scam

			klute
	those were police laboratory
	people theyve been over the
	apartment

			bree
		mock delight
	oh zippidydoo theyll find my

			klute
	why couldnt you stay here with me

			bree
	because i didnt want to be
	touched i didnt think youd get

pause then evenly 

			klute
	trask wants to talk with you

she starts on then turns back toward him  rather
pleadingly 

			bree
	hey  look officer  i can
	explain everything it was just 
	you know everything all of a 

			klute
	trask wants to talk with you

she continues on up klute continues down

int brees apartment  day

entering without greeting trask his manner is not
uncivil but simply neutral unreacting coplike
she quickly gathers up a few properties a change
of shoes

			trask
	miss daniel be sensible you find
	another place till we get things
	cleaned up

			bree
		brightly
	oh well that shouldnt take you

outing picture we see the rip extending up
through the image of tom grunemann in the front
row

			bree
	oh no

goodbye gesture

			cable

int helicopter

cable sits down next to window the helicopter
begins to rise camera goes into a medium close
shot of cable against the helicopter window the
helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office
building made up of endless glass squares a
telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the
building directly against cables head and
shoulders giving us the feeling that cable is
almost levitating by himself as one floor after
another disappears behind him we see an almost
manic exhultation in cables face as if he is on
top of things once more

ext street outside brownstone  day

we bring klute along street and into the
brownstone

int stairwell  day

klute climbs the stairs to brees apartment 
knocks he waits no answer he calls once 

			klute
	bree

no answer he starts downstairs again  then turns
back unlocks the door himself enters

int brees apartment  day

the room is still disordered bree and frank
ligourin look at him silently bree has been
assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with
her frank sits nearby in a chair klute smiles a
little  almost apologetically

			klute
	im always getting surprises

bree doesnt answer she sets the armload of
dresses over the back of a chair moves aside to
get others frank smiles cautiously ruefully then


			klute contd
	i dont want you to do this

he still doesnt extract an answer she returns
with other dresses

			klute contd
	please i said i dont want you to
	do this

			bree
		tight small
	trask said i should move lets not
	make a thing of it

he continues to look at her she continues to
gather possessions then trying to smile to deal
with it casually 

			bree contd
	look too much is going on here
	im moving in with another girl
	thats all just for a while

			frank
		helpfully
	thats right this other girls got
	a very big apartment big plenty
	of room
		then
	look its not necessarily how it
	looks right its 

he thinks better of continuing klute looks from
him back to bree he speaks gravely spacing his
words  unable to speak any faster

			klute
	no please not with this son of a
	bitch

frank rises both nervous and offended  but
dealing with klute as between civilized men
smiling

			frank
	klute lets handle it like
	grownups i mean were all grown up
	now right
		ventures forward
	 we all respect each other you
	know what i mean  i respect you
	bree respects you  you could say
	it just didnt work out between you
	and she but you got to respect her
	too  you know her best
	interests best for her 

klute hits him pursues recovers and starts to
beat him blood thickly descends the side of
franks face as he struggles away bree is
screaming bree grabs at him from behind he
thrusts her off but it allows frank to break away
through the stillopen door klute pursues

int landing at door  day

frank clatters down a stairs as klute arrives in
the doorframe and as bree behind klute screams 

			bree
	no

klute is restrained  restrains himself frank has
faced around on the stairs still bleeding
extravagantly from his torn scalp earnestly 

			frank
	hey im gonna get you dropped

klute starts out after him  frank vaults away
down the stairs  we hear him stumbling and
running  klute faces sharply around into the
apartment

int brees apartment  day

past klute to bree she is running away from him
again to a corner of the apartment fumbling at a
sewing basket he starts in after her

			klute
		indistinctly
	please 

two shot

she swings about as he overtakes her holding a
pair of scissors  simply and transcendently
terrified she strikes at him slashing his
forearm he and she stand in absolute silence he
looks down at the stain of blood spreading through
the fabric of his jacket sleeve then he turns out
of the room and down the stairs

ext brees brownstone  day

klute comes out of door  goes down steps to his
own apartment a passerby stops him for directions
and doesnt seem to notice the blood on his sleeve
klute goes into his apartment

int brees apartment bree  day

bree is in the middle of dialing the phone her
hands are shaking she misdials  holds down the
receiver for a moment then starts again

int klutes apartment klute  day

klute stands in silence for a moment or two  then
takes rather more note of his forearm not
urgently but practically it behooves him to stop
bleeding he turns toward the bathroom pulling
his jacket off with the other hand

int brees apartment bree  day

bree speaks to the phone trying to make a simple
point trying to keep her voice even

			bree
	 until he gets back
		beat
	yes i heard you i understand that
	i said im going to come over ill
	wait until he gets back

she hangs up before the other party can object in
detail  takes up her purse and goes out not even
closing the door behind her

int klutes apartment bathroom klute  day

klute has knotted a handtowel around his forearm
now uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight
then  intending to clean up  he takes up a
washcloth reaches for the faucet 

ext brees brownstone  day

bree comes out of door  goes down steps 
hesitates in front of klutes apartment struggling
with the question of whether to knock camera pulls
back to reveal we are watching her through the
windshield of a car in the parking lot across the
street camera pulls back further to reveal the
back of cables head as he sits in the car watching
her bree starts to knock on klutes door but stops
herself and walks down the street cables head
moves out of the shot we hear the sound of the car
door opening and closing through the windshield we
see cable cross in front of the car and start to
follow bree down the street

int klutes apartment bathro0m klute  day

klute finishes mopping up sound of telephone he
turns back out of the bathroom and answers it

			klute
	hello
		listens then soberly  
	trask i dont get that

ext street bree  day

bree is about a quarter block away from the
brownstone now hurrying she waves in the
direction of a cab misses it continues on we cut
to 

ext street cable  day

cable stands looking after her hesitates over
choice of action decides to follow

ext street figures past bree to cable  day

we establish the distance between them  cable 100
or so feet behind her unnoticed by her
maintaining about the same pace not  at this
point  trying to overtake perhaps waiting for
less populated surroundings we cut back to 

int klutes apartment klute  day

klute continues his phone conversation short
spoken

			klute
	who told you his secretary
		listens
	has someone checked his hotel he
	always stays at the 
		then
	ill look around ill call you
	back

he hangs up first he checks out the windows but 
if we want to be accurate  from mid room without
directly approaching the windows themselves then
he secures a pistol from his jacket and folds the
jacket itself over his arm to conceal it as a
matter of public decorum and goes on out

int stairwell klute  day

klutes manner over the next few minutes exhibits
an absolute untheatrical care and competence a
man  cable  may in fact be hiding here
somewhere to kill him he sets about checking the
likely places  first of all the lower hallway
then the stairwell itself moving steadily
unalarmedly up

at the top he notes  but still without main
concern that brees door is open he calls ahead 

			klute
	bree 

int brees apartment klute  day

he enters puzzles starts checking around quite
thoroughly she might be hiding from him we cut
back to 

ext streets bree figure of cable  day

bree moves past construction work through one of
those temporary pedestrian passageways behind her
nearer than before we see the figure of cable

int stairwell  day

klute comes quickly back downstairs back into his
room takes up the phone through the stillopen
door we watch him begin dialing  then cut to 

int spanglers outer office  day

bree sits isolated on the waitingroom couch she
may have been here for fifteen minutes  or an
hour she turns the pages of a magazine  one
handed without even lifting it from the coffee
table with an absolute lack of interest a
mechanical gesture

we hear footsteps approaching directly toward where
we are watching bree sit

			lela os
	mrs daniel 

wider  two shot

bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror as the
secretary smiles nicely  lovingly down at her

			lela
	 i have to close up now leave
	your name and number with his
	message service mrs daniel and
	why dont you just go home and wait
	until he

with the secretary as she moves into spanglers
inner office and switches out the lights

hear os the sound of dialing and brees voice

			faber
	yes  yes dear yes  maybe half
	an hour sure yes

he hangs up an ancient stirring a kind of
triumph he glances about then tightens his tie
then it comes to him after all  he takes note of
himself  he leans forward against his desk and
rubs his forehead with old bony fingers we cut to 


int klutes apartment  day night

klute on phone

			klute
	trina will you call me if you hear
	from her will you check other

on his end of things  nods once 

			klute contd

 and depresses the receiver just long enough to
clear the connection and starts dialing again 
we cut to 

int stairway of garment building  day night

quitting time as bree enters from street level
employees are coming down the stairs pushing past
her she continues up on until at one point  one
more officious or more communicative than the
others informs her 

			foreman
	lady its closing up there

			bree
	what

			foreman
	were closing up quitting time
	fabers

			bree
		unsurely
	i have an appointment with mr
	faber

			foreman
	oh yeah

he lets her pass glances after her like the
others continues on his way

int garment building faber reception area  day
night

bree arrives at the head of the stairs  as still
others press past her on their way down  and
comes more or less directly up against the thickset
receptionist she is packing her purse preparing
to depart looks somewhat challengingly at bree 
who sees no way to avoid the issue

			bree
	i have an appointment with mr
	faber

			receptionist
	in there
		turns bawls
	mr faber 

bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated
toward 

a corner of offices nathan faber

nathan stands bending over a bench with back to
camera conferring with another man as bree
approaches  looking to us as to her exactly
like his father we hear the receptionists voice
repeating 

			receptionist contd os
			contd
	mr faber 

as bree nears him he straightens and turns  a
much younger man bree stops short recognizing the
error

			nathan
	yes

			bree
	im sorry  mr faber senior

			nathan
		calmly
	my father went home about fifteen
	minutes ago he wasnt feeling too
	good

she has already started away he calls after her
evenly 

			nathan contd
	can i help you

she looks back quickly smiles nervously 

			bree
	it wasnt important

but we hold on him for a moment as she continues
out of scene  until he turns away to other
matters then 

reception area receptionist bree

bree returns toward receptionist awkwardly 

			bree
	did mr faber leave a message for
	me or anything mr faber senior
	bree daniel

			receptionist
	oh i thought that was for
	tomorrow

the receptionist riffles through a stack of
assorted envelopes  hands one out to bree  and
promptly takes her way off out bree starts to
open the envelope then and there  but others
continue to move past her she seeks a more private
place

rows of garments

bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone
else  though we continue to hear intermittent
voices os and continue to maintain the sense of
other presences

we see her open the envelope 

closer bree envelope

she finds nothing inside but money  bills
totaling fifty dollars we see her looking for a
message finding nothing it comes to her slowly
that shes been paid off and avoided she bites her
lips in pain she pushes back out of hiding 

receptionist area

 back to the reception area again by now this
immediate scene has emptied though we catch sight
of a figure or two at scenestart moving through
the background and continue to hear an occasional
noise or voice os

bree looks about for someone  then scouts for a
pencil finds one in a desk or bench drawer
starts to readdress the envelope to direct it back
to mr faber then she breaks off from that takes
up a phone instead dials  waits  then 

			bree
	bree daniel has he called in yet
	well if he does im at 
		reads phone
	 two seven eight three one
	hundred and i guess i can wait
	here five minutes then ill try
	from somewhere else
		impatiently
	just tell him bree daniel he knows
	who

she hangs up goes back to readdressing the
envelope footsteps are approaching in her
direction she glances up apologetically

			bree contd
	mr faber i just wanted to leave
	this for your father and i
	wondered if youd 

she pauses 

angle past bree to cable

cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments
in this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying
figure  a noise a gesticulation actually the
gesture is arms out palms downward intended as a
quieting gesture and the hissing noise is intended
as a shushing bree cries out turns to run 

			bree contd
	someone 

 as we immediately even as shes turning cut to


int klutes apartment klute  day night

klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into
the phone dealing evidently with an ethically
skittish message service at the other end

			klute
	did she leave a number
		beat
	this is a police call dont make
	me take time to prove it did she
	leave a number what is the number
		beat
	what is the number 

int garment building  day night

cable and bree they are at some remove from the
site of cables first appearance there are other
evidences of timelapse cables manner is that of
slightlystrained patience  a civility  an
attempt now and then to smile bree watches his
every slight gesture quivers to make a break for
it tries throughout to buy time

			cable
	cant we talk together reasonably
	just  ordinarily
		beat
	i know youre expecting some kind
	of  extravagant behavior but
	believe me  do you believe me 

			bree
	yes  all right 

			cable
	 we can talk 

			bree
	 yes

			cable
	all right then an ordinary
	matter im a quite well off man i
	have a  position to respect i
	would feel personally uncomfortable
	to be connected with a  certain
	kind of woman im sure you
	understand do you well id like
	to buy jane mckennas book

he looks at her discerningly she seems not to have
followed his exposition he tries patiently to
clarify it

			cable contd
	her black book jane mckennas her
	list of  of persons i was told
	youre negotiating for it on behalf
	of 

the phone rings an explosive noise bree startles
it has been put on nightring to sound all over
the loft and the noise is deafening but  the
most bizarre element is cables absolute lack of
response to it it rings and rings as he talks and
talks  in the same expository tone as before
without raising his voice it drowns out most of
his words  at most we catch only odd phrases of
all the following  but he seems not to hear it
any more than the clamor of other things torturing
his soul

			cable contd
	that was what klute told me  you
	were negotiating for him to buy
	that list and im in a position to
	pay a good deal more for it than he
	can do you understand id like
	you to acquire it on my 
		beat
	miss daniel do you not understand
		beat
	miss daniel i cant tell whether
	you understand me
		beat  still reasonably
	is this something klute just
	invented is this a trap for me
	miss daniel does klute know about
	me

he turns and lifts a phone one of the extension
phones situated around the loft  though up to
now hes given no evidence of even hearing the
ringing he just stands holding the phone for a
time then lowers it back on the receiver with a
sort of absolute quiet 

			cable contd
	you have no idea what im talking
	about

			bree
	yes  jane mckennas book  i
	could make a phone call

			cable
	no youre frightened youre
	pretending well  klute knows
	about me then does everybody know
	can you tell me

			bree
	yes

			cable
	then it doesnt matter what i do
	any more does it

pause then he shudders slightly

			cable contd
	you people know nothing about pain

we cut to 

ext streets  day night

we see klute  probably in mls  running along
street he tries for a cab  misses it  halts
the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of
it the driver starts to lean out to object klute
mashes him back inside enters the cab we cut back
to 

int garment building  day night

mls the two figures cable bree they are
somewhat separated  cable has gone to look down
from one of the arched windows of the loft while
bree remains in place she is a prisoner we can
suppose  when we cut closer well see her eyes
continually shifting her mind calculating her
chances  but he hasnt molested her he bears her
no animus at this point his manner is rather
quiet undetermined he feels some relief that the
thing is in effect over  and some puzzlement
about what to do with either her or himself now
he returns toward her

closer bree cable

nearing her again he gestures several times
apologetically seeking words

			cable
	ive got no idea what i shall do

he happens too close she cant avoid shrinking

			cable contd
	im not going to hurt you
	absolutely im not

			bree
	will you let me go then

he seems not to have heard the request he sits for
a moment an intellectual interest a curiosity
meanwhile perhaps we see her starting to slip
her shoes off in hopes of running

			cable
	it puzzles me so badly ive done
	terrible things but i cant
	consider myself a terrible man
	ive killed three people and id
	still want to say it was accident
	do you see

			bree
		tries again slowly
	if youll let me go i could tell
	them what 

			cable
		unhearing resumes
	tom grunemann discovered me  we
	were here on business together he
	discovered me with jane mckenna
	then i suppose it was the  the
	contempt i saw in his face and the
	certainty that sooner or later hed
	use it against me within the
	company i endured that as long as
	i could do you see

			bree
	im sorry im just frightened
	yes

			cable
	excuse me miss daniel

			bree
	i said yes i see

			cable
		doubtingly
	oh no i dont think 

			bree
	tell me ill listen
		pause
	i just want you to tell me

he rises approaches her  apparently taken in
credulous grateful wondering 

			cable
	youre willing to listen you want
	me just to keep talking

he hits her

			cable contd
	thats what you do isnt it you
	make a man feel accepted
	thats what you all do your stock
	in trade a mans weakness

he hits her again

			cable contd
	why dont you ask for mercy my
	god what mercy has anyone given
	me

int elevator  klute ascending  day night

klute has gun out  as he carefully makes his way
across the roof man in hotel window across street
holding drink  watches him with amused curiosity
klute spots entrance to stairway

int garment building klute  day night

klute goes downstairs to back entrance of faber
loft he slips inside he hears the sounds of the
beating  a stirring of feet and indistinct impact
sounds a murmur of voices but all quite muted
undramatic he maneuvers through lanes of
garments trying to gain a line of sight he
understands whats going on strains to intervene
but cant disclose himself at a point he drops to
hands and knees slides underneath the garment
racks drawing closer to cable trying to gain
position we intersperse his progress with further
breecable fragments as for instance 

fragment cable bree

			cable
	youre a person of no value you
	have no value 

klute shifting closer

klute works his way steadily closer  under
steadily increasing pressure as the pursuit and
beating continue as sounds os even close at hand
the noises are ambiguous  the clatter of
footsteps grunts a slap of flesh  rather than
distinct once or twice we hear cables voice
clearly enough to make out words 

			cable contd
	 is that contempt is it
		then
	no im the one who feels contempt

 and once or twice a cry from bree

klute tries to gain aim 

pov to bree cable

 but cable is too close upon her and they are
too steadily in motion

klute

klute moves on  moves on  gains position 
springs

cable

cable catches the sound whirls screams 

pov to klute

klute closes with him knocks loose cables pistol 
 contends for it again knocks it loose again
effect  under  sirens

cable klute

cable breaks loose backs a step  backs another
step  and then turns and runs unhesitant against
one of the windows exploding it outward with him
both frame and glass

dark side of the building

ext downshot from loft to street klutes pov

it into his suitcase on the table we hear the
familiar footsteps on the stairs brees knock he
lets her in keeps on about his business his
expression is sober hers is quite tentative

her

closer bree klute

he arrives in proximity to her then the following
events in more or less the following order

he looks at her inquiringly she responds by
sitting down plunk on the grubby front step of
the brownstone

having stood for some time  during which she has
offered only twitching motions of her hands  he
sets down the suitcase

having set down the suitcase but derived no
answer he reaches out one arm and leans against
the building front

she nearly arrives at the level of statement
fretfully indecisively 

			bree
	oh heck 
		pause
	oh heck 

then as a man not to be dallied with he picks up
the suitcase again she looks at him strickenly
but it doesnt precipitate her into speech

he puts it down again

and then  then after all goddamit he reaches
out grabs her wrist and simply hauls her along
suitcase in one hand bree in the other as she
yanks shouts struggles
