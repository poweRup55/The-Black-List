     fade in
     
     
     int  auditorium  1972  day
     
     two boys sit on opposite sides of a chessboard  one is nine
     the other fourteen  the room is silent the tension between
     the two young players severe  all the adult players that have
     been eliminated from this match by the two boys stand around
     watching  on the wall is a banner that reads  1972 washington
     state tournament
     
     the fourteen year old moves and hits his timer  frustration
     fills the nine year olds face  he moves  the fourteen year
     old moves and calls check  the nine year old frantically
     searches the board for a solution  he moves  again the
     fourteen year old moves and calls check  the nine year is
     stunned  he picks up his king to lay it on its side and
     signal defeat  suddenly he rakes the pieces off the board
     grabs his fountain pen and lunges at the fourteen year old
     stabbing him repeatedly in the chest  they fall to the floor
     the adults try to pull them apart  the nine year old struggles
     ferociously screaming and kicking like a mad man
     
     
     int  hospital ward  1972  dusk
     
     in the bg we see the nine year old boy sleeping  a doctor
     and the boys father a hardlooking man in his forties walk
     through the door  we move with them down the hall
     
                         doctor
               the pressures and demands players with
               your sons abilities put on themselves
               to win are incredible  the stress and
               tension are difficult enough for adults
               to handle yet alone a nine year old
               
                         father
               i cant afford to keep him in here
               forever you know
               
                         doctor
               id just like to keep him here over
               night then start sessions with a child
               psychologist
               
                         father
               i knew this would happen  this is his
               mothers doing  shes not strict
               enough with him  i work all day  she
               lays in bed drunk and the boy does
               whatever he wants
               
     
                                                             2
                         doctor
               after hes released its crucial that
               hes supervised  the most important
               thing is that during his treatment hes
               not allowed anywhere near a chessboard
               
               
     ext  house backyard  1972  dusk
     
     a small tract home  the boy sits on the ground drawing in
     the dirt with a stick  he does not notice as his father walks
     up and stands behind him
     
                         father
               what are you doing
               
     the boy is startled  he stands up quickly  in the dirt we see
     he has drawn a chessboard
     
                         boy
               nothing
               
     the father slaps him across the face
     
                         father
               dont lie to me  what did the doctors
               tell you about playing chess  get in
               the house
               
     the father drags his foot across the dirt erasing the board
               
               
     int  bedroom  1972  night
     
     the boy is sitting on his bed  in the bg we hear the voices
     of his parents

     we hear a door slam  the boy shows no sign of emotion
     
               
     
                                                             3
     int  hallway black screen  night
     
     all is quiet except for a faint dripping sound  a door is
     slowly opened  light streaks out into a hallway  we see the
     nine year old  he is barefoot and wearing pajamas  he looks
     up  drops of blood drip from a crack in the ceiling above
     the boy moves towards a staircase at the end of the hall
     
     
     int  bedroom  1972  night
     
     the boy enters takes a few steps into the room and stops he
     stares ahead blankly
     
     his pov womans arm  close shot
     
     the arm hangs off the bed blood flows out of a deep gash in
     her wrist and pools on the floor  the camera moves up the arm
     a woman in her forties lays in bed  the blood flows from her
     other wrist soaking into the mattress  her eyes are closed
     head titled away from him
     
     the boy shows no sign of emotion  he walks over to the
     nightstand and starts to open her purse  there is a moan from
     the woman as she opens her eyes and turns her head toward the
     boy  they lock eyes for a moment then slowly her eyes close
     the boy removes a key from the purse and walks to a dresser
     he unlocks a drawer and removes a box then leaves the room
     
     
     int  kitchen  1972  night
     
     the boy walks over to the table with a glass of milk and
     cookies  he sits down his feet dangling from the chair and
     opens the box  inside is a chessboard and pieces  he removes
     them sets up the board and starts to play
     
     close on chessboard  the camera moves from one side of the
     board to the other weaving through the chess pieces then
     pulls back over the heads of the audience
     
     
     int  auditorium  present day  night
     
     from the rear of the room over the heads of the audience we
     see three tables on stage  a large board of the game is
     presented on the wall behind each table
     
     close shot  players eyes  we cut back and forth  deep
     probing eyes intensely focused and determined

     sound we hear

     the viewing board

     handsome man in his early thirties  welldressed in an
     expensive suit there is an air of confidence about him  peter
     makes a move then hits the timer  peters opponent

     jeremy edmonds peters trainer a distinguishedlooking man in
     his fifties watches from his wheelchair  he grins and nods
     his head knowing that peter has got the game
     
     lutz studies the board makes a move then hits his timer
     peter moves then hits his timer  he is in control
     frustration shows on lutzs face  he surveys the board then
     slowly reaches over and lifts up his king and lays it on its
     side signaling defeat  peter stands shakes his hand waves to
     the crowd then leaves the stage

     there is a knock on the door and a message is slipped under

                         peter
               its a good play but risky

               watched her bleed to death  but thats
               not the main thing  whats wrong with

     int  police station  afternoon
     
     frank and andy stand before several uniformed officers
     
                         frank
               first of all id like to say that a
               lot of us havent got to know each
               other since i replaced captain waters
               last month  a lot of you think that
               im an outsider who came over and took
               away a job that should have gone to a
               local but thats the way it worked
               out  so all i can say is tough shit
               you want to bitch about it thats fine
                but you will tow the line in my
               department  that means the next time
               an officer is responding to a homicide
               call he seals off the crime scene and
               nobody  nobody but  but detective
               wagner and i go in
                    beat
               also if anyone talks about the message
               on the wall or the blood ill
               personally cut their balls off with a
               butter knife
                    to andy
               get em going  then meet me at the
               car  were going over to the hotel
               
     frank heads to the door
     
                                                             12
     
                         andy

               they got anything like this on file
               
               
     int  police station hallway  afternoon
     
     frank steps into the hall and bumps into nolan  they walk
     together
     
                         frank
               anything
     
                         nolan
               not much  i dont think she was raped
               theres no bruising or any signs of
               trauma to the pelvic region  and no
               trace of sperm which makes sense
               because she took a bath
               
                         frank
               what about prints
               
                         nolan
               no prints
               
                         frank
               you mean no prints but hers
               
                         nolan
               no frank  no prints

               chess tournaments can be boring
               sometimes  people have a lot of free
               time  they like to gossip
               
                         frank
               could you tell me where you were last
               night

               and left the auditorium at eight forty
               five  where did you go after that
               
                         peter
               to my room and then i went for a walk
               
                         andy
               by yourself
               
                         peter

     frank takes out a piece of paper from his jacket pocket
     
                         frank
               this is a printout from the hotel

               tomorrow
               
                         frank
               whats interesting about it is you say
               you only knew her in passing  yet she
               says on her message for you to call her
               at home and she doesnt leave a number
               that would imply you already knew the
               number
               
                         peter
               i got it from the tournament directory

               directory
               
     peters irritation starts to show  he opens a dresser drawer
     and removes a small book
     
                         peter
               youre looking in the general
               directory  the players directory
               lists everyone connected to the
               tournament

               were just trying to put a few pieces
               together
               
     frank and andy leave  peter turns and stares at jeremy
               
     
     ext  hotel grounds  afternoon
     
     frank and andy walk along the grounds heading back towards the
     main hotel
     
                         andy
               what do you think
               
                         frank

               he doesnt have an alibi
               
                         andy
               you think hes dirty

     david willerman a computer technician sits at a computer off
     to the side of the stage
     
                         david
               no problem  its just a matter of
               adjusting the response time
               
     he taps in a few commands on the keyboard  we see a piece
     quickly move across the board
     
                         david
               that should do it
               
     grandmaster lutz walks over and stands by the board
     
                         grandmaster lutz

     electronic devise that alters the voice  it is low resonant
     with a macabre quality to it

               whats that supposed to mean
               
                         andy
               it means if i were a killer and i
               thought the police were closing in on
               me i might invent someone to try and
               put them off the scent
               
                         peter
               thats crazy  why would i draw
               attention to myself like that
               
                         andy

               peter

     int  auditorium  afternoon
     
     peter sits across from grandmaster lutz  he looks over a few
     tables and stares at yurilivich  meanwhile lutz takes out a
     compass  he checks his reading then starts shifting the board
     slightly  peter looks at him
     
                         lutz
               do you mind
               
     peter shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesnt  the
     president walks over to peters table and starts his timer
     peter makes a move
     
     
     
                                                             20
     int  bainbridge institute  dusk
     
     frank and andy sit at a table with doctor alan fulton  a tall
     thin man in his fifties  doctor fulton studies the
     photographs then looks up at frank
     
                         doctor fulton
               you must understand that this is not my
               field

               there are all different types of
               problems
               
                         frank
               doctor fulton we dont have a budget
               out here like seattle  we cant afford
               to hire outside psychological help
               ill take whatever you can give me
     
                         doctor fulton
               well he appears to be acting out some
               kind of fantasy  were talking about a
               deeply disturbed person
               
                         andy
               no shit
               
                         frank
               could someone this disturbed give the
               appearance of being normal
               
                         doctor fulton
               absolutely
               
                         frank

               evidence  if you met him do you think
               you could tell

                         andy
               if hes crazy
               
     
                                                             21

                    askance at andy
               if hes disturbed
               
                         doctor fulton
               its possible but not likely  theres
               only one opinion i can offer with any
               certainty
                    beat
               hes going to kill again
               
               
     int  hotel gym  night
     
     peter is on the bench press straining to finish his set
     although he is clearly tired its a battle of will over
     muscle  although his face is red veins bugling he does his
     three last presses then replaces the bar  he sits up and
     buries his face in his towel  when he looks up he sees
     
     kathy sheppard a beautiful woman in her twenties is standing
     against the wall her eyes on him  peter smiles at her  she
     smiles back then walks out of the room  peter lays back down
     and starts another set
     
               
     int  steam room  night
     
     peter enters a towel wrapped around his waist  he takes a few
     steps into the room then stops when he sees kathy through the
     steam
     
                         peter
               sorry  i thought it was empty
               
                         kathy
               its alright
               
     peter sits down a few feet from her  steam swirls through the
     room  kathys eyes drift over to him
     
     her pov  beads of sweat roll down his chest and stomach
     
     peter looks over at her their eyes meet  she looks away
     peter closes his eyes and takes a few deep meditative breaths
     kathy looks over at him again  as if sensing he is being
     watched peter opens his eyes  a beat  their eyes linger on
     each others
     
                         kathy
               is this your first time here
               
                         peter
               yes
               
     
                                                             22
                         kathy
               i love this hotel  i stay here every
               time i visit my parents
     
                         peter
               how come you dont stay with them
               
                         kathy
               because i love them but they drive me
               crazy  you know how parents are
               
                         peter
               no  i dont
     
     a beat
     
                         kathy
               are you with the tournament
               
                         peter
               uh huh
     
                         kathy
               are you one of the players
               
                         peter
               yes
               
                         kathy
               ive always wanted to learn how to play
               chess  i dont have the patience for
               it  when did you start playing
               
                         peter
               when i was very young
               
                         kathy
               it seems like such a complicated game
               
                         peter
               not really  you see your goal and you
               go after it  anything that gets in the
               way is an obstacle and must be
               destroyed
               
                         kathy
               sounds very violent
               
                         peter
               chess is a reflection of life  life is
               violent  the strong win  the weak
               perish
     
                                                             23
     
                         kathy
               but you enjoy being the stronger one
               you like the control
               
                         peter
               if youre asking me if im passionate
               about what i do the answer is yes
               without passion nothing moves us
               whats your passion
     
                         kathy
               thats a very personal question
               
                         peter
               i see  this is going to be a very
               polite conversation  what shall we
               discuss  the weather  movies
               
                         kathy
               are you disappointed that i wont
               answer you
               
                         peter
               i had just hoped there would be more
               substance to the conversation
               
                         kathy
               i thought opening too quickly was a
               fatal mistake in chess
               
                         peter
                    grinning
               it is
               
                         kathy

     ext  hotel grounds  morning
     
     kathy frank and andy leave peters room and walk back towards
     the hotel
     
                         andy
               you should be an actor frank  you
               looked like you were really mad  the
               veins popping out on your neck was a
               really nice touch
               
                         kathy
               you werent mad at him for picking up
               the phone
               
                         frank
               no  i told him to  i wanted to make
               sure there was someone on the other
               end
               
                         kathy
               but we heard him
               
                         frank
               it could have been a tape  a
               prerecorded conversation between
               sanderson and himself
     
     
     
                                                             33
     int  police conference room  afternoon
     
     a room set up to deal with the murder  photographs are pinned
     to a cork board  frank is at a table with kathy andy and
     nolan  on the chalkboard in the rhyme the caller recited
     earlier
     
                         andy
               the fbi has nothing remotely similar
               to this guy  i think hes a first
               timer
               
                         frank
               check with the state  if hes never
               killed outside of washington the fbi
               wouldnt have it  nolan
               
                         nolan
               he tapes their mouths shut  we found
               traces of adhesive around the victims
               mouths  were doing a chemical
               analysis for components but its
               probably a standard brand you can buy
               in any hardware store
               
                         frank
               theres only two hardware stores on the
               whole island  well check that out
               what about the blood
               
                         nolan
               not a drop  maybe the guy works for
               the red cross
               
     frank looks at nolan askance
     
                         frank
               kathy
               
                         kathy
               well the fact that he views this as a
               game suggests that he is trying to
               prove some sense of superiority  and
               the way he murders confirms a need to
               be in complete control of his victim
               
                         frank
               what about the way he arranged the
               body
               
     
                                                             34
                         kathy
               that would indicate hes playing out a
               fantasy  powercontrol killers usually
               fantasize about their actions long
               before they commit them  once they
               become a reality though they reach a
               sense of euphoria and need to repeat
               the act to sustain it  but in all the
               research ive read on serial killers
               ive never heard of one moving so fast
               its as if the game is the catalyst for
               the murders  not the other way
               around
               
                         frank
               anything else
               
                         kathy
               yes  why disguise your voice if no one
               knows it
               
                         frank
               i was thinking the same thing  he must
               be local  its logical for him to
               assume that the police would be there
               but he recognized andys voice and
               called him by name
                    points to the rhyme
               what about this
               
                         kathy
               i would think its some type of clue as
               to where hes going to kill next
               
                         andy
               why does he call sanderson
               
                         kathy
               hes one of the best chess players in
               the world  who better to play a game
               with
               
                         frank
                    to andy
               you still having a problem with this
               
                         andy
               yeah i am  i think hes playing us
               if i was a killer and the police were
               trying to make a case against me what
               better why to draw them off than to put
               their attention on someone else
               
     
                                                             35
                         kathy
               sending yourself anonymous notes in the
               mail is one thing  but who called him
               today
               
                         andy
               i dont know  maybe theres two of
               them  maybe he hired some wino to make
               the calls
               
                         kathy
               maybe youre reaching a bit  i think
               sanderson should be in on this
               theres a reason why the killers
               calling him
               
     a uniformed officer knocks and enters
     
                         officer
               captain we found her
               
               
     ext  warehouse  wide shot  afternoon
     
     several black and white units are parked in the rear of the
     building  frank and andy walk up the loading dock steps in
     silence
     
     
     int  warehouse  afternoon
     
     the body of christie eastman is laying on top of a large crate
     her body has been draped tightly with a sheet and her arms are
     folded across her chest  her face is deathly white and has
     been made up with the same clumsy makeup
     
     written in blood on the wall behind her is  eventually
     
     
     int  stage wings  evening
     
     peter paces back and forth waiting for the match to begin
     yurilivich is sitting in a chair watching peter with a grin
     peter turns around and almost bumps into lutz who is wearing a
     ridiculous hat with sheets of aluminium foil sticking out
     
                         lutz
               theyre trying to control my thoughts
                    points to the hat
               aluminium foil  it repels the thought
               rays
               
     peter stares at him  in the bg kathy enters looks around
     then walks over to peter
     
     
                                                             36
                         kathy
               they couldnt break the riddle
               
                         peter
               did you think it was going to be easy
               you think he was going to lay it out at
               your feet
               
                         kathy
               we need your help
               
                         peter
               i offered my help this morning and
               sedman turned me down
               
                         kathy
               but youre the key  the one he wants
               to play the game with
               
                         peter
               i cant right now  ive got a game
               
                         kathy
               she could be dead after the game
               
                         peter
               she could be dead now
               
                         kathy
               what if she isnt  where are your
               priorities  you have to think between
               someones life and a chess game
                    raising her voice
               the girl he killed last night was only
               twenty one years old  he dumped her
               body behind a warehouse like a sack of
               garbage
               
     everyone is now staring at kathy and peter who are staring at
     each other  in the bg the president appears
     
                         president
               gentlemen
               
     the grandmasters walk onto stage as peter and kathy continue to
     stare at each other  a beat  peter starts to move towards the
     stage  kathy takes a step after him  she takes a envelope
     from her jacket pocket and puts it into peters jacket pocket
     
                         kathy
               these are for you
     
     
     
                                                             37
     int  auditorium  night
     
     peter sits across from grandmaster krikorian  he makes a move
     then hits his timer  on the board behind him the move is
     duplicated  krikorian studies the board  peter is staring out
     over the audience deep in thought  krikorian makes a move and
     hits the timer  peter continues to stare unaware that it is
     his move  a beat  all eyes are on him
     
     peter turns around and stares at the big board then walks over
     and makes a move  krikorian studies his position  peter
     reaches into his pocket for a cigarette  he removes the
     envelope kathy gave him then his cigarettes  a beat  he
     stares at the envelope flicking his finger against it
     krikorian looks up annoyed  peter opens the envelope
     
     close on photographs  we see several photographs of christie
     eastman before her death  peter turns through them  next we
     see the grisly photos taken at the crime scene  he is a man
     struggling to make a decision  krikorian makes a move  peter
     does not react  he replaces the photos and stares at the
     envelope then looks up at krikorian who is watching him  a
     beat  peter replaces the envelope in his pocket then makes a
     move
     
     
     int  police conference room  night
     
     kathy sits with frank and andy  coffee cups litter with table
     the nursery rhyme is written on the blackboard and reads
     
     
     
     wee willie winkie runs through the street
     upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown
     crawling through the window
     at the end of miss emmas street
     her god has gone and left his home
     so her and i can meet
     
     
     
                         frank
               her god has gone and left his home
               
     everyone shakes there head indicating they dont understand the
     reference
     
                         kathy
               why these girls  how does he pick
               them
     
     frank points to a large map of the city on the wall with two
     red pins in different locations
               
     
                                                             38
                         frank
                    pointing to the map
               i dont think it matters  last nights
               victim christie eastman was found in a
               warehouse on the outskirts of town
               the night before debi rutlege was
               found in the center
               
                         kathy
               meaning
               
                         andy
               meaning it looks like his victims are
               chosen at random
               
                         peter os
               no
               
     peter is standing in the doorway  he enters the room
     
                         andy
               what do you mean no
               
                         peter
               he says its a game  all games have a
               strategy
               
                         andy
               all you gotta do is look at the map
               
                         peter
               his victims arent random  it only
               means that they appear to be random
               theres a connection we just have to
               find it
               
     peter turns his attention to the blackboard
     
                         peter
               what have you come up with on the
               riddle
               
                         frank
               wee willie winkie runs though the
               street  we think he might be making a
               reference to himself

     as he approaches a two story house  the pov stops moving as
     if to decide which way to go then goes around the right side
     of the house

                    offering

               thats it
               
                         frank
               we think he might be making a reference
               to drugs  miss emma is a street term
               used by junkies for morphine
               
                         peter
               could emma be the name of the girl hes
               going to kill
               
                         andy
               weve checked  theres no one with the
               last name of emma on the island
               
                         frank
               maybe hes going to drug her
               
                         kathy

     but decides to answer the phone first  she walks over and
     picks it up

     tub with the shower curtains drawn  she opens the curtain and
     tightly turns the handle to stop the nozzle from leaking

     she enters the closet and hangs up her pants  as she does so

     tennis shoes       
     
     loraine starts to leave  the tennis shoes move forward
     
     close on loraine  a gloved hand reaches over and clamps down

               its going to be a long night  it
               could take hours before we know
               something  you should try to eat
               
                         kathy
               you sound like my mother
               
                         peter
               it wasnt intentional
     
                         kathy
               does whats going on bother you at all
               or are you just wearing your game face
               
     
                                                             42
                         peter
               i think its interesting
               
                         kathy
               another kind of game
               
                         peter
               in a way
               
                         kathy
               this isnt a game
               
                         peter
               oh but it is  hes killing a person
               everyday and challenging us to catch
               him  thats a game  it has rules and
               objectives
               
                         kathy
               how can you look at it so clinically
               
                         peter
               take your average cop  they deal with
               death everyday  if they let emotions
               get in the way it would cloud their
               judgement
               
                         kathy
               thats true  but the emotion is still
               there  they just learn to control it
               
                         peter
               what about you  arent there times
               when a young child is telling you a
               story so sad you just want to cry
               
                         kathy
               of course
               
                         peter
               do you
               
                         kathy
                    uncomfortable
               lets change the subject
               
                         peter
               okay  so tell me about yourself  are
               you married
               
     kathy stops
               
                         kathy
               how did we get to that subject
               
     
                                                             43
                         peter
               im just curious
               
                         kathy
                    uncomfortable
               i think its best if we dont ask too
               many personal questions  i want to
               keep things on a professional level
               
                         peter
               you mean like in the steam room
               
                         kathy
               thats not fair
               
                         peter
               are you going to tell me you didnt
               feel something in there
               
     kathy is growing more uncomfortable by the moment
     
                         kathy
               youre projecting your own desires and
               reading more into what happened than
               what actually did
     
                         peter
               very good  spoken like a true
               psychologist  when confronted with the
               prospect of your own reality hide
               behind quotations  what is that
               masters and johnson
               
     the tension breaks  kathy smiles
     
                         kathy
               you have to win every point dont you
               
                         peter
               i just wanted to know if youre
               involved with anyone
                    beat
               let me ask you something  do your
               colleagues know if youre involved or
               not
               
                         kathy
               of course
               
                         peter
               why
               
                         kathy
               because i work with them
               
     
                                                             44
                         peter
               arent you working with me
               
     kathy smiles again amused by peters tactics
     
                         kathy
               no
               
                         peter

                    beat
               and i plan on keeping it that way
               
     kathy walks off leaving peter staring after her
               
               
     int  loraines kitchen  morning
     
     kathy frank and andy are in the room with nolan  nolan is on
     his knees at the base of a window  on the floor beside him is
     a ruler and a sheet of rubberized paper
     
                         nolan
                    proudly
               this is where he forced his way in  we
               found some fibers on the windowsill
               probably particles of clothing that
               rubbed off when he climbed through
               ill know more once i get it under the
               microscope
               
                         frank
                    not impressed
               thats great
               
                         nolan
               wait ive saved the best for last
               andy hit the lights will you
               
     andy looks for the light switch  kathy realizes shes standing
     in front of it and moves out of the way  andy turns off the
     lights and the room goes dark  nolan turns on a flashlight and
     gets down on his knees then shines the light at a low angle
     across the floor
     
     the floor  close shot  we can clearly see the impression of a
     shoe print
     
                         nolan
               its a tennis shoe  pretty old by the
               individual characteristics  about a
               size ten or eleven  this guy is big

               whats this
               
     andy points to a jagged line in the impression
               
                         nolan
               dont know  looks like a cut or a gash
               in the sole of the shoe  well blow it
               up back at the lab
               
               
     int  hallway  morning
     
     frank andy and kathy follow nolan towards the bedroom  frank
     stops and taps kathy on the shoulder
               
                         frank
               before we go in i gotta tell you this
               isnt going to be pretty
               
                         kathy
               i know that  ive seen the photos
               
                         frank
               this aint no photo
               
                                             
     int  loraines bedroom  morning
     
     frank andy  and kathy enter the room  loraines body is
     laying on the bed her appearance is like all the others
     
     on the wall written in blood is revenge
     
     kathy stares at the sight horrified  she starts to gag and
     runs from the room
     
                         frank
               same as the others
               
                         nolan
               yeah

               id say at least eighteen hours
               
                         frank
               that means she was dead before we even
               finished figuring out the message
               
     
                                                             46

               or before sanderson ever showed up to
               help us with the riddle  he figured it

     she forces a smile for jeremys sake then leaves the room
     
                         jeremy
               peter
               
                         peter
               ive got be here for the police when
               they come  then ive got to practise
               in case you forgot im in the middle of
               a match right now
               
                         jeremy
               youre always in the middle of a match
               
                         peter
               i want to be the best i can
               
     
                                                             48
                         jeremy
               sometimes i think youd rather be the
               best chess player than the best
               father  instead of thinking about what
               kind of day your daughter had you
               would rather think about the sicilian
               najdorf opening or a counter to the
               tartokover bondarevsky system
                    beat
               a relationship is not a chessboard
               you cant walk away from it and come
               back whenever you want and still expect
               all the pieces to be there
               
               
     int  peters room  morning
     
     peter enters from the bathroom wearing only his jeans  he goes
     over to his briefcase and starts to take out a paper  he
     stops then slowly takes out an old worn envelope  he stares
     at it there is a knock on the door  peter replaces the
     envelope he opens the door to find a pale and shaken kathy
     she walks into  the room
     
                         kathy
               they found the third girl  her name
               was loraine olsen  i just came from
               the crime scene  it was horrible  how
               can anybody do something like that
               you got anything to drink around here
               
     peter walks over to the bar and pours her a brandy  he brings
     it over to her and sits beside her on the couch  kathy gulps
     it down
               
                         peter
               relax

               how could you  unless you were there
               
     their eyes lock for a moment each probing the others
     
                         kathy
               sorry i didnt mean that the way it
               sounded

     int  hotel basement  morning
     
     damp and dark  a large cavernous room built under the hotel
     several smaller rooms or alcoves connect to the main room
     through a series of joining doors  florescent lights spaced on
     the ceiling cast long shadows through the room  large water
     pipes and electrical mains run across the ceiling

     tenses  he walks over and picks it up  a loudspeaker is

                                                             52
                         peter
               huxleys quote also says his play is
               always fair and just
               
                         caller os

               rules
               
     the line goes dead  peter hangs up
     
                         andy
               what in the hell do you think youre
               doing  slamming down the phone in the
               middle of the trace
               
                         peter
               you think youre going to catch him on
               a trace  everything he does is planned
               out well in advance  the only way
               were going to get him is to rattle him
                make him slip up
               
                         frank
               you never know how youre going to
               catch a suspect
               
                         kathy
               peters right captain  hes got to be
               forced into making a mistake
               
                         andy
               we didnt ask for your opinion doctor
               
                         peter
               maybe you should
               
     peter stares at andy defiantly
     
                         andy
               you dont tell us how to run our
               investigation  you got that
               
                         peter
               you dont have an investigation without
               me  you got that
               
     the two men lock eyes hostilely
     
                         frank
               what were you going to say kathy
               
     
                                                             53
                         kathy
               well i think you have to play to his
               ego  he thinks hes superior  the
               more secure he feels the more chances
               hell take
     
                         frank
               what did he mean by huxley
               
                         peter
               he was referring to a quote by thomas
               henry huxley
                    quoting
               the chess board is the world the
               pieces are the phenomena of the
               universe the rules of the game are
               what we call nature  the player on the
               other side is hidden from us  we know
               that his play is always fair just and
               patient  but also we know to our
               cost that he never overlooks a
               mistake or makes the smallest
               allowances for ignorance
     
     
     ext  puget sound  afternoon
     
     peter and kathy are sitting on the beach  peter draws squares
     in the sand like a chessboard and starts moving shells and
     rocks around  kathy grins
     
                         kathy
               are you playing chess
               
     peter smiles like a boy with his hand caught in the cookiejar
     
                         peter
               when i was little id watch the other
               kids playing baseball from my room  in
               the evening when their parents would
               call them in to put their bats and
               balls away id watch them from my
               window forcing expressions of
               disappointment trying to gain another
               few minutes outside so they could play
                but no one could stop me from
               playing
                    he closes his eyes
               all i had to do was close my eyes and
               my whole world became a chessboard  i
               could see the pieces and sometimes it
               felt like if i reached out i could
               almost touch them  i ordered them and
               they obeyed
               
     
                                                             54
     kathy stares at him for a moment unsure what to make of his
     speech  peter opens his eyes there is a beat as he seems to
     bridge the gap back to this world  he smiles
               
                         kathy
               can you go fifteen minutes without
               thinking about it
               
                         peter
                    thinks for a moment

                         kathy

     he smiles at her  he destroys the pattern in the sand takes
     her hand and they start walking
     
                         peter

     peter stops and smiles

               look why dont you just come out and
               ask me what you want to know
               
     kathy hesitates
     
                         peter
               was it serious between debi and me

     kathy stares at him almost studying him for a moment
     
                         peter
               what
               
                         kathy

               start to talk about something serious
               you start to play games
               
                         peter

                                                             56
                         kathy
               nobody could attack you  you set your
               life up like one of your chessboards
               youre impregnable  but at the same
               time youve become trapped behind your
               own defenses  youre cut off from
               everyone around you
               
                         peter
               what are you talking about  you dont
               even know me
               
                         kathy
               does anyone
               
     he starts to walk away
               
                         kathy
               are you forfeiting
               
     he stops dead in his tracks turns and walks back
               
                         peter
               i just dont want to fight with you
               
                         kathy
               then show me who you are
               
     peter thinks  theres a seriousness we havent seen before
     
                         peter
               this frightens me  because im
               starting to feel things i havent felt
               in a long time
               
                         kathy
               youve got to face the things you feel
               
                         peter
                    a little grin
               i thought you were the woman who didnt
               want to get involved
               
                         kathy
               i said i didnt plan on getting
               involved
               
     he moves closer  she takes a step back
               
                         peter
                    moving closer
               what happened to facing the things we
               feel
               
     
                                                             57
                         kathy
                    giving in
               you can turn everything around so
               easily  this is not just another game
               is it
               
                         peter
               no
               
     they stare at each other each of them probing the others eyes
     peter leans forward and gently kisses her on the lips  he
     kisses her again  their passion builds until they throw their
     arms around each other and embrace passionately
     
     
     int  peters living room  afternoon
     
     peter pins her against the wall and kisses her  she wraps her
     legs around his waist as he holds her against the wall  they
     continue to kiss as they move along the wall knocking pictures
     off the wall  peter carries her over to a large chessboard
     with one hand he sweeps the pieces off onto the floor then
     sits her down on it  they kiss each other furiously each of
     them groping at the others clothing  their hands move along
     each others bodies exploring touching feeling  he un
     buttons her blouse then kisses her neck working his way to
     her breasts  kathy closes her eyes submitting to the pleasure
     of his touch
     
     
     int  peters bedroom  afternoon
     
     two silhouettes  bodies intertwined  the sounds of love
     making fill the room
     
                                             slow fade to black
     
     
     int  peters bedroom  later  night

     a light comes on  kathy lays next to peter  she rolls over
     and kisses him
               
               
                         kathy

                         peter
                    nibbling at her neck
               you
               
                         kathy

               if i have to  im going to take a
               shower
               
     peter goes into the bathroom  kathy sits up and throws on a t
     shirt  she goes to the desk  by the phone is a copy of the
     white pages  she starts to look up the number  in bg we
     hear the shower
     
     close on phone book  in the middle of the page a name is
     underlined in red  it reads  rutlege debi
     
     kathy stares at the name  a beat  slowly she turns through
     the pages
     
     close on phone book  the name eastman christie is underlined
     the pages are quickly turned again until we see the name olsen
     loraine underlined
     
     kathy is stunned  she thinks for a second then gets up and
     starts getting dressed  in the bg we hear the shower stop
     
                         peter os

     she finishes dressing then heads for the door  she opens the
     door and stops then looks back
     
     her pov her purse is on the nightstand
     
     she hesitates then quickly walks back to get it  she picks it
     up and starts back for the door when peter steps out of the
     bathroom  he stares at her
     
                         peter
               where are you going

               go pick up the pizza
               
                         peter
                    moving closer to her
               i thought you said the line was busy
               
                         kathy

                         kathy
                    backing away
               nothing
               
                         peter
                    following her
               then why are you backing up
               
     peter waits for an answer  there isnt one  he looks around
     the room retracing in his mind what could have happened  he
     sees the open phone book on the dresser next to him  he stares
     at it for a moment then back at kathy
     
                         peter
               this
                    
     she doesnt answer  peter appears disappointed
     
                         peter
               i was looking for correlations between
               their names addresses anything that
               might be the same
                    
     kathy looks away
     
                         peter
               youre as bad as andy maybe worse
               
     he walks over to a chair and sits down freeing the path to the
     door
     
                         kathy
               peter you have to admit
               
                         peter
               admit what  that i was right about
               you in the steam room  that youre
               willing to do anything to find out what
               you want  would you like me to leave
               so you can search the rest of the room
     
                                                             60

                         peter
                    cutting her off

               how could you think that kathy  how
               could you even consider it
               
     a beat  kathy thinks for a moment then walks to the door and
     leaves  a beat  peter gets up stares at the phone book then
     closes it softly

                    points to his hat
               aluminium foil  it repels the thought
               rays

                         president
               since grandmaster sanderson leads the
               tournament with nine wins  and
               grandmaster yurilivich is in second
               with eight  it as become apparent
               that with only four games remaining
               the other players should they win all
               four of their remaining games would
               still not be in a position to win the
               tournament  therefore we have decided
               that the remaining games between
               grandmaster sanderson and yurilivich
               will be held separately

               what do you want
               
                         andy

                                                             63
                         peter
               no
               
                         andy
               i used to  with my old man  he taught
               me how to hunt and trap  trappings a
               lot harder than most people think  we
               used to go after raccoons mostly
               theyd get into our garbage our
               fields  when an animal cant live
               peacefully with those around it it has
               to be destroyed  but theyre crafty
               little devils  you see the trick is
               you can put your trap down but no
               raccoon is going come near it unless
               you lay down the scent  you ever smell
               raccoon scent  smells like shit but
               to a male raccoon it smells just like
               pussy  hell walk right up to that
               trap even though it dont look nothing
               like a raccoon and stick his goddam
               head right in it  you know why  cause
               he cant help himself  the scent
               drives him  so if you want to catch a
               raccoon all you gotta do is figure out
               where he is  lay down the scent 
               and sooner or later hell walk right
               into the trap
               
                         peter
               what if he doesnt bite  what if hes
               an exceptionally bright raccoon
               
                         andy
               well then you just gotta find out
               where he is  and once youre sure
               where he is  you shoot the fucker
               
     a beat  they stare at each other  andy walks to the door and
     leaves
               
               
     ext  peters hotel room balcony  night
     
     peter sits outside thinking  jeremy and erica join him
     
                         erica

     peter smiles  there is a long pause  peter looks at jeremy
     they stare at each other
     
                         peter

     jeremy pulls out a printout of chess board with pieces in
     different positions  he shows it to peter

     a moment  he cant believe he could miss such an obvious move

     stares at her evaluating her
     
     
                                                             69

     erica stares at her
     
                         kathy

                         erica
                    confidentially
               i know he really likes you
               
                         kathy

               something

               these things
               
     kathy smiles  she looks up and sees peter standing in the
     doorway  there is a moment of embarrassment between them
     
                         peter
               honey why dont you run down to
               jeremys now
               
     
                                                             70

                         kathy
               nice meeting you
               
     she walks over to peter and gives him a kiss
     
                         erica
                    whispering
               i like her  shes nice
     
     erica leaves  there is an uncomfortable moment between peter
     and kathy  they look at each other probing each others eyes
     there is a knock on the door  frank and andy enter their
     expressions are serious
     
                         peter
               another one
                    frank nods

               anywhere but im beating you
               
     the callers statement hits home  slowly a look of
     determination covers peters face
     
                         peter
               so why were you looking for doctor

               i couldnt tell you that  it would
               ruin the game
               
                         caller os
               the games almost over peter and
               youre running out of time
               
     peters face hardens eyes intensely staring off in the
     distance
               
                         peter
               its you whos running out of time

               theres an old wooden bench in the
               garden  next to it is a rock  youll
               find a message for you under it  lets
               see if youre as clever as you think
               you are
     
                                                             72
               
     the line goes dead  peter hangs up his frustration shows
     
     
     int  police conference room  afternoon
     
     peter sits across the desk from frank  kathy stands by the
     window  the room is crowded with the callers clues  the map
     with colored pins in it  the words  remember eventually
     revenge is  a copy of the callers note written on the
     blackboard  it reads
     
     
     
     peter
     
     in a fierce magazine you will find a hint of my action to come
     
     as large as you maybe in the world of pawns and castles you are
     still light years from reaching me   invisible as the air one
     hundred men with their desperate pleas to stop cant move me
     
     
     
     peter walks over to the blackboard and studies the note
     
                         peter
                    reading
               in a fierce magazine youll find a hint
               of my actions to come why does he
               set this line apart
               
                         kathy
               for emphasis
               
                         peter
               exactly  its the key
               
                         kathy
               but what does he mean by a fierce
               magazine  violent
               
                         peter
               a fierce magazine brutal
                    thinking aloud
               an angry magazine a war magazine
               a mercenary magazine  fierce
                    he gets it
               mad
               
                         kathy
               what
               
                         peter
               wheres the note
     
                                                             73
               
                         andy
               you got it on the board
               
                         peter
               no i need the original note
               
                         andy
               theres a photostat of the original on
               the wall
     
     peter gets up and takes the note off the wall and studies it
     for a moment then starts to fold it in half
     
                         peter
               my daughter reads mad magazine all the
               time  if you fold the back cover a
               certain way the text reads
               differently
               
     peter moves the crease of the paper in and out until it forms
     the correct margin
     
     
     the note now reads
     
     
     
     in a fierce action to come
     
     as large as castles you are
     still light as the air
     one hundred men cant move me
     
     
     
     kathy looks at peter impressed
     
                         peter
                    reading
               as large as castles  you are still
               light as air one hundred men cant
               move me
               
                         frank
               it doesnt make sense
               
                         kathy
               it doesnt make sense because we dont
               understand it
               
                         andy
               but a hundred men could move him
               
     
                                                             74
                         peter
                    losing patience
               hes not talking about himself
               
                         andy
               then whats he talking about
               
                         peter
                    on edge
               if we knew that wed know the answer to
               the riddle wouldnt we  hes telling
               us where hes going to kill tonight and
               we cant see it
               
                         frank
               maybe we should back up a minute and
               take a look at what we do have  all
               the girls that have been killed have
               been killed at night  theyre all the
               same type  all moved into their homes
               within the last three months  and all
               of them found their homes through
               homesearchers
               
                         kathy
               i thought that homesearchers was a dead
               end
               
                         frank
               it cant be a coincidence  the woman
               that owns it has a son  she says hes
               been on vacation in montana for the
               last ten days  were trying to locate
               him  theres also a cleaning service
               that comes in once a week  were
               checking that out too
               
                         kathy
               he moves around a lot  why
               
                         andy
               he finds his victims through
               homesearchers  he goes where they are
               
     peter is only halflistening to the conversation  he appears
     deep in thought
     
                         kathy
               but they rent lots of apartments  he
               could probably find them all in a
               localized area  why move all over the
               island
               
     peter slowly comes to a realization  his eyes open wide as a
     thought crashes into his mind
     
                                                             75
     
                         peter
               jesus  it cant be that easy
               
     peter walks to the map of the victims locations on the wall
     he moves his finger from point to point examining each
     location  kathy frank and andy watch him  peter continues to
     move his finger in various geometric lines across the map
     
                         andy
               you want to tell us what the hell
               youre doing
               
     peter doesnt answer  he stares at the map for a few more
     seconds as the excitement of his realization grows  he takes
     a step back and turns to kathy
     
                         peter
               he told us and we missed it  he said
               hes never been anywhere  therefore
               this island is the world to him
                    pointing to the map
               as far as hes concerned this is a map
               of the world  thats why he quoted
               huxley  the chessboard is the world
               
     peter takes a marksolot off kathys desk and draws a large
     square border on the map outlining the grids eight by eight
     
                         peter
               hes using the map as a chessboard
               the sonofabitch is playing chess with
               me
               
                         frank
               how can he be playing chess with you
               youre not making any moves against
               him
               
                         peter
               maybe i already have
               
     peter rushes towards the door
               
     
     int  auditorium  afternoon
     
     peter is with kathy frank andy and david at the computer
     station

                         peter
               hes replaying the game i played
               against him move by move using these
               girls as the chess pieces
                    beat
               all the girls have been found in their
               homes except christie eastman who was
               found in back of a warehouse  why
               
                         kathy
                    making the
                     connection
               because to follow the game he played he
               had to move to that grid
               
                         peter
               right
                    he searches the map
                     and points to a spot
               here  c4

                         peter
               but he had to dump the body there to
               make the move
               
                         kathy
               now that you know what stage of the
               game hes at can we figure out where
               his next move is going to be
               
     peter walks over to the map and traces his finger over it then
     looks at the computer printout
     
                         peter
               his last move was c1f4  i would move
               f8g7  his next move using the
               tarakoss would be e2e3 that
               would be
                    points to a spot
               right here
               
     there is a moment of silence as kathy frank and andy both
     digest what they have heard
     
                         kathy
               each of those grids represents almost a
               square mile
               
                         frank
               thats a big area to cover

     yurilivich makes a move then hits his timer  peter studies
     the board  he looks up at yurilivich  both of them stare at
     each other intensely  peter looks back at the board and makes
     a move  on the big board a piece moves then stops halfway
     between a square  a moment later the entire board breaks up
     into an unreadable mass of lines  theres a groan from the
     crowd  the president walks over to david and confers with him
     quickly then goes to the players
     
                         president

     int  apartment bedroom  night
     
     the pov climbs through the window and studies the woman in bed
     for a moment  she is on her side her back to him  sensing
     something the woman turns over  the woman is not officer

               im getting a bad feeling about this
               if yurilivich was making a move we
               would have heard something from andy by
               now

     of a chair peter stands  a beat

               the other night  i said some things
               that maybe i shouldnt have  i mean

               can see how you thought what you did

               im not looking for an apology peter
               
                         peter
               i was thinking that maybe when this

                         kathy

               no listen  you have no idea of the
               kind of pressure im under right now
               
                         kathy
               thats still no excuse  you treat
               everything like a game
               
                         peter
               i cant think any more unless its
               about you  ill be in the middle of a
               match and instead of thinking about my
               next move i think about how you look
               when you smile
                    beat
               remember how you said that i hide
               behind my chessboard  ever since my
               wife died ive been
                    this isnt easy
               ive been afraid of getting too close
               to someone again  afraid of losing
               them
               
                         kathy
               youre wife died  you cant feel
               responsible for that
               
                         peter
               you dont understand
               
                         kathy
               then help me to understand  i want to
               understand
               
                         peter
               its not that easy
               
                         kathy
               of course it isnt  its always
               difficult when someone you love dies
               but you cant feel responsible because
               she had a car accident
                         
                         peter
               but i do
               
                         kathy
               why
               
                         peter
               because she killed herself

               oh the police said it was an accident
                but i knew  ive always known  i
               closed myself off to her and after i
               found the letter i closed myself off to
               everything else  beating yurilivich
               and playing for the title was all i
               could think about  but i snapped  i
               had a breakdown in the middle of the
               match  i dont remember too much about
               it

               this letter  ive never opened it
               
                         kathy
               why not
               
                         peter
               because i know what it says
               
                         kathy
               maybe youre afraid of what it says
               
     a beat  peter walks to the couch and sits down  he stares at
     the envelope then starts to open it  he stops and looks up at
     kathy who nods her head  kathy starts to leave
     
                         peter
               will you stay with me

               peter  there are many pains we feel in
               this world  but loving someone who
               has shut you out of his life has to be
               the most unbearable of them all  i
               knew when we married that you were a
               man consumed with ambition but
               somewhere along the way your
               chessboard became your wife and i
               became your mistress

               i know now that you cannot change
               cannot give me the things i need  you
               may think that im a coward for what i
               am about to do but it is my choice
               my release  i only ask that you shield
               erica from the truth and that you
               forgive me for being so weak

               doctor sheppard what goes on in the
               mind of someone like this
               
                         kathy
               thats a very difficult question to
               answer
               
                         reporter
               is there a usual scenario
                                             
                         kathy
               well  yes usually we find theyve
               had a traumatic childhood  he was
               probably abused by a dominant female
               figure  that coupled with the fact
               that these girls have not been raped
               leads me to believe that he is either
               impudent or a latent homosexual
               regardless hes acting out some type
               of revenge fantasy that fulfills some
               sick sexual needs

                         peter
               period  thats what he meant about

     eventually
     revenge
     is
     carefully
     planned
     
     he stands back and studies it  his eyes dart across the
     message like a chessboard calculating evaluating

     peter erases the word planned  and adds arranged at the
     bottom  he studies it for a moment then closes his eyes  he
     turns around and takes a few steps then stops dead in his
     tracks  his eyes open wide as a thought crashes into his mind
     he turns around and stares at the board confirming what he
     already knows

     long flash of lightning  suddenly her expression turns to one
     of horror as she sees something in the next room

     mirror  the lightning lights the room well enough for her to
     see a mans silhouette in the mirror  he is standing on the

     off his feet  he falls back into the murky water and

     and the blinking lights dont make it easy  peter leans over
     pointing the gun at the ground

     his body jerks backwards violently smashing into the wall
     then he slides down and dies slowly disappearing under the
     surface of the water
