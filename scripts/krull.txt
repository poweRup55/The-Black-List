a guard sees the band of warriors emerge from the forest

            middling well

colwyn stands and we see that he is several inches taller
than his father

                        turold

            the attacks are unceasing by night

            unlimitedext gloomy forest road day

two mounted slayers ride along the road their horses and
armor are black as are their cylindrical flattopped
helmets pierced with a tslot for vision their weapons are
longswords and maces

two more slayers ride out of the forest and join the black
column at a road up ahead wait three more who swing in
behind the column as it passes

forest noises die at the slayers approach the only sounds
we hear are the clink of metal and the heavy thud of the
horses hoovesint tower staircase day

colwyn mounts a narrow circular staircase toward a wooden
doorint tower room intercut

lyssa the queens seventeenyearold daughter stares
across the circular room at the wooden door listening to
colwyns approaching footsteps

the door swings open and colwyn enters they stare at each
other for several moments colwyn dusty and disheveled in
his armor lyssa freshly scrubbed and glowing in a
diaphanous gown

                        colwyn
               nervous
            im colwyn

lyssa nods noncommittal they start to circle the room
eyes fixed on each other like a pair of nervous cats

                        colwyn
               plaintive
            are you lyssa

she gives him another noncommittal nod they resume their
tentative circling

suddenly lyssa turns away leaning on the sill of a narrow
window her shoulders begin to heave as if shes sobbing
colwyn is in agony he rushes across the room to her

                        colwyn
            i dont care what arrangements were
            made by our parents you dont have
            to go through with it

lyssa continues to heave

                        colwyn
            they cant force you i wont let
            them

lyssa turns around and colwyn sees that shes not sobbing
butlaughing

                        lyssa
               trying to control her
                laughter
            im sorry i couldnt help it

                        colwyn
               taking considerable umbrage
            i dont have to go through with it
            either

                        lyssa

            i had nightmares all week

                        lyssa
               sits down beside him

            reek of sweat and horses

                        colwyn
               pompously
            if youre going to marry a warrior
            youd best get used to it

                        lyssa
            i have no intention of getting used
            to it

she goes over to a small cistern and fills a wooden bucket

            scrub you down

            parapet and ill hand the buckets up
            to you

colwyn looks at the stone stairs leading to the top of the
tower

                        colwyn

               looks at lyssa sighs

he starts up the stairsext road crossing day

a column of mounted slayers waits at the crossing for
another column to reach the intersection the first column
falls in beside the second as it passes forming a double
column

others but distinguished by the leopard embroidered on his
chest and by his lance which bears a pennon affixed to its

            the leopard banner

                        queen
            for some the lure of power is
            stronger than the ties of blood no
            matter i had hoped to have the
            wedding next spring lord turold
            with all the nobles of the kingdom
            in attendance but fate and this war
            have ordained otherwise

                        turold
            it is important to assure the
            succession

                        queen
            yes

the queen smiles and beckons turold closer he kneels beside
the bed

                        queen
            you knew you are a rude bumpkin

                        turold
               smiles
            that i am my lady

turold looks out the window at the north tower

                        turold

angle from the queens bedroom window a waisthigh wall
conceals the bottom half of a naked colwyn who stands atop
the tower hugging himself in the brisk windext top of north tower intercut

colwyn hears lyssa mounting the stairs and moves to the
doorway reaching around to take the bucket from her

                        colwyn
               as lyssa pushes past him
            just hand me the bucket what are
            you doing

he backs away covering himself with his hands lyssa
advances on him tucked in her belt like a sword is a
longhandled bath brush

                        lyssa
            i dont trust you to wash behind
            your ears

                        colwyn
            never mind my ears go away

the queen and turold watch the unfolding drama from their
window vantage point a great tongue of water leaps across
the tower as lyssa heaves the bucketful at colwyn dripping
wet he retreats but is soon cornered and attacked without
quarter lyssa wielding brush and soap with gleeful
enthusiasm at one point colwyn squirms free and with his
head completely enveloped in lather tries to flee but
since he cant see he soon fetches up against a wall and
lyssa continues her scrubbingresume  queens bedroomturold

                        colwyn

            maybe youd better look around for
            another candidate i dont think my
            skin is tough enough to survive a
            lifetime of you and your brush

they close in a passionate kiss and begin caressing each
other we see turold standing in the doorway watching them

                        turold
            youll both wait at least for five
            hours the wedding is at three

                        colwyn
               acting offended
            it was a platonic kiss father

                        turold

turold snorts down a laugh colwyn and lyssa begin to
giggle then all three break into laughterext courtyard of white castle day

the occupants of the castle  servants soldiers minor

the two men spur their horses toward the wedding couple who
stand perfectly still as the horses thunder down on them
turold and rowan swing their swords directly above the heads
of the young couple the blades striking with aclang then
they wheel their horses to a stop colwyn and lyssa almost
obscured by the whirling dust have not moved a muscle

                        turold
            let it be done then

he hurls his sword at the ground beside the wedding couple

                        rowan
            it is done

he hurls his sword which sticks in the ground beside
turolds crossing it a cheer goes up from the spectators
and the guards on the walls

as colwyn and lyssa kiss a crossbow bolt strikes one of the
guards who topples thirty feet to the courtyard below
slayers appear around the walls leaping over the parapet
and attacking the guards

                        turold
               shouts
            slayers to arms

men and women arm themselves as slayers descend the walls
they mount a fierce counterattack against the slayers women
fighting beside their men lyssa fighting beside colwyn

but suddenly the main gate is rammed open and a dozen
slayers on horseback led by modred attack the defenders
from the rear in the melee colwynn and lyssa are
separatedext queens balcony day

the queen and her girls hear slayers forcing the door to her
bedroom within

                        queen
            help me up i will die on my feet

the two girls help the queen to stand she faces the door
defiantly as it bursts open a slayer steps into the
bedroom

                        queen
            and i will not die alone

she hurls a knife which pierces the slayers throat but
even as he falls three more slayers enter the room and
advance on the three women who stare back defiantlyext courtyard of white castle day

colwyn sees that his father is being pressed by several
slayers and hacks his way to his side they dispatch their
assailants then colwyn looks through the courtyard for
lyssa who has just run a slayer through with her short
sword when she is felled from behind by modreds mailed
fist he picks her up and lays her across his saddle

                        colwyn

               opens a door in the wall
            through the door
               as colwyn hesitates
            quickly

they go through the door and are followed shortly by two
slayersint corridor in wall of white castle day

colwyn and turold back down the dark corridor fighting the
two slayers they kill the slayers but in the exchange
turold is badly wounded he leans against the wall holding
himself erect by force of will

colwyn pressed one of the roughhewn stones and a door
swings open in the wall a staircase leads to an underground
passage he moves to help his father through the door

                        turold
               shaking his head

            try to reach ynyr the old one

                        colwyn
            i must follow the slayers theyve
            taken lyssa

                        turold
               sharply
            you will not follow the slayers you
            will obey my command
               softer
            you have no chance alone boy you
            must try to break through to ynyr
            he has great knowledge only with
            his help can you save lyssa

they hear footsteps in the corridor

                        turold
            go now
               as colwyn hesitates
            go i command you

as colwyn enters the passage and begins swinging the heavy
door shut modred appears advancing on turold with drawn
sword turold places himself in front of the door but he is
weak from his wound and goes down under modreds first blow
modred thrusts his sword into the crack of the door
preventing it from closing turold slumped against the
wall looks up at him with pleading eyes

                        turold
            spare him modred have you never
            loved anyone

                        modred
               after a pause
            if i spare him they will kill me

                        turold
            he is your godson now he and lyssa
            were married

modred stares at him for some moments then withdraws his
sword allowing the door to close turold flashes a look of
gratitude then diesext courtyard of white castle day

the castle is in flames the occupants slain

the slayers mounted wait in a double column for modreds
command lyssa sits on a horse in the middle of the column
her hands tied behind her modred approaches her with a skin
canteen of water which she refuses by averting her face he
steps back and signals the column which trots out through
the main gate

as modred mounts his horse to follow the column the twin
suns dip below the horizon modred rides through the main
gate disappearing in the shadows we hear an inhumanscream amplified by the stone walls of the gate

modreds riderless horse emerges from the other side of the
gate a new angle shows modred lying on the stone floor
beneath the gate tower his chest raked bydeep gougesext woods near white castle night

colwyn stands beside the exit of the underground passage
tears running down his cheeks as he stares at the burning
castle in the distanceext forest near granite needle day

the forest ends abruptly some distance from the edge of a
steep cliff a natural stone bridge arches from the cliff to
the granite needle a cylindrical formation that rises from
the floor of the valley below

colwyn stands at the edge of the forest looking out at a
group of slayers posted near the stone bridge nearby are a
pair of black tents housing more slayers

he hears a noise and turns to see a slayer behind him
drawing his sword as the slayer rushes colwyn hurls his
knife at the tslot in the slayers cylindrical helmet
striking him between the eyesext granite needle day

colwyn wearing the dead slayers helmet and armor
approaches the group near the stone bridge the bridge leads
to an opening in the side of the needle which gives access
to a passage which extends some ten feet into the needle
before it takes a rightangle turn

on the floor of the passage are heaped the bodies of half a
dozen slayers though ynyr may not be able to get out he is
clearly capable of preventing anyone from getting in

                        colwyn
            the old man must sleep sometime

                        slayer
            yes sometime but when

                        colwyn
            perhaps now

                        slayer
            perhaps youd like to stroll across
            the bridge and find out

                        colwyn
            perhaps i will

                        2nd slayer
            go right ahead brother and let the
            old man put you to sleep forever 
               nods toward bodies
             along with them

the slayers laugh but fall silent as colwyn draws his sword
and starts across the bridge

he moves across the bridge into the passageway stepping
over bodies as he nears the rightangle turnint cave in granite needle intercut  day

ynyr stares down the passage toward the rightangle turn in
his hand held out before him is asilver glaive a cross
shaped weapon with four equal blades

when colwyn rounds the corner into view the glaive leaps
from the old mans hand and spins down the passageway

                        colwyn
               pulling off his helmet
            i am colwyn son of turold

the glaive stops in midair inches from colwyns throat

realizing theyve been tricked two slayers start across the
bridge to attack colwyn but the old man projects his glaive
past the boy where it hangs in midair spinning and
glowing the slayers retreat

                        slayer
            there is no way out he will die
            there with the old man

in the cave colwyn stands in front of ynyr

                        colwyn
            the white castle has fallen

                        ynyr
            does the queen live

                        colwyn
            the new queen lives

                        ynyr
            turolds son was to marry her

                        colwyn
            we were married then she was taken
            by the slayers you must help me

                        ynyr
            i have lived in this place like my
            fathers before me guarding the old
            knowledge i knew when i had no
            son that the great war would come
            in my time and that i would be the
            one to pass on the old knowledge to
            a new king come

colwyn glances toward the entrance

                        ynyr
            it is night the slayers have gone
            to their tents and the bridge is
            guarded by dark ones they will not
            cross for they have no power in
            this place

colwyn follows ynyr through a passageway to int triangular room in granite needle night

colwyn and ynyr sit beside a fire in a triangular pit in the
floor colwyn has shed the slayers armor and ynyr holds a
black onyx box in his lap

                        ynyr
            this is not the first time the dark
            ones have attacked our world they
            came once before a thousand years
            ago a young king and queen with
            extraordinary powers were given to
            us then to lead the struggle my
            forefather was their councilor as
            i will be yours

                        colwyn
            i have no extraordinary powers

                        ynyr
            your powers are greater than you
            know
               indicates his glaive
            have you ever seen one of these

                        colwyn
            in the old books its called a
            glaive

ynyr opens the onyx box to reveal agolden glaive

                        ynyr
            this belonged to the young king who
            fought the dark ones a thousand
            years ago now it is yours

colwyn picks up the glaive turns it in his hands the
blades flashing in the firelight

                        ynyr
            with two or three days practice
            youll be able to use it as well as
            i can then well have a chance of
            fighting our way out of here

                        colwyn
            two or three days while lyssa is in
            their hands

                        ynyr
            there is no other way

                        colwyn
               looks at the fire
            but there is another entrance to
            this place

ynyr follows colwyns gaze and sees that hes judging from
the movement of the flames

                        ynyr
            yesint tunnel in granite needle night

                        ynyr
            but it opens onto the sheer wall of
            the needle theres no way down

                        colwyn
            you have rope

                        ynyr
            i am too old to climb down a rope

                        colwyn
            you wont have toext opening in wall of granite needle night

colwyn inserts his glaive in a crack beside the opening
then ties a rope to the glaive and climbs down the wallext bottom of granite needle intercut  night

colwyn reaches the ground and signals ynyr who unties the
rope from the glaive and secures it around his waist then
he lowers the rope over the glaive which allows colwyn to
lower him down the side of the needleext nearby cliff intercut  night

a dark one watches them from the top of the cliff its red
eyes peering over the edge the thing moves quickly down the
rock face with only an occasional scrape or flash of claw
to mark its descent

at the bottom of the cliff the red eyes appear above a rock
 only a few yards from colwyn but before it can attack atridentflashes through the air and strikes the thing square
in the face the outer prongs of the weapon piercing the red
eyes we hear a death grunt then the sound of a body
falling

colwyn turns but sees nothing he lowers ynyr to the ground
and they set off across the valley floorext forest clearing just before dawn

the golden glaive stands upright on colwyns outstretched
palm ynyr kneels beside him

                        ynyr
            focus on the glaive

colwyn tenses with concentration the glaive begins to spin
at first slowly then faster and faster until its a golden
blur

                        ynyr
            reach out with your mind reach out
            to lyssa

colwyn furrows his brow in concentrationcolwyns telepathic search intercut

through a translucent image of lyssa we see stretches of
terrain moving past bizarre forests and valleys gargoyle
mountains rainbow lakes

                        colwyn
               sweating
            there is nothing

                        ynyr
            reach out farther call to her

            lyssa  lyssa ext fortress of krull in the mountains just before dawn

a long shot shows only a series of jagged peaks but as we
move in we see the outlines of a gigantic fortress
designed to blend into the mountains

lyssa walks along the parapets of the fortress a cold wind
whipping at her light garments the occasional glint of
talon or beak the quick flash of a red eye tell us that
she is closely watched and guarded

                        colwyn over

            no they watch me closely but they
            havent harmed me

                        ynyr
               to colwyn
            where we must know where she is

colwyns face is bathed in sweat his hand clenched tight

                        colwyn over
            lyssa where are they keeping you

                        lyssa over
            in a great fortress in the
            mountains wait somethings
            happening

as the twin suns edge above the horizon the fortress fades
and disappears the whistle of the wind changes to ext fortress of krull in the jungle dawn

 tropical bird sounds as the fortress appears in the
midst of the jungle its walls covered with liana vines

                        lyssa over
            everythings changed now the
            fortress is in the jungle

colwyns body is shaking from the strain of maintaining
contact ynyr grips his shoulder

                        ynyr
            enough boy

but colwyn continues to concentrate

                        ynyr
            enough

ynyrslapshim sharply knocking him backward the boy lies
exhausted breathing heavily

                        ynyr
            you must break when the strain
            becomes too great or you will harm
            yourself and you must concentrate
            your powers for when they are needed
            most what did she answer

                        colwyn
            she was in a great fortress first
            in the mountains then in the
            jungle how is that possible

                        ynyr
            it is the fortress of krull i know
            it only from the stories of wars on
            other worlds they did not use it on
            our world in the first great war
            for it costs them enormous power
            this time they mean to conquer at
            all costs

                        colwyn
            the fortress moves

                        ynyr
            yes each dawn it rises in a
            different land sometimes in the
            mountains sometimes in the jungle
            sometimes the desert sometimes the
            sea never in the same place twice

                        colwyn
            then even if lyssa tells us where
            she is well never be able to reach
            her for they will never allow the
            fortress to rise near us

                        ynyr
            no they occupy the fortress but
            they cannot control its movement it
            is moved by fate and sooner or
            later fate will place it near us

                        colwyn
            then we must be ready five leagues
            from here is the eastern tower i
            know the barons who hold it good
            men and brave they will help us

                        ynyr
            you have not slept in two days

                        colwyn
            nor will i till my bride is beside

they set off through the forestresume lyssa

                        lyssa
               calling
            colwyn colwyn

she hears the scrape of a taloned foot behind her and
hurries along the parapet she stops and looks down at a
small clearing in the jungle outside the wallsext jungle clearing intercut  day

a fawn grazes in the clearing unaware of awhite leopardpoised on a branch above it as the leopard is about to
pounce it glances up and sees lyssa staring down from the
fortress wall as if in answer to her summons it jumps to
the ground and heads for the wall

the leopard leaps onto the walkway in front of lyssa then
moves obediently to her side they set off down the walkway
together

suddenly the leopard whirls androarsas it hears the scrape
of a taloned foot behind but other dark ones are in front
of them lyssa is forced to descend a stone staircase the
leopard acting as rear guard roars its defiance as it
backs down the stairsext forest brook day

colwyn and ynyr are about to cross the tiny stream when
suddenly asmall white cloudmaterializes above the water
bulging and gyrating affording brief glimpses of feet and
hands as if a small man were trying to escape as colwyn
jumps back drawing his sword the cloud vanishes with apopand the small man ergo is plopped on his seat in the water
which is only a few inches deep

                        ergo
            help help im drowning

                        colwyn
            i doubt it the water is only an
            inch deep

                        ergo
               stands
            it could have been quicksand i
            might have been sucked to my death
               jumps out of the water
            where is this place

                        colwyn
            a forest near the valley of needles

                        ergo

            certain difference of opinion
            concerning a venison pie the
            foolish man left it sitting on his
            windowsill what did he expect

                        colwyn
            perhaps he expected to eat it

                        ergo
            for that rudeness peasant lout i
            am going to leave you hanging by
            your heels when i depart which is
            right now

from the folds of his voluminous clothing ergo produces a
tattered spellbook he peers at a page mumbles to himself
and pokes his head toward colwyn  whereupon he vanishes
colwyn glances around but the little man is nowhere to be
seen

                        ergo os
            get me down from here

colwyn turns and sees ergo hanging upsidedown from a tree
limb directly behind him he lifts him down

                        ergo
            my spells always go wrong when i am
            observed be gone

            the forest is not safe these days
            youd best travel with us

             wide of vision and i do not
            travel with peasants and beggars
            goodbye

we follow ergo as he sets off down the forest path heading
in the opposite direction from colwyn and ynyr after a few
yards the forest seems to grow darker the sounds more
ominous ergo glances around apprehensively suddenly
through an opening in the leaves he sees a face with asingle eyein the middle of it

with a yelp he turns and races back up the path after
colwyn and ynyr when he catches up he wedges himself
between them to get as much protection as possible

                        ergo
            i just remembered i have urgent
            business in this direction

                        colwyn
            what business

               fearful glance behind
            staying aliveext forest clearing day

as colwyn ynyr and ergo cross the clearing ergo steps on
a snaretrigger and is suddenly hoisted into the air by his
foot colwyn draws his sword and turns to face five armed
men who step out of the forest theyre a ragtag bunch
garbed in various kinds of chainmail and armed with a
bizarre variety of weapons

                        torquil os
            the lad is quick very quick

colwyn wheels to see torquil the robber leaning against a
tree his huge battleaxe resting casually across his
shoulders his cheek bulges with a wad of chewing tobacco

                        torquil
            but also very young six to one is
            no odds boy

                        ergo
               yelling as he hangs upside
                down
            get me down from here you louts or
            ill turn you all into pigs

torquil glances up at ergo then spits a stream of brown
juice at the ground and steps forward to investigate his
prisoners

                        ergo
               muttering as he fumbles for
                his spellbook
            theyll soon learn the price of
            snaring ergo the magnificent

torquil walks a circle around colwyn and ynyr

he sees kegan arrive with a stag across his shoulders and
he snicksnacks his carving knife in anticipation but

but kegan spots a hare and creeps into the forest after it
leaving ergo and colwyn alone in the clearing

suddenly ergo hears ominous noises he peers into the dark
forest and his jaw drops as he sees a pair ofred eyesstaring out of the gloom he snatches up a carving knife and
a frying pan and backs toward colwyn holding the pan as a
shield the redeyed thing moves toward them through the
trees and poor ergo is unmanned by fear he drops his knife
and ducks his head behind the frying pan in sheer terror

but he hears the thing stop short and raises his head to
look behind him where a cyclops stands with trident poised
to throw the little man assumes that both creatures are
trying to kill him and faints dead away but the trident is
aimed at the redeyed thing which has no desire to do
battle with the cyclops the thing retreats the red eyes
fade the cyclops comes over to ergo and kneels to listen to
his heart then he enters the forest after the dark oneext forest clearing later that night

            in return for the power to see the
            future but they were cheated for

he hurls his glaive at a nearby tree the weapon bores clean
through the trunk then through two more before it imbeds

colwyn and torquil top the hill and look down at the lake
the surface of which looks as if it had been instantly
frozen in the midst of a great storm

the little man suddenly lets out a yelp and jumps back he
is staring into the jaws of a huge shark frozen in the wave
as was all the marine life in the lake including gulls
with one foot touching the water he steers around the jaws
and catches up to ynyr

                        ergo
               scowling

colwyn resumes his place beside torquil who gives him a
sideways glance

                        torquil
            so youre something more than a
            seeker of fame

colwyn shrugs sheepishly

                        torquil
            well im not impressed

                        colwyn
               smiles
            i knew you would not be thats why
            i chose you

they reach the end of the lake which is bordered by a small
scarp torquil hikes himself onto the scarp and reaches down
to help colwyn up

                        torquil
               grin
            im alittleimpressedext emerald stonehenge late afternoon

a circle of stone dolmens emerald green in the center of
which sits an old man blind wearing a green robe an
emerald seer sitting across from him is titch his ten
yearold assistant similarly robed

a greenhued holographic image appears above the emerald
showing colwyn and his band approaching the seer weaves his
fingers through the image reading it by touch

                        seer
            eight come here brother they have
            traveled far fetch bread and wine

                        titch
            yes brother

the boy fetches a jug of wine and a round loaf of bread and
approaches colwyns band as they enter the stone circle
colwyn waves titch toward his men and moves with ynyr and
torquil to the seer

                        ynyr
            we seek the fortress of krull

                        seer
            such a vision will be opposed who
            seeks it

                        ynyr
            the new king

                        seer
               little smile
            with an old voice

                        ynyr
               answering smile
            you know the voice

                        seer
            yes you have left your place in the
            needle it is the time then

                        ynyr
            it is the time

                        seer
            i will seek the fortress for you

the seer presses his fingertips against the rotating sphere
increasing the pressure and friction until small tongues of
flame spurt from beneath his fingertips

a holograph begins to form above the sphere the fortress in
midocean

                        seer
            can you see

                        ynyr
            yes it is the western ocean

                        colwyn
            there is a prisoner there

                        seer
            yes

the holograph dissolves replaced by a new one which shows a
curving arm of the vortex the deep central parts of the
fortress lyssa and the white leopard move down the arm
pressed by an unseen pursuer

                        colwyn
               leaning forward
            lyssa

as the twin suns dip below the horizon the flames spurting
from the seers fingertips begin to leap and lengthen until
the sphere is surrounded by fire its color changing from
emeraldgreen to crimson we hear faint hollowscreams ofrage

the holograph above the sphere begins to waver and blur
then is shattered by a holographic black claw shooting
upward from the sphere the talons of the claw are blood
red its appearance accompanied by a hollowscream

the seer is knocked backward the claw disappears the
emerald drops to the ground

                        colwyn
               kneeling by the seer
            are you hurt

                        seer
               sitting up
            no
               grim smile
            the dark ones do not like curious
            seers poking into their affairs

                        colwyn
            can you tell us where the fortress
            will rise tomorrow

                        seer
            i cannot see the future only the
            present but at dawn tomorrow i can
            see where the fortress has risen
            that day  and every day thereafter
            until fate brings it near us

                        ynyr
            the dark ones will appose you with
            all their power

                        seer
            they will fail for during the day
            the power of the circle is greater
            than theirs only at night can they
            pierce the circle

titch approaches ergo with bread and wine

                        ergo
               wrinkling his nose

about to take the bigger piece for himself when conscience

shoulders

                passes

the seer kneels at waters edge washing his hands with
ritual motions he hears footsteps behind him

                        seer
            is that you brother

we see a changelingseer standing behind him an exact twin
except that his eyes are open andred changeling reaches
down and places his hand on the seers neck

                        changeling
               hiss
            it is me brother

his hand turns into ataloned claw which tightens around
the seers neck throttling him he lowers the body into the
stream then reaches into the seers robe and extracts the
emerald which hecrushesin his claw the green fragments
drop into the water floating downstream behind the seers
body

his bloody claw now reverts to human form but the fingers
remain bloody he kneels and washes off the blood when he
hears titch approaching he closes his eyes

                        changeling
               in seers voice
            is that you brother

                        titch
            it is me brother

he stands and places his hand on the boys shoulder to be
led back to camp the cyclops appears having followed titch
to guard him

the cyclops glances at the changeling but notices nothing
unusual he takes a few steps farther down the path to
check it out  and stops just short of a point that would
show him the seers body fetched up against a rock in the
stream he turns and follows titch back to the campsiteext stonehenge night

the band is seated around the fire finishing a huge dinner
of roast boar the changelingseer sits slightly apart his
eyelids lifting occasionally to afford a thin slit through
which he surveys the group withred eyes

                        torquil
               raising a joint
            passable pimple very passable

            the greatest boon of your otherwise
            worthless life blockhead is the
            privilege of dining on boar roasted
            by the hand of ergo the magnificent

                        torquil
            your boast is a bigger mouthful than
            your roast magnificence

he glances over his shoulder at colwyn who is leaning
against a dolmen staring gloomily into the darkness
torquil gets up and goes to him carrying the joint

                        torquil
            youve eaten nothing

                        colwyn

               little smile
            these well pay for

                        torquil
               sigh
            lad you have an unnatural desire to
            pay for things it stunts the mind
            and shrivels the imagination

               hands it over

colwyns hunger comes alive as he starts to work on the
joint

                        torquil
            but i cant tell yet whether its a
            talent for theft or gluttony

bardolph and oswin stand guard over the sleeping band
stationed at the perimeter of the circle looking outward
the cyclops broods by the fire his expression troubled he
frowns and looks around then gets up and moves out of the
circle into the darkness

as soon as the cyclops is gone the changelingseer opens
his eyes and looks around he stands and moves toward
bardolph

                        bardolph
               turns
            whos there

                        changeling
               holding out a hand
            its me brother i am thirsty

                        bardolph
            here ill guide you

he approaches the changeling who places a hand on his
shoulder to be led to the streamext path to stream near stonehenge night

as they move down the path the changelings hand turns into
aclawand he throttles bardolph so quickly hes unable to
utter a sound he tosses the body into the bushes and starts
to wipe his bloody hand on the grass  but stands as he
hears colwyn coming down the path

                        colwyn
            where is bardolph brother

                        changeling
            he heard something and went to
            investigate brother

colwyn starts to move past him to the stream

                        changeling
               reaching out
            lead me to the stream brother

colwyn stops and allows the changeling to place a hand on
his shoulder a close shot of the changelings hand shows it
still bloody the blood running onto the cloth of colwyns
jacketext stream near stonehenge intercut  night

the cyclops stands near the spot where the real seer was
killed he moves downstream a few yards  and suddenly sees
the seers body floating in the water caught against the
rocks he realizes immediately that the band is in great
danger he races up the path toward the camp

as colwn leads the changeling down the path we see the hand
on his shoulder turn into aclaw the claw is moving toward
his neck when suddenly the cyclops bursts from the trees in
front of them colwyn stares in disbelief as the cyclops
hurls his trident straight at him the weapon whistles past
his ear and slices off the changelings arm at the shoulder

colwyn spins sees the red eyes ducks backward as the
changeling swipes at him with his other hand  now become a
claw he draws his glaive as the changeling reverts entirely
to bestial form its hideous black body bursting the seams
of the emeraldgreen robe

as the creature springs at colwyn we see for an instant
the horrible face teeth flashing eyes burning then
colwyns glaive strikes between the eyes slit by the
horizontal blades of the glaive the eyes explode in a burst
of red and the thing dies with a scream

torquil ynyr and others run up the body of the creature
has already turned to ash forming the characteristic vortex
of the dark ones

            wouldnt have to show its eyes

            stream

they all look up the path at titch who is rubbing his eyes
sleepily ergo goes up to him and puts an arm around his
shouldersext stonehenge night

the band stands beside a fresh grave outlined by stone
markers colwyn is kneeling with his arms around titch
whose face is buried against his chest

                        colwyn
            if he had not agreed to help us
            they would not have killed him he

                        torquil
            that creature helps no one and none
            who go there return

                        ynyr
            she has the power of vision

                        torquil
            she has the power to kill

                        ynyr
            perhaps she will not kill me for i
            know her name

                        torquil
            her name is death

                        ynyr
            she had another name once

                        colwyn
               with finality
            no we will find another way to
            locate the fortress

                        ynyr
            there is no other way you asked me
            why the beast had come this time

                        colwyn
            yes

                        ynyr
            he has come for lyssa

            lyssawhy

                        ynyr
            like you she has extraordinary
            powers he would make her his queen

                        colwyn
            can she be forced

                        ynyr
            no she must agree of her own free
            will

                        colwyn
            never

                        ynyr
            you are young you dont understand
            the attraction of great power and
            you forget the pain of long waiting

                        colwyn
            then we must reach her before she
            feels that pain

                        ynyr
            yes

on the other side of the fire ergo lies awake watching

cyclops sits nearby leaning against a stone one hand on
his trident his eye is closed he appears to be asleep

ergo sits up takes his spellbook and sneaks off behind a
stone the cyclops opens his eye and watches as ergo thumbs

the arms open into the top of a huge bloodstone funnel at
the bottom of which is the hole of the beast lyssa and her
guardian are forced along a spiral walkway that curves down
the walls of the funnel to the dark hole at the bottom

we hear a heavy slithering sound as of an enormous tail
being dragged across stone a pair of huge red eyes appear
in the beasts hole and we hear a husky whisper the sound
is ominous but also attractive in the way that enormous
power is always attractive

                        voice of the beast
            do not be afraid you are safe here
            you are protected by my power

lyssa shrinks against the stone the white leopardroars

the leopard is suddenly flung backward hurled with
tremendous force against the stone lyssa turns to see it
embedded in the solid rock mouth open and eyes glazed

                        voice of the beast
            nature is my slave here

a stone claw rises from the floor

                        voice of the beast
            its laws are mine to break

the claw bursts into flame and strikes at lyssa with such
force that the rock around her is shattered yet she is
unharmed the flaming claw lifts her up and sets her down
then shrinks to a ball of flame and drops into her hand she
looks down to see that she is holding a rose

                        voice of the beast
            such is my power it can be yours

when she looks up the red eyes are gone she is aloneext stonehenge early morning

before the camp wakes the puppy crawls out of titchs arms
and trots behind the stone it scans the spellbook lying
open on the ground then disappears in a gyrating white
cloud and becomes ergo again as he sneaks back to his own
blanket he sees the cyclops watching him with a smile

concealed at the side of the road are ten slayers and sweyn
the robber who refused to go along with the band he points
down the road at the approaching band the chief slayer
nods and hands him a leather purse full of gold coins
which sweyn tucks in his jacket they mount their horses and
start down the road

a mangrove swamp with a latticework of gnarled roots
hovering above dark waters the band enters the swamp

                        cyclops
            do not let the waters touch you

                        colwyn
            what will happen

                        ynyr
            you will be devoured by your own
            mind

colwyn and torquil help the old man ynyr while the cyclops
takes care of the two little ones ergo and titch sometimes
lifting one in each hand to deposit them on the next root

the slayers reach the edge of the swamp and dismount sweyn
and the chief slayer lead them in

the band is halfway across the swamp when colwyn suddenly
slips and plunges into the water

                        torquil
               extends a hand
            take hold

but the waters of betrayal have begun their workcolwyns povhe sees torquil stand and embrace lyssa who comes from
behind a tree

a black claw appears pouring gold coins into ynyrs handback to shotcolwyn lunges at ynyr

                        colwyn
            i will melt that gold and pour it
            down your throat old man

                        ynyr
            he sees betrayal everywhere he will
            attack us so long as he is
            conscious

they glance anxiously at the slayers closing quickly titch
reaches into ergos voluminous coat and pulls out a soup
ladle which he throws at colwyn the ladle catches colwyn
in the forehead knocking him unconscious  but also
knocking him backward in the water out of reach

                        ergo
               to torquil
            your axe lay it out

torquil tucks the heel of the axe handle under a root and
grips it with both hands ergo tightropes out the handle and
kneels on the axe head directly above colwyn

                        torquil
            i cant hold the weight of both of
            you

                        ergo
            hush

he squinches his eyes shut and mumbles something to himself
the gyrating white cloud appears with a pop and when it
pops off ergo has been transformed into asnake with its
tail wrapped around the axe handle the snakes plunges into
the water and wraps itself around colwyns chest torquil
grits his teeth and pulls up on the axe lifting the snake
and colwyn out of the water and depositing them on a nexus
of roots

the white cloud reappears and returns ergo to human form
barely conscious coughing and spitting water

meanwhile the slayers are almost upon them the cyclops has
moved to the rear with kegan oswin and rhu as the chief
slayer comes within range the cyclops lunges with his
trident slicing the root on which the slayer stands and
spilling him into the dark waters sweyn kneels to help him
out

                        chief slayer
            traitor

he stabs sweyn in the chest slicing through the purse of
gold coins sweyn tumbles into the water blood and gold
pouring out of the gash in his jacket the chief slayer
attacks the others wounding some knocking several into the
water  and they in turn attack their fellows

the band stares in awed silence as the slayers massacre each
other the din of battle fades the slayers dead to a man
float in the water

as colwyn regains consciousness the others gather round

                        colwyn
            forgive me my friends i saw
            terrible things

                        torquil
            they do not exist except in the
            waters of the swamp where they will
            remainext opposite edge of the swamp day

the band emerges from the swamp which laps at the foot of
the widows mountain ynyr faces colwyn and torquil

                        ynyr
            from here i must go alone

                        colwyn
            you will tell me her name and we
            will go together

                        ynyr
               with peculiar emphasis
            you must never know her name
               pause
            if more than one approaches she
            will certainly kill them alone i
            may have a chance

                        torquil
               hand on colwyns shoulder
            each to his fate lad

                        ynyr
               nods
            each to his fate wait for me at the
            inn if i am not back by dawn you
            will know my fate and you must go
            on without me

he turns and starts up the mountain

at the rear of the group the cyclops heads toward a forest
carrying titch on his shoulder

                        ergo
            where are you going

                        cyclops
            well meet you at the inn

the cyclops moves off with titchext forest day

titch rides on the cyclops shoulders straddling his neck
he holds a smallcrossbowat the ready

                        cyclops
               whispers and points
            over there

titch takes aim at a great stag bracing his arm against the
top of the cyclopss headint inn night

kegan oswin and rhun are downing flagons of sack and
dandling pretty inngirls on their knees torquil eyes them
enviously from the fireplace across the room but cant
bring himself to leave colwyn who takes no comfort from
wine or women

                        colwyn
            go join them

                        torquil
            what kind of friend do you think i
            am

                        colwyn
            the best but my unhappiness is not
            made lighter by adding yours to it

                        torquil
            well it is true that if i received
            a royal command i couldnt very well
            disobey it could i

                        colwyn
               little smile
            go i command you

                        torquil
               grins
            yes my lord

he strides across the room seizes a pair of inngirls by
the waist and swings them around

ergo sitting near colwyn stares despondently into the
fire

                        ergo
            try your tricks on me and ill turn
            myself back into a snake and bite
            you

                        colwyn
            you and i will guard the fire

                        ergo
            what else is left for a man without
            friends

colwyn glances out a back window and sees thebody of a stagbeing carried past on someones shouldersext widows mountain night

ynyr climbs toward thehourglass openingof the widows cave
above lit by an eerie light from withinint widows cave night

a gigantic web ofcrystalstretches across a vast domed
cavern shimmering in the luminescence from below at the
center of the web is a domed cubicle made of crisscrossed
ribbons of mirror glass light flashes off the mirrors in
such a way that it is impossible to see through the
openings who or what is within

the blinding effect does not occur inside the cubicle so
that a pov shot from inside shows the entire web clearly it
also shows reflected from hundreds of facets on the inside
of the structure the face of the widow the old woman who
sits at the center a hideous crone grotesque and
distorted she sees ynyr standing at the edge of the web

                        widow
               low
            someone comes here

she picks up an hourglass containing only a handful of
sand and turns it to start the sand running out

                        widow
            this is his time

ynyr is shouting at her from the edge of the web

                        ynyr
               shouting
            i am ynyr i seek the widow

but sound does not pierce the cubicle from inside it one
can only see his lips moving

ynyr steps onto the web and starts toward the center when
hes halfway across he turns to see a giant black widow
spider made ofcrystal entirely translucent except for a
red hourglass in the center of its crystal abdomen as the
spider approaches ynyr and prepares to attack the red color
expands filling the abdomen first then spreading through
the rest of the body

ynyr holds up his glaive the spider stops begins moving
sideways the redness fades inside the cubicle the
hourglass sand has almost run out

the spider twitches a crystal strand throwing ynyr off
balance and causing the glaive to fly from his hand it
sticks in a crystal strand too far to reach ynyr is
helpless the spider advances reddening

                        ynyr
               desperate shout
            lyssathisname has the power to pierce the soundproof cubicle
the widow stands as she hears the name echoed by the huge
cavern

                        widow
               calls
            who speaks that name

                        ynyr
               shouts
            ynyr

she watches as the spider looms over ynyr then she reaches
behind her and turns the hourglass just as the last grains
of sand run out this causes the spider to back away
turning translucent again ynyr retrieves the glaive and
makes his way to the domed cubicle

he enters the cubicle to find the widow facing away from
him though he can see her hideous face reflected back by
the mirrors in front of her

                        widow
            it is fifty years since i heard that
            name

                        ynyr
            it is fifty years since i spoke it
            to you

                        widow
            i was beautiful then

                        ynyr
            the most beautiful woman in the
            world

                        widow
            but you would not stay with me

                        ynyr
            could not could not betray the girl
            to whom i was betrothed

                        widow
            she was not as beautiful

                        ynyr
            no she was not as beautiful

                        widow
            she bore you many children

                        ynyr
            we had no children

                        widow
            you had a son

                        ynyr
               staggered
            you said nothing you told me
            nothing

                        widow
            you had left me i kept silent out
            of rage

                        ynyr
            where is he my son

                        widow
            i killed him when he was born
               pause
            this place is my punishment

the old man bends his head sadly when he looks up he sees
in the mirrors that tears are coursing down the widows
cheek as he watches the tears the mirrored face turns to
that of a beautiful young girl and the widow is stunned to
find that she sees the reflections ashesees them the face
of a young girl

                        widow
            do not try your trickery on me

                        ynyr
            it is no trickery

                        widow
            those are reflections
               turns to face himthisis my face

when she starts to turn we see her as old but when she
faces ynyr we see her through his eyes as a young girl

                        ynyr
            you see

                        widow
               smiles
            yes

a reverse angle explains her smile she sees him as the
young man who loved her

                        ynyr
            memory is no trick it is a power
            the power to see

                        widow
            power you have given me what can my
            power give you

                        ynyr
            knowledge

                        widow
            of what

                        ynyr
            the fortress of krull when will it
            come near here

                        widow

                        ynyr
               touches her cheek
            could i lie to you and still see
            your beauty

                        widow
               lowers her eyes
            no

                        ynyr
            a young man seeks her a young man
            about the age i was when i met you

                        widow
            tomorrow the fortress of krull will
            rise with the sun in the valley of
            reeds but the knowledge is of no
            use to you no man has ever escaped
            the web and soon the creature will
            come for you even here

ynyr touches his glaive

                        widow
               shakes her head
            it will not help

                        ynyr
            then the other lyssa will share your
            fate she will grow old in the
            fortress as you have grown old here

the widow takes a small gold hourglass from a mirrored
niche

                        widow
            hold out your hand

she breaks the hourglass and pours the sand into his open
hand

                        widow
            those are the sands of my life so
            long as they remain in your hand
            the creature cannot harm you

ynyr closes his hand but the sand trickles out through his
fingers he tries clenching it tightly but the sand
continues to run

                        ynyr
            i cannot stop the sand

                        widow
            you cannot stop time go now before
            it runs out

                        ynyr
            you will come with me

                        widow
            there is sand enough for only one
            life go now save the other

she watches ynyr make his way across the web toward the cave
entrance the angle is behind her and we see her hands grow
gnarled and mottled her body become that of an old woman
once again  but when we swing around in front of her we
see thather face is still that of a young girl

the crystal spider scuttles across the web to attack ynyr
but the old man holds up his clenched fist and shows the
sand running from his fingers

stymied the spider crouches and turns blood red a scream
of rage fills the cave

ynyr reaches the safety of the entrance and looks back the
bloodred spider scuttles to the center of the web and
smashes open the cubicle ynyr looks at his hand the sand
has run out

as the old man makes his way sadly down the mountain a shot of the widowshows her encased in a web shroud and though her body is
old she retains even in death the face of a young girlint inn night

torquil and his men dandle inn girls on their knees
laughing leching and guzzling the innkeeper bustles
about assisted by a muchabused serving girl named veela
whose beauty is concealed by kerchiefed hair frumpy
clothes and a layer of soot

across the room colwyn and ergo sit in front of the fire
staring gloomily into the flames

titch comes in the back door and whispers to torquil who
signals his men they get up and head for the back wall
where cyclops is swinging open a pair of large double doors

ergo is too glum to notice the sudden diminution of noise
but colwyn sees torquil and his men carrying in a giant
venison pie ten feet across and five feet high

                        titch
               comes up to ergo
            ergo

the little man hunches forward refusing to answer

                        titch
            sir ergo  my honorable lord
            ergo

            first you desert me and now you
            mock me go back to your oneeyed
            friend

titch reaches out and presses the end of ergos nose

                        ergo
            what now you poke me in the nose as
            well

                        titch

            never loafed an hour in its life

               sniffs again
            impossible this nose asleep while
            venison fills the air
               seizes titch
            where is it boy tell me where it
            is and i forgive you everything

                        titch
            its right behind you

ergo turns and his eyes grow as big as the pie

                        ergo
               awed whisper
            a venison pie as big as a house

                        cyclops
            a small house

                        ergo
            and what do you think a small person
            lives in you oneeyed fool leaving
            me here to mope while you and the
            boy were arranging my assassination

                        titch
            we meant only to please you

                        ergo
            and do you think im not going to
            eat myself to death this very night
            huh

the dwarf approaches the pie worshipfully

                        ergo
            look at its beauty look at its
            grace

                        torquil
               holds out a knife
            look at its insides

                        ergo
            no not yet let me hug it and kiss
            it a little  let me run my fingers
            over its lovely skin
               climbs onto the pie
            let me climb to the top and sing to
            it

he clambers up the crust and stands on top of the pie

                        ergo
            henceforth i am lord ergo for now i
            have an estate to rule

he kneels and embraces the crust

                        ergo
               crooning
            let us go then you and i my sweet
            and hot and lovely pie 

the crust suddenly gives way beneath him he plunges into
the pie disappearing completely the onlookers laugh and
applaud but when he doesnt reappear they grow worried

                        titch
               knocks on the crust
            ergo are you all right

ergos head pops up through the crust

                        ergo
            here lies lord ergo drowned in a
            venison pie he died with a smile
            and a belch goodbye goodbye 

he disappears inside the pie again the others crowd around
and begin dismembering itint inn later that night

colwyn and the cyclops stand guard over sleeping robbers and
inn girls ergo floats halfawake in the gravy in the pie
shell a contented smile on his face he opens his mouth and
allows a piece of venison to float into it then he hearswhimperingand peers over the edge of the crust titch is
asleep nearby in the throws of a nightmare

the serving girl vella is still busy cleaning up as she
passes the pie shell she hearsscrabbling and splashing
and stops to see a puppy trying to clamber out

                        cyclops
            lift him out

vella lifts out the puppy and sets it on the floor the
puppy shakes itself then trots over to titch the boy hugs
the puppy to his chest

                        vella
               to cyclops
            its the little man called ergo
            isnt it

                        cyclops
            yes

                        vella
            he must care a lot for the boy

                        cyclops
            yes

                        innkeeper
               coming over
            you lazy slut i dont pay you to
            stand around jawing with the guests

                        colwyn
            leave her be shes worked hard all
            day

                        innkeeper
            shell work till dawn if i choose

he cuffs the girl knocking her to the floor but backs away
as colwyn approaches

                        colwyn
               an order
            her working day is over shell rest
            now

the innkeeper scowls then skulks off grumbling colwyn
helps the girl up and sees that her ankle has been twisted
by her fall he puts an arm around her and helps her toward
the stairsint center of vortexlyssa moves around the walkway looking for escape but all
the passages leading out of the center are blocked by red
eyes

                        voice of the beast
            have you considered

she turns to see the gigantic red eyes in the beasts hole

                        lyssa
            i do not want your power it is
            hideous

                        voice of the beast
            you know nothing of power you
            foolish girl you think power is a
            mighty sword or a strong castle or
            the paltry magic of an emerald seer
            power is none of these

the red eyes in the hole disappear lyssa hears the voice
behind her

                        voice of the beast
            power is beauty

she turns to see a greek adonis standing behind her his
naked body glistens with oil he is incredibly handsome
but his eyes are red she retreats the adonis vanishes
and lyssa feels her hand clasped gently she turns to see a
girl of her own age smiling at her but her eyes are red
and she speaks with the voice of darkness

                        voice of the beast
            power is friendship

when lyssa pulls her hand away the girl vanishes

                        voice of the beast
            power is joy

lyssa sees herself but with red eyes as a young mother
holding a baby and laughing

then she feels a hand on her cheek and turns to see colwyn
redeyes smiling at her as he caresses her cheek he
speaks with the dark voice

                        voice of the beast
            power is desire

she knows from the eyes and voice that this is not the
real colwyn but loneliness and fear and longing are
beginning to take their toll she touches his hand presses
it against her cheek

                        vella over
            the cruelest fate is to be far from
            the one you love not knowing
            whether you will ever see him againint vellas room night

vella sits dejectedly on the edge of the bed colwyn stands
near

                        vella
            i was betrothed to a boy from my
            village we were to be married this
            summer but he traveled across the
            sea and his ship was lost
               bows her head whispers
            they say he drowned but i know he
            is alive i know he will come back
            to me

moved by her grief colwyn sits on the bed and takes her in
his arms to comfort her

                        colwyn
            i know the cruelty of such a fate

                        vella
               lifts her head
            perhaps you think no man would
            return to me

                        colwyn
            i dont think that

vella stands and slips the kerchief from around her hair
which is long and lustrous it tumbles loose falling
gracefully around her shoulders she wipes the sleeve across
her face and almost magically the smudges and dirt
disappear she steps out of her ungainly shoes then
unfastens her ugly dress it falls to her feet she stands
barefoot in her chemise stunningly beautiful

                        vella
            am i not worth returning to

                        colwyn
            yes

                        vella
            am i not beautiful enough to be
            loved

                        colwyn
            yes

                        vella
            even by you

                        colwyn
               drops his eyes
            yes

int vortex  night

the redeyed colwyn holds lyssas hand as he makes his
proposal

                        voice of the beast
            this i tell you our children will
            be princes they will have the power
            of my darkness and the power of your
            blood they will conquer galaxies

lyssa back away shaking her head no

                        voice of the beast
            they will make you a queen a queen
            of worlds uncountable

the redeyed colwyn waves his hand and a stone wall cracks
open

                        voice of the beast
            these are the galaxies you will
            rule

through the crack we see galaxies moving toward us slowly
at first then faster we see not only the familiar galactic
forms  spirals ellipses spheres  but shapes and colors
never seen from earth exploding galaxies of red stars
whirling galaxies of yellow and blue galaxies writhing as
if in pain they move toward us faster and faster until
they becomes blurs of light and color another wall cracks
open

                        voice of the beast
            these are the worlds of your empire

we see planets moving toward us earthlike planets of blue
and green volcanic planets spitting flame gaseous planets
ringed planets planets with a hundred moons another wall
cracks open

                        voice of the beast
            these are the beings who will be
            your slaves

we see crowds of living creatures some humanoid others
with shapes never seen prostrating themselves in obeisance
keening their pain and fear

                        lyssa
            i do not want your worlds or your
            slaves

                        voice of the beast
            then look

another wallcracksopen we see colwyn and vella in a close
embrace

                        lyssa
            its a lie

                        voice of the beast
            these walls do not lie he will
            betray you

                        lyssa
            he will not

                        voice of the beast
            then he will dieint vellas room intercut

colwyn and vella in each others arms

                        vella

                        vella
            let me comfort you

                        colwyn
            i cannot take comfort when she has
            none

                        vella
            then give me comfort sleep with me
            tonight

                        colwyn
            i cannot betray my bride

her tears wash theblue dyefrom her eyes and we see that
her eyes arered

colwyn is in the arms of a dark one

                        colwyn
            i feel your pain but i cannot
            betray her

                        vella
            you will not then

                        colwyn
            i cannot

vellas left handturns into a claw she moves it toward his
neck then stops she begins to crybloodred tearsrun
down her cheeks

                        vella
            my master told me make him betray
            her if he will not kill him

colwyn steps back from her

                        vella
               thrusts out her claw
            yesheis my master

colwyn plucks his glaive from his belt and poises it to
throw

                        vella
            these talons were a heartbeat from
            your throat i could have killed you
            in an instant

colwyn lowers the glaive

                        vella
            but in the hour i knew you i loved
            you that love is life for you and
            death for me remember me

in the vortex lyssa stares defiantly at the redeyed
colwyn

                        lyssa
            it is you who are betrayed

the redeyed colwyn extends his left hand which turns into
a claw the talons clutch the empty air  and in her room
vella gasps as she is strangled

the redeyed colwyn snaps his arm sideways  and vella is
flung across her room against the wall her body
disintegrates leaving only gray ash and an empty chemise

                        colwyn
            have faith lyssa i will come

in the vortex the false colwyn has vanished the huge red
eyes have reappeared in the beasts hole

                        lyssa
            he will come for me

                        voice of the beast over
            he will not come you will be my
            queen

as colwyn and torquil move toward the inn ynyr draws the
cyclops aside glancing at thebands of white linenon his
wrists

                        ynyr
               low to cyclops
            it is dangerous for you

                        cyclops
            it will only be a few hours then i
            will accept my fateext marsh day

the band watches from the edge of the marsh as the cyclops
stands kneedeep in water facing the charge of a dozen
firemares

                        ergo
            theyll trample him to death

                        ynyr
            no he will master the leader

the firemares charge past the cyclops who disappears in a
cloud of smoke and steam and spray they wheel and charge
again circling him he fixes his eyes on the lead mare who
pulls out of the circle and comes toward him the cyclops
places his hand on the mares muzzle and the horse stands
quietly the others follow suit forming a circle around
himext marsh a few minutes later

the band is mounted except for the cyclops titch sits
behind colwyn

                        ergo
               calls
            quell

                        cyclops
            i cannot go with you my friend

                        colwyn
            it is today

                        cyclops
            yes it is today

the band files past him each man reaching down to shake his
hand ergo is next to last his mouth works as he tries to
speak but no words come out the cyclops embraces him

                        ergo
            my heart stays here

                        cyclops
            and mine goes with you

ergo moves off wiping his nose on his sleeve colwyn is
last with titch sitting behind him

                        colwyn
               to titch
            youre too young to come with us
            lad stay with our friend

he swings the boy to the ground then grips the cyclopss
hand

                        colwyn
            each to his fate

                        cyclops
            each to his fate

the cyclops stands beside titch holding the boys hand
watching the band move off

                        ynyr
               to colwyn as they ride
            he ran a great risk helping us
            today if he opposes his fate his
            death will be terribly painful

                        colwyn
               looking back
            let us wish him peace

the cyclops is sitting crosslegged on the ground having
wound awhite linen headbandaround his forehead titch sits
beside him

                        torquil
               pointing up
            we must cover a hundred leagues
            before sunrise

                        colwyn
               stand in his stirrups
            at the gallop

as the mares increase their speed their sparking hooves
begin to flash until at full gallop their feet and
fetlocks are enveloped in flame they thunder down the road
on a carpet of fireext ridge sunset

in long shot we see the firemares silhouetted against the
darkening sky galloping along the spine of the ridge on a
thin line of flameext ford night

a gatekeeper comes out of his hut as he hears approaching
hoofbeats a wooden gate stretches across the road barring
the ford

                        gatekeeper
               to himself
            if theyre nobles itll cost em
            gold

the gatekeepers mouth drops as the firemares round the
curve andsmashthrough the gate causing the stream to boil
and hiss as they gallop through it he stares at the clouds
of steam that mark their passage

                        gatekeeper
               plaintive whine
            i wouldve settled for silverext log road in swamp night

with hoofbeats audible in the distance half a dozen thieves
huddle on the log road preparing an ambush

                        leader
            to your places if they resist show
            no mercy

the thieves kneel at the edge of the log road weapons at
the ready the leader stands in the middle of the road
notches an arrow and draws his bow

                        leader
            hold or you are dead men

his eyes turn to saucers as the firemares round the curve
and bear down on him he yelps and dives into the swamp
along with the rest of his band the firemares thunder
past leaving the thieves gulping swampwater andthe logroad in flamesext valley of reeds just before dawn

the horizon shows light gray as the firemares streak across
the valley leaving a trail of blazing reeds

two dozen slayers ride from the fortress to oppose them

                        colwyn
               shouts to torquil
            its almost dawn flank them

torquil leads half the band to the right colwyn leads the
other half to the left they sweep past the slayers on
either side surrounding them with aring of fire the
slayers are enveloped by flames as the band reconverges and
heads toward the high wall of the fortress

but a dismounted slayer pierces the fiery wall his clothes
flaming and hurls a spear at rhun at the tail of the band
colwyn and torquil look back and see rhun skewered by the
spear the point protruding from his chest torquil shakes
his head and they continue toward the wall

but atop the wall hidden behind the crenellated parapet
wait another dozen slayers withcauldrons of boiling pitchat the ready

colwyn reaches the bottom of the wall and swings off his
mare

                        colwyn
            up the wall quickly

the others dismount and follow him up the wall which is
canted back some twenty degrees from the vertical allowing
them to clamber up the stone courses but suddenly a stream
of boiling pitch pours down the wall toward them

                        torquil
            look out

they dodge the hissing steam of pitch but a second stream
catches oswin who screams as hes enveloped by the boiling
liquid

colwyn and torquil look up to see a cauldron of pitch being
moved into position directly above them but torquil points
down the wall where 

 the cyclops is galloping along the parapet the hooves
of his firemare sparking against the stone titch stands on
the saddle behind him with a crossbow laid across his broad
shoulder the boy looses a bolt and hits one of the slayers
at the cauldron saving colwyn and torquil

the slayers loose a hail of arrows several of which strike
the cyclops in the chest but he keeps coming and titch
keeps firing bolts from behind his shoulder felling slayers
like deer

as the twin suns are about to rise the slayers overturn the
great cauldron of pitch which pours down the wall heading
straight for colwyn ext arctic landscape sunrise

the fortress rises out of the ice and colwyn looks up to see
the stream of pitch frozen solid not three feet above them

                        colwyn
               shouts
            on them

he leads the band up the wall to the parapet where the
cyclops has dismounted and is holding off several slayers
shielding titch who is still firing his deadly bolts a
brief but fierce battle disposes of the slayers

the band gathers around the fallen cyclops a dozen broken
off arrow shafts protrude from his body he holds ergos
small hand in one of his great paws

                        cyclops
               dying smile
            a man can ask nothing more than that
            his death help his friends

his hand tightens with the pain that he has brought upon
himself then his fingers open slowly ergo stifles a sob as
the great eye closes in death

torquil calls colwyns attention to yet another group of
slayers in the distance colwyn leads the band across an ice
bridge to a stone door encased in ice they hack through the
ice and swing open the door which opens onto a set of stone
stairs leading down

                        torquil
               glance toward slayers
            ill stay behind and keep them busy

                        ynyr
            it is not necessary they will not
            followint stone stairway intercut  day

the band moves down the stairs

above the slayers reach the stone door but theyre clearly
reluctant to descend one steps forward and starts down 
but then hears the eeriescreamsof the dark ones below he
scurries back up and with the others backs away from the
door

on the stairs below the eerie screams are deafening
echoing through the stone corridors ynyr leads the band
taking them down the stairs across a landing and down
another flight of stairs

torquil notices mortar crumbling between the stones of the
staircase

                        torquil
            look

                        ynyr
            yes they are weakening it takes
            great power to maintain the
            fortress and they have expended
            muchint stone corridorthe band hurries down the corridor pursued by dozens of red
eyes

                        torquil
               looking back
            theyre gaining on us
               draws his sword
            we must slow them up with steel

they are standing beneath a romanesque arch that supports
the wall

                        colwyn
               looks up at the arch
            better stone than steel

he draws his sword and inserts it beside the capstone of the
arch working the blade to loosen the mortar torquil
follows his thought and begins chopping at the mortar on the
other side of the capstone

the red eyes are almost on them when they finally succeed in
dislodging the capstone they jump back as the capstone
falls and the arch collapses blocking the corridor with a
wall of stone rubble

                        torquil
            youre resourceful my lad
               grins
            i tell you one year under my
            tutelage and i could make you the
            prince of thieves

                        colwyn
            subject to the king no doubt

                        torquil
               modest bow
            naturally

suddenlya black claw bursts from the stone rubbleand
clutches torquil by the neck colwyn quickly draws his sword
and hacks off the arm which disintegrates into gray ash

                        torquil
               fingering his neck
            a good thrust my friend another
            second and thered have been nothing
            between my head and shoulders but
            bad memories

                        colwyn
            i intend to keep you alive your
            majesty so you can abdicate your
            throne and become my warlord

                        torquil
            perhaps if the pay is good

colwyn signals ynyr who leads the group down the corridor
and then down yet another flight of stone stairs they
emerge in int cavern of agea pillared cave pitch black we hear the rasping sound of
labored breathing as of old men close to death

                        colwyn
               calls softly
            stay together

they move through the cave weapons at the ready a feeble
voice calls out

                        old torquil
            torquil 

torquil turns to see a wizened holloweyed old man himself
at the end of his life

                        old torquil
            do not let this happen torquil

a priestess of youth steps out from behind a pillar she is
eighteen wearing a transparent garment that shows the
stunning beauty of her young body she holds a golden goblet
containing a rainbowcolored liquid

                        priestess
            it need not happen torquil drink
            the rainbow it is youth

she reaches behind the pillar and takes the hand of young
torquil pulling him into view it is torquil as he was at
eighteen

                        priestess
            it isyouryouth torquil

                        ynyr
               touches torquil
            this is the cavern of age touch
            nothing take nothing or the future
            will be plunged into your heart

torquil shudders as he looks at the old man he will become
horrified by the gaping face of his own future colwyn takes
his arm and gently pulls him away but the priestess of
youth slips ahead appearing again with the young torquil
this time in passionate embrace as she caresses the youth
she holds out the goblet to torquil

                        priestess
            drink the rainbow torquil youth is
            yours i am yours take me torquil

                        colwyn
               guiding him past
            she lies my friend

now it is ergos turn to confront the future he sees
himself as an old man bald and shrunken at the edge of
death

                        old ergo
            ergo save yourself save yourself
            from this

from behind a pillar appears a fairy priestess of youth
goldenhaired beautiful holding a gold goblet she tilts
the goblet and pours some of the rainbow liquid into her
hand

                        fairy priestess
               holds out her cupped hand
            drink from my hand ergo i can save
            you

ergo starts toward her but titch grabs his arm

                        titch
               yanking him back
            ergo

ergo allows himself to be pulled along gazing back
wistfully

                        ergo
            oh she was so beautiful  and i was
            sougly

                        titch
            would you desert your friends

                        ergo
               shaking himself out of it
            no no im with you boy

bringing up the rear of the group is kegan he looks to the
side and gasps in horror as he sees himself at age eighty
writhing on the floor wracked by the pain of a horrible
last illness

                        old kegan
               gasping
            disease and pain kegan this is
            your future

a priestess of youth appears she is very young perhaps
fifteen with the kind of beauty that makes a man catch his
breath she holds out the goblet her face full of
compassion and concern

                        very young priestess
               pleading with him
            oh please kegan dont let this
            happen come to me as you were

a young kegan steps out beside her he is sixteen a golden
youth

                        very young priestess
            come to me young kegan

she steps forward moving very close to him

                        very young priestess
               whispers
            your youth is in the goblet come to
            me in the rainbow

no mortal man could resist her she holds the goblet to his
lips and he drinks

                        torquil
               sees him and shouts
            kegan

                        ynyr
            it is too late he has drunk

the priestess embraces kegan as they kiss a rainbow arches
down and envelopes them in its multicolored light but the
colors soon fade and the rainbow becomes an arc of white
light growing brighter and more intense in the blinding
light the priestess begins to age turning old before our
eyes as does kegan himself

the others watch frozen in horror as kegan struggles to
escape her embrace but she clutches him with bony fingers
pressing her wrinkled mouth to his they topple to the
floor writhing in each others arms their skin turning to
parchment the writhing stops two skeletons lie on the
floor locked in fatal embrace the white bones shimmering
in the arc of light

as the others continue through the cave ergo takes titchs
hand and places it on his arm

                        ergo
            keep a tight hold boy in case i
            get any more crazy ideasint outer wall of vortexthe band approaches the curving bloodstone wall of the
vortex great circular openings in the wall indicate the
terminal of the arms

                        ynyr
               to colwyn
            they will hold lyssa in the center
            of the vortex the place of the
            beast where its power is greatest
            no man can match it there lyssa
            must try to move toward us for as
            we enter the vortex and move closer
            

                        colwyn
               waits then finishes the
                sentence
            the beast will kill her

                        ynyr
            yes to keep her from you but now
            that we are inside the fortress you
            will be able to contact her

colwyn kneels on the floor elbow on knee bending his
forehead against his hand in concentration

                        colwyn over
            lyssa int center of vortex intercut

lyssa is halfway up the spiraled wall of the vortex midway
between the beasts hole below and the passage above  all
of which are guarded by red eyes

            colwyn 

                        colwyn over
            you must move away from the center

                        lyssa over

                        colwyn over
            lyssa your bracelets bend them
            straight and cross them

lyssa removes a pair of gold bracelets from her arm bends
them straight and forms a cross

                       colwyn over
            now grip them in your hand

she wraps her fingers around the intersection of the cross
converting the bracelets into a kind of homemade glaive

                        colwyn over
            will your power outward

                        lyssa over

            the spiral begins in the west

                        colwyn over
            where the spiral begins

lyssa looks up to where the spiral begins

                        lyssa over
            yes

                        colwyn over

            we are in the fortress

                        lyssa over
               as she smiles
            i knew you would come

at the outer wall the band is midway between two of the
arms ynyr looks from one to the other then choosesthe oneon the left

and in the center lyssa must make a similar choice for the
spiral begins midway between two of the arms she also
choosesthe one on the left she holds the shining glaive in
front of her as she moves into the arm and we hear the
scrape of talons and the gutturals of frustration as the red
eyes are forced to retreat before itint first arm of vortexthe band moves down the curving arm toward the centerint second arm of vortexlyssa moves out the adjacent arm away from the center she
holds her glaive in front of her forcing back the red eyesint center of vortexthe huge red eyes of the beast rise toward the top of its
hole we hear a hideous scream of rage as the beast
discovers lyssa gone

we do not actually see it emerge from its hole but we see
the reaction of the lesser dark ones guarding the passages
they shrink in fear fleeing up the passages as the beast
climbs out of its hole and up the side of the spiral funnel

as the beast moves into the west passage we catch a glimpse
of one taloned foot it is so large that the mind cant
conceive of a living creature this huge it leaves behind a
trail of black mud mixed with fragments of a bizarre
seaweed dark red with spiral leavesint second arm of vortexlyssa glances back fearfully as she hears the beast coming
up the arm

            come quickly colwyn i can see the
            eyes of the beast

colwyn turns toward the righthand wall of the passage

                        colwyn over
            lyssa touch the wall of your
            passage

lyssa presses her hand against the wall behind her

                        colwyn
               runs to the wall
            shes on the other side of this
            wall i can feel it

                        ynyr
               covers his eyes
            i chose the wrong passage

                        colwyn
            she can see the beast

                        ynyr
            use your sword

                        colwyn
            what use is my sword i cant reach
            her

                        ynyr
               points to wall
            cutcut

colwyn stares at him for a moment then unsheathes his
sword grips it with both hands and swings it at the stone
wall the blade strikes the stone with a spineshiveringclang he swings again  another clang but on his third
swing the blade bites into the rock sinking to a depth of
several inches

on the next swing the blade penetrates deep into the rock
and on the next it slices all the way through tearing
loose chunks of stone colwyn swings the sword back and
forth like a scythe cutting his way through the solid rock
spraying fragments behind him

in the other passage lyssa presses herself against the
wall watching the beasts eyes come closer suddenly a
chuck of rock bursts out of the wall near her as colwyn cuts
through he seizes her arm and pulls her through the hole
into the adjacent passage

ynyr lays a hand on colwyns shoulder as he embraces lyssa

                        ynyr
            you must move quickly the beast
            will stop at nothing now

                        colwyn
               divines his intention
            youre coming with us

                        ynyr
               shakes his head no
            it is my fate to die in the
            fortress

                        colwyn
            no you cannot know that

                        ynyr
            i can because i choose it

                        colwyn
               imperious
            i forbid you

ynyr smiles indulgently colwyn shrugs in embarrassment

                        colwyn
            i didnt mean it that way but you
            cannot stay

ynyr takes colwyn and lyssa by the arm and moves up the
passage

                        ynyryoucannot stay you must both
            escape the fortress or else this
            world is doomedint other arm of vortexthe beast moves toward the hole in the passage wallresume  colwyn et althey hear the beast tearing at the stone wall enlarging the
hole to allow it to pass through ynyr nudges colwyn and
lyssa up the passage

                        ynyr
            go now
               turns to torquil
            quell was wise he knew that a man
            cannot ask more of his death than it
            help his friends

                        torquil
               sadly grips his hand
            that is true

the weteyed ergo is too choked with emotion to approach the
old man ynyr lays a hand on titchs head

                        ynyr
               smiles
            take care of ergo

                        titch
            yes sir

the five move up the passage

                        colwyn
            quickly or he will waste his life
            for nothing

they increase their pace ynyr watches them until they
disappear then backs slowly up the passage

a section of wallexplodesinward as the beast tears his way
through ynyr sees the red eyes and places a hand on his
glaive

                        ynyr
            you and i were destined to meet my
            friend

he flings his glaive which flies to a point ten feet in
front of him and hangs in midair glowing

                        ynyr
            and i am not so old that i can be
            swatted like a fly

he thrusts his hand forward  the glaive leaps toward the
beast giving off a blinding light the beast roars and
retreats

                        ynyr
            no not so old as that my black
            beauty

now the red eyes narrow as the beast focuses its power on
the glaive the weapon is pushed backwards slowly but
surely

                        ynyr
            yes you will have to attack me
            directly to kill me i will cost you
            power my dark friend much power

he thrusts his hand out and the glaive leaps forward  but
only a few feet this time the beasts power stops it then
continues to push it back toward the old man he holds out
his clenched fist and stops the glaive about five feet in
front of him the beasts power is so tremendous however
that the arms of the weapon begin bending backward

suddenly one of the horizontal arms snaps off and flies
toward ynyr grazing his shoulder he staggers back but
manages to hold the glaive steady the other horizontal arm
snaps off and buries itself in his chest he goes down on
one knee but continues to hold the glaive steady though the
weapon is now reduced to its vertical axis

finally his strength gives out he drops his arm the
vertical blade spins toward him and pierces his throat the
beast moves past his crumpled body up the passageint very wide staircasethe five make their way up the staircase to a landing as
torquil starts up the next flight colwyn calls him back

                        colwyn
            we must find a smaller passage
            where it cannot follow

they move down a corridor to int dodecahedronthey look around in confusion at the doors in each of the
twelve sides of the huge room

                        torquil
            which one

                        lyssa
            where is the fortress

                        colwyn
            in the arctic ice

                        lyssa
               points to door
            that way i can feel the cold

they move to the door which opens onto a long stairway
leading up at the top we can see snow blowing past the
opening

                        colwyn
               pointing up
            shes right look

they hear the beast coming closer and start up the long
stairwayint long stairway night

as the five make their way upward a terrible noise from
below makes them stop and look back the beast is tearing
away the rock enlarging the passage to follow them they
quicken their pace

along the stairs are small piles of fine powder the mortar
between the stones is crumbling and trickling down the
wallsext fortress night

the five emerge from the staircase and make their way across
the arctic landscape toward the outer wall colwyn looks
back and sees the beast tearing its way out of the fortress

                        colwyn
            make for the wall ill catch up

                        torquil
            colwyn dont be a fool you cant
            do battle with that thing

                        colwyn
            theres no way to outrun it you
            know that this is what ynyr was
            preparing me for its what he died
            for

                        lyssa
            youll be killed

                        torquil
            dont worry ill tap him on the
            head with my sword hilt if i have
            to

                        colwyn
               quietly but with iron
                authority
            youll lead the others to the wall
            as i tell younow

torquil bows to colwyns authority he leads the others
toward the wall colwyn pulls off his hauberk useless in
this battle and faces the beast in his tunic the wind
whips the thin cloth as he advances across the ice to where
the beast waits obscured by the thickly falling snow

suddenly a gigantic chunk of ice flies straight at him he
raises his hand and the ice shatters streaking past him
harmlessly

now he begins to concentrate focusing his power until his
body gleams  then shimmers  then bursts into flame with
tongues of white fire leaping from his body as if it had
been doused in gasoline the flame is under his power it
doesnt harm him nor does it melt the snow he walks on it
only harms when he wills it  as when he sees a patch of
dark ones approaching from the side he sweeps his arm
toward them and an arc of flames rolls across the ice like a
wave washing over them and leaving their charred bodies
writhing in the snow

the beast is moving back and forth in an area of ice ridges
and hummocks dimly visible through the heavy snowfall near
it is a stone tower some fifty feet high the tower is
suddenly lifted from the ground and hurled at colwyn he
makes a downward chop with his hand and the tower splits in
the middle the two pieces flying past on either side of
him

                        colwyn
            i am no feeble old man for you to
            crush with two blows
               moves forward grimfaced
            this is for that old man

he sweeps his arm toward the beast and an arc of flame rolls
across the ice as the beast sidesteps the flaming arc
slices off the top of an ice hummock leaving the flat
surface boiling and steaming from the heat

colwyn presses forward driven by grief and rage he
launches a second arc of flame one end of which catches the
beasts side the beast roars with pain and retreats driven
back by colwyns power he launches a third arc and this
one strikes the beasts head staggering it

the beast is wounded now one of its huge eyes is swollen
half shut the skin around it badly charred enraged the
beast counterattacks huge projectiles streak toward colwyn
first come blocks of ice then great fragments of stone
finally the stone fragments begin to burn screaming
through the air like meteors

the projectiles shatter against colwyns protective shield
of flame but the force of repeated impact drives him
backward small fragments of ice and stone actually pierce
the shield tearing his tunic cutting his skin he is
bleeding from several flesh wounds and his forehead is
burned by a fragment of flaming rock

but the beasts power is not infinite the hail of
projectiles slows then stops colwyn resumes his advance
he chops his arm downward we hear a sharp crack and an ice
hummock explodes near the beast he chops again and an ice
ridge explodes leaving a deep crack in the ice the beast
hurls another projectile but colwyn brushes it aside as if
it were a mosquito and sweeps an arc of flame at the beast
to back it off

then he resumes chopping with his armcrackfollowed
closely oncrackas the ice around the beast is sliced and
shattered by colwyns power the section of ice on which the
beast stands suddenlydropsa foot or so the beast hurls a
final projectile then colwyn cracks the ice again we hear
a deep rumble and a huge section of ice collapses falling
into the depths of the fortress carrying the beast with it

watching from a distance torquil sees the exhausted colwyn
staggering on the ice barely able to stand

                        torquil
               to the others
            ill get him make for the wall

torquil heads for colwyn ergo pushes lyssa and titch toward
the wall

                        ergo
            quickly quickly to the wall

but ergo himself turns around and follows torquil to where
colwyn is stumbling on the ice dark ones flit between the
ice hummocks converging on them

as torquil helps colwyn toward the wall ergo forms a rear
guard armed with butcher knives from his voluminous coat
as dark ones lunge out of the swirling snow the little man
faces them fearlessly hurling his knives with deadly aim to
protect his friends one creature falls with a knife between
the eyes another with a knife in the neck a third pierced
through the heart

they reach the parapet where torquil and lyssa help colwyn
over the wall the five clamber down the face of the wall
and torquil is about to jump off onto the icy ground

                        colwyn
               points to horizon
            wait

the two suns are about to come up they remain on the wall 
except for ergo who slips on a sheet of ice and slides
toward the ground titch reaches out and grabs his hand
holding him on the wall though ergos legs are buried in
snow up to the kneesext forest valley sunrise

clinging to the wall the five look out on a green valley
ergos legs are still buried to the kneesbut in theground the stones of the wall are shifting the fortress is
collapsing

                        colwyn
               jumps to the ground
            away from the wall

torquil and colwyn haul ergo out of the ground and move away
from the wall

they watch the fortress crumble

                        colwyn
            its a fitting monument for ynyr and
            quell and the others

the fortress sinks from sight leaving a green valley in its
place

                        lyssa
            thats a better one

                        colwyn
            yes

they make their way across the glen colwyn and lyssa with
arms around each other titch riding on torquils shoulder
and the ergopuppy riding on titchs

                        lyssa
               looks around
            wheres ergo

titch hands her the ergopuppy who licks her face she
laughs and sets the puppy down it runs in front of them
frisking

peasant families come out of the forest and join them
children chase the puppy through the grass
