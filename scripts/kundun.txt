                         in the night i knew you were coming

               now the foothills the still photograph of this barren 
               mountain range comes to life as we see something moving

               it is a small caravan  traveling this narrow mountain pass

                                     woman vo
                         at dawn you were born

               closer on this caravan we can make out eight or ten men 
               walking and on horseback dressed in heavy brocade coats 
               and large woolen hats black braids trailing down their backs

               a yellow palanquin is carried by four large monks wearing 
               maroon robes

               the caravan reaches the top of the mountain pass and turns  
               a sudden shift in direction  a switchback the travelers 
               head downhill

                                     boy vo
                         tell me

               now we see the menss destination a lake an incredibly 
               blue circular lake sunk between snowdusted mountains it 
               is lhamo i latso  the oracle lake  and it shimmers in 
               the sunlight

               as the lake comes into view a young man pushes back the 
               curtain of the yellow palanquin and peers down at it

               the man is dressed in royal robes he is young twenty four 
               years old his name is reting rinpoche he is the regent of 
               tibet

               the color of the lake changes  from brilliant turquoise 
               to a deep murky unfathomable darkness

                                     woman vo
                         you were a beautiful baby so calm

                                     boy vo
                         no cried

               the woman laughs

                                     woman vo
                         maybe just a little

               the palanquin is set down on a flat rock overlooking the 
               lake the waters color changes again to a deep purple 
               then blue again then red then indigo

                                     woman vo
                         and that day your father got better 
                         he named you lhamo the protector

                                     boy vo
                         i know

               silence

               the noblemen and monks surround reting as he steps out of 
               the palanquin

               one man stands out here a monk a high lama in fact with a 
               kind face and fantastic mesmerizing eyes he is the lama of 
               sera

                                     woman vo
                         go to sleep lhamo

               reting stares at the lake

               the water turns a light grey and an image appears  obscure 
               at first then becoming more solid a vision

               he sees a house  a small stone onestory ushaped house

               the house has a flat tile roof and an unusual wooden rain 
               gutter with windows outlined in black and a prayer flag in 
               the courtyard a spotted dog is in front of the house 
               barking though we cannot hear him the vision becomes 
               completely clear for an instant  clear enough to see the 
               face of a young boy at the window

               close on reting rinpoche looking searching

                                                                    cut to

               a portrait of a mountain kyeri  a majestic glacier mountain  
               the house mountain of the village of takster amdo province 
               north eastern tibet

               sound returns as the wind whistles around this jagged 
               mountain peak and then the view moves down below the tree 
               line and into the rhododendron forest and the farmlands 
               until it comes to rest on a small stone ushaped house a 
               house caught in the dawns mist

               close on the face of a sleeping child a boy lhamo dhondrup 
               age two and onehalf years he is dreaming he is about to 
               wake up

               today his life will change

               we stay on the boys face until slowly his eyes open  
               beautiful dark eyes

               int tibetan peasant home kitchen dawn 1937

               the mother walks past the boy her woolen skirt swaying in 
               the rosy light a seven yearold brother  lobsang samten  
               and a teenage sister  tsering dolma  share lhamos kitchen 
               mattress lhamo looks at them and then he turns to see the 
               heavy felt boots of his father as the man walks through the 
               room and out the door lhamo finds the kind face of his 
               mother she is looking at him

               ext courtyard dawn

               the boy walks across the stone courtyard as we hear the sounds 
               of this country morning the snorting of horses clucking of 
               hens a command from the father as the man feeds the animals

               the boy scratches he pees he sees his mother on the roof

               she is a silhouette against the dawn as she feeds cedar and 
               yak chips into the incense burner  sending white curly 
               smoke up to circle the prayer flag and its clusters of 
               printed mantras

               we pull back as the spotted dog begins to bark

               lhamos house is the house in the vision

               int kitchen morning

               it is a good day there is cheese for breakfast

               the father reluctantly gets up and gives his seat to lhamo

               lhamo settles and waits for his mother to hand him his bowl 
               of tsampa he bestows a most beautiful smile on his family

               ext courtyard day

               the father is leaving the yard with a short string of horses 
               when there is a sudden commotion

               the chinese governor is passing through this little village

               his horse equipped with tack that looks like armor he is 
               surrounded by a dozen chinese soldiers all on huge horses 
               ruling the road kicking up mud

               lhamos father stops he holds still he looks to the house

               the mother is holding the children against her in the doorway

               road

               six travelers approach four of the men are dressed as 
               nobility wearing red and gold silk two men are monks

               close on the small face of lhamo as he looks down at the 
               bed

               lying on a piece of yellow silk are many objects there are 
               three of each type of object three walking sticks three 
               drums three silver pens three eating bowls three bells 
               three rosaries three pairs of spectacles

               the lama of sera  keustang rinpoche  hands lhamo the 
               rosary he had so coveted when the man first visited

                                     keustang rinpoche
                         this is yours you say what else 
                         belongs to you

               lhamo considers the request then climbs onto the bed to 
               study the objects the drum and the bell he chooses quickly

               keustang rinpoche watches the boy gather the items he looks 
               at the yellow silk and the boys small fine hands

               he dares not look directly at the boy

               lhamo picks up one walking stick  a lovely bronzehandled 
               one he swings it around but he finally rejects it in favor 
               of a plain ironhandled stick

               he makes his own pile of these things then looks at the 
               lama of sera

               keustang rinpoche pulls up the boys pants legs there is a 
               funny skin marking on the legs like tiger stripes

               the lama rearranges the boys clothing then one more time 
               takes the beautiful little hands in his own and whispers

               which is attached to two poles and carried between two mules

               the vehicle rises and falls pitches and twists as it is 
               carried along the roadless tibetan plains

               lhamo reaches forward and pulls back a curtain

               ext tibetan plateau day

               the boy is traveling with a caravan it is not in fact an 
               enormous caravan maybe fifty people including lhamos 
               family members of the search party monks muslim traders

               the dreljam driver looks over at lhamo and signals that the 
               boy should close the curtain

               lhamo does so only to lean across his brother to look out 
               the other side of his tiny carriage

               the other side opens to a view of the great empty land a 
               herd of deer grazes beside the travelers mountains rise in 
               the distance a flock of geese flies overhead

               lhamo closes the curtain

               they hit and pinch until finally the movement of the carriage 
               stops the driver reaches in through the open curtains and 
               separates the boys each to his own side of the dreljam

               inside his tiny carriage young lhamo now sits quiet and 
               composed

                         the next day the baby was safe 
                         they found him guarded by a pair of 
                         black crows he was the first dalai 
                         lama the living buddha of compassion

                         appear incarnate

               at the curtain behind lhamo we notice the curlytoed shoes 
               of a monk a man who must be standing in the next room

               int dalai lamas private rooms day

               in the room immediately adjacent to this bedroom we now see 
               the three monks who chased the young boy down the slippery 
               halls

               they are the dalai lamas personal attendants  the master 
               of the ritual the master of the kitchen and the master of 
               the robe it is the master of the kitchen who stands directly

               angular man with almost nordic features large round eyes 
               a yellowish mustache sharp nose

               all of these men will become quite familiar to us as will 
               the man standing listening behind the attendants

               he is a sweeper a man named norbu thundrup age thirty he 
               is tall and gangly with a wispy beard and a pockmarked

               the regent walks through this room on his way out

               a passing look from norbu lets us know that reting rinpoche 
               is not wellliked

               the lord chamberlain bows to the boy and then unpacks his 
               parcel

               he has a rolled parchment document

               he has a beautiful carved wooden box

               charismatic man with razor sharp eyebrows pictured sitting 
               on a throne

               hands and indicates that the boy should bring the heavy 
               instrument down hard on the parchment

               something on a tab of attached paper then bows to the boy

               the lord chamberlain touches the boys shoulder and tenzin

               gyatso leaves his hiding place as the speakers voice fades 
               away

               as the two walk down the hallway tenzin gyatso spots an 
               unusual wooden door he lets the lord chamberlain get a little 
               bit ahead of him and then the boy tries the door it is 
               heavy it almost opens

               tenzin gyatso and his brother lobsang are pulling at the

               mirror a lacquered rocking horse there are hats umbrellas 
               and even a pair of laceup cordovan shoes

               magazines and books there is a stack of tires in the back 
               corner the boys uncover a train set and a good collection

               just as the monks find their young charges and we hear them 
               at the door tenzin sees something truly spectacular it is 
               a telescope

               the monks enter the room as the young dalai lama reaches for 
               this miracle

               the sweeper tucks the boy in as the master of the robe 
               finishes his nightly preparations and with a pat and a smile 
               the two men leave the room

               a mouse steals a bit of tsampa from the offerings placed on 
               the altar before the buddha

               tenzin gyatso peeks out from under his covers and looks to 
               see if those curlytoed shoes are visible under the partition

               they are the master of the kitchen is still near

               tenzin gyatso pulls the golden pocket watch from under the 
               covers he pries and digs at the back of the watch until he 
               succeeds in popping it open revealing its miraculous insides

               finally tenzin gyatsos eyelids grow heavy the camera passes 
               over his face as his eyes close

               the boy begins to speak mumble as he falls asleep

               we find two scrolls the first is penden lhamo the special 
               protectress of the dalai lama

               she rides her wild mule through a sea of blood  between 
               rows of jagged mountains pointed fingers and spreading toes 
               her hair gone crazy her fangs revealed  the details are 
               incredible a garland of freshly severed heads hangs around 
               her body snakes hold up her skirt five skulls form her

                         rest and a slave for all who want a 
                         slave

               beside her on the second scroll is mahakala he is the fierce 
               representation of the buddha of compassion crows fly in the 
               clouds to the left of the terrifying black sixarmed figure

               a skull rosary is held in the upper right arm a trident is 
               held in the left hand

               the deity wears a crown of five skulls he has three eyes

               he tramples an elephant

               we might have been in a dream as the camera finally moves 
               back to find the peaceful1 protected face of the young dalai 
               lama asleep

               the camera moves across the mural devoted to the story of 
               the fifth dalai lama it is a fantasy of green with mountains 
               and lakes and deities and monsters

               we find the statue of seventh dalai lama sitting on his 
               golden cushion and we look deep into the eyes of the 
               thirteenth dalai lama fantastic deeper deeper

               the view travels and we see a prison yard shackled men share 
               the yard with hairy fat dogs

               one man looks up and sees that the yard is under surveillance 
               of course the men all know that this terrace belongs to the 
               boy dalai lama

               a monk is chanting in low deep tones in the background

               the dalai lamas teacher taktra rinpoche sits on the floor

               being the teacher taktra rinpoche sits slightly higher 
               than the dalai lama taktra is an older man in his sixties

               he is stern solid nononsense

               taktra rinpoche begins a prayer

               but the boy leaps up from his table and goes to taktra and 
               hangs around his neck shouting

               motion with his hands delicate beautiful hypnotic

               tenzin gyatso copies the elder

               we are close on the boys moving hands the chanting becomes 
               the voices of a hundred men as we fade out

               fade in on the boys hands but they are a little larger  
               they are the hands of an eleven or twelve yearold boy  
               and the motion they carry out is on the verge of becoming 
               extraordinarily beautiful

               his tsampa while reading from a long narrow stack of 
               scriptures thangkas of milerapa  the great tibetan poet 
               and teacher  hang on the walls

               we notice the curlytoed shoes of the master of the kitchen

                         the lord sakyamuni buddha are the 
                         truth of suffering the truth of the 
                         cause of suffering the truth of the 
                         cessation of suffering the truth of 
                         the way which leads to the cessation 
                         of suffering

                         contaminated actions and afflictions 
                         birth illness grief old age

                         the causes of suffering arise from

                         envy hatred greed unkindness 
                         wrong view and so forth  these are 
                         some causes of suffering

               now we cut back to ling rinpoche but he is standing outside 
               in a courtyard he asks another question but he raises his 
               right hand as he speaks and lowers his left completing the 
               question with a clap of the hands

                         another

                         we will have to think about that

               there is laughter even ling rinpoche laughs and the boy 
               erupts into his beautiful free easy laugh

                                     tenzin gyatso

                         when one understands that he causes 
                         some of his own suffering needlessly 
                         then he looks for the causes in his 
                         own life and when and he looks for 
                         those causes when he investigates 
                         then he is putting confidence in his 
                         own ability to eliminate the sources 
                         and end the suffering a wish to

               the monk who is his medium spins and twirls he wags his 
               heavy headdress about a round mirror glitters on his chest

               sweat pours from his brow over his wildly grimacing face

               the oracle spits at the government officials in the room

               horns blow cymbals crash incense burns the oracle nears 
               the dalai lama and retreats from him finally he whispers

               and then the oracle gently straightens tenzin gyatsos yellow 
               robes before the trance ends and the oracle falls into the

                         he warned about the future of tibet

                         when it is time

               int gardens norbulinka day

               his holiness works on an old movie projector a whitehaired 
               chinese monk works with him the old monk has very little 
               patience he bangs his hand on the table and huffs and puffs 
               as the two try again to fiddle with this and that

               tenzin gyatso works diligently and calmly

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         patience is the first of the six 
                         perfections

               the old monk mutters something in chinese they thread a 
               roll of dusty film into the reel and spin the wheel the 
               film breaks the old monk bangs the table again the work 
               continues

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         one day we will get that automobile 
                         running

               the monks slaps his head in horrid anticipation

               int dark room norbulinka night

               a movie begins shown on a piece of cloth tacked to a wall

               it is a newsreel  footage from world war one the trenches

               the boy goes up to the cloth screen and touches it gently 
               playing with his own shadow as men dash from foxholes across 
               a muddy body strewn field

               the boy steps back and stares at the horror of real war men 
               sleeping in the muddy foxholes makeshift hospitals tend 
               the dying youths  not much older than his holiness  
               weep into their filthy bloody hands

               the old monk keeps his trembling hand on the noisy hand
               operated projector

               tenzin gyatso slowly sits crosslegged on the bare floor

               war does not look good on film

               int dalai lamas private rooms norbulinka night

               the boy sits alone in front of his altar praying

               meditating

               int altar room the norbulinka day

               a black room lit by butter lamps

               taktra rinpoche and tenzin gyatso sit opposite one another 
               crosslegged on the floor taktra is the teacher he sits a 
               bit higher

               the room is a shrine to mahakala the dalai lamas personal 
               deity mahakala is present in the form of a huge golden 
               statue

               the boy has his head bent low to catch the rinpoches words

               there is much gesturing much murmuring we might catch only 
               a word or two

               an oral teaching is being passed on a lineage teaching it 
               is sacred and secret

               ext upper courtyard the potala day

               close on a thangka of penden lhamo

               we hear monks debating it is ling rinpoche answering playing 
               the student

                                     ling rinpoche
                         to be born in a time when the buddha 
                         has appeared to be born in a time 
                         when the buddha has taught to be 
                         born when the teaching of buddha is 
                         alive

               we find his holiness sitting listening to the debate

                                     ling rinpoche
                         to be born where the dharma is 
                         practiced to be born in a time when 
                         people have compassion for other 
                         people

               the view widens now and we are under a softly billowing 
               appliqued canopy maybe fifty monks and lamas are present

               this is an informal group

                                     questioner
                         how is human life precious

                                     ling rinpoche
                         as a result of previous karma you 
                         have obtained this human life by

                         of shantideva with the boat of

                         the waters of samsara how rare to 
                         find this boat oh ignorant one 
                         do not fall asleep now

               shots ring out

               the men jump to their feet and rush out from under the 
               canopy the dalai lama is right in front

               more shots as the men stare out across the countryside

               we hear murmurs of

                                     voices

               reting tried to assassinate taktra rinpoche

               we hear these snippets as the dalai lama runs from the group

               int hallways potala day

               it is almost black inside this old building the panting boy 
               runs up and up and up several staircases

               the lord chamberlain peers through the telescope as the

                         tragic unnecessary

               the lord chamberlain steps away from the telescope and the 
               boy takes his place

               the shooting slowly stops

               you were born

               the lord chamberlain walks to a far sheltered end of the 
               terrace

               tenzin gyatso slowly turns the telescope to see the prison 
               yard

               view through the telescope the yard is full of prisoners 
               listening to the shooting one man sees the telescope aimed 
               at the prison and prostrates then another and another

               tenzin gyatso steps away from the telescope and turns to 
               follow his lord chamberlain

               ext other side of terrace day

               the lord chamberlain opens a yellowing letter and begins to

                         attacked both from without and within

                         tell you current news the chinese 
                         have launched a deceptive campaign 
                         aimed at convincing the world that 
                         tibet belongs to china we sent a 
                         mission to the chinese national 
                         conference our attendance was a 
                         grave mistake

                         the tibetans were introduced as 
                         delegates from the chinese region 
                         of tibet we protested this reference 
                         and demanded a letter rebutting it

               a boy about fifteen or sixteen

               yearold dalai lama wears the same colored rosary around his 
               left wrist

               the cutters move in to the corpse and as we hear them begin 
               the work of dismembering the body the view pans up to reveal 
               the vultures circling overhead

               the last person leaving the hilltop with is the dalai lama 
               as an older man  not a character from this movie  but a

               bowl is spun the balls whirl race and finally one leaps 
               from the bowl

               this ball is taken to the dalai lama and he makes a mark on

               the boy climbs up on a chest and peeks through a tiny window 
               in the wall which separates this enclosure from the regents

               the boy goes to a small table where a document is unrolled

               the chanting of monks

               the boy is handed a golden wheel symbolizing the assumption

               coracles  skin boats  are loaded with bundles and people 
               and pushed off the banks and into the water

               the caravan journeys through a narrow mountain pass

               the flags of tibet and of the dalai lama are carried by 
               mounted soldiers

               suddenly monks come running from the surrounding mountain 
               trails shrieking wailing

               they run to lamas grabbing at their robes clutching crying 
               out

                                     monks
                         do not let him go we beg of you do 
                         not take him from us

               one monk clutches for an instant at the laymans wrapping on 
               tenzin gyatso  but he does not recognize him as the dalai 
               lama

               the boy tenderly embraces this distraught figure but the 
               monk drops away from him and clings to the shy sweet presence 
               of ling rinpoche

               the dalai lama is quickly and quietly surrounded by soldiers  
               discreetly so as not to give away his identity

               ling rinpoche speaks to a group

                                     ling rinpoche
                         he goes for a short time until the 
                         danger can be determined he will 
                         not leave tibet he will return

               the pain on these monkss faces in their voices is tragic

               tenzin gyatso is overwhelmed

               he sees before him a line of prostrate monks  but they are 
               not bowing to him they are laying down in the pass trying 
               to block the way of the caravan

               ling rinpoche goes to these men and gently helps them to 
               their feet

                                     ling rinpoche

                         on the opposite hand some officials 
                         urge you not to return they believe 
                         you should leave now for india

                         at this point the most likely result

                         the chinese would see such a pact as 
                         an open declaration of war

               their preparations for the day

               a new sweeper works in the adjacent room

               like a painting the beautiful monastery fills the screen 
               with its white walls and red roof

                         treated like one

               the dalai lama is shaken by this violent behavior

               the general leaps to his feet and is about to strike the

               the dalai lama runs between then he holds the general back

                                     lukhangwa
                         why is it necessary for the chinese

                         give us back tibet

               the general backs away and brings himself under control

                                     general chiang
                         plans for absorbing the tibetan army

                         then we will begin with replacing 
                         the tibetan flag with the flag of 
                         the motherland

               the dalai lama is at his telescope

               three thousand pla soldiers march along the shepherdss trail

               they march behind huge red banners of mao tsetung and chute

               this time the soldiers do look like monsters their faces 
               are grey  coated with tibetan dust their peaked hats look 
               vaguely like horns their tattered khaki uniforms like rough 
               hide

               monks line the trail whipping at the soldiers with their

               blesses sacred objects he lifts his bell and dorge

               rice is passed among the people rice is thrown

               a tibetan chant is sung

               beside his holiness is a large yellow silk pagoda

               the view moves inside the pagoda as the chanting continues

               the whole screen becomes this mandala as the chanting an 
               cymbals and deep resonating sounds of the song continue and 
               then a hand comes into the mandala and begins to sweep it 
               up

               pull back to see that the hand belongs to tenzin gyatso

               tenzin gyatso collects the ground particles of tibetan quartz 
               and rock he destroys the painstakingly lovely sand painting

               the chanting becomes louder and louder and it mixes with the 
               sound of the river

               tenzin gyatso pours the sand into the river

               in the weak light in the black room tenzin gyatso is lost 
               among the other praying monks

               ext hallway of residence night

               the dalai lama walks down the hall he says to a sweeper

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         dim the lights

               and then he bends down to pat a dog

               int dalai lamas private rooms night

               tenzin gyatso rolls the thangka of penden lhamo and slides 
               it into its ancient container

               the young man places the scroll over one shoulder

               int entrance of residence norbulinka night

               close on the little cabinet in the corner of the entrance 
               hall

               tenzin gyatsos hands open the doors

               the young man pulls open the drawer which contains the false 
               teeth

               tenzin gyatso pulls a rolled kata from his coat he tucks 
               the lead soldier of an indian ghurka into the center of the 
               scarf he places the bundle in the drawer

               then he adds something a sweet the kind his mother makes

               he closes the drawer and locks it

               he hides the key again behind the small unobtrusive 
               cabinet

               ext residence stairs night

               with a soldier on either side of him the dalai lama descends 
               the staircase

               the soldiers start to lead him away but he pauses

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         wait

               the young man leaves them

               ext residence night

               he walks to the far side of this white building

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         i see a safe journey

               the boy returns to the front steps

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         i see a safe return

               the soldiers wait

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         now i am ready

               tenzin gyatso places the scroll over one shoulder a soldier 
               lays a rifle over the other one

               ext gardens norbulinka night

               the three men walk quietly through the empty gardens we 
               hear the sounds of the crowd grow louder

               ext wall night

               the soldiers pause look to his holiness tenzin gyatso 
               removes his glasses puts them in his bag then nods  and 
               the soldiers open the gate

                                     soldier
                         move aside tour of inspection move 
                         aside

               of course we see only a fraction of the crowd  angry men 
               and women

               a man steps beside his holiness

               tenzin gyatso looks up  face to face

               it is the khamba bodyguard the monk who guarded him so many 
               times the man with the horrible face

                                     khamba bodyguard
                         move aside let us through move 
                         aside

               the dalai lama is between the soldiers shouldering his own 
               gun the bodyguard falls in behind

               the little group makes its way through the crowd

               ext tributary of the kyichu river night

               in the same place where the little tenzin gyatso tentatively 
               tested one rock the escape party crosses on the slippery 
               stepping stones

               ext countryside night

               the small party makes its way across a bit of countryside

               people are camped here  khambas farmers nomads the dalai 
               lama crosses to safety  unnoticed

               ext kyichu river night

               coracles await

               the dalai lama climbs in the lord chamberlain sits beside 
               him the soldiers push off the khamba bodyguard stands on 
               the bank alone

               every splash of the oars sounds like it could wake the dead

               tenzin gyatso looks back he puts on his glasses

               he sees camp fires and the glow of torches he hears echoed 
               voices

               he looks up he sees the stars and the moon and that 
               incomparable tibetan sky

               he looks forward

               he sees mountains

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         i have always loved mountains

               he is handed a steaming cup of tea

               and then a cloud passes over the moon

               ext countryside night

               on horse back the party makes its way up a mountain pass

               there are more members now  tenzin gyatso has joined those 
               who left ahead of him  members of the kashag tutors his 
               mother his brother

               it is tough going the ground seems like quick sand with 
               every step a struggle when the horses have disappeared from 
               sight a sand storm arises wiping away their tracks

               ext countryside night

               the party passes above an encampment of chinese soldiers

               they are not seen

               ext countryside day

               the party travels through the emptiness

               ext mountain pass dusk

               his holiness walks beside his horse

               he joins other members of the group standing on a ridge

               tenzin gyatso picks up a rock and throws it over the side

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         right will be victorious

               and now the others do the same the lord chamberlain says

                                     lord chamberlain
                         the gods will be avenged

               ext outskirts of tibet day

               the dalai lama sits before a low table set up on this desolate 
               border

               a document is before him

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         i repudiate the seventeen point 
                         agreement

               with a slap of the state seal of tibet this is done

               the lord chamberlain removes this document and replaces it 
               with another

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         i constitute the government of tibet 
                         the only legal authority in the land

               the seal comes down hard once more it is done

               ext border day

               a sick and tired tenzin gyatso makes the last leg of his 
               trip on the back of a black yak

               before him through the light rain we see a small bamboo 
               arch erected in the middle of nowhere

               six indian ghurkas wearing floppy jungle hats and heavy 
               british boots stand at attention

               the dalai lama on his black yak passes under this bamboo 
               gateway as the indian soldiers raise their guns in salute

               an indian soldier goes to the yak and helps the sick man 
               from his mount

               tenzin gyatso stands barely able to hold himself on his 
               feet his hand rests on the yaks back

               the indian soldier steps closer and knowing he is breaking 
               protocol he whispers

                                     soldier
                         with all respect may i ask who are 
                         you

               the young man smiles at the soldier  a man who looks like 
               the lead soldier come alive

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         what you see before you is a man a 
                         simple monk

                                     soldier
                         are you the lord buddha

               pause

                                     tenzin gyatso
                         i think i am a reflection like the 
                         moon on water when you see me and 
                         i try to be a good man see yourself

               int a room in india foot of the himalayas day

               tenzin gyatso unpacks he is dressed in maroon robes his 
               arms bare

               he places some books on a table next to his tinkering 
               equipment he lifts a heavy parcel

               ext terrace day

               close on the young mans beautiful hands as he sets up his 
               telescope

               the tripod is erect the body is attached the eyepiece is 
               adjusted

               and then this boy this man this simple monk aims to 
               takes a look at a bigger world

               on a black screen a card reads

               the dalai lama has not yet returned to tibet

               he hopes one day to make the journey

                                         the end
