     over black we hear the distant but near melodic cry of a loon

     slowly fade in to


     ext black lake  night

     the loon continues its hypnotic call as the steamy mist lifts
     off the dark water which doesnt even ripple  the loon
     continues her nocturnal cry as we savor the beauty of the lake
     the elegance of the bird and the haunting echo of her lonely
     call until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under
     silenced forever  a lone feather surfaces and floats as

     credits roll over the black lake to richie havens singing i can
     see clearly now then

     over black

                         keough os
               and they pay you for this  to tag
               beaver

                         walt os
               imagine

     as we fade in a face comes into focus from underwater  it is
     the face of walt lawson maine fish and game looking down from
     a boat


     ext lake  day

     next to him is sheriff hank keough paunch disposition of an
     untipped waiter

                         keough
               ask me what an animal does in the
               wild is his own business so long as
               he doesnt do it to man  i think
               mark twain said that

                         walt
                    dry
               i think he didnt  but sinceyouvesaid it i guess were
               covered

     keough holds a stare  walt drops overboard  keough pulls a
     twinkie from his pocket  begins to unwrap

               well he was very ill and he
               refused to go see a doctor and
               well i think he had alzheimers
               he would be coherent one day
               incoherent the next and onecoherentday he asked me to end
               his suffering  i wouldntdoit
               but he kept insisting and insisting
               and deteriorating till the point
               the only cognitive thing he could
               really do was that i finish him
               off  finally i just gave in and
               hit him on the head with a skillet
               then buried him under the bulkhead

                    to jack re kelly

               i never had sex with you

                         hector
               even so youre allowed to boast
               you look thin by the way ive
               mentally undressed you i can see
               your ribcage

                         keough
               i really dont mean to be
               discourteous
                    patronizing
               but how is it a person could come
               to believe that a crocodile is in
               new england

                         hector
               they have saltwater glands they
               can swim across oceans its only
               a matter of time

                         keough
               and what would he do come winter

                         hector
               they can survive winter  as long
               as their nostrils dont freeze
               they survive
                    to kelly

               you know when friends or family
               members say things they tend not

                                             cut to


     a campfire

     ext beach campsite  night

     kelly stands alone skipping stones  after a beat jack
     approaches

               skips on a good one

                    overriding
               im beginning to see why you were
               shipped off

     and her face falls

                         kelly
                    wounded quietly
               that was an awful thing to say to
               me

                         jack
                    feels bad now

               this

     jack reads her he can see that she does

                         jack
               okay
                    then

                         jack
                    a beat
               night

     theres a little chemistry here though both would probably deny
     it  he heads off toward his tent she sits with her book  she
     gives one last look watches him go  then she goes back to her
     book

                                             dissolve to


     ext lake  much later

     the lake is still the campfire is out the tents are quiet
     the quiet sounds of night  crickets  a loon  an owl  a
     courageous raccoon looks about seeing what he can rummage  by
     the water a black bear takes a drink

     angle keoughs tent

     he emerges compelled by a full bladder wearing only his
     trousers carrying a revolver  he walks into the nearby woods
     he removes from his shorts his bladders connection to the
     outside world  proceeds to urinate  then hehearssomething  the sound of rustling leaves  he stops urinating
     we hear a half second of movement  then quiet  must be his
     imagination  he resumes his business

     more rustling its not just the sound of dense urine against
     leaves he stops somethings out there in the darkness
     quiet  he starts up for a second stops quickly and we hear it
     forsure  somethings rustling towards him  with his free
     hand keough pulls out his revolver  more rustling keoughpointsthe gun  something on the ground is coming toward him
     he moves slowly gun drawn into the darkness  the rustling is
     getting louder  its almost upon him  a beat  closer
     closer  then keough peels away a bush revealing

     hector

     looking into a gun barrel  he screams  keough screams  then

                         hector
               jesus christ

                         keough
               what the hell are you doing

                         hector

       running off to get your      room where you can play with
       sister pregnant who you     soft stuffed reptiles
       probably already call mom

     and now all the others awakened are charging

                         kelly
                    arriving
               hey  what is going on

                   hector                    keough

       to pee

                         keough contd

               i dont care how much money hes

     and hector storms off  a beat

                         kelly
               you hurt his feelings  i think you
               should go apologize

                    how to say it
               he thinks theyre godly

     a beat

                         jack
               he thinks theyre what

                         kelly
               in his defense every primitive
               culture known to man deified them
               hes a mythology professor he
               thinks crocs are divine conduits

                         keough
               is this spose to make me take him
               more serious

               with understanding comes tolerance
               too bad they dont put proverbs in

                         keough
                    befuddled

               intelligence i have intelligence
               intelligent people eat twinkies

                         jack
               lets just all get some sleep

     and keough heads off under

               im an intelligent person

     upon which he disappears from earth  hes stepped into one of
     hectors pit traps  a beat

                         keough os
                    calmly

                                             dissolve to


     ext lake  sunrise

     the steam is lifting off the lake


     ext lake  morning

     keough kelly hector and deputy burke are cruising in the
     whaler  hector and jack are both in full diving gear  jack
     also has a stick gun for protection  hector doesnot

                         keough
               again i dont mean to be annoying
               with my questions  but if itisa
               crocodile which i dont think it
               is  and if theydocharge these
               baby hatchling sounds
                    to jack
               why exactly would you want to be
               underwater at the time
                    to hector
               with you it makes sense

                         hector
               they dont really attack underwater
               and

                         keough
               that walt guy got hit underwater

                         hector
               no crocodile has ever

                         kelly
                    to hector
               youshouldtake a flax pole

                         hector
               and what if i tranq him kelly  he
               drowns  you think about that

                         kelly
               im just saying last resort

                         keough
               again  not to be disruptive  do
               we have a problem with it dying

                         hector
               crocodiles dont sever with their
               teeth their molars are blunt

     as if thats suppose to clear it up  keough stares back
     blankly  then

                         keough
               is this a trick

                         hector
               what im saying isifits a
               crocodile that cut a man in half he
               would have to be over twenty feet
               which would make him well over a
               hundred years old it would be
               unthinkable to destroy him

                         jack
                    to burke
               alright lets just drop here

     burke lowers the anchor as keough just continues to stare at
     hector  kelly readies the hatchling recorder  she lowers it
     into the water

                         kelly
               they respond pretty quick  ill
               wait till you get down before i
               turn it on

                         jack

                         kelly
               good luck

     there was a twinge of real concern in her voice  he makes eye
     contact with her  then drops over  goes under

                         hector
                    to kelly
               two years married divorced used
               to be a lawyer quit im still
               waiting on his sperm count

                         kelly

                         keough
                    to hector
               i brought a pork chop maybe we
               could hang it around your neck for
               luck

                         hector
               no thank you but maybe later you
               can chew the bark off my big fat
               log

     and hector drops overboard

                         keough
                    to kelly
               was that like a homosexual remark

                    strict
               i asked you to be nice to him

     keough rolls his eyes

     kelly and keough onboard

                         kelly

               killer niles all around him he

                    as he starts the motor to
                     burke
               cut the line  cut the fucking
               line

     burke goes to work on the anchor line as we angle kelly
     treading water in the middle of nowhere  shes completely
     vulnerable

     kelly treading water  find keough on the boat he now has the
     engine running fighting against the drag but whatever has that
     boat has a fucking strong hold

                         keough

                         burke
                    working away
               im trying

     and finally as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne
     with a jump burke nearly sails out  keoughs boat then races
     to kelly

     angle kelly

                         kelly
               hurry up

     and they quickly pull hector on board all attention is on
     hector as they lean over to rescue him  on the far right two
     eyes moving closer to the oblivious rescuers

     closer  theyre now in the water right below burkes head  how

     hangs over the boat  kelly screams in horror

     in a microsecond burkes head and life are both gone  off

               a man died  you dont have to be
               so tough

     she nods appreciatively  part of her would love to collapse
     into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic

                         kelly
               im fine  i uh im fine

     pan to find keough walking  still visibly shaken  he
     unwittingly approaches hector  they hold a look

               yup

                         hector
               whenever somebody dies i consider
               it such a waste that i didnt know
               him better

     a beat  then

                         keough
                    fighting off disbelief
                     shock maybe
               his head was just bitten off

                         hector
                    sadly
               i used to have this recurring
               nightmare that i was headless

     keough turns to stare at him with incredulity

                         hector contd
                    quietly rattling it off
               id be on the ground looking up at
               my body no head walking around
               bumping into everything  and my
               parents wouldnt let me in the
               house cause theyd just bought all
               these new antique lamps and they
               were afraid id knock them over
               made sense and meanwhile the
               neighborhood bullies would see my
               round little head on the ground
               looking like a ball and theyd
               come rushing over to start up a
               game of soccer  id actually feel
               grateful just for being allowed
               into the contestthatsesteem for
               you what are your thoughts

     keough has had enough of this guy

                         keough

               you know hector im sure youre
               a fine person in your own mental
               way  but i think it would be best
               if you and i didnt speak

     and keough heads off  he takes about four steps then snap
     up goes his upsidedown body like a rocket  hes stepped in
     hectors springbow trap  a beat  he swings upsidedown like
     a pendulum  another beat

                         hector
               this is a setback

                    again

     hector and jack grab hold kelly cuts they lower him to the

               i lied

     and he charges after hector who runs toward the beach  keough
     chases jack and kelly pursue trying to stop him  and
     suddenly exploding out of the woods a ferocious charging
     growl  an attack  screams all over a halfsecond of confusion
     before we see its a large black bear jumping out of the
     darkness right at hector  hector dives out of its path
     screams panic shouting as the bear rears up on his hind legs
     seemingly about to lunge when exploding out of thewaterthe giant jaws of a crocodile

     in a flash instant the beast engulfs the bear twisting it
     slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water

     the bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only
     be one outcome here  in a matter of seconds both bear and
     crocodile have vanished  and the water is calm again

               snag him in pitmans  tranq him in
               water he drowns

                         kelly
               they could try to tranq him on
               land

                         hector
                    knowing
               they wont  hes taken human life
               the mission will be to put him
               down

                         keough
               gee that would really disappoint
               me

                         hector
               forget about him being god hes
               thirty feet long heisa miracle
               of nature who somehow made his way
               to maine  this is a grand beastagranddragon  an attempt should
               at least be made to capture him
               alive

                         jack
               well you can try talking them into
               that if

                         hector
               i have enough flaxedil with me to
               put him out  and i think i know a
               way to

                         jackforgetit

                         hector
               look  i know im crazy but when
               they come they will kill it  they
               have to politically hes too
               dangerous if something were to go
               wrong the odds are he will be
               destroyed

                 keough                    hector contd
        which is exactly          please hank let me finish
        what                 im having a sane moment this
                                  is a window

                         hector contd
               if he were neutralized when they
               got here they might consider
               saving him

                         kelly
               and how would we neutralize him

                         hector
               we lure him on land and pump him
               with the drugs

                         jack
               no way

                         hector
               jack  weve all seen it  hes
               probably a hundred and fifty years
               old hes bigger than an elephant

     hectors impassioned here hes not fooling around

                         jack
               so maybe wildlife will try to save
               him theyre more equipped to

                         hector
               we both know what theyll do

     silence  admission by silence  then

                         jack
               even if wecouldtranq him how
               would we get him on land

                         keough
               other than to eat us

                         hector
               he follows anything that moves
               you guys can be in the trucks with
               tranq guns  if he charges drive
               off plus hank youve got your hand
               held cannon  we could do this with
               no safety risk  if it works we
               save a beast that should be saved

     a beat  theyaresympathetic to the idea

                         jack
               and again  how would you get him
               on land

                         hector
               thats actually the easy part

     off the cable

               where is he

                         jack

     the men switch guns under

                         jack contd
                    yelling to hector
               do not go in that water
                    to the driver
               back us in

     as the pickup backs closer to the shore

                         jack contd
                    to keough
               if you get a safe shot

     the water is calm again  a beat

                         jack contd
                    to gare
               you see anything

                         gare
                    looking through binocs
               nothing  maybe he swam out

     upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging
     the truck  screams

                         jack
               go  drive

     the pickup spins dirt lurches forward throwing keough off
     balance  the croc heads back for the water as keough regains
     his balance

                         jack contd
               take him

     and keough blasts  it detonates the ground near the croc
     causing him to surge airborne into the water  and he goes
     under  silence  a beat

                         kelly
               did you get him

                         keough
               i dont know
                    to the driver
               back the truck

                         all
               no

                         jack
               hector you see anything

     angle hector

     on the pontoon of his chopper  hes looking about studying the
     water

                         hector
               no

                         keough
                    sarcastic
               i just have this feeling
               everythings totally safe

                         hector
                    yelling
               i see blood  maybe you got him
               hank

     and as hector looks further  behind him up surfaces the
     crocodile in all his stealth  his head is two feet from hector
     and nobody knows it  least of all hector

                         hector contd
               i cant see him but this is
               definitely blood  maybe you got
               him

     and as he turns back he sees it  the croc comes up as hector
     screams jumps off  screams  keough leaps off the truck and
     charges into the shallow water with his gun looking to give
     hector some cover

     hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper  he
     climbs in

                         keough
               where is he

                         hector
               i dont know

     no sooner said than the croc comes launching up  as he springs
     toward the open chopper cabin hector leaps out on the other
     side  the crocs head comes crashing clear through the cabin
     and he becomes wedged  the crocodile is stuck he protrudes
     right through the chopper  hes notcompletelyimmobilized but
     wherever he goes now the helicopter is going with him

                         keough
               hector

     but now jack has joined rifle in hand  hector surfaces again
     swimming for shore  jack runs to help him onto land

                         keough contd
                    taking aim
               alright  game over

     but the croc looks feeble now  he lets out this moan of death
     and even keough hesitates to pull the trigger

                         keough contd
                    to kelly
               should i

                         kelly
               wait

     resume

     the croc unable to dive is now thrashing toward the beach
     but theres no rage in his behavior now  he seems desperate
     hes taken some bullets hes tired hes wedged inside a two
     ton piece of metal and hes exhausted

                         kelly
               i think the drugs are kicking in

     breathing heavily he lumbers into the shallow water unable to
     free himself from the mangled wreckage  as unbelievable as that
     cow looked dangling from this very chopper the sight is even
     more astonishing if not preposterous now  a thirty foot
     exhausted crocodile iswearingthe broken helicopter  and he
     just cannot go on anymore

     kelly hector jack keough stare back  they approach with
     caution  they all stare at the tired crocodile

     angle the croc

     hes now looking back  bleeding gasping beaten  in his
     eyes we can see it  the beast is beaten

     angle the principles

     theres no triumph  in their eyes sadness

                         jack
               i dont think we really want to
               wait for him to catch his breath

     it continues to breathe heavily

                         kelly
               hes through fighting  look at
               him

                         jack
               i dont care  hank  end it

     keough raises his cannon

                         hectorno  look  hes got nothing left

                         jack
               yeah and every time we think
               theres no more danger

     upon which a twenty footeranothercroc thrusts up out of the
     water seizing hector  screams  it death rolls hector flings
     him out of his mouth and in seconds hes coming up for more
     keough blasts his avenger  a direct hit

     it takes the smaller crocs head right off sending it sailing
     into the air  it splashes down the first head not to hit
     kelly

     they all then go for hector pulling him to shore  hes
     bleeding

                         hector
               im okay

                         kelly
               youre not okay your legs a mess

                         jack
               get him onto shore

                         kelly
               he heeds a tourniquet

     keough quickly peels off his shirt  gives it to kelly who goes
     to work

                         kelly contd
               youre gonna be okay

                         hector
               guess i finally got bit

                         kelly
               yeah you got bit  im gonna fix
               it

     a sudden roar  kelly screams as jack and keough wheel to see
     the big croc  maybe his final roar he looks weak  gasping in
     the crashed chopper  jack and keough approach

                         keough
                    quietly re the big croc
               hes done  hes dying

                         jack
               dont count on it
                    then
               we better take him out

     but something about this crocodile his eyes looking back at
     them nobody wants wants to take him out

     angle the croc

     looking back at them  he knows hes in their hands now  he
     knows

     angle the humans

     a beat

                         hector
                    quiet
               flax him under his tail  two
               hundred ccs  under the tail
               thatll put him to sleep

     upon which we hear the sound of trucks  florida fish and game
     us wildlife arriving on the scene

                         jack
               thank god

     officer colson florida fish and game emerges approaches
     stares with utter disbelief

                         kelly
               we need to get it some medical
               help
                    re hector
               and him too

     by now the florida army has moved in  they all stare with the
     same suspended disbelief

                         keough
                    explaining
               we trapped him with our chopper

                                             dissolve to

     he kisses her hand  holds a look  heads off

                                             dissolve to


     ext beach  dusk

     the tents are down everythings packed  a couple trucks
     remain  the croc is gone  things are quiet  kelly stands down
     by the water staring out

     her pov

     hypnotic beauty  the lake doesnt even ripple  she soaks it in
     as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to
     this again  she hears every bird  including a distant loon
     serenity has returned  then suddenly a stone goes skipping
     out four five six skips  kelly turns around  jack stands
     there  they hold a look

                         jack
               i thought i should say goodbye to
               the lake too

     he approaches  takes her hand

                         kelly
                    weakly
               different worlds jack

                         jack
