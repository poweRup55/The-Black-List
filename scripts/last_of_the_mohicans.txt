               in miniature we hear the forest some distant birds their 
               sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern a piece of 
               sunlight refracts within the drops of water paints a patch 
               of moss yellow the whisper of wind is joined by another 
               sound that mixes with it a distant rustling it gets closer 
               and louder its shallow breathing it gets ominous

               is coming

               racing in the same direction they are they hit it straight 
               on and it shoots over them and theyre drenched by two waves 
               coming from the sides

               hawkeye  chingachgook

               paddle like fiends to get momentum and control

               same thing when they crested the wave uncas hollers at them 
               to pull and they do

               as soon as theyre through it uncas slams the paddle in the 
               water and makes the canoe revolve a hundred and eighty degrees 
               in a vortex so that now its going through sternfirst or 
               the stern becomes the bow so that uncas could pilot it a 
               different way through a hazard of

               exposed rocks

               jutting out of the water

               hawkeye didnt have to turn because chingachgook at the 
               bow uses his paddle to shove the canoe away from jutting 
               rocks uncas does the same past the jutting rocks uncas 
               swings it back around while

               white water

               smashes into the camera

               canoes

               the ranger the redcoats and even heyward feel the 
               exhilaration of the ride thats because they think theyre 
               home free

                                     hawkeye
                         heres where it gets tricky

               heyward turns to look in front of him he doesnt know what

               looks glasssmoth although there is a distant roar of sorts

               the look on his face starts to change

               heywards pov tighter

               the glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls 
               off the end of the world the river just ends

               realize theyre heading for the lip of a waterfall theres 
               a couple of outcroppings of rock in the center at the very

               the canoes  slightly above us  will go right over

               of the falls

               heyward

               grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe he loses his 
               grip the canoe rockets for the edge

               uncas

               lurches sideways grabs a tree root he is the only link of 
               the canoe to earth the bow with heyward is literally 
               hanging over the edge uncas strains and pulls the canoe to 
               the rock he gestures to heyward

               heyward

               crawls forward and makes the island then the two redcoats

               hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with

               holds him between her thighs and uncas is confused but 
               alice whispers his name and he responds he loves her in the 
               halflight

               uncas

               his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon then she 
               seems to reach some emotional climax and begins to cry softly 
               and uncas stops making love to her and holds her then shes 
               flooded with shame he reaches for her she jerks away he 
               reaches for her again and clutches her to him and she breaks 
               down then he turns her face to him but her expression has 
               completely flattened

                         again  he told me this without

                         so the huron are the servants of the

                         believes he fooled magua because he 
                         is so proud of his cleverness he is 
                         blind but it is the huron path that 
                         magua walks down not the french 
                         one now les francais also fear 
                         huron that is good when the huron 
                         is strong from their fear we will 
                         make the terms of trade with les 
                         francais and we will trade as the 
                         white man trades take land from the 
                         abnakes fur from the osage sauk  
                         fox and make the huron great over 
                         other tribes no less than the whites 
                         as strong as the whites

               hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with magua

                         up the fire stick and became the

                         steal his lands to sell them for 
                         gold to the white man  would the 
                         huron have greed for more land than 
                         a man can use like francais black 
                         robes do  would huron kill tribes 
                         with disease would the huron fool 
                         seneca into taking all the animals 
                         in the forest for beads  brandy 
                         but sell the fur to the white man

                         the frontier moves with the sun and 
                         pushes the red man of the wilderness 
                         forests in front of it until one 
                         day there will be nowhere left
