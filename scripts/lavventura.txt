it is the afternoon of a summers day anna a twentyfiveyearold brunette 
comes out from the entrance of a stately building and walks along a pathway 
that leads up to a dirt road she is in a great hurry and becomes a little 
annoyed and surprised at seeing her father a meticulously dressed and 
elderly gentleman standing near the curb busily talking to his chauffeur in 
front of a black british car
 
				anna
		so there you are ive been upstairs looking 
		all over for you
 
there is a moment of silence during which annas father deliberately ignores 
her presence she stares at him intently trying to determine his mood and 
wondering how she is going to tell him what she has to say before she leaves 
finally he turns around and faces her
 
				father 
		oh i thought you were already on the high 
		seas
 
anna is barely able to control her temper but realizing that the discussion 
is about to take the usual sarcastic turn she immediately checks herself
 
				anna
		no not yet dad
 
her father fixes her with a long ironic look conscious of his daughters 
haste he is apparently trying his best to detain her
 
				father 
		isnt it fashionable any more to put on a 
		sailors cap with the name of the yacht 

				anna 
		no dad it isnt
 
there is another moment of silence meanwhile a car has pulled up on the 
other side of the road it is claudia a twentyfouryearold blonde and a 
friend of annas both she and the driver get out of the car and remain 
discreetly in the background waiting for the conversation to end annas 
father resumes speaking after a cursory nod to claudia who in turn 
responds with a polite but halfhearted smile
 
				father 
		and how long will you be away 

				anna 
		four or five days

				father 
			resignedly 
		oh very well ill just spend the weekend 
		alone by myself and take a little rest i 
		should be used to it by now
 
anna glares at him furiously but still manages to restrain herself
 
				anna 
		used to what

				father 
		to the fact of my retirement not only as a 
		diplomat but also as a father

				anna 
			protestingly and with a 
			 deep sense of compassion 
		but how could you say such a thing 

				father 
		because its true after thirty years  not 
		having ever spoken the truth to anyone i 
		should at least allow myself to do so with my 
		own daughter 

				anna 
		and have you any other truths to tell me 

				father 
		you already know what they are

				anna 
		you mean sandro dont you  well i beg of 
		you please spare me that goodbye dad
 
she kisses him on the cheek but the father remains unmoved it is obvious 
that he still has something else he wants to say to her in fact after 
gazing upon his daughter with a certain amount of pity he finally does say 
it
 
				father 
		that type will never marry you my child

anna has a difficult time restraining herself but manages somehow to keep 
calm as she answers
 
				anna 
		up until now dad ive been the one who hasnt 
		wanted to marry him

				father 
		its the same thing goodbye dear
 
he now returns the kiss his daughter had given him a short while ago then 
without once turning around he heads slowly towards the entrance of the 
house as claudia comes into the foreground

anna still very tense and upset over the scene with her father gets into 
the car claudia follows after her as the driver puts her suitcase into the 
trunk
 
				claudia 
		have you been waiting long youll have to 
		excuse me
 
anna doesnt answer she merely pats claudias hand the car takes off as 
annas maid standing to one side of the road waves a warm goodbye claudia 
responds by waving back but anna doesnt even look around instead she 
turns to the driver and says
 
				anna 
		please hurry alvaro were late
 
the car speeds ahead along the dusty road across a verdant strip of land 
until it reaches the archway of a stonewall fence around which it turns and 
disappears it is seen again emerging from behind a cement wall and continues 
racing swiftly onward over a road that runs between two high walls there is 
no sign of traffic only silence it is an ancient road and a very elegant 
one claudia looks at it admiringly anna continues to remain wrapped up 
within herself the car now makes another turn heading into a small narrow 
road flanked on each side by gardens of patrician villas suddenly it 
emerges on a drab modern street amid the kind of traffic typical of any 
modern town

finally the car enters the street where sandro lives and pulls up in front of 
a small but very fashionable palazzo anna and claudia get out and as the 
driver starts to remove the suitcases from the trunk claudia turns to anna 
and says
 
				claudia 
		ill wait for you here
 
anna starts to walk across the street and is about to enter a building 
surprised claudia calls out to her
 
				claudia 
		but where are you going 

				anna 
		im thirsty

				claudia 
		if i had a man waiting for me for half an hour 
		and whom i hadnt seen for a month 
 
all of a sudden anna stops she is pensive almost sullen
 
				anna 
		you know i could just as well go without 
		seeing him today

				claudia 
		what after giving us such a run around 

claudia stops smiles and jokingly tries to laugh it off 

				claudia 
		i see so its farewell to the yachtand 
		farewell to the cruise
 
anna pays no heed to claudias teasing comments but follows her own original 
line of thought
 
				anna 
		you know its terrible to be far away from one 
		another really its difficult to keep an 
		affair going when one is here and the other is 
		somewhere else but at the same timeits 
		comforting  because it gives you a chance to 
		consider what you want and how you want it
		but when hes right there before you all the 
		time well hes right there
			then with a sense 
			 of exasperation 
		oh lets go back
 
claudia notices sandro leaning out of the window from his apartment on the 
first floor of the building he is looking at them attentively he is a young 
man of thirtyfive his shirt is unbuttoned and the tie around his neck is 
unknotted realizing that he has been spotted he smiles and waves a cheerful 
hello
 
				sandro 
		ill be right down
 
as if seized by a sudden powerful impulse anna heads straight towards the of 
the building claudia looks at her with astonishment and watches her 
disappear into the doorway then she looks up again at the window but sandro 
is no longer there
 


sandros apartment is extremely small although it contains many books it 
has the atmosphere of a place that is very seldom lived in sandro has just 
finished knotting his tie he closes his suitcase and heads toward the door 
he turns back however to pick up a towel fallen from the bed he takes the 
towel into the bathroom then he goes to the door again opens it and sees 
anna she appears a little anxious without giving sandro a chance to say a 
word she enters the apartment closing the door behind her sandro puts down 
his suitcase and is about to embrace her but anna steps aside and begins 
staring at him with an intense look upon her face taking him all in with her 
eyes she examines his suit his hands his legs his shoes then her gaze 
moves back up to his face which she proceeds to scrutinize sandro is unable 
to understand her behavior so he shrugs and jokingly exclaims
 
				sandro 
		would you like to see my profile
 
he snaps himself into profile then turns slowly in the manner of a store 
window mannequin anna continues to stare at him this time she peers 
directly into his eyes sandro is no longer amused
 
				sandro 
		well what is it
 
finally anna puts an end to her staring and taking sandro by the hand she 
leads him around the room she stops in front of a mirror and looks at 
herself the expression on her face becomes taut determined she starts 
unbuttoning her dress as she continues looking at herself in the mirror 
sandro comes up close to her shoulders caresses her hair and whispers 
softly into her ear
 
				sandro 
		but your friend is waiting downstairs 

				anna 
		shell wait
 
anna turns around and presses herself up against him with such a violent 
passion that sandro is somewhat dismayed but only for an instant soon they 
are feverishly kissing each other and it is almost with a sense of sheer 
animal pleasure that sandro abandons himself
 



meanwhile left alone claudia is pacing back and forth outside in front of 
the building she is bored and obviously tired of waiting then as she is 
about to cross over to the other side of the street she sees sandro and anna 
coming out of the doorway the expression on annas face hasnt changed  
she appears sad and gloomy but claudia doesnt take note of it she is too 
busy fuming over annas lack of consideration eager to let them both 
understand that she is sick and tired of waiting around
 
as sandro opens the window of the car which is pointed towards milan he 
says to claudia
 
				sandro 
		i have a feeling that youre not used to being 
		alone
 
				claudia 
			glancing first at sandro 
			 and then at anna
		that seems to apply to you also
 
meanwhile the driver has taken annas suitcase out of the black car and puts 
it into sandros claudia picks up her own suitcase and is about to do the 
same but sandro intervenes and takes it from her
 
				sandro 
		dont be so humble

				claudia 
		how should i be  arrogant 

				sandro 
		but of course arrogant haughty hasnt 
		anna ever told you
 
while this exchange was going on anna has already climbed into sandros car 
sandro follows and takes his place at the wheel claudia gets in alongside 
him the car takes off at high speed
 



heading south along a state highway sandros car is traveling at high speed 
over a straight open road it is twilight and as the evening shadows begin to 
fall the surrounding countryside is bathed in an aura of mystery

inside the car anna claudia and sandro sit in complete silence anna is 
deeply absorbed in her own thoughts claudia is looking out of the window 
enthralled by the dark beauty of the landscape another car draws up 
alongside of sandros and is about to pass him but sandro steps on the 
accelerator and pulls ahead with a tremendous burst of speed the other car 
lags behind and then turns off at a crossroad however sandro makes no 
attempt to slow down in fact spurred on by what has now become a definitely 
hostile atmosphere he drives even faster

as sandro suddenly switches on the headlights the violent glare that 
polarizes the roadside cuts off claudias view she turns to sandro with a 
look of disappointment
 
				claudia 
		it was lovelier before
 
to please her sandro turns the headlights off and once again the countryside 
is covered by a veil of thick but romantic shadows
 
				sandro 
		like this
 
now claudia again peers out at the landscape  but only for an instant 
sandro abruptly turns the headlights on again revealing a sharp curve in the 
road up ahead only about a hundred yards away he quickly shifts into lower 
gear and the car swerves slightly the sudden shift from fourth to third 
gear causes the motor to emit a sound that resembles a cry the car races 
swiftly towards the curve getting closer and closer but at such high speed 
it appears impossible the car will be able to make the turn further up 
ahead where the curve fades there is a stone wall that runs along the side 
of the road at this point even anna is attentive her eyes wide open both 
she and claudia are petrified and terrorstricken as the curve and the wall 
loom closer and closer fifty yards forty ten all of a sudden the 
headlights illuminate a large gap in the wall about three or four yards away 
just on the other side of a small ditch that separates the road from the wall 
itself there seems to be no other choice with a frightening leap  and 
going well over fifty miles an hour  the car barely makes it over the ditch 
and right through the opening in the wall the car comes to a sudden halt 
but skids along on the muddy ground of an empty lot until it finally stops 
near the door of a small farmhouse in front of an old man he is seated on a 
bench and has been observing the entire scene without budging an inch 

there is a brief pause  silence then sandro comes out of the car followed 
by claudia and anna claudia is visibly shaken she leans up against the 
building for support as though in search of something solid and dependable 
she is also unnerved by the feeling that she is responsible for what has just 
happened
 
				claudia 
		its all my fault
 
but instead of reproaching her sandro turns to the old man and excuses 
himself for having broken into his property imperturbably the old man looks 
up at him and says
 
				old man
		and who do you think made that hole over there
 
even before he has a chance to be surprised at the old mans remark sandro 
becomes aware that anna is laughing it is not the hysterical laugh that 
normally might be expected after such a close call it is instead a pure and 
simple laugh almost a happy one and leaves both sandro and claudia plainly 
baffled
 
				claudia 
		theres nothing much to laugh at 

				sandro 
		and thats what i say too we could have all 
		been killed
 
anna looks at them as she continues to laugh
 
				anna 
		im sorry  but i cant help laughing
 



on a calm sea amid the aeolian isles just off the coast of sicily a motor 
yacht is moving quietly and smoothly over the water it is heading directly 
towards a small island that appears like a huge rock jutting up from the sea 
sharply silhouetted against the sky about a hundred yards away a few sea 
gulls are lazily wheeling around up above

aboard the yacht a sailor is at the helm peacefully smoking his pipe while 
another peers out over the water as he munches on a sandwich it is almost 
noon
 
raimondo a deeply bronzed young man in his thirties is lying outstretched 
in the sun on top of the cabin towards the prow lying flat on her stomach 
upon a small rubber mat is claudia her arms are dangling over the side of 
the boat catching the cool fine spray of water splashing gently against the 
prow corrado comes out of the cabin he sits down on a bench near the stern 
after placing a cushion under himself so as not to soil his suit which is 
white and of an elegance that is slightly out of style corrado has a 
sensitive face with a look that is both sharp and intelligent in age he is 
closer to his fifties than his forties following directly behind him is 
giulia one of those impossible women who are so terribly sweet and coy and 
yet so demanding of attention the pose she strikes as she looks out over the 
water and the saccharine tone of voice in which she speaks are precisely 
characteristic of her nature
 
				giulia 
		its as smooth and slick as oil 

				corrado 
		i detest comparisons made with oil
 
anna also appears on deck looks around and noticing claudia goes over and 
lies down beside her claudia rolls over on her back to embrace all that 
wonderful sun but her outstretched arm comes in contact with anna who smiles 
and joins her in a friendly embrace
 
				claudia 
		did you sleep well

				anna 
		yes fairly well but i went to bed last night 
		planning to do some thinking about a number of 
		things  instead i fell asleep

				claudia 
		i didnt know one could sleep so well on a 
		yacht it lulls you 
 
their conversation is suddenly interrupted by sandros voice shouting 
hello he comes up to them and gives anna a warm hug then nods hello to 
claudia he is in a jaunty mood stretching himself out on the deck he opens 
a picture magazine he had brought with him and starts to read but anna 
places her hand over the page he is looking at and says to him
 
				anna 
		it would be better for you to get some sun

sandro closes the magazine and throws it overboard the pages come apart in 
the water some of them are quickly swept under by the waves while others 
float and slowly drift away white specks upon which a few sea gulls converge 
emitting their guttural cries 

as sandro stretches himself out in the sun anna looks upon him with 
tenderness she is about to embrace him but stops midway and then finally 
changes her mind instead she proceeds to stare at him with a profoundly 
troubled expression then momentarily dismissing her anxiety she cuddles up 
close to him in an effort to provoke his affection sandro responds but only 
with a fleeting kiss seeing them together like this claudia gets up and 
moves away to the far side of the prow sandro and anna remain as they are 
until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow sandro opens his eyes and 
sits up anna does the same the rocky island is now quite close almost 
directly upon them it is larger than it previously appeared and casts a 
long dark shadow over the yacht the water beneath the overhanging cliffs is 
extremely clear and almost motionless sandro rises to his feet and shouts 
out to everybody aboard
 
				sandro 
		shall we go for a swim 

				claudia 
		oh no please not here  it looks too 
		dangerous
 
the yacht proceeds to encircle the island up ahead another island comes 
into view it is smaller brighter and less foreboding corrado gets up and 
comes over to the prow to join sandro anna and claudia he is immediately 
followed by giulia who peers intently at the landscape
 
				giulia 
		at one time the aeolian isles were all 
		volcanoes 

				corrado 
		you must know your third grade geography book 
		inside out
 
giulia looks at him resentfully and abashed claudia points to an island 
which they have just passed
 
				claudia 
		what is that one over there called 

				corrado 
		that must be basiluzzo
 
				claudia 
		sounds like the name of a fish  merluzzo 
		basiluzzo
 
corrado then points to an even smaller island which they are now approaching
 
				corrado 
		now that one is lisca bianca
 
anna who had been absorbed all the while in contemplating the landscape 
though still preoccupied with certain personal thoughts of her own suddenly 
unfastens her thin dress stripping down to her bathing suit she turns to 
the group and exclaims with a note of exasperation
 
				anna 
		oh my goodness all that yapping just for a 
		little swim
 
she then goes to the edge of the boat which has slowed down somewhat and 
before sandro has a chance to call out to her she dives into the water
 
				sandro 
		anna
 
once in the water anna starts swimming towards the island the sailor at the 
helm slows the boat even more so as to keep it within annas range raimondo 
meanwhile has gotten his skindiving equipment ready around his waist he is 
tightening a belt to which a long knife is attached the yacht continues to 
slow down sandro now dives into the water and starts swimming towards anna 
claudia and giulia are removing their clothes and they too get ready to go 
into the water but claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in 
motion so she turns to the sailor and shouts
 
				claudia 
		stop  stop the boat
 
the motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt a sailor places a 
ladder over the side of the boat claudia goes down the ladder easing 
herself into the water she moves away from the side of the yacht by swimming 
backwards giulia follows her down the ladder but stops on the last rung
 
				giulia 
		hows the water
 
sandro looks up and pointing to the rocks at the highest part of the island 
answers her
 
				sandro 
		lets see you dive from the top of those rocks 
		giulia that would be really sensational  come 
		on giulia  your life is much too 
		circumscribed 

				giulia 
		what has everybody got against me this morning
 
from inside the cabin a feminine voice is heard shouting
 
				patrizia 
		raimondo
 
solicitously raimondo goes over to the door of the cabin from which 
patrizia emerges wrapped in a filmy nightgown she is a woman of great 
elegance somewhere in her thirties
 
				patrizia 
		why have we stopped

				raimondo
			kissing her hand 
		lady patrizia
 
then holding her by the hand raimondo leads her towards the prow where 
corrado greets her and likewise kisses her hand
 
				corrado 
		arent you going in for a swim patrizia 

				patrizia 
		what makes you think i would even dream of such 
		a thing raimondo why dont you go in for a 
		dip
 
she turns around to look at raimondo and becomes somewhat startled to see him 
all rigged out in his diving equipment complete with mask speargun etc
 
				patrizia 
		raimondo do you enjoy fishing underwater
 
				raimondo 
		i detest it but after all what can you do
		its the latestand i try my best to adapt 
		myself
 
he dives in as soon as he hits the water he starts shivering and exclaims
 
				raimondo 
		who ever said that man was originally a 
		creature of the sea
 
then lowering the mask over his face he begins to submerge on deck 
patrizia peers out over the sea and covering her eyes to shade them from the 
sun remarks
 
				patrizia 
		i have never understood the islands with all 
		that water around them poor things 
 



out on the water sandro and anna are almost at a standstill keeping  
themselves afloat with only the slightest movement of their arms sandro is 
laughing and joking as though all this purely physical enjoyment of sun and 
water has freed him of all other cares anna tries to emulate him but is not
entirely successful every now and then her face becomes clouded with that 
same worried expression
 
				anna 
		when do you have to go back

				sandro
		i dont know it depends on ettore hes 
		now in the process of negotiating for a 
		contract here in sicily

				anna 
		then how come youre not with him 

				sandro 
		what a question because i want to be with 
		you naturally i hope he doesnt close the 
		deal so hell leave me alone at least for a few 
		days isnt this water wonderful
 
he is lying on his back in the water with his eyes closed his face to the 
sun cradled in the gentle movement of the waves anna looks at him then 
after a moment of silence she says
 
				anna 
		id like to find a place where i can get some
		peace and rest maybe around here somewhere 
		id like to try

				sandro 
		what could be more restful than this
			he opens his eyes and 
			 is upright in the water 
		excuse me what is it that you want to try
 
instead of answering him anna starts swimming rapidly out to sea sandro 
tries to hold her back but because she swims much faster he gives up and 
finds himself alongside of giulia
 
 				giulia
			 referring to anna 
		where is she going 

				sandro 
		ask her
 
giulia is not much of a swimmer she bobs up and down in the water doing a 
crawl and it seems she is always on the verge of going under still she 
manages to stay afloat enjoying herself like a little child slightly off to 
one side raimondo is exploring the depths with his speargun in hand ready 
to shoot he seems to be chasing a fish that is apparently trying to elude 
him but the water is so clear that it would be difficult even for a fish to 
hide in fact only a moment later raimondo takes aim with his speargun 
pulls the trigger and the little harpoon shoots out then with a great 
splash he swims off in hasty pursuit of the fish a rubber raft piloted by 
one of the crew and bearing corrado ashore comes passing through the 
swimming area the sailor is carrying on a conversation with corrado
 
				sailor 
		ive always worked on pleasure boats even 
		though its more tiring 

				corrado 
		why

				sailor 
		because the owners never seem to have any fixed 
		hours for example last night we kept right on 
		sailing we didnt even have a chance to get 
		some sleep still i like it better
 
the raft passes alongside of sandro and corrado calls out to him
 
				corrado 
		im going ashore to take a look around the 
		island there are some ruins up there 

				sandro 
		there too
 
				corrado 
		well were still in italy you know
 
the raft continues on its way towards shore a little distance away claudia 
is floating on her back basking in the sun with her eyes closed  almost 
motionless her arms are outstretched and only the very slightest movement of 
her fingers in the water is sufficient to keep her afloat suddenly her hand 
comes in contact with something viscous which seems to be a fish that has 
shot up to the surface of the water at first claudia merely withdraws her 
hand without bothering to see what it is but since it persists in following 
her she opens her eyes and notices something moving right next to her 
frightened she lets out a tiny yelp at that very moment directly behind 
the fish raimondos rubber fins appear above the water and she realizes 
that it is raimondo himself he removes his mask and breaks out into a hearty 
laugh as claudia playfully splashes some water into his face

observing them from a few yards away is anna having returned from her swim 
out in the open sea she was about to join claudia but claudia involved now 
in chasing after raimondo doesnt notice her 

meanwhile raimondo outdistancing claudia finds himself alongside of 
sandro
 
				sandro 
		what kind of a fish is that 

				raimondo 
		its a cernia 

				sandro 
		my god its enormous
 
claudia having given up trying to catch raimondo swims up alongside of 
giulia who is busy observing corrado disembark on a little strip of beach 
that stands out distinctly white against the dark rocks claudia is in a 
playful mood she dives underwater grabs hold of giulias leg comes up and 
then dives under once again giulia caught up in the spirit of all this 
playfulness drops her concern with corrado and joins in with the fun and 
merriment

suddenly there is a loud shriek then annas voice is heard screaming
 
				anna 
		a shark a shark
 
they all turn around to look at her anna is swimming furiously towards the 
boat then immediately the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht 
sounds out
 
				sailor 
		dont move  lady stay where you are 
		stop everybody keep still
 
but sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards anna like a 
demon raimondo who was about to climb aboard the yacht grasps his 
speargun firmly in his hand hurls himself back into the water and also 
starts to swim in annas direction claudia is stricken with fear and holds 
on tight to giulia anna has stopped swimming and is cautiously looking 
around to see if anything comes up out of the water then she looks up and 
seeing sandro and raimondo approaching she shouts
 
				anna 
		stay away
 
they both stop then raimondo hurriedly dons his mask and disappears under 
water while sandro again starts swimming out towards anna sandro comes up 
alongside her
 
				sandro 
		anna
 
but anna doesnt say a word instead they both swim silently back to the 
yacht where claudia and giulia are already climbing aboard patrizia comes 
out of the cabin to see what is happening

they all lean over the side of the boat looking down into the water 
expecting the shark at any moment to come into view but the water remains 
unruffled the seaweed below is clearly visible waving like so many fans 
even the rocks at the bottom can be seen with all sorts of smallgilled fish 
darting about a mysterious fascinating world and yet because of what 
happened one that arouses fear everyone aboard is silent until anna and 
sandro followed by raimondo finally arrive and climb aboard sandro 
immediately takes anna to her cabin and the others follow making various 
comments
 
 				claudia 
			to anna
		but how did you become aware of it did it 
		touch you
 
anna doesnt answer but continues on ahead amid the overlapping remarks
 
				giulia 
		i would have died
 				
				patrizia
		 and how ugly they are  with all those teeth

				corrado 
			shouting from the shore 
		what happened 

				giulia 
			shouting from the prow 
		theres a shark in the area dont move from 
		where you are 

				corrado 
		whos moving
 



inside the cabin which is partitioned into separate rooms the general 
layout is neat and orderly with a number of prints decorating the walls 
sandro and anna followed by claudia enter from the outside deck and cross 
over into annas room it is extremely small with two cots on one side and a 
long curtain that partially conceals a bureau from which several dresses are 
seen hanging

anna is soaking wet in her bathing suit and her hair is all knotted into  
clusters that hang down over her face without bothering to dry herself she 
crouches down on the cot and assisted by claudia wraps a blanket around her 
body sandro and claudia look at her with great concern a member of the crew 
enters carrying a tray on which there is a halffilled glass of liquor which 
sandro takes and offers to anna
 
				sandro 
		here drink some cognac
 
anna positively refuses it and the sailor leaves as sandro sets the glass 
down on a shelf looking up at both sandro and claudia anna appears pleased 
with their solicitude
 
				anna 
		its nothing really lets go back its 
		all over now 

a pause and then an instant later she begins shivering under the blanket 

				anna 
		only id like to change im a little cold
 
leaving anna and claudia alone on their own sandro turns and goes outside 
the cabin where the others are still congregated busy chattering among the 
remarks exchanged one that is distinctly heard is patrizias
 
				patrizia 
		but where did the shark go to
 
as soon as sandro closes the door to the cabin anna is suddenly and 
completely changed she gets up from the cot goes over to the curtain and 
draws it aside revealing an array of feminine attire wondering which dress 
to choose she finally selects two and tosses them on the cot
 
				anna 
		which one shall i wear

				claudia
			picking up one of the two dresses
		this one is gorgeous

				anna 
		then why dont you try it on
 
as anna begins to dry herself with a large bath towel claudia slips on the 
dress and looks at herself in the mirror with a coquettish expression on her 
face
 
				anna 
		it looks better on you than it does on me 
		you keep it
 
anna is removing her bathing suit as she continues talking to claudia with a 
tone and manner that reveal a sense of excitement mixed with one of amusement
 
				anna 
		you know that thing about the shark was all a 
		joke
 
claudia looks at her as though dumbfounded as though she had never known her 
before she is obviously piqued and angry but more with herself than with 
anna
 
				claudia 
		theres the difference between you and me you 
		know how to put over certain things and i 
		dont sometimes i envy you
 
anna is all dressed and ready she opens the door and steps outside as 
claudia follows behind 




out on the deck sandro patrizia raimondo and giulia are looking over the 
side of the boat watching the sailor as he approaches the yacht with a 
rubberized raft  giulia with her usual air of affectation looks down at 
the water splashing up against the raft and asks the sailor
 
				giulia 
		but arent you afraid

				sailor 
		maam sharks never attack anybody anyway the
		raft is dark and they wouldnt be able to see 
		it

				patrizia 
		so it is true that theyre blind
 
anna appears at the door of the cabin and sandro rushes over to meet her a 
little surprised to find her looking so cheerful as though the incident that 
had just taken place were completely forgotten
 
				sandro 
		how are you

				anna 
		fine cant you see so yourself
 
anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little 
stairway leading down to the water
 
				anna 
		i have an urge to put my feet on some land 
		arent you coming
 
as she starts to go down the steps sandro quickly comes over to her
 
				sandro 
		anna maybe it would be better to wait a 
		while

				anna 
		wait for what

				patrizia 
		well with a shark running loose around the 
		place i for one wont get aboard that raft 
		theyll have to catch it first i want to see 
		it right here before my feet dead or alive 

				claudia 
		better dead
 
but anna has already stepped aboard the raft and sandro follows her giulia 
has her eyes fixed on the beach where corrado in his white suit is waiting 
for them her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark so 
she looks down at the sailor and asks
 
				giulia 
		will the three of us fit

				sailor 
		sure sure theres plenty of room
 
patrizia instead turns around and heads back to the cabin and raimondo 
follows her shortly after giulia descends into the raft and as it moves 
away from the boat with a slight pitch she lets out a few hysterical shrieks 
anna laughs and then shouts out to claudia
 
				anna 
		claudia arent you coming

				claudia 
		im certainly not going to swim across 
			
				anna 
		well send the raft back to you

				giulia 
		and bring some cushions when you come and a 
		towel
 
claudia nods assent and remains there looking over the side and watching the 
water splash against the boat suddenly she looks up at the sky and realizes 
that the sun has disappeared actually it is hidden behind a cloud and over 
on the horizon a group of other clouds have accumulated

the sailor left aboard the yacht is now signaling the other sailor on the 
raft who having deposited sandro anna and giulia on the beach is returning 
to pick up claudia he sounds the depths with his oar and then shouts up
 
				sailor 
		okay come ahead come ahead
 
the sailor aboard the yacht goes over to claudia and says
 
				sailor 
		im taking the boat right up to the shore and
		well let you get off from the gangplank as 
		soon as we get there
 
then he disappears inside and soon the yacht starts moving towards the shore 
claudia peers out over the landscape the islands are sharply silhouetted 
against the sea and sky the volcano on stromboli smokes feebly and in the 
distance a ship passes by claudia is plainly enchanted by the view then she 
collects her thoughts and slowly heads towards the cabin
 



patrizia seated at a small table inside the cabin is busy working on a 
complicated jigsaw puzzle which once completed is supposed to represent a 
typically classical scene one by one she selects the various pieces of 
cardboard and inserts them in their rightful places simultaneously she is 
munching on some crackers spread with jam and a piece of cold fruit beside 
her is raimondo  he is staring at patrizia with such an intense expression 
that she becomes thoroughly annoyed and says to him as she continues working 
at her puzzle
 
				patrizia 
		what do you want raimondo do you want me a 
		few years ago maybe but now and then 
		at this hour of the day
 
coming down the steps that lead into the cabin claudia overhears the end of 
the conversation and decides to withdraw but patrizia sees her and calls 
her back
 
				patrizia 
		come claudia do come in theres no 
		romance going on here
 
claudia enters raimondo continues to stare at patrizia particularly at her 
legs patrizia becomes aware that raimondo is staring at her and with a 
condescending gesture she lifts her skirt a little higher to make him see 
better
 
				patrizia 
		there have you seen enough now are you 
		satisfied
 
raimondo nods yes claudia is amused by their behavior but also a little 
surprised

patrizia calmly resumes her game and raimondo again begins to stare at her 
this time at her breasts and again patrizia becomes conscious of the fact 
that he is staring at her she assumes a bored attitude and looks up at the 
ceiling in a gesture of quiet forbearance raimondo reaches out with his hand 
and gently caresses patrizias breast claudia looks on in amazement 
raimondo withdraws his hand
 
				patrizia
			regretfully 
		now tell the truth arent you a bit 
		disappointed but i already told you 

				raimondo 
		if womens breasts were colored yours would be 
		blue
 
patrizia laughs at raimondos remark and looks at him sympathetically then 
she turns to claudia
 
				patrizia 
		tell me claudia what do you think of raimondo
 
				claudia 
		i would say hes pretty depraved 

				patrizia 
		oh no quite the contrary hes really just a 
		child

				raimondo 
		patrizia dont start in again i would 
		rather be called depraved unless you happen to 
		love children

				patrizia 
		you know i dont love anybody 

				raimondo
			angrily
		i know dammit i know 
			turning to claudia 
		and just think  if there ever was a woman so 
		right so perfectly cut out for all kinds of 
		dissipations degradations infidelities 
		of  of of debaucheries its her well 
		anyway shes faithful faithful out of 
		laziness of unwillingness
 
raimondo has such a disgruntled look on his face that patrizia laughs
 
				patrizia 
		he amuses me i dont know of anything more 
		amusing outside of this jigsaw puzzle dont 
		you find it so claudia

				claudia 
		one would have to be in love with somebody to 
		know that

				patrizia 
		have you ever been in love

				claudia 
		not really its suffocating in here shall 
		we go out
 
claudia leaves the cabin and goes up to the deck patrizia returns to her 
game and raimondo continues to stare at her
 



along a narrow strip of beach on the island of lisca bianca sandro anna 
corrado and giulia are waiting for claudia to come ashore there are some 
patches of vegetation growing here and there but by and large the island is 
one huge rock with rugged cliffs which descend perpendicularly to the water 
jutting promontories give the place a sense of raw primitive beauty seeing 
anna and sandro climbing a short distance up along the rocks to find a 
comfortable place where they can lie down and stretch themselves corrado 
remarks
 
				corrado 
		if any of you get into your bathing suits 
		again you can be sure we wont be seeing one 
		another for the rest of the year i just cant 
		stand seeing anybody in the city after having 
		seen them naked on the beach
 
the yacht finally has arrived and the gangplank is laid out between the boat 
and the shore claudia descends and as she wades ashore she stops bends over 
to dip her hand in the water and with a tone of voice resembling that of a 
mother speaking to its newborn child she pretends she is speaking with 
someone or something in the water
 
				claudia 
		oh how sweet what a dear little darling
 
they all turn around to look at her wondering to whom or what she is 
referring
 
				giulia 
		who are you talking to 

				claudia 
		to the shark
 
they all break out into a laugh and claudia continues her comic bit as she 
playfully pretends to lose her balance on the slippery pebbles along the 
shore corrado looks at her somewhat surprised as though up until now he had 
never seen her comport herself with such a lively sense of humor and wit
 
				corrado 
		say claudia wouldnt you like to climb up 
		with me and take a look over there 

				claudia 
		at what

				corrado 
		at the ruins theyre very ancient you know
 
out of the entire group claudia is perhaps the only one who really has the 
desire to explore to see and to generally take advantage of whatever the 
cruise has to offer
 
				claudia 
		that sounds like a good idea but why dont we 
		all go together
 
though claudias suggestion is heard by all none of them make a move 
relaxing so comfortably in the sun as they are it seems the last thing they 
would want to do is to climb up the rocky slopes so claudia starts to go up 
on her own following corrado who is already under way but giulia 
immediately comes up to him and squeezing his arm to emphasize her plea 
whispers to him
 
				giulia 
		please i beg of you stay here
 
giulias plea is expressed with such a pitiful sense of humility that claudia 
is immediately taken aback although she does not fully understand its 
motive
 
				corrado 
			noticing claudias hesitancy
		well 

				claudia 
		well what

				corrado 
		have you decided

				claudia 
		all i said was that it sounds like a good idea
 
disappointed and rather irritated corrado turns back while claudia looks 
around for a place on the rocks where she can comfortably set herself down 
giulia in turn approaches corrado
 
				giulia 
		why didnt you ask me to go with you 

				corrado 
		do you know why because if you saw those ruins 
		im sure you would have said they were very 
		very beautiful you always say how beautiful 
		to everything  whether its the sea or a 
		baby or a cat you have such a sensitive 
		little heart that it throbs for anything
 
				corrado 
			ironically
		but corrado  if something is beautiful why 
		shouldnt one say so

				giulia
			referring to corrado
		he never misses a chance to humiliate me to
		let me know that he doesnt care about me any 
		more

				corrado 
		giulia that remark is not worthy of our twelve 
		years of honest concubinage i repeat once and 
		for all and publicly that i admire you does 
		that please you
 
				claudia 
			under her breath to 
			 anna and sandro
		twelve years  but why havent they married
 
				sandro
			with a faint smile
		and why havent they left each other

				claudia 
		im beginning to have my doubts it couldnt be 
		that theyre in love

				sandro 
		could be theyre the kind of people who are 
		capable of anything
 
sandro suddenly grabs anna around the waist and pulls her to him his action 
is so unexpected that even anna is astonished but giulias voice is heard 
again
 
				giulia
			to corrado
		the trouble with you is that nobody can speak 
		to you thats all

				sandro
			placatingly
		giulia dont you understand that the more 
		involved you become with people the more 
		difficult it is to speak with them 

				giulia 
		you men are all so dreadful

				sandro 
		i know we are but as the years go by we 
		become even worse isnt that so corrado 

				corrado 
		i hope so
 
breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group a 
seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht 
claudia runs to the basket picks up a peach and quickly bites into it
 
				claudia 
		how wonderful

				corrado 
		thats patrizias way of letting us know shes 
		with us
 
claudia takes another peach from the basket and gives it to corrado
 
				claudia 
		i think youre very sweet corrado 

				corrado 
		more so than the shark 

				claudia 
		theres no comparison

				corrado 
		then why dont we go up and see the ruins




anna and sandro have left the group and are ensconced further up among the 
rocks on a grassy slope overlooking the beach
 
				anna 
		sandro a month is too long a time i have 
		become used to being without you

				sandro 
		youll get over it soon its the usual anxiety 

				anna 
		a little more so this time

				sandro 
		so it will just take you a little longer to 
		get over it

				anna 
			angrily
		but i think we should talk about it or are you 
		fully convinced that we too wont understand 
		each other

				sandro 
		there will be plenty of time to talk about it
		later  well  get married  soon  that way 
		well have more time

				anna 
		in this case getting married means nothing 
		arent we already the same as being married 
		and corrado and giulia  arent they already 
		the same as being married

				sandro 
		but why rattle your brains by arguing and 
		talking believe me anna words never help 
		at all they only serve to confuse i love you 
		anna isnt i that enough

				anna 
		no its not enough i told you before that i 
		would like to get away for a while and be alone 

				sandro 
		but you just said that a month was too
 
				anna 
			interrupting
		i mean to stay away longer  two months a 
		year three years yes i know it sounds 
		absurd and i feel awful the very idea of 
		losing you makes me want to die and yet 
		i i just dont have the same feeling for you 
		any more 

				sandro 
		and what about yesterday at my house 
		didnt you have any feeling for me even then 

				anna 
			angrily
		there you go must you always spoil 
		everything
 
she turns and walks away in a rage sandro breathes a deep sigh as though 
the scene had exhausted him then stretches himself on the ground his face 
turned skyward his eyes shut tight
 



the sky over the island of lisca bianca is completely filled with clouds it 
is early afternoon the atmosphere has darkened and occasional sounds of 
thunder are heard in the distance

sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head further below claudia 
corrado and giulia are also taking a nap gradually however with the sound 
of thunder they become aroused
 
				giulia 
		looks like the weather is changing 

				corrado 
		please giulia must you always emphasize the 
		obvious i can see for myself that the weather 
		is changing
 
corrado rises and looks around lazily listening to what appears to be the 
sound of a motor boat and which seems to be coming from the other side of the 
island claudia spotting a sailor approaching also rises
 
				sailor 
		well have to get going
 
claudia turns around looks up and sees sandro asleep by himself
                                 
				claudia 
		and wheres anna 
			then turning to the sailor
		isnt she on the yacht
 
				sailor 
		i dont know you see we were taking a 
		little nap
 



out on the yacht patrizia is completing her puzzle only a few pieces are 
missing but the area to be filled in is a very difficult one raimondo who 
has grown impatient over patrizias long and tedious concentration exclaims
 
				raimondo 
		youve made some mistake there with the 
		bushes thats why you cant finish it

				patrizia 
		take it easy raimondo why are you getting so 
		impatient
 
claudias voice is heard calling out from the shore
 
				claudia 
		patrizia 
 
patrizia raises her eyes and gives a quick casual glance at the porthole 
raimondo immediately takes the hint that she would like him to get up and see 
what claudia wants so he goes out to the deck where he sees claudia calling 
from the shore
 
				claudia 
		is anna there 

				raimondo 
		i dont think so
 
he goes over to the cabin and looking through the portholes calls out 
annas name but there is no answer so he returns to the side of the boat 
and shouts back
 
				raimondo 
		shes not here
 




meanwhile on the beach sandro is also looking for anna disturbed and 
amazed that she is not in sight
 
				sandro
			angrily to himself
		this is the kind of behavior that drives me 
		crazy

down at the shore giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go 
aboard the yacht but anxious about annas whereabouts she changes her mind 
and turns back claudia also deeply concerned decides to remain and look 
around for herself she turns and starts climbing up towards the rock in an 
opposite direction than that taken by sandro who has now reached the top
 
the search is fruitless there seems to be no trace of anna but sandro 
continues to explore the area stopping every now and then to call out annas 
name then looking down over the slope he notices claudia giulia and 
corrado coming towards him
 
				sandro 
		did you find her
 
none of them answer but it is clear from the worried expressions on their 
faces that they too have found no trace of anna still they continue the 
search each going off in different directions claudia walking over land 
covered with large white rocks and clumps of dry brush spots something 
moving behind one of the bushes anxiously she starts to walk up closer 
suddenly the branches begin to move and a stray lamb emerges surprised but 
also somewhat relaxed she turns around and calls out to corrado who is 
following her only a short distance away
 
				claudia 
		its a lamb
 
corrado looks at her without answering then stops and notices further up 
ahead a jumbled pile of rocks which he feels might very well be the ruins he 
had previously intended to explore he is about to head towards them but 
suddenly realizes that giulia is following directly behind him he quickly 
changes his direction in an effort to avoid her

sandro comes upon a small stone hut that leans up against a high section of 
rock as he starts to approach it another stray lamb appears as if from 
nowhere and runs off frightened by sandros approach he tries to open the 
door to the hut but finds it locked as he looks around the area uncertain 
as to his next move he sees claudia and corrado coming towards him
 
				claudia 
		find anything 

				sandro 
		no

				corrado 
		perhaps shes taking a swim somewhere
 
though no less concerned over annas disappearance than any of the others 
corrado attempts to lighten the tension by feigning a calm and sensible 
attitude taking note of the stone hut before him he observes it carefully 
and remarks

				corrado 
		its really a fact  theres nothing new under 
		the sun now look here look at this 
		structure a kind of natural shelter sandro 
		thats how you should design your houses

				sandro 
		me i no longer have any interest in 
		building and then where can you find 
		boulders of rock like this in milan
 
claudia comes up close to the hut and tries to peer through the tiny window 
but inside it is so dark that nothing can be seen suddenly she finds a 
small piece of bread on the ledge of the window she picks it up and starts 
examining it then realizing the bread is still fairly fresh exclaims
 
				claudia 
		somebody must live here

				corrado 
			after examining the bread himself
		but anna wouldnt be staying with the kind of 
		people who live here
 
the discussion is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of one of the sailors 
who has come up from the shore
 
				sailor 
		we had better get started the storm may 
		break any minute now

				claudia
			angrily
		what do you mean what about anna

				sandro 
			to the seaman
		tell lady patrizia that we cant leave now in 
		fact well have to make a tour around the 
		island

				sailor 
		wouldnt it be better if you told that to the 
		lady yourself i cant assume the 
		responsibility for keeping the boat here 
		theres no place to tie it up and then 
		you know its got a flat bottom and if the 
		sea gets a little too rough

				sandro 
			angrily
		that doesnt make any difference if we have to 
		stay well stay
 



aboard the yacht which is circling the island sandro patrizia raimondo 
and one of the sailors are peering out over the side scrutinizing the banks 
and rocky slopes in hope of finding some trace of anna the jagged cliffs 
appear enormously tall and ominous harboring tiny grottoes in which someone 
could easily hide
 
				patrizia 
		perhaps she wasnt feeling well maybe a 
		cramp or something

				sandro 
		anna is an excellent swimmer even with a 
		cramp she would have managed to reach shore 
		somehow

				patrizia 
		but you have to  consider all possibilities 
		sandro
 
incensed by her remark which he considers to be absurd sandro moves away 
from patrizia and goes towards the stern of the boat where he notices corrado 
signaling to them from a remote section of the beach
 
				corrado
			calling out
		there are some footprints around here
 
but he stops in the middle of the statement and throws up his arms to 
indicate that the discovery is really of little significance so he proceeds 
to climb back up along the pathway from which he descended and the yacht 
continues on its way
 
				sandro 
			calling from the stern excitedly
		patrizia
 
both patrizia and raimondo come rushing over to the stern and look towards 
where sandro is pointing at something dark and obscure afloat on the water up 
ahead
 
				raimondo
			to the sailor
		mariosteer the boat that way
 
the yacht heads in the direction of the black object in the water but as 
they come up close they realize it is nothing more than some wooden piece of 
furniture the turn has taken the boat slightly away from lisca bianca and 
they now find themselves closer to the little island of basiluzzo
 
				sailor 
		shall i turn back

				sandro 
		no now that were here lets have a look 
		around basiluzzo 
			then turning to patrizia 
		when we were swimming she swam out in that 
		direction 

				sailor 
		it wont be easy to find a place to go ashore
 



the first shadows of evening begin to fall over the island of lisca bianca 
the sky is now even gloomier streaked with flashes of lightning rumbling 
sounds of thunder are heard in the distance the entire group is once again 
reunited on the beach and the impending storm has heightened their fears and 
anxiety they are cold restless and exhausted but profoundly moved and 
shaken by the reality of annas strange disappearance
 
				sandro 
		lets try to be practical about this the best 
		thing to do is for all of you to go to the 
		closest island that has a police station or 
		something and report the disappearance ill 
		remain here because well i dont know 
		but it seems to me that something may turn up 
		anyway i just dont feel like leaving 

				corrado 
		then lets get started its senseless to 
		waste any more time

				patrizia
			to the sailor
		how long will it take to go there and come 
		back

				sailor 
		if theres a police station at panarea it 
		should take us a couple of hours but if we 
		have to go to lipari it will take much longer 
		then it also depends on how rough the sea is
 
giulia is about to get on her way but she stops and turns around to look for 
corrado who notices her looking at him
 
				corrado 
		ill stay here also
 
				giulia
			alarmed
		but why what if it starts to rain 

				corrado 
		if it rains ill buy myself an umbrella
 
claudia who has remained to one side wrapped up in her own thoughts 
doesnt make a move to leave sandro and corrado look at her in surprise

				corrado 
			to claudia understandingly
		claudia i know how you feel but there are 
		already two of us staying 

				sandro 
		ill go even further and say that her presence 
		here  i dont want to sound offensive  could 
		be a great hindrance
 
ignoring sandros remark claudia turns and determinedly heads towards the 
interior of the island meanwhile patrizia and giulia have gone aboard the 
yacht
 
				giulia
			calling to corrado 
			 from the boat
		do you want some blankets  and something 
		to eat
 
corrado makes an irritated gesture signifying no then together with sandro 
starts climbing up the rocky slope towards the stone hut as they meet up 
with claudia midway the first drops of rain start to fall and it is clear 
that the storm is on the verge of breaking the three of them reach the door 
of the hut and corrado tries to pull it open but the lock resists then 
sandro comes to his aid and placing their shoulders up against the wooden 
door they finally manage to force it open



inside the hut it is pitch black sandro strikes a match and finds a kerosene 
lamp on a nearby table he lights it and the room is suddenly illuminated 
revealing a miserable interior with a few broken chairs several empty boxes 
a shovel and a few other utensils over to one side is a small pile of straw 
suggesting a makeshift bed
 
				claudia 
		as far as im concerned i think shes alive 
		why even this morning that business about 
		the shark it wasnt at all true

				sandro 
		and why do you tell us this only now
 
				claudia 
		i i dont know i didnt think it was 
		worthwhile she was laughing over it 

				corrado 
		really still it remains to be seen why she 
		invented a shark what was her purpose in that 

				claudia 
			indicating sandro
		maybe youd better ask him

				corrado
			to sandro
		what were you and anna arguing about 
		excuse me for being so indiscreet but this is 
		serious

				sandro 
		nothing but the usual argument the only 
		thing was  if i remember correctly  that 
		she said she had a need to be alone

				claudia 
		and how do you explain that
 
ignoring the question sandro begins pacing back and forth across the room 
the silence is broken only by the sound of the rain outside which is now 
coming down harder and harder suddenly footsteps are heard approaching the 
hut sandro claudia and corrado quickly turn around and face the door their 
faces clearly revealing the expectation that it might be anna finally the 
door begins to open and an old man appears carrying a sack in his hand
 
				sandro 
		are you the owner of this place 

				old man 
		no the owners are in australia 

				sandro 
		but where did you come from 

				old man 
		from panarea why

				corrado 
		ah then it was you i heard a boat leaving 
		here at two oclock today

				old man 
			scratching his head
		it must have been around four or five 

				corrado 
		in the afternoon
 
				old man 
		no in the morning why whats happened

				sandro 
		nothing nothing at all

				claudia 
		but why dont you tell him 
			then turning to the old man 
		a girl who was with us has disappeared 

				old man 
		what do you mean disappeared  was she 
		drowned

				claudia 
		no she didnt drown she just disappeared 
		and nobody knows where
 
				sandro 
		and i suppose its my fault why dont you 
		tell him that too thats what you believe 
		isnt it 

				claudia 
		rather than being so occupied with my thoughts 
		you would have been better off trying to 
		understand what anna was thinking

				old man 
		have you searched in back of the house to see 
		if she might have fallen off that cliff last 
		month thats what happened to one of my 
		sheep i looked all over for it all day long 
		and it wasnt until late at night that i heard 
		it bleating it had been there the whole 
		day and was almost dead
 
claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark calling 
out desperately
 
				claudia 
		anna    anna
 
but her cries are lost in the sound of the storm drenched by the rain her 
shoes full of mud her dress soaked she stops as corrado who had followed 
after her grabs hold of her arm and leads her back to the hut
 
				corrado 
		come claudiacome back inside
 



it is early morning inside the hut and the flame of the kerosene lamp has 
dwindled down to a tiny flickering light claudia awakens with a bewildered 
look upon her face wondering where she is and how she comes to be there she 
notices corrado dozing on an empty box in a corner of the room then 
realizing that sandro and the old man are no longer there she gets up and 
goes out the door

outside everything is covered by a thick haze which is gradually beginning 
to lift sandro who is standing a short distance away from the hut hears 
claudia approaching and turns around to greet her
 
				sandro 
		are you feeling better

				claudia 
			nodding yes
		im sorry about last night please forgive me

				sandro 
		youre very fond of anna arent you
 
				claudia 
		yes very much so

				sandro 
		has she ever spoken to you about me 
	
				claudia 
		occasionally but always with affection 

				sandro 
		and yet she seemed to feel that our love for 
		her  mine yours even her fathers in a 
		certain sense  werent enough for her or 
		didnt mean much to her 

				claudia 
		i know i keep asking myself what i could have 
		done to prevent all this from happening
 
there is a pause then suddenly they both hear the sound of a motor growing 
louder and louder they look out over the shore but the haze is so heavy that 
it is impossible for them to determine the source then seeing the old man 
coming up the path sandro impulsively runs towards him and seizes him by the 
collar
 
				sandro 
		whose boat is that 

				old man
			astonished
		what boat

				sandro 
		just a moment ago didnt you hear the sound 
		of a motor

				old man 
		at this time of the year there are so many 
		boats

				sandro 
		and how come youre up so early 

				old man 
		early is four in the morning early for you
 
sandro is visibly deflated by the old mans casualness and he decides to 
abandon his questioning he turns away from him and looks up to see claudia 
walking slowly towards the top of the cliffs directly behind the hut where 
the night before the old man had said anna might have fallen she looks down 
over the side and quickly withdraws almost in fear of being sucked down into 
the swirling waters below she turns away and starts walking towards the 
interior part of the island in the rocky hollows around her she notices 
small accumulations of yesterdays rain and scooping up some of the water 
from one of these rocks she rinses her face as she gets up again sandro is 
there standing directly before her claudia is almost startled they 
continue to gaze at one another in silence then claudia abruptly turns away 
and heads towards a higher point of land a moment later sandro joins her 
again and once more they find themselves staring into each others eyes 
almost embarrassed by their own behavior yet unable to control it

the wailing siren of a police boat resounds through the air like a shrill 
lament only then do sandro and claudia detach themselves from their trance
like state from the sudden compulsion of being drawn towards each other 
through the haze they notice a landing taking place down at the shore 
realizing it is their friends returning with the police they both start 
descending the slope to greet them

stepping ashore are patrizia giulia and raimondo followed by a marshal of 
the carabinieri and two police agents as sandro and claudia come rushing 
down over the rocks claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to 
arrive on the beach simultaneously with sandro

meanwhile corrado has already gone down to the shore and as he goes out to 
meet them patrizia giulia and raimondo anxiously look to him as though 
expecting some good news but corrado remains silent then throws out his 
arms in a gesture of despair
 
				giulia 
		how did you spend the night in that hut
		and what did you have to eat 

				corrado 
		what do you think

				giulia 
		we too you know it was disastrous first at 
		panarea where there werent any boats then 
		at lipari where everybody was asleep and 
		the phone call to rome

				patrizia 
		we had to notify her father 

				corrado 
		yes that was a very good idea

				patrizia 
		hell be here sometime today 
			then turning to sandro who 
			 has just arrived on the scene 
		i also phoned my house in milan but ettore 
		had already left

				marshal
			to sandro 
		anything new develop 

				sandro 
		unfortunately no

				marshal
		very well first of all ill have them search 
		the waters around the island i brought two 
		frogmen with me meanwhile well take a look 
		up around here

				sandro 
		look marshal with those deep crevasses 
		youll need some rope and ladders 

				marshal
		dont worry weve got everything 

				sandro 
		another thing theres an old man who lives 
		here on the island

				marshal
			interrupting
		i know i know one thing at a time
  
the marshal starts climbing up towards the interior of the island with 
sandro following behind as claudia sees them coming in her direction she 
moves away to a lower section of the island to avoid coming in contact with 
sandro peering over a precipice she sees the frogmen below and watches 
them slide into the clear water like two enormous fish

sandro and the marshal have arrived on the edge of the same precipice where 
two men are lowering a rope ladder into the depths moving up further to 
watch the operations sandro becomes aware of claudia standing alone just a 
short distance away he heads towards her but she tries to avoid looking at 
him sandro however is unable to take his eyes from her and continues 
walking in her direction but seeing patrizia and raimondo approaching he 
suddenly stops a small stone accidentally loosened from the ground rolls 
along the path and comes to a halt directly in front of claudia almost like 
a message she picks it up looks at it then throws it away sandro moves 
away and heads back to the edge of the precipice

patrizia and raimondo join claudia raimondo who is carrying a box of 
crackers in his hand offers them to both claudia and patrizia
 
				patrizia 
		no who wants crackers why dont you go and 
		have some coffee made instead

meanwhile sandro has arrived at the edge of the precipice where he finds 
giulia and corrado they are looking down at one of the carabinieri who is 
dangling from a long rope over the side of the rock exploring the crevasses 
where a body might have fallen from the precipice above the marshal leans 
over to see if anything has been discovered
 
				carabiniere
			calling up to the marshal
		nothing here
 
the marshal turns around in disgust and looks at corrado who is frankly sick 
and tired of the whole operation
 
				corrado
		dont look at me like that marshal  i had 
		nothing to do with it

				patrizia 
			referring to the frogmen below
		lets hope they dont find her if they do 
		they would find her dead
 
all of a sudden claudia breaks out into tears patrizia doesnt say a word 
she just lets claudia cry knowing it will do her good sandro comes over and 
as soon as claudia sees him there she stops crying and avoids looking up at 
him
 
				sandro 
		listen patrizia the marshal says theres a 
		current that passes by here and ends up at 
		another island i dont know which he 
		wants to send one of his men over to have a 
		look one never knows do you mind if i ask 
		raimondo to go with him 

				patrizia 
		i dont see why i should mind

				claudia
			to sandro
		i think that you might go and have a look 
		yourself

				sandro 
		yes maybe that is better
 
he turns and starts heading down towards the beach
 
				patrizia
			to claudia
		what amazes me is sandro he seems so calm

				claudia
			rising
		calm he doesnt seem so to me he was 
		awake all night
 
one of the frogmen emerges with an ancient vase in his hand evidently found 
in the depths below raimondo who has just arrived with a thermos of hot 
coffee puts it down and goes over to the frogman to fetch the vase
 
				raimondo
			to the frogman
		what is it

				frogman
		an ancient vase theres a buried city under 
		here its full of this stuff
 
raimondo takes the vase and shows it to patrizia and claudia it is an 
extremely beautiful amphora in terra cotta with a figured design around it 
patrizia and claudia momentarily drop their thoughts to examine it then 
corrado who had observed the scene comes over followed immediately by 
giulia
 
				patrizia
			ironically
		come on corrado tell us what century it 
		belongs to
 
corrado smiles then comes closer to examine it claudia also kneels down to 
look at it a moment later she feels a presence at her side and even without 
turning around she knows it is sandro taking advantage of the discovery that 
was made he purposely has returned to join the group in order to be near 
claudia they both now feel between them the warmth of that contact and for 
a brief moment succumb once again to that sudden sense of wonderment which 
they already had experienced at dawn
 
				giulia 
		corrado why dont you ask them to give it to 
		us as a gift

				corrado 
		really so that you can stuff it with your 
		geraniums

				patrizia
			to sandro
		but arent you supposed to be on your way
 
claudia stricken with dismay immediately detaches herself from sandro who 
replies with a certain sense of embarrassment
 
				sandro 
		yes im going im going now


 

a patrol boat is anchored off the cliff of a small island where the current 
running through the surrounding waters comes to an end sandro is leaning 
against the wall of a dilapidated building which is constructed right on 
that part of the rock where the sea close by discharges all kinds of refuse 
four or five islanders are busy scouring through the accumulated rubbish 
they are taciturn poorly dressed people who every now and then come to blows 
over the possession of some article washed ashore by the waves sandro is 
watching them feeling distraught and melancholy one of the carabinieri who 
had accompanied him is walking up and down beside an elderly gentleman who is 
obviously one of the local gentry
 
				sandro 
			to the carabiniere
		its already two hours what are we going to 
		do

				carabiniere
		it takes about twenty to twentytwo hours for 
		the current to reach here from lisca bianca 

				elderly gentleman
		and sometimes even twentyfour depending on 
		the wind

				carabiniere
 		if the girl disappeared yesterday afternoon 
		well have to wait at least until three or four 
		oclock
 
sandro looks at them without commenting then turns and walks away towards 
the center of the village the houses and shops around the square are very 
plain and shabby sandro spots a barber shop and fingering his dayold 
beard enters for a shave

shortly thereafter a clamor of voices is heard outside and sandro comes 
dashing out of the shop seeing the islanders fighting and arguing about 
something drawn up from the sea he runs over to find out what it is  as he
arrives on the scene two policemen step out of the confusion dragging a 
large crate which they carry over to the door of a nearby shack amid the 
protests of the islanders who are still arguing and shouting among 
themselves
 
				voices
		it belongs to me we found it 

				gentleman
		back stand back
 
the two policemen set the crate down and lift the lid it is full of 
cigarettes
 
				carabiniere
			to the islanders
		you see it contains cigarettes well have to 
		confiscate it
 
the islanders react violently shouting out all sorts of epithets but the 
policemen manage to restrain them and soon the commotion is quieted down
 
				carabiniere
			to sandro
		these people are contemptible they have no 
		sense of dignity at all
 
				sandro 
			referring to the crate
		and you say that came from lisca bianca

				carabiniere
		it couldnt have come from anywhere else at 
		least somewhere from that vicinity but i 
		really cant understand it contraband 
		cigarettes on that island its the first time 
		that ever happened

				sandro 
		look id like to get back to lisca bianca 

				carabiniere
		but how could weat a time like this when we 
		just well lets at least first have a look
		around the other islands could be that 
		something might turn up there

				sandro 
			impatiently
		but even here we were supposed to find who 
		knows what and all we bring back with us is 
		a crate of cigarettes

				carabiniere
			shrugging his shoulders
		as you wish
 



at lisca bianca a helicopter is hovering above the island and preparing to 
land waiting for it to descend are claudia the old man the marshal and 
annas father just arrived from the mainland

				marshal
			 to the old man
		 is it also true that you saw no boat around
		here at lisca between yesterday and this 
		morning

				old man
		how many times do i have to tell you marshal 
		that i was at panarea

				marshal
		i believe you i believe you but im also 
		certain that youre hiding something from me i 
		can see it written all over your face and 
		you know that i have never liked your face and 
		if you want to know something that gentleman 
		over there
			indicating annas father
		whos a very important person doesnt 
		like it either so just keep that in mind 
		ill talk to you later
 
the marshal moves away from the old man and goes over towards annas father 
who is watching the helicopter come down
 
				annas father  
		i presume by this method that youll be able to 
		uncover some new clue either a handkerchief or 
		an article of clothing in other words 
		something which your men have not been able to 
		find as yet 

				marshal
		without any doubt sir if anything belonging 
		to the girl who has run away is still here on 
		this island

				annas father  
			resentfully
		allow me to inform you that my daughter is not 
		a fugitive

				marshal
		im sorry sir i didnt mean to put it that 
		way but you must understand sir that i

				annas father  
		i understand very well only i dont want any 
		rash assumptions to be made
 
one of the carabinieri appears with annas valise which he sets down on the 
ground
 
				marshal
		heres her valise sir
 
the helicopter is now a few feet above the ground and everyone steps aside 
to allow it room to land the rush of wind from the propeller sends up a 
cloud of dust and finally the helicopter touches down the propeller stops 
the door opens and out comes two large bloodhounds accompanied by a police 
attendant he immediately says something to the dogs in german which suddenly 
creates an atmosphere of resentment among the group assembled there

annas father goes to his daughters valise bends down but doesnt dare to 
touch it
 
				claudia 
		do you want me to open it 

				annas father  
		yes please
 
claudia opens the valise and starts pulling out several dresses a few 
intimate garments and several other items of clothing as she continues 
rummaging she suddenly comes upon two books fitzgeralds tender is the 
night and a copy of the bible which she hands to annas father who in turn 
examines them with great care and deliberation
 
				annas father  
		this looks to me like a good sign dont you 
		think so as far as im concerned anyone who 
		reads the bible could not have committed an act 
		of impropriety why as a matter of fact i 
		remember when i was in china many years ago i 
		happened to be involved in a similar situation 
		concerning an english woman the wife of 
		ambassador shafford a good friend of mine 
		there too we found a bible and i said at 
		the time that whatever had happened that clue 
		alone had definitely ruled out the possibility 
		of suicide why it was logical i said 
		that whoever reads the bible believes in god 
		and therefore
			then turning to claudia in an 
			 almost supplicating tone of voice 
		no you dont believe it well as a matter of 
		fact i was right the woman was found two 
		days later it was a case of amnesia

				marshal
		sir if you have no objections may we start 
		the search
 
annas father turns around to look at the bloodhounds who are already 
sniffing the air for a scent and anxious to get on with the hunt then he 
throws a quick glance at his daughters valise once more and with an air of 
disgust and irritation walks off in a huff followed by claudia
 

				attendant
			to the marshal
		get everybody out of the way

				marshal
		okay ill send them down to that part of the 
		beach over there
 
after they all have left the area the attendant leads the two bloodhounds 
over to annas valise instructs them to pick up the scent then takes them 
up to the very top of the island where he subsequently unties them from his 
leash and sets them off

claudia and annas father arrive on the beach where patrizia giulia 
corrado raimondo and one of the sailors are seated on a pile of rocks

as the dogs begin running in different directions over the island trying to 
track down the scent from annas valise the entire group remains silent 
awaiting the outcome of the search suddenly the bloodhounds come racing 
down the slope heading directly towards the beach where they are gathered 
apparently hot on the trail of some familiar scent to everybodys amazement 
the dogs stop in front of claudia jumping excitedly and barking at her as 
though they had found their prey claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified 
with fear she turns around and sees the others all staring at her but she 
cannot understand why they are looking at her that way nor why the dogs have 
stopped right in front of her then as if struck by a sudden flash of 
memory she touches her dress and cries out
 
				claudia 
		its because of this the dress its 
		because of this dress anna gave it to me 
		yesterday right after the swim
 
completely relieved claudia smiles and bends over to pet the dogs as the 
attendant comes up to them and ties the leash back on to their necks then he 
leads them away and heads once again upthe slope towards the top of the 
island annas father seems almost disillusioned by the negative results of 
the search corrado also feels dissatisfied and addressing himself to the 
marshal says
 
				corrado 
		and what are we going to do now 

				marshal
		well try again

				patrizia 
		but is it really necessary those two 
		beasts how absurd
 
meanwhile the patrol boat has returned and is pulling ashore giulia is the 
first one to notice its arrival and she calls out to the others that sandro 
is back then she goes over to where annas father is standing
 
				giulia 
		sandros here

				annas father 
			coldly
		i dont know him 

				giulia 
		it seems to me that at a moment like this 

				annas father  
		i dont want to know him
  
by this time sandro has come ashore followed by the carabiniere and 
immediately goes up to claudia
 
				sandro 
		claudia listen  claudia
 
but claudia hardly looks at him and seeing corrado approaching she moves 
away from sandro 

				corrado 
			to sandro
		i didnt think youd be back so early

				carabiniere
			interrupting
		we didnt check the other islands so

				corrado 
		and why didnt you go there

				carabiniere
			referring to sandro
		he wanted to come back
 
the sailors have unloaded the crate of cigarettes from the patrol boat and 
the marshal is getting all the details from the carabiniere
 
				marshal
		up until now those smugglers were operating 
		only around the palermo area this will be a 
		nice surprise for the lieutenant in milazzo 
		call up headquarters bring them up to date and 
		have them give you instructions on what to do 
		with this crate

				corrado 
		so the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might 
		have also been that of these smugglers could it 
		be possible then that anna

				marshal
			evading corrados question 
			 and pursuing his own thoughts
		i wonder where they could have unloaded the 
		stuff  maybe right here at lisca 

				corrado 
		i was saying it might even be possible that 
		anna had left with them

				marshal
		but for what reason would she have wanted to go 
		away

				corrado 
		listen marshal as for there being reasons 
		for going away anyone of us might have three 
		thousand of them so you can assume that she 
		had them what i want to know is it possible 
		that the smugglers might have taken her aboard 

				marshal
		i think its possible

				a sailor 
			calling from the patrol boat
		marshal headquarters is calling they have 
		an important message
 
				marshal
		what is it about

				sailor 
		theyve stopped a suspiciouslooking boat a 
		few miles from here yesterday afternoon the 
		crew has been taken to milazzo for questioning
 
the marshal takes off for the patrol boat and corrado goes over to annas 
father
 
				corrado 
		did you hear that what do you plan on doing

				annas father 
			resignedly 
		we are in the hands of god 

				sandro 
		thats truebut in the meantime as far as 
		im concerned its absolutely necessary to go 
		to milazzo 
			directly to annas father
		i know that you have no desire to meet me and 
		i shall take pains not to impose myself upon 
		you but besides you i am the closest person 
		to your daughter

				annas father  
		however that may be at this moment my daughter 
		has more need of her father than of you 

				sandro 
		pardon me for being so frank but there are 
		certain things that a father  especially a 
		father like you cannot understand so dont 
		be stubborn im coming with you
 
as soon as he finishes saying this sandro turns around and looks at claudia 
as though he had just now realized that she was there listening to him 
claudia goes to the gangplank and boards the yacht disappearing into the 
cabin having followed her with his gaze sandro then turns to patrizia
 
				sandro 
		patrizia what are you going to do 

				patrizia 
		what do you want us to do i dont know 
		myself but well do something 

				sandro 
		ill go and get my valise
 
sandro goes aboard the yacht and enters the cabin on the way to his room he 
meets claudia who has just changed clothes and is about to return ashore 
they stare at each other for a moment without saying anything but the 
intensity in claudias look mixed with fear and desire is so overpowering 
that sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her claudia immediately 
releases herself from his embrace but for the moment it lasted the kiss was 
full and  passionate  then she turns and goes out on deck sandro remains 
there momentarily stunned then picks up his valise and returns ashore

as claudia followed by sandro steps back on the beach she is met by 
patrizia
 
				patrizia 
		weve decided to go to montaldos place in 
		fact ettore should already be there

				sandro 
 			intervening
		good then ill meet you there
 
he says this primarily for claudias sake hoping to catch her eye but she 
keeps her head bowed low and doesnt look up after a moment of hesitation 
sandro turns away and heads towards the small motorboat in which annas 
father arrived from the mainland and without saying another word he climbs 
aboard patrizia places her arm around claudias waist and together they 
start walking towards the yacht but upon reaching the foot of the gangplank 
claudia stops
 
				claudia 
		im going with the patrol boat to make a tour 
		around the islands 

				patrizia 
		to do what

				claudia 
		i just cant leave without first searching 
		those islands one by one

				patrizia 
		but arent you tired i can just about manage 
		to stand on my feet 
			then turning around to look 
			 for raimondo she calls out 
		raimondo 

				raimondo 
		here i am patrizia im always here 

				patrizia 
		claudia isnt coming with us will you please 
		take care of her luggage thanks
 
raimondo goes aboard the yacht and returns with claudias valise he consigns 
it to one of the carabinieri who in turn takes it aboard the patrol boat 
claudia follows him aboard the marshal comes out of the radio room steps 
ashore then joins sandro and annas father on the motorboat while patrizia 
giulia corrado and raimondo go aboard the yacht


 

in the seaport town of milazzo on the sicilian mainland sandro and annas 
father are seated in an office at police headquarters  the sailors picked up 
on a charge of carrying contraband are being questioned by the police 
lieutenant
 
				sailor 
		no sir lieutenant we werent even able to 
		drop anchor once  the sea was too rough
 
the lieutenant motions for the sailor to come up to the desk then points to 
a sheet of paper in front of him
 
				lieutenant
		okay just sign here 
			turning to a guard 
			 standing at the door 
		have the next one come in hes the last 
		isnt he
 
another sailor enters and timidly approaches the lieutenants desk he is 
rather young and his face is completely bronzed by the sun
  
				lieutenant
		they tell me you have a lot of trouble at home 
		is that right
 
				young sailor 
		yes sir my sister is sick and my 
		father too

				lieutenant
		so thats why youve turned to smuggling eh 
		you need the money now i can help you i can 
		see that you get some assistance from the 
		government but first theres a little 
		formality weve got to take care of just a 
		few questions and then we can all go to 
		lunch your friend tells me you dropped 
		anchor three times
 
the sailor starts as though taken by surprise then quickly answers
 
				young sailor 
		yes sir three times

				lieutenant
			to sandro and annas father
		now were getting somewhere theyre beginning 
		to contradict each other 
			then facing the sailor again 
		now look here your friend just swore to me 
		that you werent able to do any fishing at all 
		because the sea was too rough and what about 
		the other boat 

				young sailor 
		what other boat

				lieutenant
		now look my men saw it and they also saw you 
		men throwing those crates overboard what have 
		you got to say about that

				young sailor 
			stuttering 
		i  i  wasnt feeling well  i i was 
		sleeping i dont know anything  i  
		im all mixed up and 
 
sandro is unable to control himself any longer he gets up walks over to the 
sailor and yells in his face
 
				sandro 
		but what are you saying what are you 
		saying
 
the lieutenant motions to sandro to be quiet then calmly rises from his desk 
and continues
 
				lieutenant
		now look here im ready to forget the whole 
		thing the cigarettes the contraband 
		everything if you would only tell me you or 
		your friends whether the girl was aboard 
		your boat and how far she went
 
they all remain silent the lieutenant motions to the guard who then leads 
the sailors out of the office
 
				lieutenant
			to annas father
		just as i thought even if you caught them in 
		the act theyd deny it they always deny 
		everything and then in this case if they 
		were to admit having had the girl aboard it 
		would mean theyd be admitting to the charge 
		of carrying contraband oh its easy to say 
		talk but if they did talk the following 
		morning youd find them cold dead in front of 
		their doorstep

				annas father  
		i think it would be worth my while to take a 
		run over to palermo the chief of police there 
		is a very good friend of mine and im sure 
		hell do whatever he can i feel were wasting 
		our time here excuse me lieutenant i hope 
		we see each other again under better 
		circumstances and thanks for everything
 
bidding goodbye to the lieutenant annas father leaves without looking at 
sandro a moment later sandro folds the newspaper he was reading tucks it 
under his arm and starts heading towards the door
 
				lieutenant
		at any rate well continue investigating i 
		know that headquarters has sent out an alarm to 
		all areas

				sandro
			showing the newspaper 
			 to the lieutenant
		tell me lieutenant do you happen to know this 
		fz who wrote this article here
 
the lieutenant takes a look at the paper which carries a twocolumn story 
headed disappearance of a roman tourist at lisca bianca
 
				lieutenant
		thats francesco zuria hes the news 
		correspondent

				sandro 
		where can we locate him dont you think that 
		by offering a reward to anyone who can give us 
		some information


				lieutenant
		zuria is in messina you might try him shall 
		we phone him
 
from the opposite end of the corridor through which sandro and the lieutenant 
are walking appears the sergeant who was in charge of the patrol boat on 
which claudia toured the islands in search of anna after saluting his 
superior the sergeant says
 
				sergeant
		have you any instructions for me lieutenant 
		may i return to lipari

				lieutenant
		yes with whom did you leave the crate of 
		cigarettes

				sergeant
		i left it at the warehouse
 
the sergeant again salutes his superior then continues on his way along the 
corridor sandro abruptly turns around and follows after him
 
				sandro 
		pardon me sergeant but when did you get back

				sergeant
		about two hours ago

				sandro 
		and the young lady who was with you 

				sergeant
		i dont know she said she had to catch a 
		train
 
sandro remains a while absorbed in his thoughts then hurriedly leaves the 
building and heads towards the station
 



on her way to the waiting room of the station claudia purchases a newspaper 
then goes over to an empty bench and sits down turning to the local news 
section she suddenly comes upon the article announcing annas disappearance

a moment later sandro appears at the door claudia looks up at him but 
doesnt say a word he walks over and sits down beside her
 
				sandro 
		where are you going to montaldos 

				claudia 
		yes

				sandro 
		then ill go with you
 
there is a moment of silence then claudia shows him the newspaper article
 
				claudia 
		have you read it theyre asking for anyone 
		with information to get in touch with them 

				sandro 
		yes i had also thought of going there to talk 
		with them

				claudia 
		yes you should go 

				sandro 
		but then when will we see each other
 
claudia looks at him imploringly intent on making him understand without 
having to tell him outright that it is not a question of their seeing each 
other sandro of course does realize and suddenly springs to his feet and 
nervously begins pacing back and forth across the waiting room claudia in 
turn also rises and goes over to him
 
				claudia 
		i know its difficult but if you go on like 
		this it will become even more difficult
 
the bell announcing the trains arrival is sounded sandro turns around and 
faces claudia almost with a sense of helpless despair
 
				claudia 
		please dont look so solemn and dont wait 
		for the train to come in
 
but sandro doesnt move and again claudia insists imploring him not to 
stay although she realizes full well that this may mean a final goodbye
 
				claudia 
		please please leave i dont want to look out 
		of the window and wave to you with a 
		handkerchief
 
sandro still doesnt move and is about to say something but claudia looks 
at him so pleadingly and with such a determined expression that he finally 
succumbs and starts walking towards the exit behind the train tracks

the train has just pulled into the station the platform is completely empty 
and claudia is the only one to board the train she climbs up the steps and 
the door is closed behind her a second later she appears at the window 
looks out briefly then disappears into her compartment the station master 
raises the signal for the engine to start a short whistle is heard and soon 
the train gets under way

sandro dashes out across the tracks swings open one of the doors and boards 
the train as it picks up speed and pulls away from the station

claudia is seated in a corner near the window looking out she appears 
completely relaxed and totally drained of energy fatigued after so much 
tension after a few seconds she turns around and is abruptly startled to 
see sandro standing nearby in the corridor he comes over to her compartment 
and takes a seat directly opposite to hers claudia is absolutely furious
 
				claudia 
		go ahead now say something i want to know 
		just what it is we have to say to each other
 
sandro remains silent waiting for claudia to settle down and calm herself 
but she continues to reproach him
 
				claudia 
		sandro i dont want you to come with me i 
		dont want to see you how can i make it 
		clear to youwhy did you come

				sandro 
		i dont know why i just couldnt help it
 
				claudia 
		but sooner or later weve got to end this 
		relationship and its better to do it right 
		now 

				sandro 
		i have no desire to sacrifice myself its 
		idiotic to sacrifice oneself why for 
		whom if anna were here i might understand your 
		scruples but shes not

				claudia 
			deeply wounded
		oh sandro 

				sandro 
		im sorry i didnt want to sound cynical but 
		isnt it better to look things squarely in the 
		eye

				claudia 
		for me they are exactly as they were when we 
		met three days ago  just three days ago
		dont you realize and you and anna no i 
		guess they arent like that any more my god 
		is it possible to forget in such a short time 
		for things to change so quickly 

				sandro 
		it takes even less

				claudia 
		but its so sad so terribly sad im not used 
		to it im not ready for it you know i 
		have never been so upset in my life sandro 
		why dont you help me 

				sandro 
		i think the only way to help ourselves claudia 
		is for us to be together

				claudia 
		no im sure it wont move over there lets 
		make believe nothing happened and when we get 
		to the next station get off 

				sandro 
		and what about you

				claudia 
		me i i please leave me alone
 
suddenly she stands up and goes into the corridor the car is of an old type 
 one half is first class the other second claudia stops in front of a 
secondclass compartment from which the sound of two voices is heard one is 
that of a woman  sweet very delicate and very feminine the other is that 
of a man with a sicilian accent sandro joins claudia standing there 
together they hear the conversation
 
				womans voice  
		i work there but im really a stranger 

				mans voice  
		i tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you 
		and she has often spoken to me about you

				womans voice  
		and who is she does she work in catania
 
				mans voice  
		yes she takes care of the garden 

				womans voice  
		then its impossible for her to know me in the 
		villa where im at we have a male gardener 

				mans voice  
		so thats logical you see both being 
		gardeners they spoke about you to one another 

				womans voice  
		and what did they say about me 

				mans voice  
		they told me that you were a very nice girl 
		that you always mind your business in other 
		words things of that sort
 
there is a moment of silence then the sound of music is heard coming from 
the compartment claudia and sandro look at one another with a smile on their 
faces then claudia leans over to peek into the compartment the woman is 
young she has thick wavy brown hair  he is one of those typical seducers 
from the provinces with black hair there is a tiny radio between them 
sandro also takes a peek into the compartment then they withdraw as the two 
resume their conversation
 
				womans voice  
		we have a radio like this too 

				mans voice  
		no not like this one

				womans voice  
		and why wouldnt we have one like this

				mans voice  
		because this is a chinese radio
 
another pause sandro takes hold of claudias hand and presses it she 
doesnt resist but allows him to do it
 
				womans voice  
		certainly a radio this small is very practical 
		its especially useful for i dont know 
		for traveling

				mans voice  
		but for you what comes first music or love
 
claudia presses up close to sandro amused and at the same time obviously 
moved
 
				womans voice  
		music of course to get a sweetheart one has 
		to look around but to get a radio all you 
		have to do is buy one

				mans voice  
		ah no for me love comes first im a man 
		and i know whats what first love and then 
		music
 
claudia laughs but she is still very upset all of a sudden she starts and 
looks out the little window the train is coming into a station and is 
beginning to slow down claudia grabs sandro by the sleeve and pulls him 
through the corridor sandro tries to resist
 
				sandro 
		claudia listen to me

				claudia 
		no sandro please i ask you as a favor
 
she continues to drag him through the corridor until they finally reach the 
platform then she opens the door they are both highly emotional claudia is 
almost hysterical
 
				claudia 
		promise that you wont try to look for me 
		you shouldnt try to look for me any more 

				sandro 
		but why claudia why
 
sandro tries to grab her in his arms but claudia pushes him away almost 
with a sense of violence as though she were afraid she might change her mind 
once in his arms in the meantime the train has come to a stop in the 
station sandro pauses to look at claudia once more
 
				sandro 
		even if you chase me away i claudia lets 
		not wait any longer after it will be too 
		late  come with me
 
claudia is visibly battling with herself then in one last moment of 
decision she pushes sandro towards the door and goes back into the car
 
once on the ground sandro walks back and forth along the platform to see if 
he can find claudia hoping she might look out the window to wave goodbye 
but she doesnt appear the train starts to move as sandro desperately tries 
to catch a glimpse of claudia but she is not to be seen sandro starts 
running along the platform but the train is now going too fast he stops  
angry disappointed and upset
 



at the entranceway of a luxurious villa claudia who has just arrived is 
greeted by the princess she is an elderly woman rather ordinary in 
appearance but very aristocratic in taste and manner
 
				princess  
		did you have a good trip it is such a 
		magnificent day i am very happy that sicily is 
		able to give you so warm a welcome and you do 
		deserve it youre such a lovely blonde come 
		my dear
 
claudia smiles and follows the princess into the garden
 
				princess  
		and where are you from 

				claudia 
		from rome

				princess
		oh how nice so youre from rome and would 
		you happen to know of some intelligent 
		clergyman in rome who might be willing to come 
		here and stay with us we have our own private 
		little chapel it is a masterpiece with 
		seventeenthcentury frescoes and the 
		remains of all our dead ancestors a wonderful 
		collection he would find it very convenient 
		there and could say his own masses then he 
		would have to spend a little time with my 
		husband who never sees anyone to keep him 
		occupied

				claudia 
		an intelligent clergyman princess but i 
		think the intelligent clergymen of today have 
		so many other things to do

				princess 
		well perhaps one with a little physical 
		handicap one who is slightly lame for 
		example
 
in the meantime they have arrived at a shady alcove where seated in various 
wicker lounge chairs are patrizia giulia and a young man dressed in simple 
casual clothes the first one to notice claudia and to greet her with warm 
cordiality is giulia
 
				giulia 
		well finally we were beginning to get worried 
		about you too
 
claudia plunks herself down in one of the lounge chairs next to patrizia the 
young man rises and bows slightly
 
				patrizia 
		but where did you finally end up 

				claudia 
		it was futile we went all over
 
there is a moment of silence the thought of anna returns to weigh on the 
group claudia pours herself an orange drink from a pitcher on the table 
beside her
 
				claudia 
			referring to anna 
		but why does she do these things 
			she takes a sip from 
			 her glass then rises 
		i cant stand it any more
 
she takes a few steps looks around at the villa and at the other end of the 
alcove sees corrado and ettore saying goodbye to a pair of elderly gentlemen
 
				giulia 
			to corrado and ettore
		but how can you carry on a discussion in this 
		heat

				corrado 
		when one approaches fifty my dear he is 
		affected only by the cold

				ettore
			noticing claudia
		and who is this 

				patrizia 
		this is claudia annas friend
			to claudia 
		youve never met my husband have you
 
ettore immediately recalls claudias name from a previous conversation that 
was apparently held before she arrived
 
				ettore  
		by the way have you phoned him
 
				corrado 
		you mean sandro i told you already hes not 
		in at least hes not at the hotel

				ettore  
		now look what has to go and happen at a time 
		when ill be needing him how can we discuss 
		things when we lack dates and figures 

				patrizia 
		but didnt he say he was coming here
 
now with all this talk about sandro the sense of relaxation claudia had 
felt upon her arrival has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes 
more and more noticeable

				ettore  
		well what are you all waiting for send a car 
		out to get him he cant be more than a couple 
		of hundred miles away

				giulia 
		to me the fact that hasnt shown up is a good 
		sign do you want to bet that hes found anna 

				ettore  
		maybe but do you know that forty thousand 
		persons a year disappear in italy without 
		leaving a single trace behind them forty 
		thousand almost as much as the entire 
		population of san siro raimondo will you go 
		and see if you can locate sandro 

				raimondo 
		okay
 
a gong announcing lunch resounds throughout the garden
 
				patrizia 
		first let the poor thing have something to eat 

				ettore  
		it wouldnt really do you any harm to skip a 
		meal

				princess  
		ive never met this sandro what kind of a 
		person is he he couldnt have done her in 
		himself by any chance

				ettore
			breaking out into a loud laugh
		sandro oh sure i can see sandro calling
		anna over to him and saying listen anna i 
		intend to get rid of you but since its so 
		painful and complicated and besides i 
		dont happen to have a gun on me why dont 
		you do me a favor and get rid of yourself on 
		your own
 
there is a moment of complete dead silence during which the same disturbing 
thought flashes across the minds of all those who are present like a sudden 
revelation
 
				giulia 
		my god how could we joke over something like 
		that we should be ashamed of ourselves 

				princess 
			rising
		come on lets go
 
they all get up except claudia she is left so completely shaken by the 
conversation by the thought that it seems she no longer has the strength to 
move giulia after giving corrado a defiant look turns and smiles at the 
young man who had stopped to wait for her
 
				giulia
			to claudia referring 
			 to the young man
		goffredo is the princess nephew hes 
		eighteen years old the lucky boy and what do 
		you know  he paints 

				goffredo 
		anybody can hold a brush in his hand all you 
		need is to buy some oils and start painting 
		even rembrandt did the same
 
giulia laughs with a strange sense of excitement then takes goffredo by the 
arm and leaves claudia remains alone she watches the group heading towards 
the house  giulia holding tight to  goffredo ettore  to patrizia their 
voices are heard somewhat unclear
 
				ettore  
		but where is the prince is he well 

				princess  
		the last time i saw him the day before 
		yesterday it seemed he was well

				ettore  
		princess why dont you sell this villa i 
		would turn it into a lovely psychiatric clinic 

				princess  
		its a little like that already

finally even claudia starts moving slowly behind the others but she is 
still very much upset
 



a crowd of people that keeps growing and growing from one moment to the next 
is gathered in one of the main streets of messina in front of a mens store 
with its shutters halfshut the local police are unable to control the flow 
of traffic which has been blocked as a result of the crowd the cars are 
packed close to one another raising a great din with their horns the throng 
is composed chiefly of young men pushing and climbing over each other to get 
near the shop to see inside sandro tries to make his way through the crowd 
in an attempt to get up close himself but the confusion is so great that he 
finds the going very difficult remarks and comments are heard above the 
noise
 
				first young man
		who is it sophia loren 

				second young man
		oh no its some model from turin with a 
		lowcut dress

				other voices
		its queen saroya i saw her so who 
		could it be

				third young man
		theyve torn her dress shes almost nude 
		she ran into the shop to hide herself
 
a police siren is heard from afar then before long it fills the air and 
dominates every other sound  an alfa romeo pulls up followed by a police 
wagon full of policemen both vehicles maneuver their way through the crowd 
like snakes through a jungle and stop right in front of the shop sandro 
takes advantage of the opening created by the two cars and thus finds himself 
a few steps away from the door bending over in order to see through the 
small space left open by the halfdrawn shutters he notices several 
newspapermen and photographers
 
				sandro
			to one of the newspapermen 
		which one of you is zuria

				newspaperman
		hes inside
 
meanwhile the policemen have come out of the wagon and arrive at the door of 
the shop with the chief of police leading the way one of them raises the 
shutter and the crowd which has backed away slightly at the insistence of 
the police begins pressing forward threateningly soon pandemonium breaks 
loose in the confusion sandro manages to get inside the store along with 
the policemen and two photographers the shutter is again lowered just a few 
inches behind him
 
standing in the middle of the shop is a most charming and provocative young 
brunette with tightfitting pants and a blouse that is open almost from the 
neck to the waist she is wearing nothing under her blouse so that with 
every movement of her body one cannot help catching a glimpse of her naked 
breasts as the policemen come forward she receives them with a smile 
sandro asks one of the journalists standing nearby if he can tell him which 
one of them is zuria  the journalist points to a man who is only a few steps 
away  a man not very old but who has a ravaged face and whose hair is 
almost completely white
 
				sandro 
		zuria

				zuria  
		yes until proven otherwise 

				sandro 
		i would like to ask you something 

				zuria  
		wait a moment cant you see im busy
 
everybody is gathered around the chief of police and the girl the store 
clerks are looking at her admiringly the manager most upset is explaining 
the situation to the chief of police
 
				manager
		i phoned you chief because in view of the 
		situation i thought it best
 
the girl interrupts him she has a very selfsatisfied look on her face
 
				girl
		i came down here to buy a foulard suddenly 
		i realized that little by little directly 
		behind me i was being followed by so many 
		men and more and more of them kept coming
 
				chief of police
		well i should think so dressed like that

				girl
		but i have always gone around like this 
		everywhere in the world nothing like this has 
		ever happened to me before
 
zuria turns to sandro and clears his throat outside the crowd becomes very 
noisy
 
				zuria
			to the girl 
		how old are you

				girl
		nineteen my name is gloria perkins im 
		married and a writer by profession i write in 
		a trance almost always in contact with people 
		who are dead tolstoi for example or 
		shakespeare but the movies also interest me
 
zuria nods to sandro as if to say now watch this
 
				zuria  
		how do you find the men of messina are you 
		shocked by their warm display of friendliness 

				girl
		no why should i be shocked were in italy 
		not finland

				zuria  
		and how were you received in palermo
 
the girl turns around and looks down at zuria with contempt but she manages 
to remain calm
 
				girl
		in palermo i was with my husband now im 
		going to capri to write an article for the 
		tourist office
 
zuria clears his throat again and whispers to sandro
 
				zuria  
		she did exactly the same thing in palermo 

				chief of police
			to the girl 
		if you want to go back to your hotel were 
		ready to escort you                   

				girl
		oh yes thank you 
 
photographer snaps a flash photo the girl immediately strikes a pose other 
flashes follow the clerks ask for her autograph one of the policemen raises 
the shutter the girl comes forward smiling and is greeted with a certain 
kind of roar from the crowd the group leaves the shop sandro and zuria also 
come out the girl ushered out by the policemen climbs into the alfa romeo 
the guard holds the crowd back there are more camera flashes more smiles 
from the pretty stranger finally the car pulls out followed by the police 
wagon sandro and zuria watch the car disappear through the crowd which 
starts to disperse the din however is still enormous due to the 
unsnarling of the traffic jam
 
				zuria  
		do you like her
 
sandro shrugs his shoulders somewhat surprised by the journalists question
 
				zuria  
		she costs a hundred thousand lire 

				sandro 
		youre kidding

				zuria  
		no im not why do you think she does all 
		this its one of the many ways she can put 
		herself on display when you bait the trap the 
		mouse will snap to tell you the truth  if it 
		wasnt for the fact that one hundred thousand 
		lire represents my whole months salary well
		but you had something you wanted to ask me
 
sandro is still looking at the journalist with a sense of incredulity almost 
as if he felt zurias conversation was something out of this world but he is 
brought back to reality by zurias last remark which is made as the 
journalist starts walking at a very hurried pace
 
				sandro 
		i read one of your articles regarding the 
		disappearance of a girl im that girls fianc

				zuria  
		oh im sorry i have to rush but ive got to 
		write a story about this thing that just 
		happened tell me exactly how it all turned 
		out

				sandro 
			impatiently
		now listen if i had any information i 
		wouldnt have come here to ask you but i see 
		that you too lack any information 
 
the journalist casts a sidewards glance at sandro he is a bitter and 
sarcastic man one who is completely absorbed with his own little problems 
and his own daily routine but for this very reason he is quite capable of 
taking any kind of insult either big or small
 
				zuria  
		as a matter of fact ive already had several 
		phone calls on that article one said they had 
		seen the missing girl in an automobile 
		somewhere in rome another one said they saw 
		her on the pier talking with some strange 
		sailors could be she secretly left the 
		island by boat
 
				sandro 
		is that possible

				zuria  
		who knows another one has it that she 
		entered a store in troina this information 
		comes from the storekeeper himself who stated 
		that such and such a girl had bought i dont 
		know what in his store at troina

				sandro 
		is that far from here

				zuria  
		about fifty miles or so if you want ill give 
		you the name of the storekeeper
 
				sandro 
		yes of course but you should also print 
		that in your paper but right away tomorrow 
		morning its the local palermo paper isnt 
		it i mean its widely read

				zuria  
		yes but why do you think our readers would be
		interested in such news now even if i sent it 
		the editors wouldnt print it

				sandro 
		you really must do me this one favor 

				zuria  
		pardon me but why must i do you a favor 
			
				sandro 
		then lets call it a business proposition 
		something to round out your salary
 
the journalist clears his throat without answering then he grabs sandro by 
the arm and takes him back to the other side of the street where a few 
people left over from the crowd are still discussing the incident that just 
took place as they gradually drift away from the scene the traffic is now 
back to normal
 



at the princess villa claudia is in her room applying some fresh makeup 
in front of a small dressing table although she appears thoroughly engrossed 
in all the minute details of her makeup nevertheless she seems 
considerably  interested in any sound that comes through her window

the rumble of a motor is heard claudia runs to the window and looks out into 
the garden a dark car pulls up in front of the service entrance a uniformed 
chauffeur gets out of the car and enters the house carrying a package under 
his arm there is an obvious look of disappointment on claudias face she is 
about to return to the dressing table when she notices there in the garden 
giulia heading towards the house accompanied by the young prince goffredo 
claudia is profoundly shocked by giulias behavior as she laughs jokes 
bends over to pick up some flowers and skips along unashamedly

in the meantime patrizia has entered the room with two wigs one of which 
she is wearing and the other in her hand she also has on a cocktail dress 
but one that is more elaborate than claudias patrizia immediately goes up 
to the mirror of the dressing table and while she finishes arranging the wig 
on her head says to her friend
 
				patrizia 
		are you ready im not thats all we needed  
		a cocktail party the vitality some people 
		have irritates me 
			indicating the wig on her head
		how does it look
 
claudia who has meanwhile tried on the other wig and is looking at herself 
in the mirror turns around to patrizia
 
				claudia
			ironically
		its divine 

				patrizia 
		you say that just to flatter me 

				claudia 
		do you consider that a compliment 

				patrizia 
		no
 
the two of them burst out laughing and together they leave the room then 
after a few steps through the corridor they separate with a friendly gesture 
towards each other patrizia goes into her room while claudia prepares to 
descend the wide stairway coming up the same stairway are giulia and the 
young prince goffredo  there is something of an embarrassing moment between 
them then giulia aware of claudias presence detaches herself from 
goffredo and as they reach the top of the stairs she comes over to claudia 
and takes her by the wrist in order to confide with her more intimately
 
				giulia 
		he wants to show me his paintings he wont 
		let go  of me  anymore  poor thing he must 
		have a crush on me
 
she laughs with an obvious sense of amusement but she is also tickled by her 
own vanity claudia looks at her without knowing what to say to her
 
				giulia 
			even more excited
		please you come too 

				claudia 
		but for what reason should i come there 

				giulia 
		please do come dont leave me alone with 
		him hes capable of i dont know have 
		you noticed his eyes
 
claudia resigns herself to escorting giulia to the floor up above the very 
top of the stairway leads to an attic where goffredo is leaning over the 
railing looking down
 
				goffredo  
		giulia 

				giulia 
		here i am
 
seeing the two of them arriving together the young prince feels 
disappointed but he knows he has to cover his intentions with a show of good 
manners when the two women reach the top of the stairs he bows to claudia 
in a most respectful fashion then he leads them down a low and narrow 
corridor to a door they pass through
 
the attic is bright and spacious with slanted roof and two huge windows it 
is filled with paintings easels canvases brushes and oils as soon as 
giulia enters the studio she moves away from claudia and attaches herself to 
the young prince who is setting up one of his paintings on an easel beside 
one of the windows claudia looks around the room with a sense of 
indifference going over to the window she looks out and sees a vast 
panorama of the countryside 

giulia looks at the painting with a certain amount of surprise it is a 
picture of a nude woman a shapely figure slightly plump in the manner of 
renoir
 
				giulia 
		claudia come and see its a nude
 
claudia is looking through the paintings that lean up against the wall face 
backwards she turns one around a nude woman a second another nude woman 
a third the same
 
				claudia 
		theyre all nudes if im not mistaken 

				giulia 
			to goffredo
		but why all nudes

				goffredo  
		because there is no landscape as beautiful as a 
		woman

				giulia 
		and where do you find the models 

				goffredo  
		oh there are as many as one wants 

				giulia 
			turning to claudia
		i thought the model was something obsolete 
		nowadays didnt you claudia
 
claudia goes back to look out the window a group of flying birds swoops down 
to land directly under the roof the birds settle themselves in a little nest 
directly in front of the window claudia bends over to get a better look and 
is actually able to see the little nest as she hears behind her the exchange 
of remarks between giulia and the young prince
 
				goffredo  
		its strange how anxious women are to display 
		themselves its almost a natural inclination 

				giulia 
		but how could they pose like that i couldnt 

				goffredo  
			with a grave youthful sensuality
		why dont you try

				giulia 
		me goffredo youre mad 
			turning to claudia 
		hes mad

				claudia 
		not really
 
claudia moves away from the window and continues to look at giulia and 
goffredo with a deep sense of amazement giulia is euphoric kittenish and 
trembling with excitement goffredo is firm resolute and serious
 
				giulia 
		dont you ever paint men

				goffredo  
		answer me why dont you try posing ill paint 
		you a beautiful portrait

				giulia 
		but why me ask claudia shes much more 
		beautiful than me

				goffredo  
			insistent
		but i want to paint you you appeal to me more

				giulia 
			timidly
		i appeal to you more
 
giulia glances over at claudia who is still preoccupied looking out of the 
window then screws up her courage and boldly advances towards goffredo 
making her intentions clearly understood goffredo immediately responds to 
her invitation and draws himself close up against her there is a moment of 
hesitation then a kiss  awkward but passionately violent giulia on her 
part is completely shameless claudia turns around exactly at that moment 
when the two of them are caught up in a feverish embrace she looks at them 
completely dumbfounded then takes a few steps forward as though she doesnt 
believe her own eyes
 
				claudia
			almost unconsciously 
		giulia
 
giulia quickly turns around her face is flushed with excitement but also 
with an expression that seems somewhat triumphant before anybody has a 
chance to say anything she heads towards the door swings it open and stands 
firmly on the threshold  obviously intent on telling claudia to leave in 
fact claudia doesnt wait to be told but immediately walks out into the 
hallway
 
				giulia 
		and tell corrado too that im here if he 
		wants me you can also tell him that my tiny 
		little heart is beating like mad and that at 
		this moment its the only thing that interests 
		me is that clear 

				claudia 
		it couldnt be any clearer
 
giulia takes a few steps backward into the room and seeing claudia still 
there looking at her strangely exclaims
 
				giulia 
		now what do i have to do to be left in peace 

				claudia 
		i think all you have to do giulia is to close 
		the door
 
and with a violent bang that leaves claudia startled giulia slams the door 
shut claudia remains standing there for a moment still very much amazed 
but she is aroused from her stupor by the sound of a car pulling into the 
courtyard then she rapidly starts descending the stairs
 
claudia has reached the hallway leading out to the garden and is anxiously 
waiting there looking at the car that has just arrived but she is not able 
to distinguish exactly who it is and her view is also blocked by ettore and 
corrado who have just come out of the house and are now standing in front of 
the car so she walks out to the garden and joins the group a certain look 
of disappointment spreads over her face as she sees only raimondo come out of 
the car evidently sandro has not been located
 
				raimondo 
		hes not at the hotel and he probably wasnt 
		even in milazzo the room clerk said he rented 
		a car
 
claudia moves away from the group as though she has heard enough she goes 
over to lean against an enormous vase standing there on the side her hands 
are trembling in back of her she hears the sounds of the others voices but 
cannot distinguish what they are saying then patrizia arrives and calls out 
claudias name but she has to repeat it a second time before claudia 
realizes she is being called
 
				patrizia 
		claudia lets go
 
claudia turns around but doesnt move another car pulls up driven by the 
same chauffeur who had evidently picked her up the other day and in which 
the princess is already seated
 
				claudia 
		im not coming

				patrizia 
		but then why did you bother changing
 
patrizia remains puzzled for a moment as though searching for a motive behind 
claudias sudden decision then discreetly turns away without insisting and 
goes over to the car in the meantime giulia and goffredo have come out 
through the hallway and head towards one of the two cars corrado looks at 
them with a cold and critical stare then with a deliberate intent to prick 
giulias feelings he says
 
				corrado 
		giulia is like oscar wilde give her the 
		superfluous and she will do without the 
		essential
 
ettore breaks out into a laugh as he helps patrizia into the car
 
				ettore  
		thats him hed die if he didnt have somebody 
		to quote he comes up with quotations like that 
		even at a board of directors meeting
 
claudia watches them getting into the car she is beside herself completely 
wrapped up in her own thoughts
 



in the rear of a general store on the outskirts of a small sicilian town a 
woman is seated at the window she is very young thin and irascible up 
front her husband is speaking with sandro and as she listens attentively to 
what he is saying a sarcastic smile spreads over her face
 
				husband  
		be patient i cant remember everything 

				sandro
			indicating the newspaper article
		but it even says what she bought a bar of soap 
		so theres no point in making believe you cant 
		remember
 
after waiting a few seconds to give her husband a chance to explain himself 
the wife jumps up from where she is sitting comes over to sandro and yanks 
the paper from his hands then she starts reading the article in a jerky 
manner typical of one who is not too literate
 
				wife  
		a young female stranger whose description 
		corresponds with that of the missing girl came 
		into my store
 
she suddenly stops reading and turns toward sandro
 
				wife  
		she came and then she left with him but this 
		one wont admit it 
			turning upon her husband furiously
 		you think i wasnt aware of it
 
the husband a young man tries to keep calm and carry on the conversation in 
a logical persuasive manner
 
				husband  
		but if i was carrying on with the girl why 
		would i want to give any of this information to 
		the newspaper

				wife  
		thats what id like to know myself

				husband  
		fine that makes two of us who want to know in 
		fact three with him 

he indicates sandro  then seeing a fat luscious female customer enter the 
store he turns to her and continues

				husband  
		ah lady amalia would you be interested in 
		knowing why i told the newspapers about a 
		certain girl who came here the other day and 
		then disappeared
 
the woman anxious to learn about any new bit of gossip becomes immediately 
interested
 
				lady amalia
		disappeared who is she  where when

				husband  
		and that makes four anybody else
 
sandro a little sick and tired of the whole matter and wanting to put an 
end to what has by now become farcical intervenes
 
				sandro 
		you have to be precise did this girl enter 
		your store or didnt she 

				wife
			shouting
		yes

				sandro 
			ignoring her
		was she blonde or brunette 

				husband
			calmly
		brunette 

				wife
			contradicting him
		blonde 

				sandro 
		how was she dressed

				husband  
		i dont quite remember seems to me she wore a 
		black dress

				wife
			intervening sarcastically
		he doesnt look at dresses he looks at whats 
		under them
 
the husband turns around and looks at his wife menacingly
 
				sandro 
		pardon me but has anyone else been here asking 
		about this girl

				husband  
		no  i dont think so 

				sandro 
		thanks
 



sandro leaves the store he walks a few steps along the pavement then sits 
down at a small outside table of a nearby caf he looks out over the square 
a small sicilian town quiet and still in the hot afternoon sun every now 
and then he glances up at the country road that winds around the town as 
though he were waiting for someone

a few moments later in fact a car comes into view and slows down as it 
reaches the square the driver looks out for a place in which to park sandro 
rises to his feet the car comes to a stop a few steps away from him the 
driver rushes out of the car to open the door for the person inside it is 
claudia sandro immediately goes over to meet her looking at her somewhat 
amazed not only does he see her more elegantly dressed than he has ever seen 
her before wearing a smartly tailored polkadot suit but also as an 
entirely new person as someone whose beauty he has discovered for the first 
time for a moment they continue staring at each other without even 
bothering to say hello
 
				claudia 
		any news

				sandro 
		yes but its all so conflicting however 
		there is some slight indication
 
claudia drops her gaze relieved by even that slight note of hope then she 
looks up at him again as though inspired by another sudden thought 
something which must have lingered in her mind from one of the princess 
humorous quips then the owner of the general store appears on the scene 
after having dealt his nagging wife a crushing verbal blow he turns to 
sandro but not without first glancing at claudia for whom it soon becomes 
evident he has really come out on the street
 
				husband  
		listen in the paper they forgot to say that 
		as soon as the girl left here she took the bus 
		to noto the bus leaves from the square over 
		there i saw her clearly i came to the door 
		to see her off she was a beautiful girl 
		lovely pair of legs
 
while speaking he continues to keep an eye on claudia with the look of one 
who thinks his gaze is loaded with irresistible masculinity all of a sudden 
he pulls out a package of nazionali cigarettes from his pocket and offers one 
to claudia she looks at him dumbfounded then automatically declines with a 
shake of her head in turn he lights up a cigarette inhaling the smoke 
voluptuously meanwhile his wife has come upon the scene and looks at him 
suspiciously then with a sad wistful voice she turns to claudia
 
				wife  
		youre from rome arent you i knew right away 
		because im from viterbo he was a soldier 
		there and so
			indicating her husband and
			 then quickly continuing 
		i dont like it very much here
 
				husband
			interrupting
		then why dont you go back
 
his wife turns and looks at him hatefully exactly in the same manner he had 
looked at her
 
				claudia 
		how long have you been married 

				wife  
		three months

claudia and sandro look at each other there is a moment of embarrassment 
then sandro breaks the silence

				sandro 
		well thanks for the information
 
they exchange goodbyes then claudia and sandro move away from the store and 
head towards claudias car suddenly sandro takes claudia by the hand
 
				sandro 
		its better if we present a happy picture no
 
claudia is about to withdraw her hand but she is taken aback by sandros 
phrase which also fills her with a warm and tender feeling after the squalid 
situation with the young storekeeper and his wife now sandro opens the door 
of the car looks at claudia as if to ask her consent for what he is about to 
do and since claudia says nothing but just stands there trying to figure out
which one of the feelings struggling within her will win he removes 
claudias valise and closes the door
 
				sandro 
			to the driver
		tell the signora patrizia that we are 
		continuing the searchand that the signorina 
		claudia will manage to survive somehow
 
the driver bows slightly then he climbs into the car and departs sandro and 
claudia remain there watching the car disappear out of view now sandro 
turns to look at claudia and smiles at her claudia is visibly upset she 
doesnt smile back but merely turns away and heads towards sandros car
 



claudia is intent on looking at sandro who is doing the driving the car is 
traveling on a country road but claudia shows no interest in the landscape 
she continues to stare at sandro as if she wants to know his most secret 
thoughts suddenly feeling himself being stared at sandro turns towards 
claudia she quickly drops her gaze then sandro turns his eyes back to the 
road and claudia looks up at him again

from a bend in the road up ahead preceded by the loud and penetrating blast 
of a horn the bus mentioned earlier by the storekeeper appears sandro 
barely manages to stop the car in time off to one side of the road he gets 
out and places himself in the middle of the road where he starts signaling 
for the bus to stop with a loud screech of its brakes the bus comes to a 
stop almost directly in front of him the bus driver opens the window and 
leans out
 
				driver
		did your car break down 

				sandro 
		no i only want some information
 
meanwhile the drivers assistant gets down from the bus and the passengers 
lean out of the windows  claudia has also gotten out of the car and appears 
on the scene
 
				sandro 
		were searching for a girl of about 
		twentyfive seems she boarded this bus two 	
		days ago in the afternoon you should 
		remember her because she was a stranger around 
		here
 
the driver gets down from the bus and comes over to sandro scratching his 
head
 
				driver
		she was a little nervous darkhaired  with 
		a kerchief around her head
 
he turns to his assistant for verification who in turn searches his memory 
and then adds
 
				assistant
		two days ago wasnt there that midwife on 
		the bus too sure thats right and she was 
		talking to some young woman 

				sandro 
		can you tell me where she got off 

				assistant
		all i can tell you is that the midwife is from 
		x 

				sandro 
		okay thanks
 
sandro turns and goes back to his car while the others climb back on the bus 
which begins to leave claudia and sandro remain standing near the car 
watching the bus disappear then claudia turns and looks out over the fields 
she sees a dry riverbed filled with stones that sparkle in the sun beside it 
a high rocky bank sandro stands next to her and she becomes vividly aware of 
his presence as she glances at him he turns around then she quickly starts 
up a conversation as though she were anxious not to have any romantic mood 
develop between them
 
				claudia 
		my god  lets hope it was her
 
then still feeling sandros eyes fixed upon her she turns and starts  
heading towards the car  sandro catches up with her and takes her hand 
before they climb into the car they look at each other intensely a moment 
later the car takes off at full speed
 



in a courtyard of the midwifes house sandro and claudia are questioning a 
middleaged woman
 
				midwife  
		i only exchanged a few casual words with her 
		as one would ordinarily do on a public bus 

				sandro 
		and do you remember where she got off 

				midwife  
		wellprobably at the last stop which is noto

				claudia 
		after that you didnt see her anymore
 
the woman pauses for a few seconds and looks at claudia as though she had 
detected some hidden motive behind the question and when she resumes 
speaking what she has to say is in sharp contrast to the way she says it 
they are words of protest but spoken condescendingly almost sweetly yet 
leaving no doubt as to their meaning
 
				midwife  
		what are you trying to insinuate young lady
		why should i have seen her again i dont do 
		anything thats illegitimate

				claudia 
		oh no what are you saying im not 
		insinuating anything

				midwife  
		and furthermore my dear young lady because 
		you really are a dear you know if the story 
		of that girl is merely a pretext let us say 
		to get in touch with her then i feel it is my 
		duty to warn her these things are very very 
		dangerous especially in a neighborhood like 
		this where people occupy themselves more with 
		other peoples affairs than their own
 
seeing claudia being put into an uncomfortable position sandro who had been 
following the midwifes discussion with a cagey attitude intervenes
 
				sandro 
		then you should also be able to tell me where a 
		young girl might stay in noto are there any 
		hotels or rooming houses

				midwife  
		theres the trinacria hotel or the regina 
		near the municipal building as for rooming 
		houses i dont know

				sandro 
		thank you

				midwife  
		dont mention it pleased to be of service 
		any time
 
claudia starts moving hurriedly out of the courtyard followed by sandro
 



sandros car is speeding across a harsh sunbaked landscape bypassing long 
lines of peasants returning from the fields the women seated on donkeys the 
men on foot the more fortunate among them have horse drawn carts
 
claudia is looking at the surrounding countryside and spies an iron bridge 
that is all rusty and obviously no longer in use
 
				claudia 
		look at that bridge who knows why they even 
		bothered to make it
 
the car continues onward passing an abandoned factory then a railroad 
station also abandoned its tracks covered by weeds the ticket office 
haphazardly boarded up with old wooden planks
 
				claudia 
		look at that a factory a station and 
		look at those tracks all full of weeds but 
		why
 
sandro shrugs his shoulders and continues driving without saying a word up 
ahead a small town comes into view with monotonous rows of newly constructed 
homes lined up along the side of the road the car enters the town and stops 
sandro gets out and goes over to a fountain nearby but the fountain is dry 
somewhat surprised he begins to look around and only then do sandro and 
claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one that 
the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut 
there is no sign of life anywhere except for the weeds growing between the 
cracks in the walls invading and suffocating everything in sight 

claudia gets out of the car joins sandro and together they start walking 
along the streets the sun beats furiously down upon the crumbling houses 
upon the church upon the useless monument in the square on which a 
dedication is inscribed to the agricultural worker 

sandro looks around in absolute silence claudia is also  silent somewhat  
dismayed instinctively she presses up close to sandro who leads her to a 
shady spot where the ground is overgrown with weeds 

sandro and claudia are lying next to each other on the grass sandro appears 
calm but is actually looking at claudia as though he were about to embrace 
her with his eyes then he takes her hand claudia offers no resistance in 
fact she entwines her fingers around his almost with a sense of 
desperation sandro tries to kiss her she makes a feeble attempt to resist 
looks around and sees the deserted town the barren fields the crumbling 
sunbaked walls she turns and looks at sandro again and now it is she who 
kisses him when they break apart they stretch themselves out upon the grass 
sandro kisses her violently again and again and again
 



the early twilight shadows are beginning to fall the sky is still clear but 
the sun is fading there is a deep silence and the air is absolutely still 
in a certain sense sandros car standing there in the middle of the 
deserted street is the only thing alive in that desolate town

huddled close to each other claudia and sandro are asleep on the grass 
lazily claudia awakens and then sandro also opens his eyes they are both 
somewhat disheveled
 
				claudia
			faintly audible
		its late we should be going
 
little by little she leaves behind the drowsiness of her deep and peaceful 
sleep purring languorously in a typically feminine fashion sandro smiles 
and gently embraces her a moment later claudia releases herself from 
sandros arms sits up and realizes that the countryside and the town itself 
are as black and motionless as death a cold shiver runs down her back and 
she quickly comes to her feet
 
				claudia 
		lets get out of here fast this is not a 
		town its a cemetery

				sandro 
		who knows why they all left
 
claudia starts to move but her legs are still numb from her sound sleep and 
she hobbles along comically laughing at the same time sandro also gets up 
and finds that his legs are cramped hobbling and laughing himself he 
follows claudia towards the car but the car baked by the sun is like an 
oven they both make boisterous and playful exclamations then another 
embrace another kiss finally they climb into the car and drive off with a 
loud roar that echoes up and down the abandoned town
 



sandro and claudia arrive in the town of noto and pull up on the opposite 
side of the street from the trinacria hotel as they climb out of the car 
claudia turns to sandro
 
				claudia 
		sandro  maybe its best that you go in alone 

				sandro 
		are you joking

				claudia 
		dont think that i want to save myself from any 
		embarrassment from the awkwardness of meeting 
		anna its not that its that you can say 
		certain things easier if youre alone please 
		sandro do try to understand me it would 
		look like i was trying to influence you to 
		force you to control you and that makes me 
		feel uncomfortable
 
sandro agrees by a nod of his head and indicates that he understands very 
well nevertheless he doesnt move several agonizing moments go by in which 
they both remain silent and still looking at the hotel across the way then 
tossing away his cigarette sandro finally walks off and goes into the hotel

left alone claudia strolls along for a few steps she sees a letter box up 
against a building and deposits a postcard she had been carrying with her 
she remains there for a moment watching a parade of ants crawling along the 
wall ending up who knows where they come and go scurrying up and down in 
vast numbers incredibly busy then claudia turns away and starts pacing back 
and forth stopping from time to time behind townspeople who mill about in 
the streets she pays them no heed several young men pass by and turn around 
to look at her they are obviously the towns dandies circling around her 
they exchange suggestive comments to one another even among the women 
claudia arouses a certain curiosity but she remains totally unaware of it 
such is the intensity with which she concentrates her gaze upon the hotel 
entrance suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her 
causes her to start and turn around it is a shop being closed other shops 
further down the street are also closing for the day the people in the 
streets begin thinning out and it is not long before claudia is left entirely 
by herself in that total solitude the doorway of the hotel emerges like the 
mouth of some dark and fearful cavern so much so that claudia is unable to 
keep her eyes fixed upon that spot she turns her head away but her 
attention is immediately drawn back again from the darkness of the hotels 
hallway she spies sandro coming out claudia doesnt wait to see if he is 
alone or not for she has only one thought in mind not to let herself be 
seen but she doesnt know what to do since there is practically no one else 
in the streets and all the shops are closed then she notices a tobacco shop 
still open and she quickly dashes into it she goes up to the counter as she 
opens her purse and starts looking for some change
 
				claudia 
		some cigarettes please do you have any
		nazionali with filters 
 
her hands tremble as she searches for the money finally she pays the  
storekeeper and immediately lights up a cigarette suddenly she wheels 
about having heard sandro enter he is alone throwing away his cigarette 
he comes up to her all nervous and excited and they both step out into the 
street
 
as soon as she is outside claudia leans up against the wall as if she has no 
strength left she lets her cigarette fall to the ground and shuts her eyes
 
				sandro 
		what is it claudia

				claudia 
		oh sandro im so ashamed of myself so 
		ashamedi tried to hide myselfi feel so 
		small i hate myself 

				sandro 
		does it please you to say such things 

				claudia 
		oh no it doesnt please me at all 

				sandro 
		then why do you say them
 
				claudia 
		because what im doing is so ugly  because 
		if you told me right now claudia i love 
		you i would believe you
 
   sandro is about to say the phrase somewhat jokingly in the hope that it 
might calm her but also with a certain amount of seriousness but as soon as 
he opens his mouth to say claudia she places her hand over his lips
 
				claudia 
		no because then id force you to swear it 
		id force you to tell me an infinite amount of 
		things and that wouldnt be right it 
		couldnt be right it would be absurd

sandro tries to calm her with an embrace
 
				sandro 
		good its better if it were absurd that would 
		mean nothing much can be done about it

				claudia 
		but just think  the very same things you had
		said to her who knows how many times maybe 
		even just before we left while i was waiting 
		outside your place

				sandro 
		so even if i did say them i was sincere with 
		her as i am now with you

moved by sandros remark claudia lifts her head and looks deeply into his 
eyes the statement reveals him as being someone quite different from the 
person she had imagined him to be and at the same time it opens up for her 
a new way of looking at things shaking his head and with much tenderness 
he says
 
				sandro 
		i have never seen a woman like you who needs 
		to see everything so clearly
 
at the sound of a mans voice coming from behind him sandro turns and sees a 
gentleman with two large packages under his arms pointing to a bellcord 
dangling on the side of a door nearby
         
				man
		excuse me but would you mind pulling that cord 
		for me
 
sandro pulls the bellcord and the sound of a bell is heard inside
 
				man
		thank you
 
the door opens and the gentleman quickly steps inside sandro looks up at the 
building
 
				sandro 
		at one time all these houses were convents
 
he takes claudia by the arm and pulls her away towards the square then looks 
attentively around the area bathed in the soft twilight the buildings and 
the churches bordering the square reveal themselves in all their beauty 
sandro and claudia climb up the steps of a church building and from there 
gaze at the scene gradually he allows himself to be overcome with 
enthusiasm 

				sandro 
		look what a fantastic scene what movement 
		what disorder they were very much concerned 
		with scenographic effects an extraordinary 
		sense of liberty
 
there is a moment of silence during which he continues to look at the scene 
before him then giving voice to a sincere thought he exclaims
 
				sandro 
		really ive got to stop this business with 
		ettore i would like to go back and start 
		working on my own projects again you know i 
		had many ideas 

				claudia 
		and why did you drop them

				sandro 
		once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate 
		for the construction of a school it took me 
		only a day and a half to finish it and i got 
		paid six million lire ever since then ive 
		been doing estimates for other peoples 
		designs
 
claudia looks at him as if she were about to render judgment and sandro 
becomes aware of it
 
				sandro 
		why are you looking at me like that 

				claudia 
		im sure youd be able to design some very 
		lovely things

				sandro 
		i dont know about that and then whos 
		interested in beautiful things nowadays
 
the last words are spoken with a deep sense of sadness sandro avoiding 
claudias glance he laughs to himself and for a while remains silent he 
takes another look up at the dark outlines of the buildings then turns to 
claudia
 
				sandro 
		claudia lets get married 

				claudia 
			astonished 
		what get married

				sandro 
		yes well get married you and i what do you 
		say

				claudia 
		what do i say what can i say no at least 
		not yet i dont know i cant even think of 
		it at a time like this oh but why did 
		you have to ask me 

				sandro 
		you look at me as though i had said something 
		foolish

				claudia 
		and are you sure you want to marry me are you 
		really surethat you want to marry me 

				sandro 
		thats why i asked you

				claudia 
		so oh how i wish that everything were so 
		much simpler that people could just come 
		together by the color of their hair or the size 
		of their shoes what size shoe do you wear 
		size 9 thats a very lovely size but im 
		sorry i wear size 8
 
sandro smiles and playfully ruffles claudias hair she also smiles then 
slowly they both head towards the hotel
 



it is morning inside the hotel trinacria  claudia has just had breakfast in 
her room and is almost finished dressing it is a rather large room set out 
with old pieces of furniture the place is in a state of disarray and the 
door leading into sandros room is wide open because of the general 
disorder claudia is unable to find her stockings but instead of being 
angered by this she appears quite jovial and laughs gaily as she continues 
to look for her stockings sandro appears in the doorway
 
				sandro 
		are you ready
 
claudia comes up to sandro and gazes upon him with a look of adoration
 
				claudia 
			ironically
		but why am i so infatuated with you

				sandro 
			smiling
		hurry up now or itll begin to get hot 
		outside

				claudia 
		yes yes yes yes right away
 
she starts looking hurriedly around the room again but is still unable to 
locate her stockings suddenly up from the street comes the sound of music 
it is a popular tune wild and rhythmic emanating from a publicity truck as 
part of some local advertising stunt claudia is overtaken by the music and 
cannot resist the temptation to do a little dance for sandro little by 
little she starts swaying back and forth to the music then kicking off her 
shoes she begins to dance around the room in her bare feet sandro looks at 
her amused but also somewhat impatient
 
				sandro 
			leaving
		okay i understand see you later
 
claudia rushes up to the door and feigning an exaggerated attitude of 
despair says
 
				claudia 
		and you leave me here all alone in this 
		hotel room 

				sandro 
		as soon as youre ready you can come down and 
		catch up with me ill be waiting for you right 
		outside on the square
 
claudia is in a playful mood and she is anxious to demonstrate her 
exuberance
 
				claudia 
			teasingly
		very well but you must first tell me that when 
		you go out without me its like going out 
		without one of your legs go ahead have a look 
		around the town all by yourself but youll 
		have to hobble along on only one leg and you 
		must also tell me that you are filled with a 
		great desire to embrace my shadow on the 
		walls then you must tell me
			suddenly her tone of voice 
			 changes and she becomes 
			 quite serious 
		you must tell me that you love me
 
sandro replies with the same goodnatured tolerance with which he had been 
watching claudia as she danced her coquettish dance
 
				sandro 
		but you know it already why must i tell you 

				claudia 
		so you wonder why
 
without waiting for him to answer she goes back towards the center of the 
room and once again starts looking around for her stockings sandro begins to 
leave
 
				sandro 
		then ill see you later 

				claudia 
		okay in a few minutes
 
sandro goes out the door claudia finally locates her stockings and proceeds 
to finish dressing
 



sandro comes out of the hotel and crosses over to the sunny square he starts 
strolling down along a street which leads to a baroque church that opens up 
to a wide flight of stone steps beyond these steps is a small deadend 
street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old 
building a few feet away from the faade seated on a bench in the shade is 
an old coachman whose horse is standing beside him with its head deep in a 
sack of hay

sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old 
building which is closed he rings the bell but there is no answer then he 
notices a time schedule posted on the door indicating visiting hours after 
glancing at it he walks over to the seated coachman
 
				sandro 
		its closed isnt there any custodian or 
		caretaker inside
 
				coachman
		 	apathetically
		nobody there

				sandro 
		but it says its open from 930 to 1030 and 
		its ten oclock now  thats a fine way to 
		greet tourists

				coachman
		tourists last year a few frenchmen came here 
		and they all walked around in their bathing
		suits so they were made to understand that it 
		was better if they didnt come at all
 
sandro shakes his head and is about to say something but he sees the door 
opening and a man appears  sandro goes over to him
 
				sandro 
		are you the custodian

				custodian
		yes come right in
 
sandro enters and finds himself inside a large courtyard of noteworthy 
architectural design though somewhat in a state of decay the custodian goes 
on his way and sandro walks further into the courtyard where two young men 
are studying the architecture on hearing sandros footsteps they turn 
around for a moment then resume their observation they are in fact young 
architectural students busily engaged in taking notes and copying certain 
architectural details they do this with an extraordinary interest almost 
with a sense of religious zeal sandro continues to stroll through the 
courtyard his footsteps are the only sounds to be heard disturbing the 
otherwise absolute silence the two young students exchange words between 
each other but they speak in faint whispers almost as though they were 
inside a church 

sandro gazes up at the arcades the columns the windows he is obviously 
filled with a painful sense of regret resentful and bitter he turns to look 
at the two young students who are deep in their studies and ignore his 
presence but he is unable to ignore them they plainly annoy him in a 
certain sense they humiliate him he turns away and heads towards the exit 
walking on the tip of his toes so as not to make any noise then he goes out 
quietly closing the door behind him
 



in the hotel lobby a maid is cleaning and dusting and at the same time 
singing little snatches from a popular romantic tune the hotel manager who 
is busy writing something in the register behind the desk looks up and says
 
				hotel manager
		go ahead keep right on singing
 
disappointed the maid immediately stops singing and the manager resumes 
writing but she quickly looks up again as she hears footsteps coming down 
the stairs it is claudia
 
				hotel manager
			to claudia
		excuse me for interfering but ive heard about 
		that girl here in this place one gets to 
		know about everything that girl youre 
		looking for why dont you try asking at the 
		youth hostel in pergusa almost all the young 
		girls traveling through here end up there
 
claudia is immediately interested to hear this bit of news and is about to 
ask for additional information but she is suddenly distracted by sandro who 
enters the lobby at that very moment
 
				claudia 
		i was just coming out to meet you how come 
		youre back so soon
 
sandro doesnt answer but merely shrugs his shoulders then he takes claudia 
by the arm and gently leads her towards the stairway he has a worried 
expression on his face and remains absolutely silent as he starts climbing 
the stairs as they walk through the corridor claudia looks at him 
anxiously wondering what is wrong
 
				claudia 
		sandro whats the matter 

				sandro 
		nothing
 
he opens the door to his room and ushers claudia in as soon as he enters he 
takes off his jacket and throws it on a chair then he walks over to the 
window and closes the shutters then without saying a word he turns to 
claudia grabs her in his arms and squeezes her claudia smiles and 
playfully yells ouch then he goes to kiss her but claudia tries to resist 
but doesnt succeed this little struggle stimulates sandro and is enough to 
make him forget all reserve he drags claudia on to the bed and forces her to 
lie down

				claudia 
		no sandro please 

				sandro 
		why

				claudia 
		no reason why
 
but sandro hugs her and kisses her again this time claudia lets herself be 
kissed
 
				claudia 
		whats the matter with you
 
sandro only responds by kissing her again then claudia yields sandro is 
angry and excited as though he wanted to take his resentment out on claudia
 
				claudia 
		sandro wait a moment just one moment you 
		seem like an entirely different person 
 
				sandro 
		and arent you pleased that way youll have 
		a new kind of adventure
 
wounded claudia pushes him away with all her might and exclaims
 
				claudia 
		what are you saying

				sandro 
		i was only joking really cant i make a 
		joke and now youve got to tell me why you 
		dont want to

				claudia 
		oh sandro i want everything you do but
 
she stops short then turns aside and reaches out to touch his jacket on the 
chair looking into the pockets not with curiosity but with a sense of love 
sandro grabs her by the shoulders and forces her to turn around
 
				sandro 
		but what
 
claudia remains silent then gets up from the bed and in a subdued tone of 
voice says
 
				claudia 
		did the hotel manager speak to you about that 
		place nearby

				sandro 
		yes she started to but i didnt feel like 
		staying to listen to what she had to say if we 
		had to listen to everybody

				claudia 
		no sandro we should go besides we 
		havent been in touch with anybody not even 
		with annas father we should have at least 
		sent a wire or telephoned lets be fair he 
		must be feeling awfully lonely

				sandro 
		i dont doubt it but at a time like this were 
		the least suitable persons to be with him and 
		as far as telephoning him who knows where he 
		is
 
there is a moment of silence then claudia starts heading towards the door
 
				claudia 
		come lets go pack your things and ill get 
		mine ready too
 




it is evening sandros car is pulling into the town of taormina on its way 
to the san domenico it comes to a small square and passes by a group of men 
and women seated on the steps of an ancient ruin they are dressed in evening 
clothes and are laughing and giggling the car turns into the street of the  
san domenico and stops in front of the hotel a porter immediately comes out 
and opens the door claudia and sandro get out and head towards the small 
courtyard that leads into the foyer

the lobby is full of activity and alive with people dressed in formal attire 
claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees the surroundings the 
people etc sandro approaches the reception desk as claudia walks slightly 
ahead anxious to see what is going on the sound of music is heard coming 
from one of the halls at the other end of the lobby there is obviously a 
party underway further on through a glass partition couples are seen 
dancing suddenly claudia stops directly up ahead she notices patrizia as 
soon as she see claudia patrizia comes to greet her smiling
 
				patrizia 
		well im looking for somebody else and who do 
		i find but you
 
claudia smiles and they both kiss each other on the cheek
 
				claudia 
		how are you
 
instead of answering patrizia takes claudia by the hand and leads her over 
to a bench along the side of the wall and sits down claudia remains 
standing somewhat annoyed by the crowd of people around her
 
				claudia 
		shouldnt we try to find a quieter place 

				patrizia 
		quieter oh yes of course
 
patrizia rises and leads claudia out to a terrace that overlooks the entire 
bay which is dotted with lights claudia takes in the view but her attention 
is still focused on patrizia she waits from one moment to the next to have 
questions thrown at her but patrizia remains silent so claudia turns around 
and looks at her as though to say come on say what you have to say and 
lets get it over with but patrizia smiles at her sweetly and only murmurs
 
				patrizia 
		you look so wonderfully tanned
 
claudia feels relieved and presses patrizias hand almost with a sense of 
renewed friendship sandro appears from behind the glass partition and comes 
out on the terrace to greet patrizia
 
				patrizia 
		and heres sandro 
			he kisses her hand
		why dont you two go upstairs and change 

				sandro 
		yes we will
 
they leave the terrace and go through one of the halls towards the corridor 
that leads to the rooms claudia walks ahead with patrizia and sandro 
following slightly behind the hall is still packed with people
 
				patrizia 
		did you manage to find good rooms
 
				sandro 
		they didnt seem too good

				patrizia 
		you should have told ettore he always manages 
		to get what he wants

				sandro 
		ettore must be fed up with me by now 

				patrizia 
		oh no not at all and then you know very well 
		that hell forgive you anything just as long 
		as you admit to him that youre a worse driver 
		than he is
 
claudia looks at sandro assured by patrizias reply she remains thoughtful 
for a moment then asks patrizia
 
				claudia 
		how do you manage to put up with all this 
		confusion you always said people bore you 

				patrizia 
		you shouldnt always take me seriously 
		actually im used to it by now first my 
		mother and now my husband both of them are 
		like dynamos 

				sandro 
		your mother

				patrizia 
		yes even i had a mother she was part 
		austrian but she was still my mother my 
		childhood was like a tennis match they 
		bounced me back and forth here and there

				claudia 
		my childhood instead was a very sensible one

				patrizia 
		what do you mean by sensible 

				claudia 
		it means being without money
 
patrizia and sandro burst out laughing and sandro reaches out and ruffles 
claudias hair they have arrived in front of a room that is situated on the 
ground floor and are greeted by a hotel clerk who is waiting for them with 
keys in hand the door is already open and claudia is about to enter
 
				patrizia 
		see you soon then
 
sandro nods yes and claudia waves so long as patrizia takes her leave 
claudia enters the room behind the clerk and sandro follows claudia stops 
in the middle of the room as the clerk goes through his various duties with 
professional exactitude he turns on the lights draws the window curtains 
checks to see if there are enough hangers in the wardrobe then finally opens
the door to the adjoining room into which he disappears all his movements 
seem completely automatic
 
				sandro 
			commenting under his breath
		you see just like a robot
 
then sandro enters the adjoining room where the clerk has in the meantime 
turned on all the lamps and performed all the other little duties sandro 
starts to undo his tie claudia remains standing in the middle of the room 
listening to all of sandros movements in the other room a knock is heard at 
the door of sandros room and sandro is heard saying
 
				sandro 
		come in
 
a few seconds later the porter also enters claudias room with her baggage 
she opens the valise and starts taking out her nightgown and other 
necessities her gestures are slow and imprecise because fatigue has overcome 
her several moments pass and sandro appears at the door in his pajamas
 
				claudia 
		sandro listen try not to get yourself too 
		involved tomorrow

				sandro 
		arent you going to change

				claudia 
		you said you wanted to quit working for ettore
 
sandro shrugs his shoulders without apparently giving much thought to 
claudias statement he goes into the bathroom saying
 
				sandro 
		sure thats what i said
 
the sound of the shower running is heard
 
				sandro 
		wow its ice cold
 
claudia goes up to the door adjoining the two rooms and stops at the doorway 
of the bathroom that is situated between the two rooms
 
				claudia 
		sandro im not coming down 

				sandro 
		why

				claudia 
		im too sleepy

				sandro 
		sleep is something one must learn to overcome 
		i learned how to do it when i was a child i 
		never slept and i had friends who even slept 
		less than i did the one who went to bed first 
		paid a penalty and we really didnt do 
		anything after seeing a movie wed go to a 
		cafe and discuss things for a while then 
		wed sit down on a bench somewhere listen to 
		some drunkard watch them putting up posters 
		or manifestoesor look at the sheep passing 
		by or go for a stroll around the market 
		place or else wed go and wake up some girl 
		in the neighborhood by standing in front of her 
		window and calling out her name
 
claudia has been listening to sandro with her head leaning against the door 
jamb her eyes closed as soon as sandro stops she goes back to her bed and 
starts undressing sandro comes out of the bathroom wearing a bathrobe and 
going over to claudia says in an affectionate tone
 
				sandro 
		youre that sleepy eh what time do expect to 
		get up tomorrow 

				claudia 
		late very late
 
claudia disappears into her bathroom and sandro returns to his room after a 
while his voice is heard
 
				sandro 
		did you know that when i was a boy i wanted to 
		be a diplomat can you imagine that me a 
		diplomat its strange but i never thought id 
		be rich i saw myself living in a rooming house 
		full of geniuses
 
claudia has slipped into her nightgown and returned to her room sandro is 
heard clearing his throat and then continuing
 
				sandro 
		instead i have two apartments one in rome and 
		one in milan as far as genius goes its a 
		habit ive never formed what do you think of 
		that
 
sandro reappears at the doorway already half dressed claudia slides into 
bed and stretches herself out under the covers
 
				claudia 
		i look at things differently but maybe its 
		best we talk about it some other time do you 
		mind turning off that light over there
 
sandro turns out the lamp on the table while claudia closes the main switch 
the room is enveloped in darkness sandro approaches the bed and bends over 
claudia to kiss her
 
				sandro 
		good night my love

				claudia 
		good night tell me that you love me 

				sandro 
		i love you

				claudia 
		tell me once more 

				sandro 
		i dont love you 

				claudia 
			smiling 
		i deserve it
 
sandro goes towards the door then turns and smiles
 
				sandro 
		thats not true i love you
 
he returns to his room closing the door behind him he seems somewhat 
meditative as though the little discourse he has just delivered has in some 
way touched him deeply he also seems a little sad then he puts on his tie 
and jacket lights up a cigarette and goes to the door
 



sandro comes out of his room and walks along through the corridors heading 
towards the reception halls down at the other end other persons are walking 
up and down the corridor in both directions
 
sandros attention is attracted by the figure of a woman who is coming his 
way at a rather quick pace she is wrapped in a tightfitting evening dress 
that emphasizes the various harmonious parts of her body sandro looks at 
her he seems to recognize her but isnt quite sure who it is the girl 
passes alongside of him and apparently she too has the same impression for 
she gives him a look that lasts much longer than it normally would between 
two complete  strangers she stops in front of a door but before entering 
she casts another glance at sandro who suddenly recalls that she is the same 
woman who had almost provoked a riot in the streets of messina and who was 
forced to take refuge in a mens shop there is a moment of hesitation then 
the girl opens the door and disappears into the room sandro continues on 
ahead until he reaches the bar which is still very crowded 

evening clothes of all kinds shiny silks jewels dangling from wrists necks 
and ears that are either white or bronzed by the sun shoes of silver or 
lustrous black headdresses of many women  high cropped or short and 
bobbed men with hair well groomed but also frequently mussed a vast 
tumultuous wave of people all wealthy and respectable talking laughing and 
carrying on as though the whole wide world was right there and everybody in 
it was like them 

snatches of witticisms faces of passing people hands reaching out for 
glasses the expressions on the face of the barman smiling and indifferent 
the sad sullen face of the cloakroom attendant the dumbfounded look on the 
face of a thirteenyearold elevator boy

sandro feels very much at home in this milieu one thinks so little forgets 
so easily and things are so conveniently ignored beginning with ones own 
self sandro moves through the crowd here and there standing next to the 
orchestra is a girl in black pants singing strange songs in a soft 
suggestive voice 

sandro encounters ettore as soon as he sees sandro ettore comes over and 
places an arm around his shoulder almost in the form of an embrace
 
				ettore  
		well finally come ill introduce you to my 
		friends

				sandro 
		i want to take a look around first ill join 
		you later

				ettore  
		say i hope its understood that starting 
		tomorrow morning ill need to have you around 
		if you dont give me some figures to work with 
		how can i proceed
 
sandro agrees with a nod of his head but he is thoughtful and somewhat 
saddened as ettore returns to his friends with whom he had been speaking and 
laughing sandro looks at him almost with a sense of rage

then he goes back to the bar and orders something to drink he is not aware 
that the girl from messina is just a few yards away and is watching him she 
is extremely tanned extremely voluptuous and extremely beautiful

sandro moves away from the bar with the glass in his hand he passes in front 
of a semidark room and takes a peek inside a television set is turned on 
but nobody is watching it sandro is restless he comes to a terrace and 
stops to look down at the illuminated docks below the headlights of cars 
passing by fan out across the road that runs along the shore of the sea with 
an angry gesture sandro finishes his drink gulping the whiskey down in one 
fast swallow he squeezes the empty glass in his hand as though he had wanted 
to crush it
 



the early rays of dawn are faintly seen coming through a window at the far 
end of the corridor claudia comes rushing out of her room and runs over to 
patrizias door she knocks then without waiting for a response she enters
 
				claudia 
		patrizia patrizia  wheres ettore 

				patrizia 
		i imagine he must be inside sleeping 

				claudia 
		would you please see if sandro is with him 
		hes not in his room im sorry to disturb you
 
patrizia gets up out of bed and goes into the adjoining room
 
				patrizia 
		ettore 

				ettore  
		what is it

				patrizia 
		nothing nothing  at all i was just looking 
		for sandro

				ettore  
		and you expect to find him in here go and ask 
		claudia
 
				patrizia 
		yes yes of course 

she returns to her room 

				claudia 
		patrizia im afraid

				patrizia 
		more or less we are all afraid especially at 
		night

				claudia 
		im afraid that anna has come back i feel 
		shes back and that theyre together

				patrizia 
		but whats gotten into you we would have 
		known sandro must be out in the garden 
		somewhere taking a breath of fresh air or 
		watching the break of dawn it would be a lovely 
		surprise indeed if he turned out to be the 
		sentimental type
 
claudia sinks down into a chair weak and exhausted
 
				patrizia 
		now listen for gods sake try not to let 
		yourself become obsessed with that idea go to 
		your room and get back into bed

				claudia 
		just several days ago the thought of anna 
		being dead would have made me sick and now i 
		dont even cry im afraid she might be alive 
		everything is becoming so damned simple and 
		easy even to deprive ones self of pain and 
		suffering
 
				patrizia 
		you should never wish to get melodramatic over 
		anything

				claudia 
		yes youre right im sick and tired of being 
		like that
 
claudia gets up and leaves the room she continues walking down along the 
corridor checking here and there but the hotel is deserted there are still 
a few lights  on in  the reception hall but not enough to illuminate the 
place adequately finally she reaches the main hall and stops the only 
signs of last nights party is a certain disorder in the placement of the 
armchairs and ashtrays filled with cigarette butts even the main hall seems 
completely deserted but all of a sudden claudia becomes aware of something 
moving on a sofa at the far end of the room she takes a few steps walking 
silently over the thick carpet so as to get a better look there seems to be 
a slight movement among what appears to be a jumbled pile of male and female 
clothes partly hidden from view by the back of the sofa claudia goes up 
still closer because she is not able to see clearly what or who it is only 
that she has the impression of having seen that suit before a mans suit 
she is now able to distinguish what it is a couple embracing and kissing

claudia approaches still closer she is now just a few steps away little by 
little as she advances her face takes on such a painful look of 
astonishment that she appears almost petrified she hesitates and bumps up 
against a little table that makes a small noise the couple on the sofa come 
out of their embrace and look up the man is sandro the woman is the girl 
from messina sandro looks at claudia as though he were filled with terror 
the girl instead seems quite amused claudia remains for a moment staring 
at them as if she cant believe her own eyes and is incapable of making any 
move then she abruptly turns away and starts running she runs through the 
main hall the reception room the courtyard and out into the street
 
there is not a soul to be seen no sound the day is breaking clear and 
serene

claudia comes over to a bench with its paint all peeling off but she doesnt 
sit down transfixed and with her eyes almost wide open she stares out at 
the sea and at the waves which are also a mystery unto themselves
 
footsteps are heard approaching from behind but claudia doesnt even bother 
to turn it seems that nothing could distract her from that painful state of 
shock which is written all over her face a young laborer in overalls 
carrying a small bundle under his arm passes by glancing at her with a look 
of curiosity he walks a few paces ahead then turns around to look at her 
again as though she were some kind of strange creature

the sound of footsteps dies down in the distance and everything is silent 
once more there is only the gentle lapping of the waves as they roll up 
against the shore claudia is completely oblivious to the scene several 
birds swoop down emitting their small cries a sudden but almost 
imperceptible sea breeze ripples claudias hair

other footsteps are heard approaching slow heavy claudia is still not 
stirred from her thoughtful trancelike state the footsteps come to a halt 
directly behind her it is sandro he appears thoroughly crestfallen he 
doesnt even have enough courage to look at claudia his face is worn and 
disfigured like that of a tired old man and he lets himself fall limp onto 
the bench they both remain completely motionless without looking at each 
other and detached claudia standing sandro seated behind them the 
skeleton of cement further off the sea

gradually claudia turns her head towards sandro her eyes are filled with 
tears she looks down upon him as though he were something that greatly 
pained her she moves up closer to the bench sandro doesnt budge an inch 
claudia reaches out to him with her hand then slowly gently and with an 
overwhelming sense of desperation she caresses his hair
