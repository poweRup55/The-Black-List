               ext  greek island  sunset

               credit sequence

               the image is in black and white

               the sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant 
               shadows on the sea

               a little boy around 8 years old  tanned from head to toe

               sprints along the cliffs scrambles from one rock to

               another with amazing agility

               in one hand he carries a transparent plastic bag  in the 
               other a net bag containing flippers mask pants and 
               sweater

               the only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit 

               obvious handmedowns  way too big  he tugs on them as 
               he goes holding them up until they slide again as 
               he leaps again and pulls them up

               the little boy is jacques mayol

               end credits

               ext  greek island  sunset

               jacques reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove

               he spits in his mask expertly spreads the spit with a 
               finger locks his feet into the flippers and dives

               he surfaces a long way out adjusts his mask and swims 
               away from shore

               in open sea

               the boy stops swimming  starts to gulp air  sucks it 
               in  oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid 
               breaths  almost hyperventilating almost alarming if 
               weve never seen this before

               his gaze is glued to the ocean floor  clear clear water

               40 feet deep  and intensely blue

               suddenly he catches his breath and dives  into the blue

               underwater

               jacques touches bottom  clamps his legs around a rock to 
               hold himself down  unhurried thoroughly at home 40 feet 
               under he opens the plastic bag  a huge speckled moray 
               eel appears in a hole in the rock slithers toward him

               the carnivores jaws are bigger than the boys head

               the boy smiles at him  pulls a piece of raw meat out of 
               his bag and holds it out  the eel takes the morsel 
               delicately  and slithers back into his hole

               gravely jacques takes another morsel out of the bag

               ext  village  dusk

               jacques walks up a steep road bordering the port almost 
               dry now

               two boys about his age run up the streets call out catch 
               up with him and gesture toward the port

                                     the boys
                         jacques  come quick

               ext  pier  dusk

               the little boys tug jacques to the end of the pier and 
               point to something in the water

                                     boys
                         look  right there  its shining

               jacques walks over and sure enough sees something shining 
               a few feet down in the water

                                     jacques
                              squinting
                         a coin

               camera pans and we see a middleaged priest loading supplies 
               into a small boat  he stops to watch the childrens 
               negotiations  little jacques is putting his flippers on

                                     jacques

                         all right

               the two boys nod as they point to the coin

               the pope smiles

               the two boys look at each other

                                     jacques

               round glasses

               enzo pats jacques on the shoulder and leaves his hand there  
               a lightly intimidating gesture

                                     enzo

                              pretending not to 
                              be
                         no

                                     enzo

                              to his brother
                         roberto mio palmo

               roberto who has already started to moisten his big brothers 
               gear in the water holds a pair of dripping flippers and a 
               glistening mask  the pope watches the scene with obvious 
               pleasure

                                     enzo
                              to his brother on 
                              the edge of the 
                              pier
                         count

               sure of himself enzo takes a deep breath and dives in the 
               water  roberto counts out loud

               roberto

               the kids all walk over to the edge of the pier  a few 
               feet away jacques takes off his flippers  enzo bursts 
               out of the water the coin in his hand  the children cheer 
               and clap  roberto rushes to catch the equipment that comes 
               flying at him piece by piece

               enzo walks over to jacques

                                     enzo
                              showing him the 
                              coin

                         dove for it

               jacques doesnt answer

               enzo smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket  he 
               pulls it out again and waves it under jacques nose

                                     enzo
                              without turning 
                              around
                         roberto  how long

                                     roberto
                         six seconds

               enzo looks at jacques for a while

                                     enzo
                         ill throw it back into the water

               you dive and if you do less than six its yours

               jacques doesnt say anything then finally shakes his head 
               negatively  enzo smiles taps him on the shoulder

                                     enzo
                         brava

               the first boy finally sums up his courage to speak

                                     boy
                              timidly
                         enzo  i saw the coin first we 
                         split

                                     enzo
                              smiling
                         you cant split a coin stupid

               enzo laughing sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves 
               the pier with his gang

               the pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket

               with his flippers dangling from one hand jacques sadly 
               stares out at the sea  the pope calls him over

                                     priest
                         jacques come look

               jacques goes over to him sees where he is pointing the 
               faint gleam of the coin underwater

                                     priest
                         is it a coin shining down there

                                     jacques
                              overjoyed
                         it is  its a coin  ill get it 
                         for you father

                                     priest
                         itll be for the poor

               jacques intent on the coins glimmer quickly slips on 
               his fins prepares his mask  he swims in the water like a 
               fish goes directly to the coin  scoops it up brings it 
               to the surface

               he breaks water waves the coin looks for the priest and 
               sees he is no longer there

                                     jacques
                         padre

               he looks at the ancient impression on the coin  boy on 
               a dolphin

                                                            dissolve to

               on jacques  underwater

               hes swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel

               he senses something behind him and turns around  he sees 
               a dolphin still and silent floating vertically  it seems 
               to be watching him  the surprise is such that jacques is 
               in a panic leaps up to the surface

               on jacques  in bed

               he bolts upright as if suddenly awakening from a dream

               int  room  on jacques father  dark

               a burly man around fifty crosses the room in the shadows 
               and throws open the shutters with a bang  sunlight pours 
               in  he walks over to jacques bed in the one room house 
               and runs his hand through his hair

                                     father
                              with a smile
                          come on time to get up 
                         jacques

               jacques rubs his eyes  his father walks over to a pile of 
               blankets on the floor on the other side of the room  he 
               gives the pile a kick

                                     father
                              screaming at the 
                              top of his lungs
                         louis wake up

               he uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl 
               of soup for jacques  a fifty year old man pokes his head 
               out from under the pile of blankets  its uncle louis 
               who is having a very hard time waking up

               ext  house  day

               jacques bursts out of the house running  diving gear 
               under his arm  a piece of buttered bread in his mouth

               he catches up with his father and uncle louis  theyre on

               a path winding down to the port  jacques slows down 
               abruptly  tries to imitate their stride  the weather is 
               balmy and the sea lies before them peaceful and blue

               ext  sea  day

               their boat on the water  the chug of its engine echoes 
               off the cliffs  a few gulls  drawn by the sound  skim 
               the waves of its wake

               ext  boat  day

               on board  jacques father checks the antique air pump

               jacques polishes the enormous copper divers helmet and 
               lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea divers 
               suit

               at the foot of an old monastery another boat passes

               the priest is in it

               jacques father and louis take off their caps  jacques 
               takes the gold coin out of his pocket

               the pope nods to jacques  his father looks over at him 
               without understanding  the child quickly puts the coin 
               back in his pocket

               ext  boat  day

               around to the boat  jacques smiles and waves at him

               enzo waves back obviously disturbed in his fishing session

               man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes  he seems 
               sluggish and tired  jacques watches worriedly  he has a 
               weird feeling

               father and son smile at each other  then his father puts 
               the helmet on  jacques joins louis at the pump

               the heavy divers suit disappears slowly underwater  the 
               gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of

               to maintain the flow of air

               bubbles  he is white as a sheet

               down at his father  he grabs the life line and starts 
               pulling at it hysterically  the air hose snaps and starts 
               flying around like some crazy snake  jacques tries to 
               jump overboard  uncle louis catches hold of his foot at 
               the last second  jacques is slapping the water with his

               he carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes dons 
               his flippers etc with his usual flair of suspense

               behind him the supervisor and other construction workers 
               watch expectantly  roberto heaves a stone weight into the

               flops over to the now taut cable the stone has hit bottom

               around every hazard until he reaches the diver trapped

               he pats his shoulder to comfort him he then inserts the 
               tire jack under a piece of concrete and as if he were 
               changing a tire begins to pump the handle

               then he takes off his flippers plants his bare feet on 
               the concrete grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls 
               him free

               possible toward the surface

               mountain peaks stark and white  a winter sky which is 
               strangely and disquietingly dark  a landscape swept by 
               snow

               superimposed on screen peru  lake huacracocha  may 1987

               a yellow light comes out of the storm  advances toward 
               us  the headlight of a train

               a narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of 
               snow in front of it

               int  train  day

               sitting in the train leaning against the misty window 
               johana cross 27 has clear quick charm and a sort of 
               romantic fragility  she is dressed simply but warmly

               she looks through the window all she sees is white

               it is clear that she was not the one who decided on this 
               trip  reading the key phrases from a beatup note book 
               she calls upon an old peruvian

                                     johana

               the old man goes into a long rambling explanation

               johana nods without understanding a thing

                                     johana

               the train pulls in slowly pushing piles of snow in front 
               of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which 
               serves as the station

               a man frank bundled in a parka comes out of a snowmobile 
               parked by the station and walks up to the train

               johana steps down carrying her suitcase and drops two 
               feet in the snow as she comes off the last step  frank 
               walks over and leans down towards her

                                     frank

               frank throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile 
               jumps in and turns the ignition on  johana takes her hat 
               scarf and gloves off  frank glances over at her he is 
               both amused and charmed

                                     johana

                         does anybody live to make a second

               frank smiles and kicks the heating system then leans over 
               to check it his eyes off the road

                                     johana
                              a little worried
                         forget about the heater

               ext  lake of the demon  camp  day

               the storm is at its peak  the frozen snowmobile plows 
               along side the lake huacracocha and stops in front of a 
               cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow

               frank gets the bags out of the back  the suitcases are by 
               now frozen stiff  johana follows in his steps

               a couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in attempt 
               to protect themselves from the storm

               johana is bewildered  shacks in the middle of the andes 
               the lake of the demon and now llama that have to be 
               pushed aside to enter ones home

               as frank opens the door a man is leaving the hut  the 
               man is jacques mayol  johana and jacques pass each other 
               in slow motion  everything seems suddenly suspended time 
               sound cold

               jacques mayol instantly makes an impression on her  he is 
               now 34 still darkhaired with dark eyes  he is wearing 
               a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles  he looks 
               like some legendary creature one would dream about

               everything finally regains its formal speed  the door 
               slams the man is gone  she and frank are in the middle

               of the entrance hall  johana hasnt yet gotten over the 
               vision she has just had but she regains composure and 
               enters the next room

               int  quonset hut

               johana happily takes her gloves off

               frank puts down the bags and walks into the next room

               its a sort of laboratory filled with ultra modern 
               equipment

               a big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a 
               long wooden dock

               sitting in a corner an old peruvian man is preparing hot 
               drinks  johana drops into a chair

                                     frank
                         a drink to warm up

                              pulling out a flask
                         tea or whiskey

                         a red suit and goggles

               frank smiles and pours johana some tea  she warms her 
               hands on the cup  she asks blankly

                                     johana
                         would it be out of place to ask 
                         what hes doing

               lawrence comes in from the other side of the room

               he walks straight over to the bay window

                                     lawrence

                         getting restless its been three 
                         weeks since the accident

               something in the distance

               at the end of the dock jacques who is sitting on the edge 
               of a hole which is cut in the ice is putting a pair of 
               gloves on  he then grabs the handles of a strange machine 
               which emerges from the water and starts taking deep breaths 
               oblivious to the cold his mind completely elsewhere

                                     back in lab

                         cant believe her eyes

               lawrence is bent over one of his machines fiddling with 
               different switches

               thing hes saying

               jacques is putting on his flippers

               johana cant believe it

               onto the machine in the water  he is waving a mask

                         he isnt going to breathe

               jacques takes a deep breath turns a handle and a weight 
               yanks him straight down into the water  lawrence sets his 
               stop watch off and flips a few switches

               johana grabs his arm as if they could do something about 
               it

                         listen

               he raises the volume  we hear the mans heartbeat through 
               a small speaker

                                     lawrence
                         thats his heartbeat
                              excited
                         can you hear the speed at which 
                         its slowing down its incredible

               lawrence tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures 
               on it and hands it to johana

               it out

               jacques stops his machine by turning one of the handles

               hes deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake  he swims 
               deliberately carefully into a large tube which is hinged 
               open  he closes it around himself  his heart is still 
               slowing down  he pushes a button on the machine and a 
               flash of light bursts in the opaque night surrounding him

                         to his heart  impressive huh  
                         the flow of blood is concentrated 
                         in the brain and doesnt even feed 
                         the limbs anymore  its a phenomena 
                         that has only been observed with 
                         dolphins until now

                         breathing

                         it depends  he should come up 
                         soon
                              smiling

                         for the rest of it i wish i knew

               johana sighs with relief as jacques appears at the surface 
               in one big breath

                                     johana
                         shouldnt somebody take him a

                         coffee might be nice

               she heads towards the old peruvian and pours a cup of 
               coffee

                              little enthusiasm

               a competition like this one must require a great deal of

               smiles at him lovingly

                         you know

               he lets go of the suitcases  suddenly behind them there 
               is a loud screech of tires  the fiat tears across the

               roberto pulls the tuxedo jacket down  the doctor puts a 
               blood pressure band around enzos upper arm pumps it up

               he listens with his stethoscope

                                     doctor
                         mr molinari im terribly sorry

                         exhaustion

               lifts him in the air

               ladder to the platform  hes wearing a wet suit and fins

               he flipflops to the end of the platform

               roberto hands him his mask  the goggles are filled with 
               polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible

               only two pinholes to see through  the mask fits tightly 
               over his nose  when enzo puts it on he looks like an 
               astonished insect  enzo breathes faster and faster

               roberto holds the wire controlling the weighted diving 
               apparatus  enzo crosses himself takes a last long gulp 
               of air

               roberto releases the weight  it sinks and drags enzo down 
               he quickly disappears into the dark water

                         finds and picks up a gold coin  
                         we can see its ancient markings a 
                         youth on a dolphin

               jacques looks up  in front of him is a dolphin floating 
               vertically still apparently just watching  jacques isnt 
               scared anymore  but every time he swims toward the dolphin 
               it moves further away  it finally disappears

               head toward the dolphin pool  its pretty crowded mostly 
               kids

               pool  the trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool 
               and getting absolutely no reaction

               three other dolphins gather around the one that jacques is 
               patting

               jacques is staring at the female dolphin  it looks like 
               the animal is trying to tell him something  suddenly the 
               dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the 
               pool

               underwater  dolphin pool

               jacques hangs onto the dolphins muzzle  lets it pull 
               him along  the dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool 
               and pulls jacques to the bottom  the other dolphins circle 
               above

               so excited by what jacques is doing she finally falls 
               into the pool

               out

               ext  sea  day

               the sun is rising on a rough sea  the committee boat is 
               anchored in the open sea 600 feet above the sea bed

               ext  committee boat  bay of taormina  day

               jacques who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just 
               laid a towel down before him  hes suited up sitting in

               the lotus position staring straight ahead clearly self

               hypnotized

               johana novelli and other officials are in the stern of 
               the boat watching last minute preparations

               the scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and aqualungs 
               flop out onto the diving platform plunge into the water 
               disappear

                              just checking
                         if there was a problem they could 
                         do something right

                         for

                                     johana
                              pointing

                         those are the divers who go down 
                         300 to 330 feet  they dive with a 
                         heliumoxygen mixture  at that 
                         depth compressed air is too 
                         dangerous because it contains carbon 
                         dioxide

                                     johana

                         that isnt for the divers actually
                         its for the balloon  it blows up 
                         and pulls the diver up like an 
                         elevator  without it with the 
                         pressure at the bottom the diver 
                         would just stay pinned to the sea 
                         bed

                              shocked
                         but doesnt jacques dive without 
                         anything

               int  boat  day  later

               on the boat novelli checks his watch  jacques comes out 
               of his room  hes dressed to dive  he ignores everyone 
               as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform  he 
               seems to be in another world  all sounds coming to him 
               are drowned out

               ext  diving platform  day

               jacques sits in the divers slot  opens his eyes slowly 
               and looks around  he puts his flippers on an assistant 
               stands at his side

               his pov

               the figures on the platform are vague the voices are 
               garbled and incomprehensible  moving almost in slow motion 
               he raises three fingers

                                     technician
                         tre minuti

               back to scene

               ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive

               they disappear one by one into the blue

               jacques uses contact lenses instead of a mask  he puts 
               them in and now his view of the world is as distorted as 
               his hearing bodies deform sounds fade

               already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his 
               system he moves into another reality altogether seems 
               to empty himself out

                                     technician
                         due minuti

               jacques fills a small tube with water  pours it into his 
               nostrils tilts his head then lets it run out he 
               puts on his gloves all his movements are slow he seems 
               to be operating in a different time zone he seems unable 
               to take his eyes off the water

               ext  end of diving platform  day

                                     technician
                         uno minuto

               jacques puts his nose clip on  he puts his hand on the 
               gueuse  closes his eyes and inhales slowly  then he takes 
               a sudden last breath nods the technician releases the 
               gueuse and in one flashing movement he disappears

                                     underwater
                         the gueuse slides down the cable  
                         jacques hangs on like a ribbon in 
                         the wind past a marker 90 feet 
                         down

               above him the boat disappears from sight

               he moves faster and faster through a sea that looks 
               like a cloudy sky  the light fades rapidly around him

               below white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night

               jacques reaches them in a matter of seconds  turns the 
               brakes brings his machine to a halt 180 feet down

               the medics are waiting for him there  they take his pulse  
               check his eyes 15 seconds normal the bubbles from 
               there scuba tanks churn the water around them

               jacques closes his eyes a tap on the shoulder he 
               releases the brake on the gueuse  plunges further this 
               time into pitch black

               below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom  he reaches 
               it and the dark diver moves to him  jacques brakes his 
               machine  moving very slowly turns his body right side 
               up  like a sleep walker jacques starts to take the plaque 
               off the plumbline pauses in the middle of the gesture

               the dark diver flashes the high sign to jacques thumb and 
               forefinger touching fingers extended all clear  jacques 
               does not respond  the diver repeats the signal  jacques 
               does not respond

               the diver taps jacques on the shoulder a beat and 
               then jacques responds thumb and forefinger touching okay

               slowly reluctantly he wraps his hand around the handle 
               of the balloon

               the dark diver quickly turns the handle for him  the 
               balloon inflates  jacques hangs on lets it carry him 
               up

               at the plague marking 210 feet jacques lets go of the the 
               balloon  with a burst of speed it darts toward the 
               surface

               jacques follows slowly undulating like a fish hes 
               getting warm now he closes his eyes

               passes the medical control without stopping without 
               even seeing it like someone asleep

               hes moving faster now toward the warmth toward the air

               jacques opens his eyes watches the lights grow brighter

               the silhouette of the boat comes back into view  60 feet 
               to go

               ext  diving platform  day

               in slow motion jacques hand holding the plaque breaks out 
               of the water followed by his arm in one continuous 
               movement his shoulders and head

               he gasps for air

               a trickle of blood comes from his nose

               flashbulbs flicker spectators cheer

               ext  open sea  a dolphin

               the dolphin the one rescued last night leaps into the 
               air in perfect harmony with jacques triumph

               ext  dolphinarium

               the dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the 
               exact same moment

               the trainer doesnt understand whats going on

               ext  diving platform  day

               jacques falls back into the water  two divers run over 
               and pull him up onto the dock

               jacques seems completely dazed almost in a trance  he 
               slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder

               it is the scream of his body in need of the surface reality 
               and the feel of the land

               johana is terrified  she can hardly breathe  everybody 
               applauds

               text engraved on it

               tape  he looks at it without understanding

               enzo explains

                                     enzo
                         its a measuring tape

               he grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground

                                     enzo

                         it from here it doesnt look like 
                         much does it

               jacques looks at him without saying a word

               enzo hands him the measuring tape

                                     enzo

               theyre locked in a long kiss  he untucks the bottom of 
               her shirt and slides his hands under it

               int  hotel room  jacques  johana  twilight

               theyre in bed making love in their fashion  moonlight 
               shines in the silver sea  in the background are the lights 
               of the bay of taormina

                                     later
                         jacques is in bed with johana  
                         they are both asleep

               suddenly he sits up as he always does after his recurrent 
               dream

               hes wide awake looks over at her sleeping  she sleeps 
               peacefully like a baby  quietly gently he eases out of 
               bed and walks to the open window

               he stands on the balcony staring at the sea  then in the 
               distance in the moonlight a dolphin leaps out of the water 
               once twice a third time

               jacques laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down 
               next to johana  she is still sound asleep

               ext  hotel  pier  night

               jacques quickly gets into one of his diving suits  he 
               puts on his flippers  the dolphin is still jumping in and 
               out of the water  jacques jumps off the pier and swims 
               over to her

               int  jacques hotel room  night

               johana rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep

               jacques absence wakes her

                                     johana
                         jacques

               she gets up and walks over to the balcony  she doesnt 
               see anything

               ext  pier  night

               johana walks down the pier and notices the little pile of 
               clothes jacques has left behind  she looks around but 
               still cant see anything  she decides to sit next to the 
               pile of clothes and waits her eyes riveted to the sea

               ext  pier  dawn

               the sky has just begun to light up again  johana is still 
               sitting next to the pile of clothes

               she is wearing jacques sweater  she looks sad yet serene  
               the look of a woman who has been thinking over the situation 
               and who has made up her mind

               tired jacques swims back to the pier  it looks as if he 
               has come out of nowhere

               he is exhausted  he takes off his flippers and gets up 
               onto the pier in front of johana  he looks at her a little 
               surprised to find her there

                                     jacques
                              warm
                         what are you doing here

               she answers in a far away voice with the same serene 
               sadness

                                     johana
                         im going to leave jacques

               dripping with water he sits down next to her  his face 
               is drawn from fatigue  she continues

                                     johana
                         im going back home

                                     jacques

                                     johana
                         because one shouldnt fall in love 
                         with creatures from the sea

                                     jacques

                         understand what youre talking

                                     jacques
                         but its not true i feel good 
                         with you it feels right

               she looks at him for a moment then takes his face in her 
               hands and rests it on her bosom as if a small child

                                     johana
                         ive got to get back to the hotel

               standing on the platform amid others  in the distance we 
               hear the rumble and whistle of a train

               johana gets on the train  the station master blows his 
               whistle

                                     jacques
                         will will we see each other

                         take good care of yourself jacques

               the train starts pulling out of the station

               himself drop in a chair

                                     enzo

               says 1125  jacques doesnt say anything and stares blankly 
               out of the window

                                     enzo

               no answer  enzo gets up and sits on the side of the bed

                                     enzo

                         to his friend jacques mayol

               the superintendent smiles sourly and gestures to a crewman

                         show them their quarters

               the three men in the capsule are  jacques enzo and the 
               tough looking capsule commander noireuter who is much too 
               professional for enzos tastes

               enzo watches through a porthole while the commander 
               concentrates on the control console  he runs through a 
               checklist of systems  jacques responds with a check as 
               he verifies each one  enzo is already bored and fed up by 
               the procedures

               jacques is lost in thought they dont look cheerful

               he takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and 
               stares at noireuter

                         because of the air pressure

               enzo and jacques burst out laughing  they keep these same 
               voice till the end of the scene

               enzo pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket

                                     enzo
                              to jacques

               enzo taps a drop onto jacques finger then on his own

               then noireuter blows up

                                     noireuter

                         be seeing mermaids everywhere

               the alcohol has an immediate effect on them

                                     enzo
                              to jacques

                         enzo gets out of the diving capsule 
                         head first

               he is connected to the capsule by a number of cables

               jacques who follows him gets completely tangled up in 
               them  they are both hilariously drunk

               int  drilling platform  control room

               the superintendent hears them laughing through the control 
               room speakers  he flips a communication switch

                                     superintendent

                         channel

               the technician nods back to him

                                     underwater
                         the two divers have gotten to the 
                         spot they are supposed to be working 
                         on  they have their arms around 
                         each other and are dancing

               noireuter watches them through the porthole  he shakes 
               his head in complete disbelief

               int  control room

               we hear the two friends humming the tune of a viennese 
               waltz

                                     superintendent

               overlooking the sea  he is very glad to hear her voice

                                     later
                         johana is still on the phone 
                         sitting in front of the bay window  
                         day is dawning

                                     johana
                              looking out at the 
                              skyline
                         its getting light out

               johana smiles  she stretches lies down on the carpeted 
               floor  jacques seems to have gone through all topics of 
               conversation

                                     jacques

                         lot you know

               johana is by now completely stretched out on the floor

                         far away and i dont know what

                         uh ah  a story

               he turns around and sits on the window sill his feet 
               dangling in mid air

               he looks at the sea seeking inspiration

                                     jacques
                         do you know how it is
                              starting again
                         do you know what youre supposed 
                         to do to meet a mermaid

                                     johana
                              with a smile

                                     jacques
                         you go down to the bottom of the 
                         sea where the water isnt even 
                         blue anymore where the sky is 
                         only a memory and you float 
                         there quietly quietly and stay 
                         there  and you decide that you 
                         will die for them only then do 
                         they start coming out  they come 
                         and greet you and they judge the 
                         love you have for them if its 
                         sincere  if its pure they 
                         will be with you and take you away 
                         forever

               johana listens with the abandon of a child being put to 
               sleep

               int  jacques room  antibes

               the sun hits the roof tops  the sea is sparkling

               the phone rings on the window sill  jacques answers

                                     jacques

                              smiling
                         absolutely positive

                                     johana vo

                         airport in nice

               jacques doesnt know what to say  he looks around him 
               cant figure out what to do

                                     jacques
                              lost
                         okay huh ill be right over

               int  airport  day

               johana is standing in front of the airport

               jacques sees her  they smile shyly at each other

               ext  street  nice  opposite the negresco hotel

               jacques and johana are sitting in the back of a taxi  the 
               driver stops in front of the hotel

                                     driver
                              loud
                         the carlton  enjoy your siesta

               jacques and johana look at each other

               int  hotel room  jacques  johana  day

               the room is in semidarkness despite the blazing sunlight 
               coming through cracks in the shutters  jacques and johana 
               are making love  jacques is on top of her his whole body 
               covered in sweat  the rumpled sheets and the movements of 
               their bodies suggest the movements of the sea  all sounds 
               are disproportionate and slightly distorted they are 
               underwater

               all johanas reluctance has vanished  both of them act 
               like people who have never felt anything like this before

               a certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling  an 
               increasing freedom  all the muscles of their bodies stretch 
               to their limits

               jacques progressively finds himself disappearing  his 
               image dissolves point by point disintegrates into 
               unbroken blue the effect creates the impression of 
               someone melting the screen is now totally blue

               a thin highpitched sound

               from the bottom of the image a tiny pinpoint starts toward 
               the camera  it is jacques naked swimming out of the 
               deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming out 
               of a dive  he comes closer and closer to the camera  
               until his head almost touches the lens

               a sudden deafening noise and we find jacques on top of 
               johana  he looks down at her speechless

                                     johana
                              a little frightened
                         are you okay

               after a long beat

                                     jacques
                          i think i love you

               int  apartment building  antibes  day

               jacques and johana step out of the elevator of a 19th 
               century building

               jacques is carrying her suitcases

                                     johana
                         why did you take me to the hotel 
                         if you live here

                                     jacques
                         youll understand

               jacques rings the door bell and sticks his key in the door

                                     johana
                              surprised
                         someone in there

               jacques nods and pushes the door open with the bags hes

               carrying  they enter a huge very old apartment filled 
               with models and paintings of boats

               jacques leads johana to the other end of the apartment

               int  bathroom  on uncle louis sort of

               its a huge oldfashioned bathroom  the centerpiece is a 
               deep ancient bathtub on faded gild feet  theres a rippling 
               shadow of a body under the bath water

               johana gasps

                                     jacques
                         dont be afraid  its my uncle
                         louis

               he goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube  uncle 
               louis underwater has been breathing through it  louis 
               head pops out of the water furious

                                     uncle louis
                         assassin

                                     jacques
                              loud as if speaking 
                              to a deaf man
                         uncle louis this is my friend

                         wagner the berlioz

                         i say  sometimes i wonder if he 
                         isnt deaf

               louis climbs out of the bathtub and pulls on a bathrobe

               behind him hes pulling two insulated wires out of the 
               bathtub  we see that theyre connected to small underwater 
               speakers  as they surface incredibly loud music blasts  
               the finale of the 1812 overture

               trumpets timpani cannons etc the sound fills the 
               room the apartment and probably all of antibes

               the three of them are at the table  there are a few scraps 
               on their plates on a threadbare lace tablecloth

               incredibly loud symphonic music is playing  louis is as 
               deaf as a fence post

               everyone has to scream over the music

                                     uncle louis
                         where are you from henrietta

                         wasnt caught  it died of cancer

               jacques shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of 
               interfering

               alright jacques nods and gives him a huge smile before

               by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round platform  
               jacques lets go of the balloon

               is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface

                         because you have to find a good 
                         reason to come back up again 
                         and i always have a hard time

               the ceiling turns into water

               jacques eyes are wide open  his face is sweating  the 
               water level from the ceiling comes down to him until he 
               is swallowed by it

               as he falls into the water we see a dolphin gulping air 
               at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue

               the dolphin meets his group about ten of them 250 kg of 
               muscles swimming at more than 40 kmh underwater  they 
               all break through the surface to gulp air regularly

               suddenly one of them leaves the group  he crosses the 
               blue and seems to make sonarlike sounds  we see a sonar 
               picture  its an image in which the dolphin will appear a 
               few seconds later  the dolphin comes up like a rocket 
               gulps air and goes back down

               the sonar image appears again  finally the dolphin 
               locates a group of fish and starts hunting them exactly 
               like a war plane  he manages to break the group in two 
               then in four and this way he isolates his victim

               he breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down  he 
               goes full power  the fish he is after are even more 
               divided  there is only one left totally lost and in a 
               panic

               the exhausted fish is swallowed

               the dolphin slows down goes back up breaks the surface 
               in slow motion  images becomes pale and bright

               he screams inhumanly

               image is white black silence

               int  hotel room  jacques

               johana opens the shutters

               the room is a shamble of broken glass water pitcher and 
               glasses lamps and vases  the windows are blown out

               jacques is lying in bed  there is a thin trickle of blood 
               coming from his nose and ears

                                     johana
                              in a panic
                         jacques are you alright

               ext  dock  jacques  johana  night

               jacques jumps into enzos boat

                                     johana
                              still worried
                         jacques  are you alright  answer 
                         me  are you alright

               she jumps down into enzos boat  he starts the engine

               the boat is racing out of the port  johana yells over the 
               sound of the engine

                                     johana
                         youve got to tell me what happened

                                     jacques
                         i saw how it has to be

               jacques parks the boat in front of the committee boats 
               diving platform  he turns on the platform lights  above

               and underwater  he throws down the diving cable  60 90 
               120 feet

               jacques gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position 
               concentrating

               johana sits down a few feet away and watches him wondering 
               just how far he is going to push this whole thing

               as the cable unrolls johana starts crying  she understands 
               that jacques is going to dive to the bottom into the blue 
               into himself

                                     johana
                         jacques you know i love you

               jacques is putting on his flippers and stands facing his 
               gueuse

                                     jacques
                              after a silence

                         ive gotta go and see

               johana starts pacing up and down the diving platform

                                     johana
                         see what  there is nothing to

                              she breaks down
                         please

               jacques has not moved he still sits motionless facing 
               his gueuse

               johana doesnt know what to do or say  she is totally 
               drained

                                     johana
                         jacques  im pregnant

                                     jacques

                         its wonderful for you

                                     johana
                         you are the father

               silence  jacques is petrified without any reaction  he 
               doesnt understand  she realizes its hopeless and stares 
               at the sea

                                     johana
                              after a while
                         i lied to keep you here

               she kisses him

                                     johana
                         promise me one thing

                                     jacques
                         anything

                                     johana
                         promise you wont forget me

               she pulls the line releasing the gueuse

               jacques takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse 
               disappears into the water  as if swallowed by the ocean

               underwater

               jacques slides along the cable pulled by the weight of 
               the gueuse  he has a beautiful smile on his face  he is 
               in his element  night has closed in around him  he turns

               on the headlight of the gueuse it casts a dim light around 
               him

               ext  diving platform  night

               johana has walked over to the edge of the platform  she 
               is holding the cable to hear jacques descent

               the counter shows that jacques is quickly passing the 300 
               feet mark

               underwater

               jacques keeps going down as serene as ever  he has gained 
               a lot of speed

               ext  diving platform  night

               johana holds her face in her hands  the counter indicates 
               that jacques is going very fast

               underwater

               the gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable  jacques 
               turns his body right side up

               ext  diving platform  night

               the counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet

               johana has felt the jolt of the cable  she cries her tears 
               and looks down at the water

               underwater

               the headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet 
               around jacques as if he were standing in a circle of light  
               he stays there patiently floating around and around his 
               cable as if he were waiting for something

               a long form circles the border between the darkness and 
               the light

               jacques holds out his hand  a dolphin comes and presses 
               its body against it  two other dolphins come out of the 
               night  jacques watches in amazement

               a dolphin lays his muzzle in jacques hand ready to lead 
               him off  jacques hesitates

               jacques lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away

               their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night

               the end
