                         evidentiary support

               stromwell is somewhat impressed but doesnt show it

                         and what kind of evidentiary support 
                         does this case require lets ask 
                         mr harriman who clearly believes 
                         that i might be hungry

               unknowingly has eat me written on his forehead he looks 
               back at her confused as the students around him snicker

               a closed sign is on the door

               less madeup elle takes notes on her laptop as warner makes 
               an argument

                                     warner
                         according to swinney v neubert 
                         swinney who was also a private sperm 
                         donor was allowed visitation rights 
                         as long as he came to terms with the 
                         hours set forth by the parents so 
                         if were sticking to past precedent 
                         mr latimer wasnt stalking  he 
                         was clearly within his rights to ask 
                         for visitation

                                     professor donovan
                         but swinney was a onetime sperm 
                         donor and in our case the defendant 
                         was a habitual sperm donor who also 
                         happens to be harassing the parents 
                         in his quest for visitation

                         but without this mans sperm  the 
                         child in question would not exist

               he grins and looks around as the class murmurs their 
               agreement

                         although mr huntington makes an 
                         excellent point i have to wonder if 
                         the defendant kept a thorough record 
                         of each sperm emission made throughout 
                         his life

                         why do you ask

               elles hesitancy is replaced by conviction

                                     elle
                         well unless the defendant attempted 
                         to contact every single onenight 
                         stand to determine if a child resulted 
                         in those unions  then he has no 
                         parental claim whatsoever over this 
                         child why this sperm why now

               emmetts mouth twitches into a smile

                                     elle
                         for that matter all masturbatory 
                         emissions where his sperm was clearly 
                         not seeking an egg could be termed 
                         reckless abandonment

                         and d brooke is obviously hiding 
                         something

                                     elle
                         but maybe its not what you think

                         but maybe it is

                                     elle
                         because people arent always what 
                         they seem to be and you refuse to 
                         see that have a little faith you 
                         might be surprised

                         out that not only is there no proof 
                         in this case but theres a complete 
                         lack of mens rea which by definition 
                         tells us that there is no crime 
                         without a vicious will

               the da rolls her eyes as do the lawyers present

                         where she was completely hosed down 
                         from head to toe

                         chutney why is it that tracy 
                         marcinkos curls were ruined when 
                         she got hosed down

                                     chutney

                                     elle
                         thats right because isnt the first 
                         cardinal rule of perm maintenance 
                         that you are forbidden to wet your 
                         hair for at least twentyfour hours 
                         after getting a perm at the risk of 
                         deactivating the ammonium 
                         thiglycolate

                         and wouldnt someone whos had thirty 
                         perms throughout her lifetime be 
                         well aware of this rule

               chutney doesnt answer she just glares at brooke

                                     elle
                         and if you in fact were not washing 
                         your hair as i suspect you were 
                         not since your curls are still 
                         intact wouldnt you have heard the 
                         gunshot

                         then brooke windham wouldnt have 
                         had time to hide the gun before you 
                         got downstairs which would mean 
                         that you wouldve had to have found 
                         mrs windham with a gun in her hand 
                         to make your story sound plausible 
                         isnt that right

                                     chutney
                         shes younger than i am did she 
                         tell you that how would you feel if 
                         your father married someone younger 
                         than you

                         gun didnt you chutney after you 
                         shot your father
