close on a finelyworked medieval tapestry  in the
background beyond the intricate foliage stands a moated
castle where a troop of mounted hunters set out for the
chase with dogs and lances  in the foreground a lovely
young maiden heads for the forest carrying an armful of
flowers  the forest stylistically rendered by the
weavers art has numbers of small animals cunningly
worked into the warp and woof  a green man clad only in
leaves and vines hides behind a tree watching a stately
pair of unicorns grazing on the greensward

                                            dissolve to

ext  forest glade  day

the woven image on the tapestry gives way to a pair of
white unicorns browsing in a sundappled glade  a male
and female these animals are of surpassing beauty their
tapered spiraling horns glowing like precious metal
their movements are so graceful that every other living
creature seems clumsy by comparison  the sound of a
distant hunting horn makes them pause  a second note is
heard  the unicorns drift silent and languid into the
farther reaches of the forest


ext  hillside overlooking castle  day

the hunting horn sounds a third time  a young woman still
close to childhood fifteen at most turns back to look at
the castle in the distance  a troop of armed men rides
out hunting accompanied by braying hounds and the blare
of horns  one of the company is masked and dressed all in
black

the girls name is lili  she is a princess of the distant
castle and dressed in splendid brocades and silk  in her
arms she carries a bouquet of wildflowers wrapped in a
lace napkin  like these blossoms she herself is young
and fresh and innocent  she sings a simple country air as
she runs through the waving grass toward the deep woods


ext  deep woods  day

on an emerald patch of moss in the shade beneath the
spreading limbs of chestnuts and oaks numbers of small
animals gambol  squirrels and rabbits hedgehogs and
foxes all manner of creatures leap and frolic about the
feet of a curious young man  this is jack o the green
his hair is long and unshorn and he wears a costume woven
from ivy leaves skins and vines  on his feet are bark
sandals  his features are tanned berrybrown and woven
into his tangled locks is a wreath of flowers  he is a
legendary green man or wild man who lives the free
life of a hermit alone in the deep woods

jack the green man feeds morsels of bread and fruit to
the animals dancing around his feet  he is a friend to
all the beasts of the forest and carries food for them in
a splitwillow basket  birds fly down and land on his
head and shoulders taking seeds and nuts from his lips

the musical sound of someone approaching alerts him  his
eyes have an animal quickness and his instincts are as
finely tuned as any creature of the wild  the birds fly
from his shoulders to the treetops  his furred companions
dart for cover  in three quick bounds jack is himself up
a nearby tree clinging to a high branch like a cat

the princess lili comes singing down the path  she spots
the fallen willow basket and looks around for the green
man

                         lili
                  calling
          jack hello jack

there is no answer  puzzled lili sits on the moss puts
aside her flowers and rummages through the contents of
the basket  the dried apples walnuts and sunflowers
dont occupy her for long  she is annoyed  a princess is
not someone to trifle with

                         lili
                  calling
          jackothegreen  green jack
          oh bother i know youre here  why
          are you so cruel

unseen high in his tree jackothegreen watches the
young princess  he is amused by her anger but there is
nothing malicious about his smile  he climbs quietly to a
lower branch hangs suspended for a moment then drops

jack lands close to the unsuspecting girl  startled she
screams in surprise  jack laughs at her unwarranted
terror

                         jack
          greetings my lady the green wood
          is honored

                         lili
          oh jack you are a wild man to use
          me so

jack spies the bouquet of wildflowers and reaches for it

                         jack
          these for me

                         lili
          if you like

jack gathers up the bouquet bowing low as he jumps to his
feet  a bluebird flies out of the greenery and lands on
his shoulder

                         jack
                  to the bird
          she brings a gift as fair as
          herself


ext  another part of the forest  day

the green man and the princess wander together down a
meandering path  birds circle about them and numbers of
small animals scamper shyly at their heels

                         lili
          you promised

                         jack
          never

                         lili
          but you did you did

                         jack
          i may have said perhaps

                         lili
          liar

                         jack
          or perchance

the distant blare of a hunting horn interrupts them  the
animals freeze wildeyed

                         lili
          its my father gone ahunting  the
          baron couer de noir is his guest and
          must be provided with some sport

                         jack
                  bitterly
          sport indeed

                         lili
          the baron is a frightful man  they
          say hes an ogre  he wears a mask
          so none may see his face

                         jack
          blackheart  aptly named

                         lili
          oh fie  what about the unicorn

                         jack
          unicorn

                         lili
          a promise is a sacred oath

                         jack
          all right  ill show you something
          sacred


ext  a clearing by a stream  day

a small meadow  a sungilded amphitheater within the
darker confines of the forest  at its edge flows a gentle
stream  an evillooking viper moves sinuously along the
grassy back as jack and lili step from the concealing
shrubbery nearby

                         lili
          lets rest a minute  im so
          thirsty

                         jack
          stop complaining

                         lili
          a gentleman would offer water

                         jack
          only were he a fool to boot
                  pointing
          see yon viper

                         lili
                  shuddering
          i detest serpents

                         jack
          that viper has envenomed the water
          no animal will drink here now

                         lili
          what shall we do

                         jack
          be patient

they crouch together behind the shrubbery

                         lili
          oh dear

                         jack

                         lili
          ive lost my napkin  it was all
          elfwork and lace i must have
          dropped it when you startled me so

                         jack
                  rising
          ill go search for it

                         lili
          dont leave me now  i fear the
          unicorn wont show himself without
          you

                         jack
          im not its master

                         lili
                  touching his arm
          the napkin will keep  id rather
          not be alone

                         jack
                  with a smile
          your command is my wish princess
          lili


ext  deep woods  day

a pair of ferocious hounds bray under the tree in which
jack was hiding  another sniffs at a few scattered
blossoms and lilis lace napkin lying forgotten on the
moss

the hunting party rides up at a gallop  at the head of
the troops are lilis father king godwin pinkcheeked
and whitebearded a kindhearted elfish man though weak
and ineffectual and baron couer de noir a powerful
knight on a black charger  his greaves and breastplate
are black as midnight as is the heavy cloak which envelops
him  his hands are covered with black gauntlets and a
horned black hood with a wolfs lupine features masks his
face  his voice rumbles with dread authority as the party
reins to a stop

                         baron
          what spoor have the hounds for us

a lancebearer dismounts and takes the lace kerchief from
the dogs foaming mouth

                         king godwin
          my daughters napkin  thats
          certain

the baron unstraps a crossbow from his saddle leathers

                         baron
          we proceed  have three men restrain
          the dogs  dont come until you hear
          the horns

the hunters ride on leaving the dog handlers to control
the straining hounds


ext  clearing  day

lili and jack wait behind the bushes watching the stream

                         lili
          how much longer

                         jack
          shhh

                         lili
                  whispering
          i am a princess  you have no right
          to order me about

                         jack
          in these woods you are a commoner
          now be quiet  true royalty
          approaches

the stream  lili and jacks pov

the pair of radiant white unicorns pushes through the
undergrowth to the edge of the stream

                         lili os
          ohhhh theyre so beautiful

the male unicorn bends his head and dips his golden horn
into the stream  soon after the female begins to drink
and numbers of small animals rabbits mice and
squirrels creep from under cover to drink as well

                         jack os
          the alicorn purifies the water
          purging it of all poison

jack and lili

the princess is entranced  a look of utter rapture
illuminates her features

                         lili
          such grace and their smell its
          ambrosia

                         jack
          they rival the angels of paradise

                         lili
          oh jack mightnt i touch one  it
          would thrill me so

                         jack
          are you honest

                         lili
          jack

                         jack
          tis a fair question  if you be a
          virtuous maid the unicorn will lay
          his head in your lap

                         lili
          hell not flee if i show myself

                         jack
          not if you be chaste  tis an
          awesome test of virginity

                         lili
          ive no fear of failure  your
          implications are most unbecoming

                         jack
          im not your judge nor have i any
          desire to witness the trial

jack turns to leave

                         lili
          where are you going

                         jack
          to fetch your napkin

jack pushes through the underbrush and is lost from sight
for a moment the princess is confused and nervous at
being left alone in such circumstances but she peers out
at the unicorns and the sight of such beauty rekindles her
resolve

princess lili steps out of the concealing underbrush and
walks slowly to the center of the clearing  her bearing
is noble and proud her carriage utterly dignified

the unicorns lift their heads from the stream and watch
the girls progress  the other smaller animals cease
drinking and scatter into hiding

lili sits on the grass in the center of the clearing
spreading her gown around her  she smiles at the staring
unicorns

the male unicorn grows agitated  his nostrils flare the
strong neck arches  sunlight gleams on the shaft of his
golden horn as he prances across the stream to the meadow
sending multihued clouds of butterflies aloft from the
flowers underfoot

lili smiles at the nimble dancing of the unicorn
seemingly drawn to her by an invisible lead  he rears up
whinnying in protest but the lure is too strong
something unspoken compels him toward the smiling girl


ext  another part of the forest  day

jack hurries along the overgrown path running as numbly
as a wild stag  the sound of approaching hoofbeats brings
him up short  with the instincts of an animal jack darts
into concealment  after a moment the hunting party rides
past sunlight glinting on the steel lancetips  the
baron holds his crossbow at the ready as black and grim
as death himself

when the hunters are gone from sight jack hurries form
his hidingplace  he realizes something is terribly wrong
and runs back through the woods leaping rocks and
deadfall logs in a desperate attempt to reach the clearing
before them


ext  clearing  day

the princess makes no move as the trembling unicorn stands
before her the tip of his rapiersharp horn pressed
against her breast  at this moment he could kill her in
an instant yet she does not resist or show any fear
instead she smiles with joy

slowly the unicorn kneels first folding his forelegs
then settling his hindquarters onto the grass  his limpid
eye meets lilis adoring gaze  without a sound he
settles his great head in the virgins lap his long white
mane spreading over her like a shawl

close on lili and the unicorn

the girl strokes the unicorns head running her hand
lovingly down the spiraling horn  the animal seems
totally in her power  he closes his eyes and nuzzles her
bodice  almost without thinking princess lili unbuttons
the top of her gown exposing her pale breasts  the
entranced unicorn immediately begins to suckle like a
newborn creature  lili hugs the white head to her bosom
consumed by ecstasy and bliss


ext  edge of the clearing  day

king godwin the baron and his cohorts ride silently up to
the edge of the clearing screened from view by the
surrounding trees  the baron holds up his gloved hand and
hisses a whispered command

                         baron
          hold

the other riders rein to a stop  the baron guides his
horse closer to the edge of the clearing parting the
branches which conceal him

barons pov

through a fringe of leaves the baron sees the princess
nursing the reclining unicorn a tableaux at once
reminiscent of the madonna and the infant jesus

the baron

as he inserts a bolt in his crossbow and cranks back the
string until it is taut  placing the weapon to his
shoulder the baron takes careful aim


ext  center of the clearing  day

lili croons to the unicorn resting on her breast a
primitive melody born of joy  all at once the sibilant
sound of an arrows slicing passage rends the still air
the crossbow bolt strikes the unicorn in the neck  the
startled outcry of the wounded beast is far more scream
than whinny

the unicorn bounds to his feet spraying the princess with
his bright blood  she is torn from her happy reverie by
the violence of the act  her own outcry merges with the
animals wail of pain

the wounded unicorn followed by his mate gallops for
freedom across the clearing

the black baron bursts from the far side of the meadow and
thunders after the fleeing unicorns  king godwin is right
behind followed by his retinue of lancebearing hunters

                         lili
                  screaming
          no  god  father no

the horsemen gallop out of sight accompanied by the call
of the hunting horn and much eager shouting

jack crashes through the underbrush surrounding the
clearing and rushes to the side of the anguished lili who
cowers replacing her bloodsoaked bodice

                         jack
                  furious
          what happened

                         lili
          i dont know  theyve hurt the
          unicorn

                         jack
          who

                         lili
          my father and the baron

                         jack
          damned hunters  it was a trap and
          you were the bait

                         lili
          i didnt know i didnt
                  sobbing
          it was so lovely he was in my lap
          like like a baby and i

                         jack
          they tricked you

                         lili
          my own father

                         jack
          how bad was the unicorns wound

                         lili
          it happened so fast  he was hurt
          and ran away

                         jack
          he did run

                         lili
          oh yes and the mare with him

                         jack
          good  theyll never catch him
          theres not a mount in the kingdom
          can outrun a unicorn


ext  deep in the forest  day

flecked with froth and blood the male unicorn bursts from
a thicket in full flight  wildeyed the female is right
behind  they pause for a moment sides heaving as they
gasp for air  in the distance the sounds of braying
hounds and the musical note of the hunting horn start them
running again


ext  forest  day

led by the baron and the redeyed hounds the hunting
party thunders through the woods in full pursuit of the
unicorns

one of the riders has a hunting horn coiled around his
shoulder  he blows a single sustained note as he gallops
past


ext  pond in the forest  day

the pool is a crystalline jewel surrounded by moss
covered stones the tranquil water reflecting the
overhanging trees  lili kneels by the edge washing the
blood from her embroidered dress  jack watches her
reclining on a gnarled treeroot nearby

                         jack
          there are many would pay a kings
          ransom for a few drops of unicorn
          blood

                         lili
          i dont want it on me

                         jack
          its powers are strong

                         lili
          i dont want to be reminded of what
          happened

                         jack
          do you think memory can be washed
          away like a few spots of blood


ext  forest stream  day

the warlike sounds of the hunting party grow nearer as
the two unicorns pause in their flight to drink from the
stream  tenderly the mare nuzzles the stallions neck
near where the dart cruelly rends his flesh  the two
animals exchange a look of understanding  the situation
is desperate their pursuers very near  the stallion
motions upstream with his head and his mate sadly
comprehends  she starts slowly up stream looking back
over her shoulder  the hunting horn blares nearer still
the stallion whinnies at the mare and she replies before
plunging up the stream to safety while her mate remains
behind awaiting his destiny


ext  near forest stream  day

the hounds are frantic now the scent very strong  they
lope ahead of the riders baying like demons from hell
the baron is right behind leading the hunters in a
daredevil chase through the woods  in their helmets and
chain mail with steeltipped lances glinting on high
they are as fearsome as an army of fiends

hunters pov

ahead through the trees the wounded male unicorn is
glimpsed standing alone by the stream  the dogs howling
grows furious  the hunters shout and bellow


ext  forest stream  day

the dogs break from the forest and hurl themselves at the
unicorn  with a swift jab the stallion impales the first
hound on his horn and sends him flying  just as the pack
of hunters emerges from the woods the unicorn takes off
leaping over the heads of the snarling hounds darting
away between the trees  the hunters and their dogs are in
close pursuit eager now for the kill


ext  pond in the forest  day

lili and jack sit among the roots and mossy rocks
bordering the still ponds  a shaft of golden light angles
down through the cathedral arching of tree limbs above
them  lilis dress is cleansed of blood and she reclines
against a tree trunk sadly singing a simple ballad in a
clear soprano voice  jack is entranced  his teasing
look has transformed into a gaze of utter adoration

                         lili
                  singing
          once there was a lady fair
          rode out on her milkwhite steed
          roses and dewdrops woven in her hair
          and in her heart  the devils seed

          sweet william did ahunting go
          all in the deep wood where faeries dwell
          from dawn til dark roamed he to and fro
          lost o lost all under their spell

          came he at last to where bluebells grow
          and he heard them ring tis true to tell
          and he lay him down and did not know
          the flowers sound was his own death knell

          for while he slept came the lady fair
          and gathered him up behind her saddle
          now all ye young hunters of bluebells beware
          for sweet william rode straight through
          the gates of hell


ext  river estuary  day

a broad river flows toward the sea divided into multi
branched channels across acres and mud flats  the surf
curls and crashes in the distance  shore birds probe the
muck with their curved bills

the wounded unicorn breaks from the green line of trees
along the edge of the estuary  the sounds of dogs and
hunting horns can be heard close behind  without pausing
the stallion gallops frantically out onto the mud flats

the unicorns sides are streaked with blood and sweat  a
brightred froth bubbles on his nostrils  his eyes are
wide with panic

the thick mud underfoot sucks at the unicorns galloping
hooves  all at once the unicorn stumbles and falls
cartwheeling in the muck  he struggles to regain his
feet but slips again floundering

the hunters ride out of the trees and reinin at the edge
of the estuary  the howling dogs struggle across the mud
toward the fallen unicorn


ext  pond  day

lili and jack under the tree  the princess smiles at the
adoring boy toying with her golden ring which she pulls
on and off her finger

                         jack
          not even the birds sing sweet as
          you

                         lili

ext  estuary  day

the unicorn struggles in the mud hopelessly mired when
the dog packs converges upon it  baying and snarling the
dogs surround the stallion nipping and harrying  the
unicorn fights back thrusting his terrible horn impaling
an unwary hound that ventured too close

the hunters watch from the bank awaiting their leaders
command to close in for the kill  the baron dismounts
holding his crossbow  he hands his reins to king godwin

                         baron
          the quarry is at bay  attend me
          here while i make the kill

black cloak whipping in the wind the masked baron strides
out onto the mud flats relentless as the specter of
death

the sky above darkens  black storm clouds gather and the
ominous rumble of thunder troubles the grim landscape


ext  pond  day

the light has changed  it is darker now  a distant peal
of thunder is heard

                         jack
          im afraid it may storm

                         lili
          let it  havent you a cozy bower we
          might hide in

                         jack
          tis not fit for a princess

                         lili
          be it fit for your wife green jack

                         jack
          i have no wife

                         lili
          then perchance youll me

                         jack
          if wishes were horses even beggars
          would ride

                         lili
          do you wish it jack
                  showing him her
                   ring
          wish you this our wedding band

                         jack
          what if i answer yes  will my wish
          come true

laughing lili throws her ring high over their heads
tracing a golden arc through the air the ring lands with
a splash in the center of the pond

                         lili
          fetch my ring and you may take me
          for your wife

it is obvious from her mocking attitude that lili is
teasing but jack is serious  he strips off his leafand
fur vestments and dives headlong into the pond


ext  estuary  day

the barons heavy black boots splash across the shallow
water of the estuary as he bears down on the harried
unicorn  the frantic trapped stallion is within range now
and the baron lifts his crossbow to his shoulder the wolf
mask leering and demonic as he takes aim

the baron fires  the bolt strikes the unicorns flank
piercing his ribs  a froth of lungblood foams into the
mud  the stallion screams  his frightened eye is bright
and staring


ext  beneath the surface of the pond  day

slowly the golden ring drifts downward tumbling end
overend in a lazy spiral to the dark and muddy bottom

jacks pale nearnaked form stabs through the crystal
water a trail of silver bubbles streaming in his wake
like a comets tail  he strokes down into the murk
tendrils of waterweed swirling about him  in the
distance the tantalizing glint of the drifting ring lures
him on

the ring settles into the mud on the bottom concealed by
waving weeds and algae  jack searches blindly for it
groping with his hands as billowing clouds of silt rise
about him


ext  sky  day

the black clouds boil and crash thunderheads mounting one
upon another in a dark maelstrom  jagged lightning splits
the sky  the heavens are in a tumult


ext  estuary  day

the barons dark figure looms over the fallen unicorn
his gloved hand reaches out and grasps the ivory horn
wrenching back the animals head  the barons glove
smolders and burns as if the horn was a whitehot poker
the stallions shrill whinny is cut short when the baron
lops off his head with a single brutal stroke of his
broadsword

the roar of thunder seems to crack the sky apart  for a
long moment the baron stands holding his grisly dripping
trophy by the single horn staring up at the raging dark
sky as his black cloak whips about him in the ferocious
wind


ext  beneath the pond  day

his lungs about to burst jack can no longer continue the
search for the ring  he turns and looks up at the surface
which has grown quite dark  with frantic strokes he
races upward only to bump his head into something solid at
the top  terribly frightened he finds the surface
covered by a sheet of ice

jack pounds his fist against the obstructing ice and
succeeds in punching through it thrusting his gasping
head out into the air


ext  pond  day

bewildered jack crashes through the ice towards shore
the woods have changed utterly  in place of the bountiful
foliage of midsummer the trees are stripped bare  the
wind howls driving a fine stinging snow through the naked
branches  overhead the sky is dark and ominous  jack
stands confused and shivering realizing in his
bewilderment that the girl is gone

                         jack
                  calling out
          lili  princess lili where are
          you

there is no answer other than the hollow echo of his words
lost on the wind  it is bitterly cold  jacks wet hair
freezes into strands of icicles  he finds his clothing
wrapping himself in his fur vest  his leafy cloak is
inadequate for this weather and he hurries off calling
for the girl as he searches for shelter

                         jack
          lili answer me lili


ext  deeper in the forest  evening

the snowstorm has builtup into a fullscale blizzard
jack staggers into the wind  a large rock overhang
provides shelter and jack scrambles underneath

jack scrapes together a small pile of twigs and leaves
taking a flint and steel from his shoulder pouch he
starts busily striking sparks

a small fire burns vigorously under the overhang  jack
warms himself and feeds sticks into the flames  it grows
darker


ext  a tree not far away  evening

princess lili hides shivering behind the tree watching
jack and his fire  her hands are out of sight tucked in
the folds of her gown for warmth  although she is cold
and frightened she makes no move to expose herself or to
join the green man under the overhand

close on lili

lilis lovely face contorts with sorrow  a single tear
starts in her eye and drops to her cheek where it freezes
like a diamond beautyspot  lili reaches up to wipe away
the frozen tear  her hand is horribly transformed
coarse black hairs sprout along her wrist and down her
slender fingers  in place of delicately tapered nails
grow wickedly curved claws  it is a hand more animal than
human  lili regards it with disgust


ext  forest  evening

with jacks small fire flickering faintly in the distance
princess lili slinks away into the deep forest eager to
hide herself and her shame


ext  overhang  night

jack is sleeping  he leans back against the rock wall
wrapped in his cloak  the fire crackles brightly before
him casting animated shadows in all directions

a highpitched cackling laugh causes jack to sit bolt
upright wideeyed and completely awake

                         jack
          what  whos there

jacks pov

glowing like foxfire in the darkness a semicircle of
luminous green eyes surrounds jacks campfire

                         jack os
          who is it  speak up

a second odd laugh is his only answer

jack

is afraid  he reaches into the folds of his cloak for his
knife a small practical affair hardly a weapon at all

                         jack
          who are you  answer me

laughing still a small man an elf no more than kneehigh
steps into the firelight  he carries a tiny harp and a
pair of pointed ears sprout from the wild tangle of his
hair  his bright clothing is everywhere tasseled and
embroidered with flowers  at first glance it is hard to
tell whether his face resembles a newborn babe or a
wizened old man  his name is honeythorn gump

                         gump
          so jack think you be a green man
          and not know gump

                         jack
          gump is it

                         gump
          aye honeythorn gump come to
          serenade you jack come to make
          you dance

                         jack
          im in no mood for dancing

                         gump
          oh but you will be jack think
          you to sleep in a faerie ring and
          not spend the night adancing

                         jack
          faerie ring

                         gump
          to be sure

gump steps back and sweeps away the snow with his cap like
an overzealous house porter  a ring of red toadstools is
revealed

                         gump
          a lively reel twill warm your bones

gump throws a handful of herbs onto the fire and the
flames leap high revealing the watchers whose eyes glowed
in the dark  sitting in a semicircle just outside the
faerie ring are a number of foxes wild goats hares
weasels and badgers

                         gump
          here be your partners jack

gump begins to strum a wild haunting melody on his harp
the animals leap into the faerie ring and linking paws
start a frantic circular dance around the bewildered jack

                         jack
          no  tis not the time  i want no
          part of your frolic

                         gump
          dance jack  the nights but begun

jack cannot resist  he is drawn into the wild dance
grabbing hold of a foxs paw he joins the circle leaping
and cavorting to the maddening music

the tempo increases the music growing evermore manic as
the crazed dancers whirl and caper  jack seems in a
panic dancing against his will a prisoner of the
frenzied harpstrumming

                         jack
                  screaming
          stop it  no more

gump pays no attention to his pleas jumping wildly up and
down as he flails at his harp

                         gump
          round and round and round and round
          before youre lost ye most be
          found

jacks face is a mask of agony the dance pure hell  with
a supreme effort of will he wrenches free from the foxs
grasp and hurls himself to the ground by the fire  the
rhythm disrupted the other animal dancers continue
awkwardly as the music stops  gump is furious

                         jack
          enough

                         gump
          and how is it a mortal dare dictate
          to the faerie folk  is me music not
          to your liking  mayhap the dance of
          death by more your pleasure

                         jack
          no i i need to rest

                         gump
          youll have a long long rest in the
          tomb me lad

                         jack
                  gasping
          i meant no disrespect

                         gump
          didnt you now  well then answer
          me this riddle and all be forgiven

                         jack
          and if i cannot

                         gump
          why jack then tis your death song
          ill be strumming

the animal dancers have stopped their frolic and stand
solemnly watching the bewildered green man

                         jack
          ask away and pray god my answer
          pleases thee

gump grins maliciously and strums a melancholy chord on
his harp

                         gump
          what is a bell that does not ring
          yet its knell makes the angels
          sing

gump laughs knowing fullwell jack cant solve his
riddle  jack frowns in concentration then breaks into a
broad grin as the memory of lilis song rushes back to
him

                         jack
          its bluebells

                         gump
          what

                         jack
          the flower  bluebells  to hear
          them ringing means your lifes at an
          end

gump hurls his harp to the ground and stomps on it

                         gump
          damnation  codfish and cockles
          gammon and trotters  youve bested
          me jack

                         jack
          a riddle without an answer is but an
          empty cup when youre thirsty for
          wine

                         gump
                  pleased with this
          well spoke  true to the mark  and
          if its wine youre wanting its
          wine we shall have

honeythorn gump strides to the rear of the overhang and
brushing away the concealing cobwebs ferns and moss
reveals a small wooden door built into the rock itself
gump throws open the door and bows low for jack to enter

                         gump
          you be our guest jack

                         jack
                  returning the bow
          im honored honeythorn gump but
          no more tricks

                         gump
          you have me word lad  to answer a
          faerie riddle deserves as much

                         jack
          twas the princess lili gave me the
          answer have you seen her by
          chance

                         gump
          ive laid eyes on no mortal but you
          this day jack

                         jack
          i fear shes lost

                         gump
          mayhap you be the one whats lost
          and she safe by the castle hearth
          but come jack well warm your
          bones

gump moves to the fire and pulls a burning brand from the
flames  as he does so the animal dancers subtly shift
and change their forms dissolving like mist in the
morning sun transforming into faerie creatures  the fox
becomes a lithe winged female wood nymph the badger a
squat goblin  the other animals change into a variety of
pixies gnomes and brownies all chattering and singing in
an ancient musical tongue

gump leads the way through the door in the rock followed
by jack and the teasing faeries

                         gump
                  singing
          there was a wee faerie lived under the hill
          hey riddlediddle and nicketynoo
          and if hes nae gone hes living there still
          nickety nackety noonoonoo


int  tunnel  night

a narrow tunnel winds under the hill twisting down
between gnarled treeroots and projecting splinters of
ancient bone  a rickety set of wooden steps has been
built in this tunnel and gump leads the precarious way
down into the earth holding his torch on high and singing
for all his worth  the other faeries tease jack
jabbering and twitting and they pull his hair and tug at
his clothing  jack does his best to ignore them and at
the same time maintain a brave demeanor as he struggles
for balance on the creaking stairs

                         gump
                  singing
          the name of this faerie was honeythorn gump
          hey riddlediddle and nicketynoo
          the sound of his harp made the mortals all jump
          nickety nackety noonoonoo

          at the stroke of midnight in the light of the
          moon
          hey riddlediddle and nicketynoo
          all the faeries dance to honeythorns tune
          nicketynackety noonoonoo


int  subterranean hall  night

gump guides the procession in to a vast underground hall
hung with fine tapestries and filled with all manner of
odd and ancient wonders  roman armor bits of mosaics and
marble statuary etc  a long wooden trestle table
stretches down the center of the hall set with burning
candles bowls of fruit and nuts golden goblets of every
shape and size

gump tosses his torch into an open glowing firepit the
smoke drifting up to the shrouded treeroots above

                         gump
          here we be  and fit for a king if i
          say so meself

jack is properly awed

                         jack
          tis splendid  i feel i must be
          dreaming

this delights the faeries who twitter with laughter as
they buzz around jack guiding him to the carved high seat
at the head of the table

                         gump
          indeed me lad  and if life is a
          dream better you dread the waking

several rows of wine casks are ranked against one wall
gump seizes a large flagon from the table and fills it
with sparkling elderberry wine

jack sits somewhat uncomfortably in the high seat with its
ornately carved dragons and basalisks entwined about him
the beautiful wood nymph hovers by his side smiling and
whispering in his ear

gump fills jacks goblet from the flagon and sets about
filling the others in turn down the table  jack is
embarrassed by the wood nymphs obvious attentions

                         jack
          make her stop it will you gump
          please

gump snorts

                         gump
          why jacklad she likes you is
          all  and what hotblooded hero
          wouldnt welcome the affections of a
          fair nymph like oona here  if
          your blood runs so cold boy you be
          a corpse before your time

                         jack
          what does she want from me

oona the woodnymph giggles wildly and covers jacks
cheek with kisses as she hovers at his side

                         gump
          fool question lad  drink up and
          warm your blood  youll find the
          answer at the bottom of your cup

gump motions with his flagon for jack to drink but the
green man merely lifts his goblet and stares dolefully at
the contents

                         gump
          elderberry wine  no finer drink
          under heaven

                         jack
          it looks er delicious
                  sniffing his cup
          such a fine bouquet very
          aromatic

                         gump
          are ye afraid of me wine  did your
          momma tell ye never to take food nor
          drink from the wee folk  think if
          ye sup with the faeries youll be
          enchanted

                         jack
          well i i dont want to be
          rude but its generally known
          that 

                         gump
          generally known  what general ever
          knew more than to lace up his boots

                         jack
          please dont misunderstand  i am
          grateful for your hospitality and 

                         gump
          he is afraid of enchantment  will
          you listen to the fool prattle on

all the faeries and goblins burst into raucous laughter

                         gump
          here the world is turned upside
          down precious summertime frozen
          into a wintry memory the
          underworld unleashed and all spirits
          walk the earth at will this be
          the state of things and the blamed
          fool wont take a sip of wine for
          fear of enchantment

jack swallows his fear  he stares heard into his cup and
in a single decisive moment drains it to the bottom  the
faeries all clap and cheer  oona gives him a big hug

                         jack
          but but why

                         gump
          big question that lad  why what

                         jack
          why has this happened to the world
          why is it winter now and dark

                         gump
          aye  honeythorn gumpd be a
          powerful wizard indeed could he
          answer

                         jack

                         gump
          if youre looking for enchantment
          jack that i can give thee

gump screws up his face with concentration and gestures
with his emerald ring  all at once the carved dragons
and serpents on jacks chair seem to come alive  they
writhe out of the woodwork sinuous and evil  jack is
terrified as they wrap about him pinning his arms and
chest to the chair as oona and the other faeries laugh
with malicious glee

                         jack
          no  stop it now please

gump snaps his fingers and the chair is but a chair again
the carved snakes mere decorations

                         gump
          that much magic i can offer ye a
          small measure of entertainment at

          man but for big questions ye must
          go elsewhere

                         jack
          dont you care about whats
          happened

                         gump

          world locked in a season of death
          frozen up no folks to scare out of
          their wits on a summers night no

          cast think thats an enjoyable
          prospect

          free  if ye want to ask ask jenny

                         jack
          jenny greenteeth  whos she

and chatter frantically

                         gump

          lad  if youve the courage to ask
          and take care to avoid her terrible
          claws jenny greenteeth has the

          tonight
                  he lifts his flagon
                   high
           tonight is for making merry

gump drinks the flagon down  the other faeries and jack
join in the festivities lifting their goblets in a
single raucous toast


ext  frozen stream  day

it is shortly after dawn but the feeble winter sun
provides little warmth or light  the gray day has the
appearance of perpetual twilight  from the rear we
easily recognize princess lili as she moves toward the
frozen stream  her fine embroidered dress is soiled and
torn her long unbound hair matted and stuck with burrs
and twigs  shes had a rough night in the open  at the
streams edge she kneels her back still to the camera

close on the frozen stream

lilis furred clawlike hand reaches out and wipes a
covering of snow from the ice  the frozen surface of the
stream provides an uneven mirror which makes the
reflection of lilis face appear even more monstrous

lili

the distant sound of laughter and singing causes lili to
look up from the ice  her face is hideously transformed
sharp fangs jut out over her lower lip  her nostrils are
wide and flaring  patches of hair sprout on her cheeks
her ears are pointed

she reacts to the strange sound like an animal sniffing
the air  and like an animal she stealthily creeps off
ducking between the frozen trees like a carnivore stalking
her prey


ext  woods by estuary  day

the sounds of singing grow nearer as lili creeps through
the woods hiding herself behind the trees

lilis pov

out of the marsh the troop of elves and faeries is led by
gump and jack  the procession shimmers and sparkles and
lili shrinks back from the joyous proceedings hiding
herself in shame


ext  estuary  day cu unicorns head

the severed head of the stallion unicorn lies half
buried in the muck  a croaking raven perches on the
small stump of horn remaining probing his beak into the
hollow eyesocket  at the sound of the faeries musical
approach the bird spreads his wings and flies off

the faeries

jack and the faeries hurry to the spot where the dead
unicorn lies  they body is stretched out several yards
away from the severed head  no one speaks  the awesome
spectacle silences the processions glad singing  even
some of the magic sparkle seems to have left the faeries
as they stand grouped like mourners around the dead
unicorn

                         gump
                  sadly
          mortals at their foolish pleasure
          rob the earth of all her treasure

jack kneels beside the dead unicorn dumb with sorrow  he
runs has hand along the hollow flank of the fallen animal
one of the evil barons barbed bolts stands straight out
of the unicorns neck and jack yanks it free with a sudden
pull  he is about to hurl the weapon far out into the
swamp when he thinks better of it and pushes the bolt into
his belt

gump silently motions with his head and starts away from
the unicorns body  the other faeries follow dejectedly
jack is the last to leave staring down at the mutilated
animal as the anger inside builds to a fury


ext  jenny greenteeths bog hole  day

a fearful slimy place  the roots of a rotted oak twist
down into the murky water like dead mens fingers  a foul
green slime floats on the surface  several splintered
bones protrude from the mud at the waters edge

gump and the faeries stop a good ways off  they can feel
the potent evil of the spot and dread it  any semblance
of joy has left them  gumps demeanor is as dour and
severe as a schoolmasters

                         jack
          are we here

                         gump
          aye
                  pointing
          that foul wallow be where jenny
          greenteeth dwells  oona lure her
          out  play the part of a girlchild

                         jack
          what do i do

                         gump
          dont get caught thats what
          shell suck your bones like honey
          comb

gump reaches into his jerkin and produces a small ivory
mounted handmirror  he gives this to jack

                         gump
          here now  toss her this when youve
          the chance  jenny greenteeth cant
          resist the sight of herself in a
          glass  shes terribly vain  praise
          her beauty and youll lull her sweet
          as a babe in a cradle

                         jack
                  not so sure
          and if she thinks me a liar

                         gump
          fie on what she thinks  you mind
          her claws and teeth cast your
          spell oona

at gumps command the faerie oona begins to spin  she
twirls into an iridescent blur surrounding herself with
a cocoon of light and when she slows she has
metamorphosed into the image of a fouryear old girl with
pink cheeks and golden ringlets

skipping and singing the transformed oona makes her way
around the edge of the bog  jack follows somewhat
unsurely at a safe distance

the apparition of the little girl kneels by the bank
there is a slight disturbance on the scummy surface of the
water as if a sudden localized wind had sprung up  all
at once like a serpent rising from the depths a bony
mottledgreen arm thrusts up through the slime the clawed
fingers clutching for the child

even as the fierce talons close on their prey the child
is gone in a dazzle of light and the winged laughing oona
hovers high above the bog looking down on the fearsome
and outraged jenny greenteeth

the water hag is the color of a decomposing corpse  and
like a corpse her ragged flesh and hair seem to be
peeling in tatters from the emaciated body  her nose has
caved in and her rotted lips betray a mouthful of
fearsome fangs  she is furious at having been tricked and
rails at oona

                         jenny
                  raging
          ratspittle and toadbreath
          damned accursed cross twixt a she
          bat and a bullfrog  how dare you
          use jenny greenteeth so

jack takes advantage of the hags distracted fury to rush
up and toss the hand mirror in front of her

                         jack
          forgive us er fair one we
          wanted only to bring a gift

jenny seizes the mirror as eagerly as if it were food

                         jenny
          whats this now

                         jack
          i bring you the only treasure worthy
          of your loveliness for naught
          else in the universe rivals the
          reflected glory of your beauty

                         jenny
          well spoke boy  you have
          discerning taste for one so young
          just who might you be

                         jack
          they call me green jack maam

                         jenny
          come closer then jack that i might
          give you proper thanks

                         jack
          your fair smile be thanks enough
          better i stand afar to admire your
          beauty complete

jenny greenteeth cannot resist the mirror and preens
before it in a hideous parody of a young woman at her
toilette

                         jenny
          think me fair do you jack

                         jack
          the moon herself would hide behind a
          cloud rather than dare comparison
          with you

                         jenny
          the moon is too round of face
          methinks

                         jack
          the sight of you makes flowers seem
          like dross  all the heavenly angels
          must envy your grace

                         jenny
          i like well your conceit jack  tis
          rare to find an honest lad in this
          troubled world

                         jack
          aye  and it is the trouble befallen
          us that brings me here  i entreat
          you to tell me the cause of our
          surrounding sorrow most lovely of
          the lovely

                         jack
          dear lad what does winter bespeak
          but death  it is a time of
          mourning  this calamity is a curse
          something wondrous and beautiful
          has been taken from the world

                         jack
          a unicorns been slain  the last
          stallion in all the country

                         jenny
          why then there thou hast  we be
          lucky worse has not befallen us

jack pulls the barons crossbow bolt from his belt to show
to jenny

                         jack
          here be the death weapon the
          unicorns blood dry upon it

                         jenny
          couer de noir  a demon if the devil
          ever made one

                         jack
          he chopped off the horn and left the
          rest to rot

                         jenny
          that would be the barons way
          therell be no light or life in the
          world until the alicorn is taken
          from him and he vanquished

                         jack
          how do i get the horn back

                         jenny
          youll need the fastest steed alive
          for couer de noirs castle rests at
          the very edge of the earth  only
          the sharpest sword and the golden
          armor of achilles will protect you
          from his fury

          night

                         jack

                  sadly

          fairest blossom

                         jenny
                  with a sigh
          what a fine meal youd make be the
          rest of you sweet as your tongue

jenny greenteeth slips abruptly under the foul surface of
her bog hole  jack returns to gump and the other faeries

                         jack
          the princess is dead

ext  lindfarne mound  day

the lindfarne mound an ancient tumulus covers almost an
acre and rises domed and treeless under a sullen sky
wispy smoke curls from the top of the mound  a pair of
black ravens circles overhead

the ragtag procession of elves and faeries appears
cautiously from out of the frozen forest and stands
gazing somewhat apprehensively at the distant tumulus

                         gump
          there it be lad  the lindfarne
          mound  kings long forgotten lie

          no less a creature than the
          lindfarne worm

at the mention of the dread name oona and the other
faeries cringe and chatter fearfully

          knaves and robbers


ext  top of mound  day

the faeries gather around a circular opening atop the
tumulus  quantities of smoke issue from the interior
gump ties one end of a coiled rope to a large stone  the
other end is lowered into the mound

                         gump

          no need  there be no more potent
          charm than a faeries love

embarrassed jack slides from sight into the hole


int  mound  day

the tomb is vast like the arched dome of a cathedral
the curving sides are built from exquisitely fitted blocks
of stone mosscovered and dripping moisture

suspended like a dangling spider on his filament jack
slides down the rope into the drifting smoke

jacks pov

far below the floor of the tomb is everywhere heaped with
treasure  great stacks of gold plate gleam in the half
light mounds of gemstones sparkle  the treasure of the
faeries is a trashpile compared with this hoard

in the midst of the splendor the dragon lies sleeping
surrounded by clouds of smoke  with its horned whiskered
head and reversed golden scales the beast greatly
resembles the symbol used in the chinese zodiac


int  mound floor  day

jack comes to the end of his rope and drops into the
treasure with a loud crash  the clatter is alarming and
jack dives for cover behind a chest brimming with rubies

the dragon has not heard a thing and continues to snore
belching smoke like a miniature volcano

cautiously jack begins his search  its a bit
bewildering as there is such a quantity of wealth
everywhere he looks more remarkable treasure is revealed
casks of jewels weapons worked in gold and silver golden
plates and goblets ropes of pearls in snakelike coils
there is armor of all description from the breastplates
of ancient rome to the winged helmets of viking marauders
jack is puzzled by mysterious japanese samurai armor and
amazed by the heft and weight of a huge arabian scimitar

search as he will jack can find no sign of the armor of
achilles  he burrows under mounds of gems and opens a
sequence of treasure chests discovering only more gems
and yet again more treasure

the dragon moans unexpectedly in his sleep causing jack
to make a terrifying discovery

jacks pov

the sleeping dragon looms larger than a house  smoke
coils above his massive head  one scaled forelimb is
extended gleaming talons hooked like scythe blades
gripped in the evil claw something extraordinary glitters
wrought from pure gold and embossed with ancient and
beautiful designs  it is the breastplate of achilles

jack

approaches the sleeping monster like a mouse creeping up
on a snoring cat  but the beauty of the golden
breastplate calms him  the legendary armor is so
wondrously made that jack can only gaze upon it with awe

a fiery snort from the dragon brings him back to his
senses  theres work to be done  with all the delicacy
he can muster jack takes hold of the breastplate and
tries to pry it from the dragons grip  its not easy
the giant serpent is fitful and groans in his sleep
grasping the armor all the tighter

jack tugs at the breastplate with all his might and
suddenly it comes free sending jack tumbling over
backwards  the noise is deafening but it is not the
sound that wakes the dragon

the mighty talons clench disturbed by the missing armor
a single green eye large as a dinnerplate slides open
the whiskered mouth widens belching fire and smoke

enraged the dragon rears up venting its spleen in a
torrent of unrecognizable words  the mysterious language
sounds somehow oriental perhaps japanese or chinese

jack cowers in terror trying to dig himself into the heap
of jewels like a mole scratching for cover  the dragon
spots him instantly  addressing jack in english he
sounds like a singsong confucius a gradeb fu manchu

                         dragon

                         jack
          oh no dont you understand

the dragon roars and swells  flames issue from his gaping
mouth and an iridescent light shimmers along his scales
as his form suddenly alters and shifts transforming from
the benevolent eastern dragon to the more familiar winged
monster of western folklore  when he speaks now all
trace of accent is gone

                         dragon
          stupid puny mortal  do you think i
          suffer pilfering gladly

the dragon belches a sheet of flame straight at jack who
rolls aside just in time but not quickly enough to keep
his clothing from being singed

                         jack
          no wait please listen

                         dragon
          no more listening  your time is at
          an end insignificant whelp

the dragon slashes at jack with his fearsome claws
batting away the breastplate held before him as
protection  jack jumps back hurling a helmet at the
dragon  it bounces harmlessly off the gleaming scales

                         dragon
          pray to whatever worthless god you
          revere  youre no more than meat to
          me now

jack scrambles frantically through the piles of loot
ducking behind chests of gold as the dragon stalks him in
the shadows  in his frenzied flight his groping hand
chances upon an ivory bow and a quiver of silver arrows
the dragon rears up on his hindquarters lashing his
terrible tail towering above jack

quickly the green man notches an arrow and lets it fly at
the dragons throat  it bounces harmlessly off the
glistening scales  jack fires a second and a third
both arrows are easily deflected and fall clattering back
into the treasure

                         dragon
          are those gnats come to trouble me
          methinks this pesky gadfly needs
          swatting

the dragon leaps for jack like a tiger pouncing on his
prey but somehow the nimble boy eludes his pursuer
diving headlong under a golden chariot  furious the
dragon crashes about flipping over anything in his path
as he searches for jack

the rope from above

honeythorn gump hangs from the dangling rope like a
monkey observing the mayhem below  oona hovers at his
side her transparent dragonfly wings ablur

                         gump
                  calling

          oh dear oh dear

gumps pov

from above the dragons search for jack resembles a
raccoon flipping over rocks in a streambed hunt for
crayfish  a large pile of silver and gold shields is
stacked like rooftiles and the dragon tosses them aside
looking for jack

                         gump os
                  calling
          keep one jump ahead lad  dont
          waste time looking back

jack and the dragon

the dragon wrenches away a suit of jeweled armor and
discovers jack cowering underneath  a lungfull of fire
sets jacks clothing aflame as he scurries out of the way
there is no other place to hide  jack is trapped his
back up against a massive shield  enraged the dragon
rears above him poised for the kill

the dark shadow of doom falls across jack as he cowers
helplessly

gump

running with the rope gump pendulums into the air
swinging back and forth across the interior of the mound
snatching up a jeweled warclub he swings past the
dragons head belaboring him with the mace as he passes

                         gump
          filthy worm  have a taste o that

furious and distracted the raging dragon turns his
attentions to this new annoyance swatting out with his
talons as gump swings by him  oona buzzes round and round
his smoking fearsome head staying just out of reach as
the dragon slashes at her

                         gump
          leg it jack  move lad while
          theres time

jack

as his companions occupy the dragons attention jack
crawls away on his hands and knees searching for a new
hiding place  sticking straight out of the heaped
treasure before him a splendid swordhilt catches his
eye  it seems to glow with some inner force  the golden
pommel gleams

jack grasps the sword with both hands rising to his feet
as he draws it from the pile of jewels  the blade is near
long as he is awesome and shining with its own special
light  jack holds it in front of him like a crucifier in
a religious procession  the light from the blade shines
on his face imbuing his spirit with courage and
resolution

gump and oona continue to annoy the dragon swinging
around his head and taunting him with the insignificant
blows  the dragon lashes out at them ignoring jack

jack swings the mighty shining sword back over his
shoulder and rushes forward a fierce warcry issuing from
his snarling mouth  with one mighty swing like a
woodsman chopping an oak he strikes at the dragons hind
leg severing it at the joint

the dragons wail of pain is abrupt and piercing  blood
fountains from the amputated limb as the giant serpent
sways for balance

the dragon falls forward toppling like a felled tree
directly toward jack  the green man stands his ground
holding his gleaming sword above his head with both hands
the dragon impales himself on the tip driving the keen
blade deep into his breast as he crashes to the ground
the sword is wrenched from jacks hand and he jumps clear
the dragon writhing on his back in his death throes

the mighty tail continues to lash about wreaking havoc
among the treasure  jack nimbly avoids the random
slashing and leaps up onto the dragons scaled stomach
with a mighty tug he draws his sword from the beasts
chest  a geyser of steaming blood follows the blade

the talons on the dragons forelegs grasp and clench
spasmodically but jack ducks between them avoiding the
terrible claws  with a single backhand swing he lops the
dragons snarling head from his neck  copious quantities
of boiling blood flush across the spread jewels

jack lifts his sword above his head and lets out an
exultant victory cry  above him gump and oona cheer
shouting bravo and hooray

the dragons head lies in a pool of blood the forked
tongue still probing the air  the great green eye slides
closed


ext  frozen forest cu rabbit

a young hare sits timidly in the sear grass ears
twitching his large frightened eyes blink

lili

several yards from the crouching rabbit the princess lili
stalks through the tall grass  we do not see her face
but her embroidered gown hangs in tattered rags about her
she moves with great stealth like an animal drawing
evercloser to the rabbit  her limbs are completely
covered by a shaggy fleece of dark hair

the rabbit is very close now  lilis movements are like a
cats as she creeps closer and closer  all at once in a
sudden wild movement the girl leaps from the concealing
grass and pounces on the unsuspecting hare killing it in
an instant

cu lili

we see the princesss face for the first time now as she
tears at the dead rabbit with her teeth  fangs actually
for lilis features are now far more animal than human
her eyes gleam ferociously and blood smears her whiskered
mouth as she eagerly devours her kill

pull back

to see lilis hunkering form totally bestial in its
spreadleg attitude  the tattered dress seems merely a
ludicrous refinement on so savage a creature  her nails
have lengthened into claws and she makes small animal
noises as she tears at the rabbits flesh

the shadow of a mounted rider falls across her form and
she looks up cat eyes widening in terror at what she
sees

baron

the black baron sits on his dark charger staring down at
the cowering girl  he laughs dryly under his horned wolf
mask the black cloak whipping about him in the wind  at
his side is a deadly rapier fashioned from the long
twisting ivory length of the alicorn

                         baron
          a child of nature how delightful

lilis flight

terrified lili drops whats left of the rabbit and
sprints for the woods  she is very agile running freely
like a feral cat  the baron watches for a moment then
digs his spurs into his horses flank and is after her

lili runs for all shes worth darting and zigzagging in
a frantic effort to avoid capture  for all her speed and
agility she cant outrun a horse and in moments the baron
bears down upon her reaching low to catch the back of her
torn dress and swing her up in front of him on the saddle

baron and lili

lili claws and scratches ripping at the baron as she
fights to be free  her efforts only elicit laughter from
her captor as he easily pins her struggling arms

                         baron
          i like your spirit  i like things
          wild and free  more of a
          challenge dont worry my pet
          ill soon have you housebroke

laughing his evil laugh the baron clutches the struggling
animalgirl tightly to his chest and gallops away into the
frozen woods


int  lindfarne mound  day

all the faeries have gathered for a great feast  the
dragons severed head is set upright on a pike  haunches
of spitted dragon meat turn slowly over a bed of coals
much of the treasure has been gathered into sacks and
stands by the rope like harvest grain awaiting transport
several gnomes and elves are busy hoisting the sacks up
out of the mound  jack and the other faeries sit on the
dragons carcass feasting and swilling wine from golden
goblets  jack wears the armor of achilles and in it he is
transformed from a wild hermit to a valiant knight  the
others wear bits and pieces of bejeweled armor plucked
from the treasure hoard  gump has on a horned viking
helmet which fits him badly  another imp a monkeyfaced

before laying it against the fallen dragon

ext  glade in forest  day

an isolated glade deep in the frozen forest  icicles hang
like frozen daggers from the surrounding trees  a light
dusting of snow powders the ground  no birds sing  all
is silent and still

jack gump screwball and oona creep through the ice
coated underbrush  screwball is clumsy and crashes over
several gelid ferns which break like shattering crystal

                         jack
          shhhh

                         oona
          sorry

the foursome all clad in armor continue silently to the
edge of the glade  they conceal themselves behind the
trunk of a huge gnarled oak  the glade is empty

                         screwball
          what do we do now

                         jack
          we wait

disgruntled the faeries settle down to wait  jack
removes his helmet and rests against the treetrunk  oona
nestles by his side tittering softly and tickling his
neck  jack does his best to ignore her  oona grows more
playful whispering and giggling at jacks annoyance

                         gump
          shhhh

                         oona

          what is it

                         gump
          somethings coming

indeed an animal can clearly be heard approaching the
glade a crunch of footfalls on the frozen ground and the
icy crack of branches snapping  jack and his companions
peer around the tree trunk

jacks pov

a shaft of pale sunlight pierces through the cloudcover
and angles down into the glade at the moment the mare
unicorn steps out of the underbrush  the light glows on
her milkwhite hide and her rounded swollen flanks
slowly with modesty and a certain dignified stride the
mare moves to the center of the glade and settles herself
down drawing her legs beneath her

                         screwball os
          whats she doing

                         jack os

as they stare in awe at the resting unicorn  even the
demented screwball has a silly smile on his face

                         jack

                         oona
          how wonderful

they are suddenly interrupted by the loud howling of
wolves  the plaintive wail stabs through the cold air
like a cry from hell

                         gump
          wolves

                         oona

sword in hand jack steps out into the clearing  the mare
unicorn is startled by his sudden appearance but makes no
effort to rise

                         jack
          its all right girl  i wont hurt
          you

the unicorn is soothed by jacks words and seems to
recognize him

jack places the tip of his sword on the ground and stands
waiting hands folded on the pommel patient as a statue
ghostlike in their silent stealth the wolves materialize
along the edge of the glade  large and gray their amber
eyes glowing the wolves begin to circle moving closer to
their prey  jack readies himself holding his sword in
both hands

with his tail curled high the leader of the pack snarls
and rushes for the mare  jack cuts him off sending him
flying with a swift sword stroke

the leaders charge provokes an allout attack  the
wolves close in howling from all sides  jack wields his
great sword like a berserk chopping and slashing driving
the furious wolves away from the mare  busy fighting
three of the brutes he doesnt notice the wounded leader
creeping behind him

the leader springs jumping on jacks back tearing at his
neck with his fangs

screwball in treetop

screwball has climbed one of the surrounding trees
bringing his bow and arrows with him  he sees the wolf
attacking jack

                         screwball
                  calling out
          steady jack

screwball draws his bow aims quickly and shoots

jack

is powerless against the huge wolf mauling him from
behind  only the golden armor he wears protects him from
the terrible claws  screwballs arrow finds its mark
straight between the animals shoulder blades  the wolf
cries out once and drops lifeless from jacks back

jack waves gratefully at the faerie

                         jack
                  calling
          im in your debt screwball

                         screwball os
                  calling back
          watch behind or ill never collect
          on it

jack spins about in time to see the leaders mate charge
savagely  the wolf leaps a high acrobatic arc whose
trajectory moves from a blur of gray fur to the precise
delineation of cold yellow eyes lolling tongue and
wicked gleaming fangs

jack lifts his sword as the wolf lands on his shoulders
and chest  falling backwards jack thrusts up and the tip
on his blade impales the wolf as they drop to the ground

tossing the squirming animal as a farmer would a forkload
of hay jack flips the wolf over his head  scrambling to
his knees he delivers the deathstroke with swift
efficiency

standing over the dead wolves sword in hand his
breastplate drenched in their blood jack is terrible to
behold  the others in the pack sense they have been
beaten and slink whimpering back into the woods tails
abjectly hooked between their legs

gump screwball and oona dart from their hiding places
they jump and leap about jack chattering happily

                         gump
          well done lad  stout heart

                         screwball
          wolfslayer wormsticker give a
          cheer for the champion

                         oona
          were i a mortal girl jack methinks
          id be in love with you

                         jack
          then id kiss you without turning my
          garments insideout and sewing bells
          all over

                         oona
          no need for bells jack  ill nay
          enchant ye

oona stops her teasing and points to the unicorn a look
of utter wonder replacing the mischief on her face

                         oona
          oh look

the unicorn  oonas pov

a baby unicorn has been born coal black with the first
stump of a horn showing on his forehead  the foal lies
beside his mother who licks the blood from his shining
moist coat

                         oona os
          isnt he beautiful

faeries and unicorn

jack and the faeries move closer to the unicorn  there is
something holy about the scene like an adoration

                         gump
          a wee stallion

jack drops to his knees before the mare

                         jack
          praise be to god

                         screwball
          small miracles better than no
          miracles

                         oona
          such a sad world be there no
          unicorns to brighten it

                         jack
          no fear of that now

                         gump
          aye  this wee studll beget a line
          of champions

the faeries kneel with jack before the unicorn and her
foal  the mare regards them without fear recognizing
friends  stretching out her neck to jack she allows him
to pet her and scratch behind her ears

                         jack
          youre shy and pretty little
          mother you deserve a pretty
          name ill call you sapphire for
          your eyes shine so


ext  faeries camp  day

the sound of swords clashing and the shouting of tiny
voices carries over to the faeries makeshift military
camp  colorful tents stand under frozen trees pennants
snapping in the icy wind  a small army of elves imps
goblins gnomes and faeries has gathered all decked out
in various odd bits of armor recovered from the dragons
lair  groups of these tiny folk are engaged in martial
training practicing with swords lances and bows

as we move through the camp amid this mock mayhem certain
isolated incidents attract our attention

two goblins duel furiously sweating and panting under the
weight of their illmatched armor  they are clearly
exhausted  as the other elves continue slashing at one
another these two take time out one leaning against a
tree trunk while the other folds his arms in repose  but
their swords continue to duel alone in midair the
blades crashing together magically like iron birds

another group practices archery aiming their tiny arrows
at a straw scarecrow some distance away  they are
extremely accurate puncturing the dummy in a dozen vital
spots  when the last arrow strikes instead of retrieving
them the faeries stand their ground  onebyone the
arrows pull free from the scarecrow and fly back unaided
through the air to land safely in their owners quivers

two huge knights each over seven feet slug it out in
full armor with battle axes  they bash away at one
another until a fearsome blow literally cuts one in half
the upper portion of the bisected knight topples to the
ground with a loud clang  the two armored legs remain
erect swaying slightly like trees in the wind  suddenly
a tiny head appears above the left cuisse  it is an elf
he is laughing  another elf pops his head out of the
righthand cuisse and the two legs hop off in opposite
directions

the fallen armor also comes apart  one gnome in the
breastplate another lifting the helm from the gorget

the victorious knight likewise begins to disassemble
revealing a number of laughing elves within like clowns
performing a carnival prank


ext  hill above camp  day

jack surveys his elfin army from the crest of the hill
he is mounted bareback on sapphire the mare unicorn and
rides easily without reins or bridle  the tiny black foal
trots alongside his mother and beside it pants an angry
gump

                         gump
          dont see why i cant ride too
          im second in command damn it

                         jack
          the colts still too small

                         gump
          im small and i can make myself
          smaller still small as a bee
          small as dust  want to see me do
          it

                         jack
          weve no time for tricks this day
          honeythorn gump

                         gump
          tricks is it  why ill trick ye
          ungrateful whelp  ill sour your
          milk and bird droppingsll fall from
          the sky wherever ye walk

                         jack
          save your mischief for the black
          baron

                         gump
          aye  that too

                         jack
          youll need more than bird droppings
          for blackheart

                         gump
          ill drop a cow on the knave

                         jack
          drop a mountain on him and we wont
          need our troops

they laugh together feeling confident

                         gump
          finelooking army

                         jack
          we march on castle couer de noir
          within the hour

                         gump
          how do you plan on finding this here
          castle if ye dont mind me asking

                         jack
          a true and troubling question
          gump well start from where the
          unicorn was killed  the baron must
          have left a trail

                         gump
          track the demon to his lair

                         jack
          aye  and hang his foul hide up like
          dirty laundry for the drying


ext  the frozen woods  day

the ragtag army of faeries on the march  jack rides at
the head of the column on sapphire  gump has had his way
and is mounted on the colt who trots obediently by his
mothers side  the other elves and faeries are either on
foot or mounted on an odd array of wild animals  deer
foxes rabbits each serves as a steed for a tiny warrior
bright banners undulate from numbers of lance tips  a
variety of armor glistens in the pale wintry sun

overhead oona and several other small nymphs ride on
flying songbirds

as they march and ride all the faerie folk are singing
their voices high and clear shimmering like wind over a
moonlit lake precise as birdsong haunting as an echo

                         faerie troop all together
                  singing
          the sky is high the world is wide
          beneath the flowers faeries hide
          the oceans deep the moons asleep
          in oberons care our souls will keep

          the stars are cold the gods are old
          our heroes all be brave and bold
          the devils sly the end is nigh
          wicked ogres too must die


ext  estuary  day

the singing carries over as the faeries move out of the
woods onto the frozen estuary  jack urges the mare
unicorn ahead of the procession

                         faerie troop all together
                  singing
          the trees are green spirits unseen
          the world we know is but a dream

the dead unicorn

jack rides sapphire near where the body of her mate lies
decomposing  as before a black raven perches on the
stallions skull  the bird emits a vile croak as jack
approaches

alarmed by the raven and the sight of her dead mate the
unicorn rears on her hind legs  jack clings to the
animals mane  the raven croaks

cu raven

the large bird spreads his wings rasping and croaking at
the rearing unicorn and rider  for a single horrifying
moment the raven appears to alter and change transmuting
into a harpy  in place of the birds head and bill is a
visage resembling both skull and snake  talons appear to
be gnarled feet and a pair of distinctly human breasts
sprout from between the sooty feathers

                         harpy
          beware beware

the harpy takes wing croaking

jack

struggles to control the frantic unicorn  gump and the
other faeries ride up as jack quiets the animal

                         gump
          trouble jack

jack points at the raven flying high over the treetops

                         jack
          we must follow that bird

                         gump
          whatever for

                         jack
          jenny greenteeth said  follow the
          raven in her flight

                         gump
          aye  said to follow it to the edge
          of night  but is this the right
          bird

                         jack
          im sure  it spoke to me

                         gump
          birds speak to me all the time
          what did it say

                         jack
          beware

                         gump
          sounds like the bird we want
                  calling to troops
          all right lads follow yon raven

the troop of faeries shout and laugh eagerly pursing the
raven


ext  edge of the forest  day

the faerie troop rides to the edge of the wintry forest
their spirits are still high but something about the mood
of the place takes hold  the singing stops  bright
laughter fades

screwball a worried elf and a nervous goblin ride side
byside into the frightening forest  they make an odd
trio mounted as they are upon a fox a hare and a badger
arthritic tree branches twist grotesquely above them in
the gloom

                         worried elf
          something i dont like about this
          place

                         screwball
          me too  no babies to pinch
          havent pinched a baby in so long
          probably lost my touch

                         nervous goblin
          everythings a joke screwball
          laugh your life away

                         screwball
          laughs bettern stubbing your toe

                         nervous goblin
          go on  joke it up while evil magic
          weaves a spell about you

                         screwball
          whats the matter  fraid of the
          big dark woods

                         worried elf
                  pointing
          look

the elf points to a gnarled tree trunk  at a second
glance it appears to be the body of a man twisted in
petrified pain his mouth open and howling a silent
scream

the three riders draw up short staring in amazement at
the curious shapes of the trees surrounding them

                         nervous goblin
          over there  another

                         worried elf
          this is sorcerers work

all the trees bear an uncanny resemblance to human figures
contorted by severe pain  these are not the curious
deformities of nature but actual living beings
transformed into trees

terrified screwball gallops his fox frantically back to
the rear of the column

                         screwball
          help  jack  gump  preserve poor
          me

the other two faeries are quick to follow

                         nervous goblin
          wait

rear of column

jack and gump ride at the rear of the column threading
singlefile along the narrow trail through the dark
forbidding woods

                         gump
          how do we follow a raven we cant
          even see

                         jack
          send oona up above the tree tops
          she be our eyes

                         gump
          good plan that

all at once  screwball and his two frightened companions
come charging down the trail causing the other faeries to
scramble out of their way  this precipitates a certain
grumbling  watch out  be careful  mind where youre
going etc

                         screwball
          master jack  master jack  these
          woods are alive  theyre alive

                         jack
          of course theyre alive  all nature
          is living

                         gump
          barely living from the looks of it

                         screwball
          no no no this is different

                         nervous goblin
          this is evil  black magic

                         worried elf
          sorcery

                         jack
          where

                         screwball
          up ahead

                         jack
          come on gump lets have a look at
          this witchcraft

jack nudges the mare unicorn and she sprints ahead in a
gallop  gump is right behind trotting on the colt  the
other three follow less enthusiastically on their animal
mounts

once again the other faeries have to make way on the
trail  this time there is fist shaking and outright
epithets as they charge through

                         other faeries
          swine  toad eaters
          maggots  vermin  etc  etc


ext  deformed trees  day

jack pulls the mare to a stop in the grove of malformed
trees  he jumps to the ground and has a closer look at
these curiosities  gump and the others ride up behind

                         screwball
          you see  you see

                         gump
          these chapsll need a woodpecker to
          pick their teeth

jack pauses before a familiar tree studying the grieved
features molded into the bark

                         jack
          why this is king godwin princess
          lilis father  king godwin and all
          his mounting party even the
          hounds  see the lymers and alaunts

jack points to several tree stumps shaped like frantic
hounds

                         screwball
          never cared much for dogs  always
          chasing the wee folk they are
          think ill lift my leg on one see
          how he likes the tables turned

screwball saunters over to a dogshaped root untying his
codpiece as threatened

jack draws his gleaming sword

                         jack
          this is ogres magic

                         gump
          blackheart

                         jack
          aye  hes enchanted the lot of
          them  his reward for delivering the
          unicorn

                         gump
          foul fellow this couer de noir

                         jack
          the foulest  mayhap i can cut them
          free

                         gump
                  shouting
          jack dont

gumps warning comes too late  jack swings his mighty
sword driving the blade deep into a tree trunk resembling
one of the hunters  the air is rent by a piercing scream
bright red blood gushes from where the sword cut the bark
flowing in a crimson stream down the trunk

                         jack
          dear god forgive me

the sight of the rushing blood unnerves even the boldest
faerie  screwball fumbles with his codpiece full of
embarrassment and fear

                         screwball
          oh dear oh dear i hope dogs
          have shorter memories than trees

jack scrambles on the ground grabbing up handfuls of moss
and mud

                         jack
          hurry  gump lend a hand

gump rushes to assist him and they press gobs of moss into
the flowing wound  at first it is like attempting to stem
the flood of a leaking dam the blood continues to ooze
through their fingers and pour down the tree  the
contorted expression of the hunter imprisoned within the
bark looks evermore tormented

                         gump
                  grunting
          worse than the battlefield

                         jack
          what know you of fields of war

                         gump
          ofttimes the wee folk come out to
          tend the wounded staunch bleeding
          with cobwebs give a parched mouth
          a sip of dew cool a fevered
          brow

the applications of mud and moss begin to work  the
bleeding from the bark abates

                         jack
          there it seems to quit ill
          wager that war held other
          attractions quite apart from
          nursing

                         gump
          well if the knight be already
          dead what harm is there in
          borrowing a thing or two

                         jack
          stealing his arms

                         screwball
          what can you steal from a man
          already lost his life

                         jack
          his honor i suppose seeing he no
          longer can defend it

jack is disgusted with the faeries  he picks up his sword
and stalks away leaving gump and screwball perplexed by
his piety


ext  sky  evening

the feeble sun is setting like the paleyellow yolk of a
diseased egg  a small swift bird perhaps a swallow
clips along erratically through the cloudless pearlgray
sky

cu bird

oona clings to the back of the darting bird  her own
gossamer wings still and halffolded now resemble those
of an exotic butterfly  she rides the bird as one would a
flying horse hanging on to the neck feathers and shading
her eyes with her free hand as she strains to observe
something moving in the distance

oonas pov

she is watching the raven which no longer resembles a
harpy but is now simply a large black bird  it flies
with determined wingbeats straight for a sharply pointed
stone pinnacle rising above the treetops  the raven
circles this monument once then lands on the uppermost
crag folding his wings for the night

oona and the bird

holding tight with both hands oona urges the bird into a
sharp dive  it swoops like a falling arrow straight into
the tangle of tree branches below


ext  forest trail  evening

jack rides silently at the head of the procession  he
seems locked deep within himself  gump and screwball trot
alongside obviously uncomfortable with jacks somber
brooding  neither of the faeries has the heart to break
the oppressive silence

all at once the bird darts down out of the trees above
circles twittering and glides in for a perfect landing on
jacks shoulder  oona dismounts rather she herself
flutters delicately into the air and flies over to jacks
other shoulder  she caresses his cheek and whispers
softly into his ear

                         gump
                  impatiently
          whats she say  whats she say

oona makes a disagreeable face at gump  jack reaches up
and she hops into his hand with a smile

                         jack
          oona tells me the raven has roosted
          for the night on a sharp stone spire
          some half a mile distance

                         gump
          that would be devils needle  last
          landmark i know in these woods

                         gump
          screwball  be quiet  we have
          friends live neath the needle
          theyll no doubt provide safe refuge
          for the night

                         jack
          good

                         gump
          beyond devils needle all is
          unknown


ext  cave mouth at base of needle  evening

the needle towers up above the trees straight and smooth
a curiosity of nature resembling a manmade structure
at the base of the rock is the opening to a cave  with
its yawning shape and sharp overhanging row of teethlike
stalactites it has the appearance of a gigantic
devouring mouth

the faerie troop rides up and dismounts  a number of
human skulls litter the ground grinning through the
curved spokes of several bleached ribcages

                         jack
          twould appear other travelers
          precede us

                         gump
          nay jack tis not what youre
          thinking

                         jack
          i trust our own welcome will be more
          hospitable

                         gump
          jack jack its dwarves live here
          hardworking chaps  hammering in
          the forge all the livelong day
          make the most wondrous things they
          do

jack stoops picking a skull off the ground

                         jack
          and this  some of their handiwork

                         gump
          nay  thats but to distract the
          casual visitor  a dwarf is too busy
          to suffer fools gladly

                         jack
          better to kill than be disturbed

                         gump
          your imagination runs away with you
          jack those bones be but
          battlefield gleanings like i
          mentioned  a wee bit of carrion to
          frighten off the uninvited

                         jack
          here is a bold champions reward to
          serve as a dwarfs doorstop

jack tosses the skull back to the ground his face flushed
with anger

                         screwball
          what care the bones when the soul is
          free

                         jack
                  scornfully
          bah  you faeries have the morals of
          ferrets

                         gump
          you do the ferrets grave injustice
          jack
                  staring into the
                   cave
          but come best settled fore dark
          this is inhospitable country at
          night  all manner of spriggen and
          banshee and bogies walk these woods
          after sunset

gump leads the way into the cave  jack and the others
follow


int  cave  evening

stalactites twist down like fangs from above as gump leads
the way through the underground labyrinth  screwball
walks at his side a flaming candlestub stuck to the top
of his outlandish roman helmet  jack is right behind and
the other faeries are strung out in the rear some
carrying torches some candlelanterns others merely
lighting the way with their own mysterious foxfire glow

turning a final corner the procession comes to a huge
golden gong hanging on the cave wall a wooden mallet
beside it

                         gump
          we wait here  those that come this
          far be considered guests  the
          others well many false twists
          and turns lure them astray

gump delivers the gong a smart mallet blow  a
surprisingly musical note echoes and reechoes down maze
like passages

                         jack
          nice piece of work

                         gump
          pure gold it is plays a different
          note every time

gump strikes the gong again  the pure musical sound is
indeed different as it reverberates among the stalactites

                         gump
          see

gump strikes it a third time  another note even more
beautiful echoes with the sound forming a melodic chord
within the cave

from around the bend a dwarf suddenly appears  this is
ogg  he is short muscular fellow with a gray waist
length beard covering his naked chest  his leather
blacksmiths apron reaches all the way to the ground
concealing his feet

                         ogg
          enough enough do you mean to
          deafen us with your infernal
          hammering

gump steps forward and takes the dwarf fondly by the hand

                         gump
          friend ogg  excuse our enthusiasm
          occasioned as it was by a fondness
          for you

                         ogg
          honeythorn gump is it  ive not
          seen your ugly face since you sold
          me a jug of cow piss claiming it was
          dragons tears

                         gump
          well bygonesre bygones i always
          say

                         ogg

          squarefoot stole the golden apples
          id forged

                         gump
          twas jimmy done that i merely stood
          for the blame unfairly but here
          now ogg this be no time to rehash
          old differences ive friends along
          in need of safe haven for the night

                         ogg
          who might these friends be

                         gump
          screwball you know and many other
          of the wee folk  we serve as escort
          for our grand champion jack o the
          green

gump nods at jack who bows politely

                         jack
          honored to make your acquaintance

                         ogg
          grand champion is it  and what
          great cause leads you to me

                         jack
          we seek the ogre baron couer de
          noir  he slew a unicorn and plunged
          the world into eternal winter

                         ogg
          thought the weather terrible of
          late

                         gump
          we seek to undo the curse

                         screwball
          gonna make ogrestew

                         ogg
          any enemy of blackhearts a friend
          of mine come on then theres a
          bit of soup left and clean straw to
          lie in

ogg vanishes abruptly as he came  gump motions for the
others to follow leading them around the corner


int  further along the cave  night

ogg is far in the distance  although his looks are
deceptive he is very agile and makes much better time
underground than the other faeries

suddenly jack stops short  he grabs gumps arm and
points to the sandy cave floor

                         jack
          my god  look

                         gump
          something the matter

                         jack
                  pointing
          oggs footprints

cu footprints

etched cleanly in the sand are oggs peculiar footprints
leading forward into the depths of the cave  they are
quite obviously the threepronged prints of a large bird
such as a goose

                         gump os
          shhh  not so loud mayhap hell
          hear ye

jack and gump

                         gump
          dwarves be very sensitive about
          their feet

                         jack
          certainly understandable

                         gump
          very secretive they are  keep
          their feet covered up  best if you
          dont mention it

far down the passage ogg waves his arm impatiently

                         ogg
                  calling
          step lively now

                         jack
          his feet shall never cross my lips

                         gump
          i should hope not

                         jack
          gump youre putting words in my
          mouth

the two hurry along the passageway to catch up with ogg
and the others

                         gump
          words be a far sight better than a
          dwarfs foot


int  dwarves workshop  night

an underground medieval factory  a row of glowing open
hearth furnaces cast a vivid molten light across a dozen
forges  everywhere dwarves are at work hammering on
anvils heating metal with tongs pumping bellows and
triphammers all wearing beards and floorlength leather
aprons  the roar and clang of industry fills the air

the faerie troops recline in shadowy niches along the back
wall eating and getting ready for sleep  candles
flicker contrasting with the occasional willothewisp
dazzle of faerie light

ogg guides jack and gump on a tour of the workshop past
bellows and furnaces without a word  jack has a bowl of
gruel and a wooden spoon  he eats with relish  gump
slurps at a dripping honeycomb


int  thurgis forge  night

ogg leads jack and gump to a forge set somewhat apart from
the others  thurgis is a hunchbacked dwarf busy shaping
a whitehot sword blade on his anvil  a barely
perceptible nod is his only greeting to the visitors

rows of impeccably finished weapons spears swords and
axes stand stacked along the wall  hanging above are
magnificent golden shields and helmets  jack puts down
his bowl and examines the weapons as thurgis plunges his
glowing blade into a vat of blood  the hiss of steam is
like a cry of pain

                         ogg
                  to jack
          cant beat dragons blood for curing
          a blade cousin thurgis be co
          master here

thurgis studies the newlytempered swordblade then
arches an eyebrow as he regards jack inspecting the
finished goods

                         thurgis
          each fit for a hero my uncle
          fashioned a hammer for thor  twas
          he named it mjolnir  grandfather
          forged excalibur you wont ever
          see finer craftsmanship

                         jack
          oh but i have

smiling jack draws his sword and hands it pommel first
to thurgis  the dwarf examines the weapon admiring the
keen edge

                         thurgis
          how came you by this blade

                         jack
          i slew the lindfarne worm with it

                         gump
          jacks a grand champion

                         thurgis
          he wields a champions sword true
          i know the work fine work
          stagnars work  this is the sword
          called the avatar

thurgis hands jack back the sword  he regards it with
wonder

                         jack
          the avatar  i like the sound of it

                         thurgis
          sigurd the volsung slew fafnir with
          that blade see the line where
          regin welded the break

jack runs his thumb over the weld

                         jack
                  in awe
          sigurds sword

          another heros handmedown
          thurgis note the armor tis greek
          work

thurgis runs his hands over the decorative basrelief
hammered into jacks breastplate

                         thurgis
          uhm fine work

                         jack
          achilles wore it before the gates of
          troy

                         thurgis
          youre well equipped id say
          legendary arms

                         ogg
          takes more than a good sword to make
          a hero

jack slides the sword back in its scabbard

                         jack
          i pray always to be worthy of it

                         gump
          stoutly spoke lad  these dwarves
          be sore grouches pay no heed to
          their spiteful grumbling

gump grabs jack by the arm and leads him away from the
forge

                         jack
                  calling back
          i do thank you for your hospitality

the dwarves make no reply but stand solemnly watching as
gump and jack leave the workshop


int  jacks sleeping niche  night

jack sits on the strawpile unbuckling his breastplate
gump helps him to remove his greaves  the fabled sword
leans an armlength away

                         gump
          dont let this talk of heroes upset
          you jack  sigurds sword is no
          great thing  the volsung killed
          fafnir  you killed lindfarne
          thats one worm apiece id say
          you and sigurd were neckandneck

                         jack
          were not in a tournament gump
                  lying back in the
                   straw
          ah but a sword twice tempered in
          the blood of living dragons

                         gump
          tis not the sword that counts but
          the man what swings it
                  gump rises to leave
          rest easy jack

                         jack
          god protect you honeythorn gump

                         gump
          your strong right arms all the
          protection ill need this night

gump wonders off  jack arranges his bedding so it suits
him  he places his sword close by the pillow and turns to
blow out the candle  he is distracted by the glow of
faerie light and a musical presence  this is oona

                         oona
          do you always sleep with your sword
          jack

oona kneels beside his bedside

                         jack
          never even had a sword in my hand
          until yesterday

                         oona
          then tis not for chastity
          methought you kept a naked blade
          twixt you and any maiden chanced

          oak  my bed is pine boughs and
          rabbit skins  theres no need of
          weaponry to keep the maids away

                         jack

                         jack

                         oona
          then why do you speak sweeter words
          to jenny greenteeth

                         jack

                         oona

                         jack

          of spring

                         oona
          and sweet

                         jack
          sweeter than bee pollen on a summer
          wind

                         oona
          pray you be sweet as your words
          dear jack

oona moves close to jack kissing his lips as a soft
cocoon of faerie light engulfs them  nearly enchanted
jack pushes away

                         jack
          nay oona tis not possible

                         oona
          a faeries love makes anything
          possible

                         jack
          im promised to another

                         oona
          what shape i take matters not  long
          you for another  ill give you your
          hearts desire

the faerie light burns brightly around oona surrounding
her like a chrysalis as she alters and shifts
transforming into a grown woman  when she steps forward
parting the curtain of light like a niade stepping through
a waterfall it is the princess lili who appears

                         jack
          lili

                         oonalili
          come then green jack youve
          promises to keep

oonalili moves closer to jack running her hand behind
his neck embracing him

                         jack
          no this isnt real

                         oonalili
          oh but it is im warm and alive
          and happy to be in your arms

furiously jack thrusts her aside

                         jack
          ill not be enchanted  this is foul
          magic  what an abhorrent
          creature would i be to dally with
          faeries guised as my beloved when
          the princess herself has suffered
          god knows what fate

cu oonalili

                         oonalili
                  harsh and spiteful
          i wish i could show you that fate
          your precious princess  i wish you
          could see her now

                                            cut to

int  barons castle  night cu lili

lili has completely transformed into a savage beast  fur
covers her face her ears are pointed  sharp fangs
punctuate her lips  only her eyes still seem human and
afraid

                         lili
                  very frightened
          please kill me if you must it
          would be a gift

pull back to show the dark room windows shrouded by heavy
black drapes  thousands of candles drip and sputter
casting a flickering light across the clammy stone walls
the baron stands before the cowering lili wearing his
mask and wrapped in his cloak  in his gloved right hand
he holds a whip

                         baron
          my generosity is not so large as
          that

                         lili
          what do you want with me

                         baron
          your love

                         lili
          your words sting more sharply than
          your whip

                         baron
          i speak of love and you think only
          of the lash

                         lili
          you are cruel  your heartless
          jesting worse than torture  how can
          you speak of love when you see what
          i am

                         baron
          i like well what i see  it pleases
          me

                         lili
          but im hideous

                         baron
          youre magnificent

                         lili
          grotesque monstrous

                         baron
          on the contrary  the puling pallid
          creature you were before was truly
          something disgusting  now you are
          splendid a fierce goddess the
          embodiment of all that is strong and
          beautiful

                         lili
          you lie  you wish to humiliate me
          as if the form im forced to bear
          were not punishment enough

                         baron
          you should glory in your animal
          nature  it is your triumph  none
          know that better than i

the baron rips off his mask  beneath is a savage face
halfwolf halfgoat with a pair of curling horns poised
above  lili screams

                         lili
          god protect me

                         baron
          not from me surely

                         lili
          you youre a beast

                         baron
          were all of us beasts my dear
          only most are afraid to show it

                         lili
          and you are you not also afraid

                         baron
          i am afraid of nothing

                         lili
          then why hide behind a mask  you
          are ashamed

                         baron
                  laughing
          i know no more of shame than i do of
          fear  i wear this mask not for
          concealment but protection

                         lili
          protection

                         baron
          i am a creature of darkness  i
          require the shadows solace and the
          black of night sunlight is
          abhorrent to me i cover myself
          completely whenever i venture forth
          in daylight sunshine is my
          destroyer

                         lili
          like some vile toadstool

                         baron
          i prefer to think more like the
          sagacious owl

                         lili
          do you feed on mice and rats

                         baron
          i prefer a plump capon but will
          happily serve you rats if theyre to
          your liking

                         lili
          why have you brought me here

                         baron
          to be my bride of course

                         lili
          id soon die

the baron uncoils his sinister whip

                         baron
          that is your choice my dear  a
          wedding will be far more swift i
          assure you

the baron strikes out at lili with his whip  it cracks in
the air close by her and she leaps back

                         lili
          damn you

                         baron
          were both of us damned my
          beauty

lili rushes to the window and pulls apart the heavy black
drapes  a shaft of sunlight knifes across the shadowy
room and strikes the baron like a bolt from heaven  he
reels from the force grimacing in pain  there is a note
of triumph is lilis shrill laughter

                         lili
                  laughing
          toadstool

the baron cringes in the light  he lifts his thick cloak
to shield himself and quickly pulls on his mask  this
done he retrieves his whip and advances on the cowering
princess

                         baron
          bold and plucky  i admire your
          spirit princess almost as much as
          i lust for your savage feline
          beauty

princess lili jumps up onto the window ledge glancing
down at the rocks far below

                         lili
          im not afraid to jump  id prefer
          that to being with you

the baron makes no reply but strikes unexpectedly with
his whip  the lash coils around lilis neck and pulls her
off balance yanking her back into the room  she falls on
her knees at the barons feet

                         baron
          when the times come you wont need
          to jump ill throw you out myself

                         lili
          do it now

                         baron
          no  now is the time for discipline
          some lessons in obedience for the
          future baroness

the baron slashes lili cruelly with the whip  she cries
out in pain

                         baron
          not as sweet as my caress

the baron strikes her again

                         lili
          jack oh jack help me

                         baron
          too bad your precious jack cant
          hear you the damsel in
          distress a rescue attempt would
          be most amusing we could flay
          sweet jack alive as an afterdinner
          entertainment

the baron punctuates each bitter phrase with a stroke of
the lash  lili lies bleeding on the floor weeping
helplessly

                                            dissolve to

int  jacks sleeping niche  night

the sound of lilis weeping carries over as we see oona
huddled in the corner of jacks niche crying softly to
herself  she has resumed her faerie shape and the light
which emanates from her fragile wings and body is of a
tender delicate hue  jack kneels solicitously before
her

                         jack
          oona dont cry please you
          mustnt

                         oona
                  weeping
          you you you mortal you

                         jack
          please

                         oona
                  sobbing
          why should i feel such pain  should
          be the other way round i could
          vex you make you dance your life
          away

                         jack
          threats wont make me love you  tis
          not the way of the human heart

oona rises in a rage

                         oona
          what care i for the human heart
          such a soft spiritless thing it is
          i prefer the hearts of hawks and
          wolves fierce and free and keen as
          steel

                         jack
          and as barren of love as stone

                         oona
          i would build a wall around me with
          such stone so the likes of you
          might never enter

                         jack
          be fair oona

                         oona
          you beware jack  you and your
          porridgepot heart

there is a bright whirlwind of faerie light and in a
brilliant pyrotechnic moment oona is gone

                         jack
          oona  oona are you still here
          blast

jack arranges his cloak as a bedcover and settles down
for the night drawing his sword and resting it beside
him

                         jack
          hard enough to fathom a womens
          mind what chance has one with a
          faerie

jack blows out his candle  blackness


int  cave mouth  day

it is the next morning  the faerie army is preparing for
the march donning armor and putting a keen edge on this
weapons  jack is mounted on sapphire resplendent in
achilles armor  gump brushes the coat of the foal  ogg
thurgis and several other dwarves have assembled to see
them off

                         jack
                  calling out
          make haste  weve a hard days
          march ahead

                         gump
          be gentle with them jack  they
          only march to please you  were this
          a faerie journey wed ride the wind
          on thistledown and ragwort stems

thurgis and ogg approach  thurgis carries a large round
golden shield  ogg has something concealed behind his
back

                         thurgis
                  clearing his throat
          ahem  im naught for fancy
          words work as i do with my hands
          the world needs champions and i
          favor that

thurgis hands the gleaming shield up to jack

                         thurgis
          i wrought this shield for noble
          tristan ere fate oertook him no
          blade nor axe can dent it  i
          believe it will serve you well

jack straps the shield over his back

                         jack
          i pray always to be worthy of it and
          thank you well thurgis

ogg steps forward and hands two glittering objects to
gump

                         ogg
          baron couer de noir is a blight
          gainst all nature  we dwarves be
          not fighters still we are with you
          in this battle  some of our
          handiwork may be of assistance

                         gump
          we be honored friend ogg

                         ogg
          theres a coil of golden thread fine
          as spider web yet naught can break
          it and a silver key no lock can
          resist

                         jack
          youre with us in battle

                         thurgis
          may god protect you

                         ogg
          aye and valor select you

oona flies down abruptly from above the trees  without
looking directly at jack she addresses the assembled
faerie warriors

                         oona
          the raven has taken to wing and
          flies due north

jack waves his arm at the assembled troop of faeries and
urges the unicorn to the head of the column

                         jack
          onward to victory

the entire troop gives out with a rousing cheer as it sets
forward on the final trek through the forbidding forest


ext  deep in the forest  day

the trees are twisted and grotesque  a dense undergrowth
of tangled vines studded with sixinch thorns block the
troops progress like oversized concertina wire  jack
rides at the head of the column hacking a pathway through
the vines with his enchanted sword  gump rides just
behind doing his best with his tiny battleaxe to clean up
the excess

                         gump
           this rate well all be in our
          graves fore we reach the barons
          fortress

                         jack
          well surely be in our graves if we
          dont

                         gump
          going grows slower weve not
          made half a mile in two hours

jack continues slashing at the serpentine vines  a final
vigorous swordstroke reveals a frozen meadow broad
open and inviting

                         jack
          gump look

jack urges the unicorn forward into the meadow  gump and
the remainder of the troop follow  at the far end of the
clearing a row of cliffs stand like the ramparts of a
city  sheer and impassable save for a narrow defile
across which something very like a vast silver curtain
hangs

                         gump
          gods blessing

                         jack
                  pointing
          theres the way mates

jack gallops forward across the meadow followed close
behind by the cheering faeries


ext  defile in cliffs  day

the faerie troops rein in a hundred yards from the
opening  the silver curtain is now quite clearly seen as
a gigantic spider web the gossamer strands inches thick

                         gump
          what make ye of that jack

                         jack
          it bodes evil

oona swoops down from above hovering in the air before
the faerie column

                         oona
                  scolding
          is this a may day pageant  are you
          all off on a lark  the raven
          passed this way hours ago

                         jack
          heading north still

                         oona
          true north
                  she points
          straight up that pass through the
          net

                         gump
          is it a net then

                         oona
          some sort of net ill see

oona flies rapidly away straight towards the web

                         jack
                  alarmed
          wait

                         gump
          willful creature that one

oonas flight  jack pov

oona makes a beeline for the web  she drives fearlessly
ahead without caution flying straight into the center of
the weave  landing on the strands she is immediately
stuck

oona in web

the more oona struggles the more entangled she becomes
like a trapped fly her frenzied attempts set the entire
web trembling

                         oona
                  calling out
          help  im stuck  oh please
          help

a giant spider the size of a man makes his way along the
web towards the helpless oona  there is something
especially repulsive about the creatures monstrous
shape  his movements are a coordinated ballet of evil

                         oona
                  screaming
          please  jack  help me
          dont let it touch me

jack and the faeries

jack draws his sword calling to his troops

                         jack
          hurry  save her

suddenly a staghorn beetle large as a rhinoceros lumbers
out of the concealing bushes at the base of the cliff
its black armored wingplates gleam like polished steel
the forked sixfoot horn towers above its head

                         jack
          lance

a young goblin lancebearer hurries forward with jacks
lance handing it up to him

                         jack
          archers  bring down that spider
          ill deal with this other creature

                         gump
          stay on your guard jack  the bug
          is enchanted surely

jack sheathes his sword lowers his lance and spurring
the unicorn with a kick of his heels charges straight at
the giant beetle

the goblin archers rush forward shouting towards the
cliff

jack rides straight at the big beetle  his lance strikes
the hard carapace of the thorax and glances off doing no
harm

jack wheels the unicorn around and charges a second time
the lance hits the wingcasing and shatters  jack is
thrown from his mount  the evil beetle closes on him
pincers opening and closing like some grotesque engine of
war

the web

the spider is nearly upon oona as the archers line up
below  a hail of arrows hit the mark  the spider reacts
with spasms of pain as they stud into him

                         oona
           kill it kill it

the arrows dont stop the spider and it reaches oona
biting her in the leg  she screams into unconsciousness
the spider sets to work spinning filament and wrapping the
stunned faerie up like a cocoon

jack and the beetle

jack scrambles to his feet drawing his sword just as the
beetle is upon him  a furious backhand slash lops off one
of the insects antennae  this doesnt slow it down it
continues to pursue the backpedaling jack pincers
clicking together like twin scythes  jack parries and
stabs slashing at the beetle with his sword

a wellaimed thrust takes off half the beetles foreleg
quantities of foul black blood gush forth onto the
ground

the archers

the goblin marksmen continue to pour a steady rain of
arrows into the spider  the swollen abdomen bristles with
dozens of accurate hits

two oversized wasps each with a sixfoot wingspan dive
down on the archers  they scatter much as soldiers of a
later age will react to a strafing by aircraft

one unfortunate pixie bowman is seized by a wasp and borne
aloft  the wasp curls his abdomen beneath him  the
barbed stinger emerges like a harpoon  the helpless
screaming pixie is stung through  the wasp releases the
lifeless body and it drops back to earth

jack and the beetle

jack continues to retreat before the beetles advance
slashing with his sword  the second antennae is neatly
amputated without any effect on the giant insect

stepping backwards jacks foot goes into a hole and he is
twisted offbalance and falls  the big bugs shadow
darkens over him  the wicked pincers clink

the mare unicorn

as she lowers her horned head and charges the beetle
running straight and true as a fighting bull the unicorn
drives into the side of the bug  the long spiraling horn
catches the joint between abdomen and thorax sliding
easily into the creatures side  the massive insect whips
about in agony snapping at the unicorn  sapphire dances
adroitly back out of harms way

the interlude gives jack the time to regain his feet
rushing forward he stabs his sword into the space between
the insects head and thorax  the pincers open and close
helplessly  it is all over  jack stabs the sword in a
second time  the big bug collapses

jack runs to sapphire and vaults onto her back  with a
victorious war cry he charges forward to help the
beleaguered archers

archers and wasps

jack is attacked from above by one of the wasps  it
hovers above seeking either to sting him or pluck him
from his mount  jack wheels the unicorn about in a tight
circle  the wasp circles overhead  with a sudden
overhand slash jack strikes the wasps basketballsized
head from his droning body  the head drops like a stone
the body continues to fly in erratic circles like a
pilotless aircraft until it crashes buzzing to earth

the disorganized faeries cheer loudly as jack rides up to
assist them  the surviving wasp harasses them from above

                         jack
                  shouting
          dont aim for the body the armor is
          too strong aim for the chinks
          shoot at the spaces between

the archers rally and aim as jack instructed  although
the first arrows miss the mark a second round is more
accurate  the wasp is hit repeatedly between its body
sections  mortally wounded it falls thrashing to the
ground

jack at the web

jack urges sapphire to the base of the cliff as the goblin
archers dispatch the wounded wasp  sword high he leaps
down and rushes to where several of the webs anchor
strands are fastened  from his life in the wild jack
knows certain strands are not sticky so the spider wont
get caught in his own contrivance  jack checks a strand
but gets stuck and only pulls free with difficulty  he
tries another and finds it clean

sheathing his sword jack climbs the web hauling himself
up the uncoated strand like a sailor ascending the
ratlines of a ship

the spider though wounded spins a shroud for the hapless
oona and does not notice jacks approach  jack draws his
sword and thrusts up into the arachnids arrowstudded
belly  the huge spider whips about in pain  jack strikes
him again slicing off one of his eight legs  frantic
the spider charges  the green man stands his ground and
splits the spiders head in two with a mighty stroke

the spider drops falling past jack hangingup in his own
web below  jack climbs to where oona is bound cutting
her cocoon free from the web

jack carriers the silkenwrapped oona back down

jack and faeries

jack lays oonas shrouded form on the ground and is
immediately surrounded by the faeries

                         gump
          well done lad

                         screwball
          three cheers for our champion

the faeries give out with a hearty hooray as jack works
deftly with his sheathknife slicing the gossamer webbing
from around the unconscious oona  he severs the last
strand and lifts her from the confining cocoon

                         gump
          is she dead

                         jack
          no thank the lord but she be sore
          envenomed by the spiders bite

                         gump
          were blind now  oona was our eyes
          and ears  how do we find the castle
          couer de noir without her

                         jack
          well find it

                         gump
          easily said the raven passed this
          way hours ago

                         jack
          heading true north  we continue in
          that direction

                         gump
          never knowing when it takes a turn
          or changes course

                         jack
          well trust in faith gump

                         gump
          aye lad weve little else to go
          by

the goblins and faeries have prepared a small litter from
two lances and a woolen cloak  three faeries lift oona
and place her on the litter  her face is serene as if
she were sleeping

                         jack
          gently boys go easy with her

jack draws his sword and chops through the bottom of the
web opening a passage into the defile

                         gump
                  barking
          all right men  lets bury our dead
          and be on our way


ext  defile  day

the column of armed faeries marches steadily up the
defile  jack rides at the head gump beside him on the
colt  four faeries bear the litter carrying oona on
their shoulders  in the distance behind them are four
small flowerdecked mounds  the freshly dug graves in
which their fallen comrades lie buried


ext  barons castle  night

like some deformed and dying organism the towers and
twisted turrets of the barons castle are silhouetted
against the night sky  utterly sinister in its malformed
splendor the buildings shape suggests the embodiment of
pure evil  high in the uppermost tower a single light
gleams through a slitted window

winging silently towards the castle the coalblack raven
glides through the night like an angel from hell


int  tower alchemical laboratory  barons castle  night

dripping tallow candles cast flickering shadows across the
mossy walls of the barons lab  all manner of arcane
instruments astrolabs crucibles retorts and furnaces
are crammed into the narrow room  stuffed owls and
crocodiles hang from the ceiling  the baron unmasked and
wearing the flowing black robes of a master magician is
busy with an experiment  the table he works on crawls
with toads and lizards a large crucible drips blood
several imps and demons serve as the barons assistants
scurrying about the lab like characters from a bosch
painting  all are deformed mutant creatures  they
crackle and snigger like the inhabitants of a zoological
madhouse

the baron takes up a glass container filled with eyeballs
and pours them into his bloody cauldron muttering to
himself his horned lupine head fierce as lucifer

                         baron
                  muttering
          blind eyes blind eyes what do you
          see  the futures secrets belong
          to me

a deformed imp with the head and goggling eyes of a fish
fidgets at the barons side  his evil master cuffs him
and barks an order

                         baron
          batwing  bring me batwing oaf
          be quick about it

the imp scampers off searching among the musty jars and
canisters

                         baron
          and lepers thumb  be swift
          before the mixture cools

all at once the raven flies into the room flapping in
circles around the lab before coming to rest on the
barons shoulder

the raven rasps into the barons ear like a backfence
gossip  the baron listens and nods completely familiar
with the language of birds  his reaction is one of vast
amusement

                         baron
                  laughing
          an army of faeries  how very
          droll do they carry flowers stead
          of spears
                  the raven croaks
          oh real spears they mean to be
          taken seriously
                  the raven croaks
                   again
          a boy riding a unicorn  things
          are getting serious indeed

the baron paces his laboratory the raven riding on his
shoulder  he pauses by a shelf where a bouquet of black
roses stands in a vase crafted from a human skull  the
baron selects a single ebony blossom and sniffs it
pensively

                         baron
          so the faeries are marching if
          by some miracle they get past the
          insects well have a surprise
          ready

the baron crushes the black rose in his fist  when he
opens his hand the blossom has been magically transformed
into a hideously deformed bat  the bat unfolds its wings
revealing toadlike gargoyles features and a long forked
reptilian tail  the grinning mouth is studded with tiny
needlesharp teeth

                         baron
          yes youll do nicely very
          nicely  just the sort of creature
          to rip a faerie to shreds

the batdemon takes wing and circles the lab diving
suddenly at the fishheaded imp who screams in terror
the bat fastens himself on the shrieking imp tearing with
his tiny teeth  the imp waves his arms frantically in a
futile effort to dislodge the creature  blood flows  the
barons cruel laughter echoes in the vaulted room

                                            dissolve to

ext  forest  day

a heavy mist shrouds the twisted trees blunting their
agonized shapes as if in pity  the barons demonic
laughter carries over and merges with the raucous calling
of crows  a flight of the black birds passes through the
fog appearing suddenly then fading just as abruptly into
the gray

the sound of marching men is heard  a moment later the
faerie troop is glimpsed trudging forward out of the
mist  jack and gump ride at the head of the dispirited
column

                         jack
          why not admit it honeythorn gump
          weve lost our way entirely

                         gump
          long as we dont lose heart jack

                         jack
          well never find the barons castle

                         gump
          once you thought wed never find the
          greeks armor and look at ye now
          decked out like a proper hero

jacks pov

the wind parts the mist ahead on the trail and for just a
moment a hideous form is glimpsed  shaped like a
hunchback with overlong arms the creature has the head of
a boar with a long flattened snout and curved tusks
this is jimmy squarefoot

                         jack os
          hold  what manner of demon be this

jack and gump

jack draws his gleaming sword

                         gump
          wait jack

                         jack
          nay  this time we strike first

jack kicks the unicorns flanks and gallops ahead down the
trail brandishing his sword

                         gump
                  shouting
          jack no

gump urges the colt into a fast run and hurries after
jack

the pigheaded creature darts off the trail and sprints
into the woods  jack is right behind the unicorn swift
as the wind  whichever way the creature turns in his
frantic effort to escape the unicorn leaps ahead cutting
him off

a projecting treeroot catches the creatures foot and
sends him sprawling  jack leaps down sword in hand and
rushes up for the kill

the creature snuffles and grunts with fear as jack stands
over him poised for the killing thrust

                         jimmy
          no hurt jimmy sir oh no please
          sir

jimmy squarefoot gets to his feet dusts himself off with
dignity and with exaggerated formality extends his arms
and points into the distance

                         jack
                  laughing

jimmy squarefoot starts off in the direction he pointed
his odd loping gait more animal than human  jack looks
doubtfully at gump

                         jack
          can we trust him

                         gump

jack waves his arms signaling the troops to advance

                         jack
          on to castle couer de noir

the troop follows jack and gump as they ride after jimmy
squarefoot into the fogshrouded woods


int  dungeon  barons castle  night

the snap of a whip is as abrupt as the change of scene

a vile stone cellar walls dripping with moss and slime
human bones litter the earthen floor  chains and shackles
hang between the instruments of torture  there is an iron
maiden a rack and a charcoal brazier heating various
tongs and pincers

the whip cracks again as the shadow of the baron moves
across the wall

princess lili is chained to a stone pillar  clothed only
in tatters her glossy pelt striped with bloody welts from
the lash she huddles helplessly before the fury of the
baron

the baron strikes again with the whip  semiconscious
lili can do little more than whimper when she is hit

                         baron
          your moans seem almost pleasurable
          my dear developing a taste for
          the lash

                         lili
                  groaning
          kill me i want so nice

                         baron
          why should i kill you
                  strikes her again
          a simple course in etiquette
          something your parents sadly
          overlooked

the baron slashes at her with the whip

                         lili
          no more please

                         baron
          i can keep a victim alive for
          weeks months if i desire it
          its an art  they beg for death
          i keep it just out of their reach
                  he strikes her with
                   the whip
          the pain remains constant

                         lili
          dont please ill do what you
          desire

the baron coils his whip

                         baron
          sweet princess you begin to sound
          most reasonable

                         lili
          what do you want from me

                         baron
          at the moment very little  your
          company at my table

the baron beckons and a squat imp with the features of a
bullfrog scurries out of the shadows and unfastens the
shackles binding lili

                         baron
          well get you cleaned up find a
          suitable gown i imagine youll
          enjoy a good meal

                         lili
          oh yes

                         baron
          a few days nourishment will see
          your strength returning

                         lili
          and then

                         baron
          yes

                         lili
          what will become of me then

                         baron
          when you are ripe for my pleasure i
          will enjoy the harvest

                         lili
          i see

                         baron
          im pleased youre not troubled by
          the prospect

                         lili
          do as you wish with my body youll
          never possess my soul

                         baron
          your soul  why should i bother
          with such a paltry trifle

                         lili
          i dont expect youd understand

                         baron
          my dear princess the human soul is
          a highly elusive commodity  i
          suggest you spend some hours before
          the glass  contemplate your
          intriguing reflection and consider
          whether such a creature as yourself
          could possibly possess something as
          fine and beautiful as a soul

the baron pulls a handmirror from beneath his robe and
hands it to lili  she refuses to look at herself casting
the glass aside in a rage

                         lili
          youre a beast

                         baron
          indeed i am my dear that makes
          us a pair

the barons lupine features appear even more demonic as he
laughs


ext  camp in the forest  night

a small fire blazes under an icecoated tree  the faerie
troop huddles about it in their robes for warmth
deformed like a torture victim castle couer de noir is
silhouetted against the frozen sky

gump and jimmy squarefoot sit on a fallen log next to
jack who stares gloomily at the hideous fortress beyond
the trees

                         gump
                  shivering
          never felt so cold in all me born

          the walls be glued together with
          blood and tears the wind in the
          basement cries with pain

                         gump
          mayhap the baron wanted us to find
          him  what good is magic if you
          dont make use of it

                         jack

                         jack
          dont speak to me of dreams  i feel
          ive been dreaming since the unicorn
          was killed

                         gump
          that be so better you pinch
          yourself now jack

                         jack
          on the morrow ill be awake enough
          to see if dreams come true

                         gump
          pray they dont turn out to be
          nightmares

jack ponders this morbid thought as he and is companions
stare silently into the dwindling fire

                                            dissolve to

ext  forest camp  morning

the dying embers of the campfire carry over and blend into
the bloodred blaze of the rising sun  swathed in mist
and fog the day star gleams dully like the glowing eye
of some halfmad creature

various angles

the faerie warriors prepare for battle  moving like
ghosts in the mist they gather weapons and carefully hone
their swords and speartips

sounds of hammering and chopping as the elves and goblins
work at building ladders and siege equipment

a pair of faeries fits together a catapult the parts of
which were painfully transported all this distance

jack and gump stand on a small rise overseeing the
activity  as the suns warmth dispels the mist the
massive walls of castle couer de noir materialize before
them

castle  jack and gumps pov

shreds of mist are stripped away by the wind like dead
flesh peeling from a corpse as the true nature of castle
couer de noir is revealed for the first time  the massive
walls of the deformed fortress are constructed not of
blocks of stone but with human bones  like the catacombs
of paris the skulls and bones millions and millions of
them are arranged in geometric and decorative patterns
stacked one upon the other an ossuary reaching to the
sky

                         jack os
          the battlements of hell

gump and jack

the green man and the faerie stare in mute horror at the
walls of the castle  the monstrosity of the evil dwarfs
them

                         gump
          tells you something bout him what
          lives there

                         jack
          well need more siege machinery and
          longer scaling ladders

                         gump
          why not mine the damned walls

                         jack
          we do both  our frontal attack a
          diversion whilst we drive a tunnel
          under

gump is cheered by jacks decisiveness and the boldness of
his plan

                         gump
          ill set the dwarves to digging

gump hurries off down the hill muttering and chuckling to
himself

                         gump
          together unto the breach storming
          the bastions of darkness


ext  castle tower  day

his black cloak whipping in the wind masked and gloved
the unicorn horn mounted as a sword and strapped at his
side the baron stands gazing down from his tower at the
frenzied faerie activity below  at his side are two fish
headed demons made more hideous by the deformed armor
they wear

                         baron
                  laughing
          an army of mites see them
          scurry

the faeries  barons pov

from the height of the tower the faeries indeed seem to
be mites frenzied in their tiny activity  a battery of
catapults is aligned scaling ladders laid out in even
rows  gump barks orders as the faerie soldiers form
ranks

                         baron os
          even a wolf has fleas

baron and demons

the baron leans against the parapet the armored demons at
his side

                         1st demon

                         baron

                         baron
          no  smashing is not required  i
          have a surprise for our tiny
          invaders raise that hatch

the baron points to an iron grill covering a skylight
the demons scuttle over and lift it off  immediately the
drone of thousands of tiny wings is heard within

                         1st demon
          i love surprises

the droning grows louder and louder until a dark swarm of
fanged frogbats rushes from the keep like a dark
whirlwind

                         2nd demon
          birdies pretty

                         baron
          i doubt the faeries will admire
          their beauty come this will be
          fun to watch

the demons lurch back to the parapet peering over with
the baron as the black cloud of screaming frogbats
descends like an angry tempest on the faeries gathered
below


ext  forest camp  day

a fanfare of trumpets as the faerie soldiers form ranks on
the plain before castle couer de noir  rows of catapults
siege towers and scaling ladders are arranged along the
edge of the icy forest  gump strides up and down in his
armor before the assembling troops barking orders like a
sergeantmajor

                         gump
          step lively now  pick up the
          pace lads this is war not baby
          pinching or curdling milk

splendid in his armor jack rides the unicorn in review as
the faerie soldiers stand in proud formation before him

                         jack
          well done gump  a braverlooking
          host i cant imagine

                         jack
          men im not much on pretty
          speeches  in a short while the
          heat of battle will test us all and
          i know that each of you will prove
          true and 

jack is interrupted by the drone of thousands of wings
growing everlouder  a shadow falls across the assembled
soldiers  jack looks up to see the cause

the sky  jacks pov

like a tornado of utter evil the dark storm cloud of
frogbats swirls down from the castle tower their high
falsetto screeching rising above the drone of wings

                         jack os
          what calamity be this

the faerie troop

the cloud of fluttering frogbats envelops the ranks of
faerie soldiers  fluttering screaming the tiny winged
creatures swarm into the ranks biting and scratching  the
faeries strike futilely at them with swords and spears
it is like fighting gnats with a teaspoon  there is no
way to keep order  in a moment its every man for
himself  the formation is broken

various angles

screwball has a frogbat attached to his face the tiny
teeth ripping  he tears at the creature and falls to the
ground rolling over and over and screaming in pain

a frogbat zooms down on gump  seen cu the gaping
frogmouth with its row of needlesharp teeth is genuinely
terrifying

gump is already having problems with a halfdozen clinging
frogbats  they bite and tear through his clothing as he
swats at them

the entire formation of faerie soldiers is in disarray
they mill about in frantic confusion helplessly fighting
the swirling myriads of frogbats surrounding them

in his armor jack is relatively wellprotected from the
infuriating creatures  sword in hand he hacks flying
frogbats from the the air as skillfully as a tennis
player returning a serve  several of the evil winged
creatures land on the unicorns rump biting and drawing
blood  sapphire rears and whinnies in fear and pain
jack swats them off with his free hand doing his best to
soothe his mount at the same time

                         jack
          easy girl easy now sapphire
          calm yourself theyre no worse than
          horseflies in summer
                  calling out
          men  defend yourselves  form a
          shield wall hurry  form a shield
          wall

the faerie troop

struggling in panic against the aerial onslaught of the
frogbats the faerie soldiers take heart from jacks
command  they rally with encouraging cries of  come on
lads hop to it  get your shields up  and all
together now form the wall

the savage flying cloud continues its torment as the
beleaguered faeries muster together and form a large
shield wall  the troops in the center lift their shields
above their heads forming an armored ceiling against the
divebombing frogbats  the outer perimeters are also
ranked with overlapping shields  the entire phalanx
closes itself in behind a solid wall of iron shields

jack and gump among the last to join the formation hurry
to its protection as the fury of the frogbats swirls
about them  jack jumps down from the unicorn and pulls
his mount with him under the protection of the shield
wall


int  under the shield wall  day

jack urges sapphire to kneel among the troops  he wipes
the blood from her flanks and calms her

                         jack
          down girl kneel my darling
          its all right now youre safe in
          here

a steady gonglike clanging resounds under the shield
wall  it is the sound of hundreds and hundreds of
frogbats diving into the uplifted shields

gump his clothing torn and face bloodied crawls over to
jack between the stalwart shieldholders

                         gump
          a fine mess this is horrid
          nipping creatures what do we now
          jack

                         jack
          defend ourselves  weve bested far
          worse already

                         gump
          easily spoken

                         jack
          dont loose heart assemble the
          archers  have everyone not holding
          a shield man a bow  shoot the
          damned things as they fly

                         gump
          there arent enough arrows

                         jack
          never mind  just do it  retrieve
          the arrows somehow

gump thinks its helpless but nevertheless musters up a
determined expression and begins barking commands in his
most military manner

                         gump
          here we go then lads  you heard
          jack  every man with a bow front
          and center aim up through the
          shields  send these damn gadflies
          to hell

the archers scramble into position kneeling between the
shield holders and aiming up through the intervening
spaces at the frogbat tempest fluttering above them


ext  castle tower  day

the baron and the demons watch the frenzied commotion
below  the baron enjoys the spectacle immensely

                         baron
                  laughing
          fights over before its begun
          soon the survivors will be in full
          retreat

                         1st demon

                         baron

                         baron
          indeed the best of fun enjoy
          yourselves

the baron wraps his cloak about him and starts for the
stairs

                         1st demon
          you go  not watch fun

                         baron

          awaiting me

                         baron
          this is another victory my friends
          what began with the lash shall be
          concluded with a caress

                         2nd demon
                  leering
          you go to lady now

                         baron
          to finish last evenings delightful
          work

                         1st demon
          we come watch we come watch

                         baron
          nay  this is a private affair no
          audience welcome better you watch
          the dismantling of our enemies
          and look you see the moat is set
          aflame

                         1st demon
          fire moat why do that

                         baron
          purely a precaution

the demons bow low

                         demons
          as you command sire

the baron stalks off sweeping down the circular stairs
into the keep


int  castle passageway  day

the passage is dark and windowless lighted by occasional
flaming torches  the baron strides the length of the
hall  he strips off his protective black garments
casting them aside in his impatient lust  first the
heavy gloves then the wolfmask last with a flourish
the floorlength midnight cloak

stripped to a simple undergown the baron pauses before a
thick ironbound door  he is panting now his nostrils
dilated flecks of spittle frothing his whiskers  his
eyes narrow as he flings open the unbolted door and steps
forward into darkness


int  under the shield wall  day

beneath the shield wall is a world of shadows the shield
bearers dark and solid as tree trunks the archers moving
between them like silhouettes of sagittarius  beams of
light stab down through the openings  the archers kneel
aim and fire upwards into the light  the drumming of
divebombing frogbats rumbles like thunder

the archers encourage one another with boasts and
compliments  good shot  right between the eyes
bullseye  etc etc

screwball kneels and fires next to jack and gump

                         screwball
                  muttering
          steady steady
                  he fires
          there  straight on straight
                  his eyes widen with
                   delight
          bloody marvelous shot

something clangs on the shields above  screwballs arrow
drops at his feet  three frogbats are impaled upon the
shaft like shishkabob

screwball grabs up the arrow and waves his trophy in front
of jack and gump

                         screwball
          look at that shot  three at once
          i cant miss

                         gump
          very thrifty  even got your arrow
          back

all at once a bright blaze of orange light brightens the
interior of the shield wall

                         screwball
          sweet slippers of oisin

                         gump
          theyve fired the moat

                         jack
          water doesnt burn

                         gump
          and frog dont fly and bite like
          tomcats  it be magic jack
          powerful ogres magic

                         jack
          there isnt much time

                         gump
          been telling you that all along
          lad

                         jack
          what magic have we on our side

                         gump
          faerie magics no match for a
          sorcerers power we have oggs
          gifts the key and the 

                         jack
          thats it  the unbreakable line
          well tie it to an arrow and fire it
          up into the timbers above the
          portculis then ill climb up
          and chop down the drawbridge

                         gump
          will you chance a miss

                         jack
          there must be some way to get it up
          there

gump eyes screwball aiming through the shieldwall and a
sly smile spreads across his elfin features

                         gump
          now jack methinks i have the
          perfect solution


ext  plain in front of castle  day

a wall of bright flames surrounds the macabre walls of the
barons castle the black smoke blending with the swirling
cloud of frogbats  cowering beneath all this fury the
faeries shield wall seems a meager fortress at best


int  barons bedroom in castle  day

it is very dark  a small fire on the hearth provides the
only light casting bold flickering shadows across the
spartan chamber

something moves in the shadows  something sleek and
swift  there is another movement sensual and predatory
a hunting animal

the shadows dance animal forms glide through the
flickering light  they are not hunting but mating
their fur shines in the firelight  tails swish in erotic
sinuosity  the low growling moan of their love language
is the sound of pure primal pleasure

glimpsed through the shadows the sensuous sliding animal
movement of the baron and lili becomes a passionate
ballet  their dark bodies writhe and merge a collision
of clouds  the mating of shadows

lili is no victim here but a willing and eager
participant  she seems utterly feminine and feline her
back arched a vibrant moan purring from her throat

the baron mounts her proud as a stallion and their
rhythmic coupling casts lyric shadows across the bare
stone walls


ext  shield wall  day

drifting smoke swirls over the uplifted shields as jack
gump and screwball break from the cover and protection of
the phalanx  they sprint across the open plain  the
smoke covers them  their escape goes unnoticed by the
furious frogbats


ext  edge of forest  day

at the crest of the hill where the plain meets the wooded
forest the faeries siege machinery stands in martial
ranks facing castle couer de noir  a row of catapults is
front and foremost  jack and gump run up the hill towards
the engines of war  screwball lags behind complaining

                         screwball
          why me thats all i ask  why
          not gunner or floki  someone who
          doesnt bruise so easy

screwball reluctantly joins the others at the first of the
catapults

                         screwball
          someone like floki or
          squarefoot or 

                         gump
                  full with authority
          youll do it because i am you liege
          and i command you to do it

screwball gulps back a complaint and kneels before gump

                         screwball
          aye my lord

                         gump
          rise screwball and into the basket
          with you

screwball gets slowly to his feet and just as slowly
climbs into the launching basket of the catapult

                         screwball
          maybe theres a better idea what
          about birds get a lift from some
          friendly bird

                         jack
          havent heard a bird sing in days

                         screwball
          or a kite  we could make a
          kite let the wind do the work 

                         gump
          shut up

screwball is instantly silent  gump hands him the
dwarves golden rope

                         gump
          start acting like youre worthy of
          this mission here  whatever you
          do dont dare drop it

                         screwball
          nay sire ill cling to it as to
          life itself

                         gump
          good lad here jack give me a
          hand with the windlass theres a
          good fellow

together jack and gump labor at winding back the windlass
on the catapult  as they turn the launching arm is drawn
slowly back a cowering screwball fearfully clutching the
golden line in the wovenleather basket

                         jack
          one more turn

                         gump
          thats it

the launching arm is bent back into a taut arch
screwball clenches his eyes shut  jack stands by the
release lever

                         jack
          have the engineers corrected for
          alignment and trajectory

                         gump
          aye  before the wee pesties
          attacked

                         jack
          then its godspeed screwball

                         gump
                  loudly
          fire away

                         screwball
          oberons hump protect meeeeeeeee

jack pulls the lever releasing the windlass and the arm
whips forward catapulting screwball high into the air
over the castle  his cry is lost on the wind as his form
diminishes into a tiny dot arcing over the walls above the
flaming moat


ext  castle courtyard  day

a leanto roofed with thatch is build along the inside
wall sheltering a stable  the courtyard is deserted as
screwball comes hurtling like a meteor  he lands in the
thatch and sinks from sight

after a moment screwballs pixie face appears out of the
straw

                         screwball
          someone what doesnt bruise says
          i glorious mission says they

a clatter of armored footfalls alerts screwball to the
approach of the barons demonic troops  a squad of
hideous heironymous bosch imps fearful combinations of
reptiles and swine longbeaked birds with insect wings
feathered rodents deformed jackals trots noisily across
the cobbles below

screwball ducks into the thatch

                         screwball
          dear oh dear straight from
          hell by the looks of em

the grotesque armor the imps wear adds to their sinister
appearance  they jabber loudly at oneanother in a
fearful gobbledygook  the wicked points of their
partisans glitter passing at eyelevel as screwball
burrows deeper into the thatch

after a moment the echoes of the imps passage fades
screwball pops up out of the straw and has a look around
the coiled golden line clutched tightly in his grasp

                         screwball
          bet they eat elves for breakfast

screwball clambers to the top of the leanto roof and
climbs up the protruding bones and skulls to the top of
the wall


ext  top of wall  day

screwball stares down the dizzying abyss into the flaming
moat  he waves at his beleaguered companions but is
hidden from view by drifting smoke  this is a good thing
for another squad of impgoons troops across the courtyard
below

                         screwball
          get moving screwball fore they
          serves you up on a piece of toast

screwball scampers along the ridge of the wall hopping
over the crenelations like a squirrel


ext  ledge  day

the wall abuts into the curving battlements of the
central keep towering above  a narrow ledge leads away
from the top of the wall arcing around the keep to the
portculis

screwball begins the traverse like a mountaineer edging
one sliding foot at a time along the ledge trying not to
look down into the flame and smoke nor across at his
comrades huddles under the shield wall


ext  edge of forest  day

jack and gump wait by the catapult straining to see
through the smoke shrouding the facade of the ghastly
castle

                         gump
                  pointing
          there he is out on the keep

the castle  gumps pov

at the distance screwball seems quite helpless inching
along the outer wall of the keep like a mouse on the back
of a sleeping lion

                         jack os
          i see him

jack

as he stares hawklike at screwball

                         jack
          hell be atop the portculis ere
          long

                         gump
          best get down close to the moat
          lad

                         jack
          aye  were good as inside

                         gump
          its what well find there worries
          me

using the drifting smoke for cover jack runs down the
open hillside towards the flaming moat


ext  ledge  day

screwball continues his cautious progress across the
curving facade of the keep

                         screwball
          i should be out sippin fresh cows
          milk straight from the udder
          thats what i should be doing

screwballs progress takes him under a sealed iron
shutter  the sound of growls and moaning brings him up
short

                         screwball
          whats this now

hooking his fingers into the eyesockets of a convenient
skull screwball gets a good grip and clambers up the wall
to the window sill  hanging like a bat he peers through
the tiny slit between the bottom of the shutter and the
sill


int  barons bedchamber  day screwballs pov

the sounds of moaning are low and vibrant  the room is
masked in shadows  items of torn discarded clothing lie
in contorted positions about the flagstone floor  the
coals on the hearth glow like the eyes of a demonic beast
not far away the unicorn horn leans against the wall
bathed in the embers glow  lili and the baron lie
together amidst a tangle of quilts and featherbeds  they
moan softly bodies wrapped in sinuous ease  their dark
fur gleams  very tenderly they lick oneanother like
cats


ext  ledge  day

screwball carefully lowers himself back to the ledge
grinning like a pixie

                         screwball
          found the alicorn i did i did
          found the baron too hee hee

screwball tiptoes away on the ledge more sure of himself
now

                         screwball
          wont be the first caught on loves
          horns


ext  roof over portculis  day

a coppersheathed arch rising over the entranceway  the
drawbridge is drawnup tight underneath and serves as a
massive gate

screwball hops off the ledge onto the roof  a gargoyle
rivaling the barons impish cohorts juts out of the wall
just beneath  screwball ties one end of the golden line
around it


ext  edge of moat  day

jack hurries along the moatedge flames licking past him
he looks up and spots screwball tying the line to the
gargoyle above

                         jack
          screwball down here

screwball waves at jack

                         screwball
                  calling down
          hello jack

                         jack
          done like a champion  can you reach
          me with the line


ext  roof over portculis  day

screwball ties his sheathknife to the other end of the
line

                         screwball
          easy as eating pancakes

screwball tosses the weighted line out over the moat  it
clears the flames and lands at jacks feet


ext  castle wall  day

jack jumps with the line and pendulums across the moat
through the leaping flames  he lands with his feet
against the bones of the wall and proceeds to haul himself
up hand over hand


ext  drawbridge winch  day

jack reaches the top of the drawbridge  he walks the rope
like a man on a leash and gets a leg over the top  on a
small platform under the open roof stands a large wooden
winch  the thick cable securing the drawbridge is wound
around it

jack climbs onto the platform and draws his sword  in
three swift strokes he hacks through the cable  the winch
spins wildly as the chain holding the drawbridge rattle
out through embrasures

amid the clatter the drawbridge slowly descends


ext  castle  day

the drawbridge gathers speed and lands with a loud crash
across the flaming moat


ext  shield wall  day

batting away bombarding frogbats gump rushes up to the
shield wall shouting for joy

                         gump
                  shouting
          lads look  the drawbridge is
          down the walls be breached

the faeries under their shields give out with a single
exultant victory cheer breaking ranks and running pell
mell down the hill towards the lowered drawbridge  the
frogbats fly after them like a swarm of pursuing bees

high above the portculis jack waves his sword in the air
cheering them on


ext  drawbridge  day

shouting and yelling like invading vikings the faerie
soldiers swarm across the drawbridge swords and spears on
high  they are met by an alarmed contingent of the
barons household guard  a nightmare battle is joined
faeries against fiends  the clash of steel on steel rings
through the stone courtyard  sapphire gallops into the
thick of the fray impaling a molefaced imp on her long
spiraling horn

the frogbats swarming in under the open portculis make
no distinction between friend and for biting and
harassing the barons troops as indiscriminately as the
faerie soldiers  this adds an additional element of
confusion to the conflict  the faeries gain ground
hacking and stabbing into the inner reaches of the castle


ext  roof over portculis  day

the roar and howl of battle drowns jacks enthusiastic
cheers as he urges his men on from atop the roof over the
portculis

we see screwball eagerly telling what he observed in the
keep but the sounds of the conflict below cover his
actual words  it is obvious from screwballs enthusiastic
gestures that he describes the location of the unicorn
horn  screwball points along the ledge to the shuttered
window in the keep

a tremendous cry of victory rises from below as the
faeries break through the ranks of imps and surge forward
into the castle


int  barons bedroom  day

the room is dark  lili lies in the barons arms
surrounded by tangled bedclothing  he strokes her soft
fur gently  a muffled cry is heard outside and lili
alarmed sits up abruptly

                         lili
          what was that  did you hear that

                         baron
          its nothing  my men take great
          delight in routing the enemy  dont
          trouble yourself beauty

                         lili
          it sounded like it came from the
          courtyard

                         baron
          from the parapets most likely  the
          men are amused by a battlefield
          entertainment of my own contriving

                         lili
          might we watch too

                         baron
          later beloved now i wish only to
          be with you

lili snuggles against the barons chest running her
fingers through the silky hair covering him

                         lili
          and i with you i never dreamed
          life held such pleasures

                         baron
          pleasure is for those who seize it
          do you think those insipid pale
          skinned mortals will ever know such
          rapture

                         lili
          its odd when i first found
          myself changing i was sick
          with loathing and disgust  i
          thought i was so ugly i wanted to
          die

                         baron
          and now

                         lili
          now i want to live forever  ive
          never felt so strong or happy

                         baron
          or looked so beautiful

                         lili
          yes  i feel that too  weakness is
          what is ugly

                         baron
          precisely my darling  your animal
          strength your primitive power has
          surfaced you are what you desire

                         lili
          to be strong and free that is all
          i desire

                         baron
          so you shall be like our
          brothers the hawk and the wolf our
          spirits know no master we are
          created in the pure image of the
          savage god that set our turbulent
          universe in motion

lili stretches languidly rubbing against the baron

                         lili
          and what savagery would please you
          most my lord

the barons talons rake lilis fur as he hauls her into a
rough embrace

                         baron
          mating with you beloved to share
          that exquisite pain once more

the baron bites her shoulder  lili yips with animal
delight

the iron shutters are thrown open with a loud crash  a
swath of sunlight stabs into the darkened chamber  sword
in hand jack stands on the window sill silhouetted
against the brightness outside

the baron shrieks and falls off the bed groaning with
pain on the floor

                         baron
          the light  the light

                         jack
          yield couer de noir or i grant no
          quarter

the baron scrambles on all fours across the floor seeking
to avoid the light  he snatches up the unicorn horn
leaning against the wall and ducks into the shadows

                         baron
          protect me beloved  i need your
          help

lili

as she reacts to the barons plight  her eyes narrow her
ears tuck back a low growl rumbles from her throat as she
bears her fangs

                         baron os
          defend me  my darling you must
          defend me

with the roar of a savage jungle cat lili leaps down off
the bed as jack jumps into the room

                         jack
          afraid to fight baron

claws hooked and gleaming lili stalks growling between
jack and the cowering baron  jack doesnt recognize her
so monstrous in her savage appearance  he backs away a
step holding his sword in front of him

                         jack
          any closer and ill cut you down

lili growls  with a sudden leap she is upon jack raking
his face with her claws as she sinks her fangs into his
neck where the bare flesh shows above his breastplate
jack screams in surprise and pain falling back under
lilis attack

jack and lili fall to the floor rolling over and over in
a fierce struggle

in the shadows the baron takes advantage of this
distraction  he creeps to the side of the fireplace and
pulls a hidden switch  a secret panel swings away from
the wall  quickly the baron scurries inside the dark
passageway beyond  the panel slides closed behind him

jack pulls free from the wild creature assaulting him  he
struggles to his feet grabbing up his sword where he
dropped it in the attack

lili crouches snarling as jack backs away  with a wild
cry she springs at him again  jack thrusts defensively
with his sword  lili is impaled the gleaming blade run
completely through her body  moaning she sags into
jacks arms his golden armor drenched in her blood

jack and lili

as she trembles in jacks unwilling embrace lilis
features alter and transform  the fangs and claws
disappear  her fur is gone  she is just a naked girl
again dying in her lovers arms

                         jack
                  shocked
          lili  no

                         lili
          jack forgive me

as gently as possible jack pulls the sword from lilis
body  he drops the weapon to the floor and lifts the
gravely injured princess in his arms

                         jack
          what have i done

                         lili
          only whats right

jack carries lili over to the bed and lays her gently
down

                         jack
          i thought you were dead i 

                         lili
          i was bewitched its better this
          way

                         jack
          they told me you were dead

lili is weakening

                         lili
          i wish i were will be soon
          dont be troubled jack tis a great
          gift youve given me

jack buries his face in the bedclothes sobbing

                         jack
          no  i wont let it happen

                         lili
          youve freed me jack

                         jack
          its the barons damnable work  too
          cowardly to stand and fight he
          used you to save himself

                         lili
          no its not you hes afraid of
          its light

                         jack

                         jack

          day

                         jack
          so hes hiding in the dark

                         lili

          love you

                         lili
          and i love you

the door to the bedroom crashes open and gump along with
screwball and several other armed faeries enter
excitedly

                         gump
          jack  the courtyards been taken
          the barons forces are besieged in
          the south tower  no sign of
          jack  do you hear what im saying

                         jack

                         jack
           the princess lili ive killed
          her

gump approaches the bed and examines the wounded princess

                         gump
          shes sore hurt jack tis true but
          not dead yet

                         jack
          the wound is mortal

                         gump
          nay  youve not reckoned with the
          powers of faerie medicine

                         jack
          can you save her

                         gump
          easily the question is can we
          save ourselves  be a shame to win
          the battle only to lose the war

                         jack

                         gump

          senses  unless we find baron couer
          de noir and bring back the horn the
          world is doomed

jack is himself again eager for action  he grabs up his
fallen sword and starts for the sealed secret passage

                         jack
          the baron hides in the dark in a
          passage under the castle quick
          give me the dwarfs key the one
          which opens any lock

          that

          means seek him out but first we
          needs visit the kitchen


int  kitchen  day

on stout shelves along the masonry walls are rows and rows
of brightly polished plates and pots  all sizes and
shapes gold silver and copper kitchen utensils shine and
sparkle

                         jack os
          the kitchen

jack and gump

they stand by the huge hearth staring up at the cookware
shining all around them

                         gump
          the kitchen be the most important
          room in a palace for if the
          victuals aint right little else is
          likely to be so

                         jack
          did you bring me here to sup

                         gump

          weapon youll need fighting the
          baron

          sunlight

                         jack
          plan on carrying some away in a
          kettle

                         gump

                  to screwball
          screwball  fetch me down a couple
          of them plates

screwball scurries up to a nearby shelf and brings down
two large golden plates

                         screwball
          howre these

                         gump
          theyll do nicely

gump takes a plate and polishes it on his sleeve  he
points to the far side of the room

                         gump
          stand over there and hold your
          plate like this

gump demonstrates how he wants the plate held  screwball
grips it with both hands holding it up before jack like a
mirror

                         jack
          will you explain whats going on

                         gump
          patience lad

gump moves to where a beam of sunlight angles through the
high kitchen window  he holds his plate in the light
trying different angles until at last he manages to
reflect the sunlight beaming it straight at the plate
screwball holds  instantly it is reflected off
screwballs plate and strikes jack straight in the eye
blinding him

                         jack
          hey  stop it  i cant see

                         gump
          ah but you will  and so will the
          baron when we bring a little light
          to his dark hideaway

gump aims his platter at jack  a blaze of reflected
sunlight fills the screen with dazzling whiteness


int  secret passage  day

a dazzle of sunlight filling the screen

                         gump os
          very nice goldenrod

a very young elf struggles to hold a giant golden salver
sending a beam of sunlight scintillating down the
meandering tunnel

gump and jack hold torches at the next bend  gump
positions a lovely niade with a copper pot lid stealing a
kiss on her fair shoulder in the process

                         gump
          stand here my dear thats
          right

gump stands behind the niade guiding her arms so that the
pot lid catches the sunbeam properly

                         gump
          turn it just a wee bit

the beam bounces on down the tunnel

passageway

zigzags up through the interior of the castle steep
stone stairs leading from level to level  faeries stand
at every bend passing the sunlight one to another like an
astral bucket brigade  standing in a long soupkitchen
line in the darkness alongside is a file of elves
faeries and gnomes each holding a platter bowl or pot
lid

jack and gump

drawn sword in hand torch uplifted jack stands at the
head of the procession impatiently stepping forward into
darkness

                         jack
          cant we move any faster

                         gump
          tis a delicate operation lad
          requires a bit of engineering
          next

a hunched longbearded gnome hurries forward clutching a
copper frying pan polished to a mirrorfinish

                         gnome
          brown tom o kirkdale reporting for
          duty sir

                         gump
          stand easy brown tom right here
          is good

jack  further down the tunnel

jack moves quite a good way down the tunnel a corona of
torchlight surrounding him in the darkness

                         jack
                  calling back
          seems to be some sort of vaulted
          chamber up ahead

                         gump
                  yelling back
          dont get too far

                         jack
          hurry up


int  vaulted chamber  day

torch in hand jack moves cautiously out of the passageway
into a vast underground room spacious as the nave of a
cathedral  stone columns thick as treetrunks rise into
the shadows above  jack never relaxes his guard  he
turns to check behind him every third step

from a distance jack shines like a multifaceted jewel
his every surface winks with reflected light
breastplate shield helmet even the long tapered sword
held before him

gumps voice echoes from far away

                         gump os
          jaack

jack is midway into the chamber  he moves like a canny
warrior pivoting checking his rear light on his toes

angle

the sibilant hiss of a swordblade rending the air  the
clang of contact as the torch is knocked from jacks grasp
and sent tumbling to the floor

jack whirls to face the challenge  it is the baron
enormous in the flickering light of the fallen torch like
some horned bear on his hind legs the baron advances the
unicorn horn gripped in his sword hand

jack hauls his shield off his back stepping forward to
meet the challenge  the baron swings with both hands
gripping the horn hilt  jack parries with the avatar
when steel hits the alicorn it is as if lightning strikes
sparks fly  a second exchange has jack in retreat

the baron lunges with the alicorn  jack receives the
thrust on his shield  the curling point of the horn
punctures the dwarfs handiwork like an arrow through a
target  for a moment the two combatants are locked
together facetoface  secure in his armor jack swings
his sword at the unclad baron  he leaps back with the
agility of a wild beast wrenching the shield from jacks
grip and flinging it clattering aside into darkness

jack backs away as the baron renews the attack  again
the lightning clash of swordplay  jack strives valiantly
to withstand the onslaught but the baron is too powerful
the swordplay comes faster  jack stumbles to one knee
the baron disarms him with a mighty blow  the avatar
rings musically as it tumbles out of reach into the
shadows

the barons leering face is made more demonic by the
unsteady torchlight

                         baron
          so boy pray while theres still
          breath in you

the baron draws back his arm for the death stroke  the
torch flickers out

the barons cry resounds in the blackness

                         baron os
          die

angle

a blinding flash of light  the baron screams a wail of
utter pain as the beam of sunlight hits him

screwball

stands by a pillar holding a silver plate  he directs the
sunlight at the baron following him as he twists and
writhes in agony

jack

scrambles across the floor seizing his fallen sword  he
leaps to his feet and rushes at the cringing baron caught
in the light like a hapless moth

it is jacks turn to wield a deathblow  he draws back to
strike and the light wobbles  the beam strikes jack in
the eyes  he is momentarily blinded  he swings and
misses his sword carving the empty air

                         jack
          damn

gump

rushes up to screwball cuffing him sharply on the back of
the head

                         gump
          dolt

                         screwball
          sorry

the clatter of hooffalls is heard galloping in the
distance

jack rushes up sword in hand

                         jack
          hes getting away  he was at my
          mercy

                         gump
          never show mercy

                         jack
          i could have struck off his head
          just now

                         screwball
          sorry jack

                         jack
          its done well never catch him

                         gump
          ever wondered why jenny greenteeth
          said you needed the fastest steed on
          earth

                         jack
          sapphire

gump turns brusquely to screwball grabbing his tunic

                         gump
          fetch the unicorn pass it
          along

screwball runs up the vast chamber to an elf standing at
the entrance to the passageway

                         screwball
                  panting
           fetch the unicorn pass it
          along

the elf turns abruptly and runs up the tunnel


int  secret passageway  day

from elf to dwarf to goblin the word is passed  the wee
folk scurry like moles in the dark tunnel their piping
voices taking up the cry

                         various faeries
           fetch the unicorn pass it
          along fetch the unicorn pass
          it along fetch the unicorn
          pass it along

the tiny voices merge and blend as the message is
transmitted more and more rapidly  the words are lost in
the steady rhythm  it is like the chirping of crickets on
a summer evening


int  vaulted chamber  day

the chirping voices carry over and become the clipclop of
hooves  a graceful elf leads sapphire the mare unicorn
out of the darkness to where gump screwball and several
other faeries stand waiting

                         gump
          swift as thistledown on the wind
          thats the faerie way

jack has recovered his shield now slung across his back
he vaults effortlessly aboard the unicorn clutching the
long mane

                         jack
          easy sapphire

gump hands him up a blazing torch

                         gump
          ride like wild fire jack

                         jack
          hell not escape me

                         gump
          youre on your own like a true
          champion

jack stabs his heels into the unicorns flank and is lost
from sight as a single leap carries him into darkness
gump and the others stand watching as the sound of hoof
clatter fades

                         gump
           champion


int  cave  day

jack gallops out of the vaulted chamber through a tall
portal leading into a winding cave  torch held high jack
races between the tapered spines of stalagmites  the
shadows of the stalactites hanging like daggers shift on
the stone walls as the unicorn thunders past

up ahead a distant gleam of natural light beckons


ext  cave mouth  day

jack and sapphire burst from the mouth of the cave in a
spray of dust  jack wheels the mare around to a halt as
he studies the barren ground  a distinct set of hoof
prints leads off into the distance  jack urges sapphire
into a gallop along this track


ext  demonic landscape  day

various angles

it is a landscape of death like some breughel vision of
hell  ravaged by war and pestilence all of the trees are
stripped bare  the houses are in ruins broken walls and
tumbled towers stand like rotten stumps  bones protrude
from the muck  corpses lie bloated and moldering

wagon wheels are set atop naked trees skeletons tied
spreadeagled across them  like hooded inquisitors
vultures perch hunched along the rims

villages smolder in ruins in the distance  smoke drifts
like fog between the blasted trees  resolutely jack
keeps up the chase  the unicorn flies like a specter
across the moribund landscape  jack is riding towards the
very gates of hell itself


ext  edge of the world  day

the landscape is barren now even of destruction  mud
volcanoes belch steam and fire  grotesque buttes hunch
under an unforgiving sky

a wall of sulfurous flames leap like a vast curtain
behind the sudden precipice cleaving abruptly from the
edge of the earth

the baron stands alone like a titan at the edge of this
cliff his mount dead at his feet  his silhouette is
terrible against the flames  he holds the alicorn like
zeus gripping a thunderbolt

jack trots forward on sapphire to meet him  at twenty
paces distance he dismounts and draws his sword

the baron smiles

                         baron
          welcome jack i knew youd be
          along

holding his shield before him jack closes on the baron

                         baron
          you are jack are you not  the
          princess has told me so much about
          you

jack grimaces at the mention of lili

                         jack
          you cursed her

                         baron
          i gave her a taste of such joy as
          her wildest dreams never provided
          even now my seed takes hold in the
          fiery furnace of her womb

jack rushes at him in anger

                         jack
          you lie

jack swings wildly  the baron parries with the alicorn
sparks flash on contact  jack is driven back

                         baron
          foolish boy  i take what i want and
          so i took your princess

                         jack
          damn you

jack leaps to the attack but the baron holds him back
sparks flying

                         baron
          yes exactly damnation  dont
          you know me jack  dont you know
          from whence i come

the barons form alters hideously  huge leathery wings
sprout behind him  his eye glow like coals  talons form
on his hairy hands  lizard scales armor his chest  he
truly appears to be a demon from hell

                         baron
          i bring your head as a gift to my
          lord lucifer

alicorn gripped in both hands the baron rushes forward
he swings with all his might  jack parries with the
avatar  there is an explosion of light  jacks sword
is broken in two  the force of the blow knocks him to his
knees  he is helpless

the baron raises the alicorn to strike

                         baron
          for you oh my master satan

angle

as the baron stands swordhorn uplifted like a
sacrificial priest the stormdarkened heavens suddenly
part  the clouds open and a ray of sunlight strikes the
baron like a bolt from god

the baron contorts with pain in the bright light  the
unicorn horn glows whitehot  the fur on his hand smokes
and he drops the alicorn screaming with pain

without warning sapphire gallops up behind the baron and
spears him through the middle  the unicorn lifts his
writhing form high in the air impaled like some kicking
insect  with a toss of her horn she hurls him to the
ground

the baron hunches on his knees gripping his midsection
in a futile attempt to keep the foul black bile from
spilling out of him like a discharge of sewer water  he
rears back his fanged head and shouts in pain

                         baron
                  crying out
          lord satan protect me

jack

jumps to his feet  in three swift strides he has
snatchedup the alicorn  it is no longer incandescent
with heat

without pausing jack delivers a roundhouse swing
lopping the barons head from his shoulders  a fountain
of black filth spews from his truncated neck as the body
topples

the severed head bounces off the edge of the cliff
tumbling out of sight past circling buzzards into the haze
of smoke

jack looks over and grins at sapphire who rears and
whinnies in triumph

the barons body sags like a deliquescent pumpkin leaking
rottenness  smoke swirls around the cliff edge  jack
wipes the alicorn clean of the barons black blood

                         jack
          hes dead lili he cant hurt you
          any more

the barons body continues to melt away seeping into the
dry dust like bubbling tar

sapphire sidles over and rubs against jack  the green man
wraps his arm around the unicorns neck  the two
companions stand at the edge of earth staring out into
the swirling flames


ext  hillside overlooking castle couer de noir  day

the world is lush and green once again  the trees billow
like deciduous cumuli  bold spring flowers polkadot the
emerald meadow  in the distance the castle couer de noir
is in flames thick black smoke staining the azure sky

the faerie army marches across the meadow singing
jubilantly  they carry their wounded away on litters
foremost of these are the biers bearing oona and lili
the princess litter is festooned with blossom heaps of
wildflowers blanket the unconscious girl

                         faeries all together
                  singing
          they sky is high the world is wide
          beneath the flowers faeries hide

mounted on sapphire and her foal jack and gump pause on
the crest of the hill to look back on the faerie
procession and the burning castle  jack carries the
alicorn like a marshalls baton  the sound of the
faeries singing drifts musically up across the meadow
jimmy squarefoot staggers along under an armload of booty

                         jack
          a good day for singing

                         gump
          ive not heard a note out of you

                         jack
          not in the mood im afraid

                         gump
          listen to him  not in the mood

                         gump
          on a day like none other the blessed
          earth has ever seen a day so fair
          as forty springtimes 

                         jack
          im not denying its a joyous day 

                         gump
          wheres your joy if you cannot sing

                         jack
          were the princess lili to join me i
          would sing till my lungs burst

                         gump
          she lives isnt that worth
          singing about

                         jack
          she lives like all the world before
          the barons curse lifted  now the
          worlds reborn yet still she
          sleeps

across the way the castle couer de noir collapses in upon
itself in a spasm of sparks and fire  only the outer
walls and the keep remain  cracks appear as the final
ramparts begin to crumble

                         gump
          youre too impatient see how long
          the castle burns  think you evil be
          purged in an instant  and
          remember  the quest is not
          concluded

jack runs his hands along the spiraling length of the
alicorn

                         jack
          aye well fetch it back praise
          god


ext  marshside meadow  day cu unicorn skull

the skull of the slain unicorn has been reunited with his
horn  a band of silver filigree conceals the repairwork
bedecked with flowers the skull rests on a velvet pillow
it is being carried in a procession

funeral procession

there is nothing somber or sorrowful about the ceremony
screwball dressed in flowers carries the pillow bearing
the unicorns skull  behind him beautiful winged faerie
maidens in gossamer gowns carry long serpentine festoons
of flowers  other elves and goblins toss handfuls of
petals and pollen into the air  they all sing happily as
sapphire and her colt prance along with them

                         faeries all together
                  singing
          the trees are green spirits unseen
          the world we know is but a dream
          the flowers sing all birds take wing
          life and death are an endless ring

the procession approaches an underground faerie tomb
beautifully constructed of fieldstone  the opening is
like a well leading down to the beehive chamber beneath
the earth  at the bottom on a blanket of blossoms the
unicorns bleached alabaster bones are precisely arranged

two winged faeries take the pillow from screwball and fly
with it down into the tomb placing it at the head of the
skeleton  a shaft of sunlight makes the skull and horn
gleam like polished ivory  all the elves and faeries
laughing and singing cast the flowers they carry down
into the tomb

jack and gump

with the happy sound of the funeral as a counterpoint
neither jack nor gump appear particularly overjoyed  they
stand beside princess lilis litter  her still pale form
and the surrounding profusion of flowers bear too close a
resemblance to the ceremony in the background  jack and
gump mourn the living

                         jack
          the quests at an end and wheres
          the good of it  a faerie festival
          over a pile of bones

                         gump
          tis not the wound thats sure  not
          a scar remains were talking
          about a spell harder to repair than
          swordwork

                         jack
          ill do anything face any
          challenge

                         gump
          might not need a gesture quite so
          grand  what were you doing the very
          moment the barons curse fell on the
          world

                         jack
          i was with the princess

                         gump
          where

                         jack
          by the pond  she was teasing me

                         gump
          go on go on

                         jack
          she tossed her ring in the pond and
          bid me fetch it  said shed marry
          me if i did

                         gump
          and did you

                         jack
          nay  it was lost  when i came up
          for air the pond was frozen over

                         gump
          thats it then the ring


ext  pond  day

as beautiful and serene as when first we saw it  the
princess is laid out under a tree cushioned by thousands
of flowers  all the faeries stand about the edge of the
water watching jack remove his armor

jack unbuckles the golden breastplate of achilles and
stacks it next to his gleaming shield and helmet  gump
helps him unfasten the greaves

                         gump
          you must find the ring it
          completes the cycle answers the
          riddle

                         jack
          ill try

                         gump
          youre good at riddles find the
          ring and the spell is broken

jack stripes down completely  he steps to the edge of the
pond pausing for a moment to look fondly at his faerie
friends gathered around him

                         jack
          your fond wishes give me strength
          dear friends

                         screwball
                  hooting
          no speeches  whats a little swim
          after sticking worms and ogres

the faeries applaud and cheer  blushing jack dives into
the water


ext  underwater  day

the cheering is silenced by the rush of water as jack
streaks down streams of airbubbles in his wake

jack strokes deeper and deeper past undulating weeds and
curious fish

at the bottom he moves carefully trying not to stir up
the muck  he gently parts the drifting tendrils
searching among the weeds

a winking gleam catches his eye  he reaches out an eager
hand to seize whatever it is

a cloud of silt issues from his grasp as he opens his
fingers  centered on his palm golden and perfect is the
ring

jack turns and strokes for the surface a shining ceiling
of light far above him


ext  pond  day

jack breaks the still surface with a happy shout  he
holds the ring triumphantly above his head

                         jack
                  exultant
          i did it  i found it

laughing joyously jack swims for the shore  the banks
are deserted  not a single faerie remains  but jack
seems not to notice  he takes hold of a treeroot and
hauls himself back on land  the golden armor of achilles
is gone  in its place are jacks old fur and leaf
vestments

                         jack
          and will my lady honor her word in
          exchange for this bauble

jack stops short when he sees the princess asleep under
the tree  there is no trace of the heaps of flowers upon
which she rested  nor of the jeweled gown she wore on the
litter  she looks just as before  only asleep

                         jack

          spectacle ive provided

tossing the ring abstractly up and down jack pulls on his
fur trousers and approaches the sleeping princess  he
kneels before her lifting her hand to his lips

                         jack
          beggars on horseback come courting
          the crown

jack slips the ring on lilis finger  her eyelashes
flutter  she is awake looking him straight in the face

                         lili

they fall eagerly into each others arms  their long
passionate embrace is interrupted by an unseen pest

                         jack
          ow

jack swats at his legs

                         lili

          like a fly trapped inside my ear

                         jack
          ow  whatever it is it hurts

princess lili takes jack by the hand and starts running
pulling him along with her

                         lili
          hurry up then jack o the green
          youll be safe in the castle
          well hand out bells and crosses
          strew the floors with flax and
          salt


ext  forest path  day

lili and jack run together holding hands down a sunlit
forest path  the dialogue is continuous

                         lili
          no faeries in the palace we have
          our own magician knows lots of
          spells first well tell my
          father the news youll like my
          father jack  hes not like most
          kings

watching from a high bank unseen by lili and jack the
mare unicorn and her black colt stand in sundappled
silence  the colt rubs against his mothers flank as she
gently blows on his mane with her delicate seashell
nostrils

below jack and lili run together up the path into a blaze
of sunlight

                         lili
           and we wont have to stay in
          some stuffy manor all the time
          when the weathers fair we can live
          in the woods ill wear homespun
          like shepherdess

they disappear into the glare and the screen goes white

                         the end
