     face in on

     the surface of the ocean

     sunny and placid then slowly we begin descending underwater

     moving down from the bright surface waters through layers
     of fish and marine life

     a school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current
     their numbers are enormous their movements in unison
     suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the
     school taking out four or five before disappearing into the
     shadows  the school moves on as if nothing happened
     quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only
     seconds before

     we move deeper and deeper

     fish disappear darkness envelopes us  cold and lifeless
     where light has never penetratedfive thousand feet ten
     thousand  deeper where only strange selfilluminating
     echoniderms move eerily through the currents  then suddenly
     we hear static from radio transmission  then voices

                                jones
                   burritosenchiladas

                                dejesus

     several voices suddenly break into argumentvegetables

     others

                                becks voice radio

                   shack seven here  i aint the hook
                   over

     a light flares out of the darkness suddenly illuminating an
     immense shapefifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal
     nearly seven feet tall  it is a motorized diving suit and
     we see the stenciled name willie across the front
     breastplate  as it pivots we see the stationary worklights
     around the base of a large underwater mining operation the
     shack  then a womans voice

                                willies voice
                                womans voice
                   six to shack  im the hook

     inside the shack control room

     littered with papers halffull coffee cups and a confusion
     of wires and very lowtech hightech equipment beck sits at
     the monitor controls  he is younger than we expected
     twenties clean cut good looks  hell be a hell of a good
     looking man at thirtyfive he just needs to be hardened
     from the looks of the coffee cups around him hes on his
     way

                                becks voice radio
                   okay six lets wrap this container
                   and call it a day

     above him a bank of monitor screens  each one labeled with
     a crew members name and providing a video picture from a
     camera mounted on their helmet  beck reaches above him and
     throws a console switch which activates another monitor
     labeled rov  with a joystick he manipulates an outside
     camerathe rov its picture we see on the monitor  it is
     moving

     underwater

     willies pov  the inside of her helmet is a grid of led
     gauges monitoring air reserve body temperature
     atmospheres heart rate blood pressure

     she stops next to a pair of railroadlike tracks and removes
     the tool attached to the end of her arm  the move is
     practiced and professional like a cook changing the tool on
     a set of egg beaters  first she inserts the existing tool
     into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she
     disengages the tool  next she selects the next tool from
     the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into
     position  sixpacks voice comes over the radio

                                sixpacks voice
                   hey willie you trip on a
                   tit or something  were all
                   waiting on you honey

                                willie
                                under control
                   keep your pants on sixpack
                   i promise youll be inside before
                   mr rogers neighborhood comes on

     over the radio we hear other mens voices laughing  they
     like willie and cheer her on  tell him willie atta
     girl etc

     willie clicks in her last tool and turns  expertly she
     hooks a large dumpsterlike container the container to what
     looks like an underwater parachutea container
     transporterwhich when filled with oxygen it lifts the
     massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauledin
     by a winch

                                willies voice
                   six to shackhooks on  ready
                   to winch

     underwater machinery

     halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and
     dumpsters squatting in the gloom  a winch begins grinding
     and the big newly hooked container lurches down the tracks
     it comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with
     several others to complete a set  we hear becks voice

                                beck radio
                   ok thats it  come on in

     more motor suited divers appear their helmet lights
     glaring  their breastplate names catch in the dim lights
     cobs bowman willie

     as they approach the underwater lock where an elevator will
     transport them up into the shack we see signs of human
     life  a basketball goal attached to the side of the
     building stickers and signs  no bozos etc  a formal sign
     towers over the entrance  it says transocean corp shack 6

     on one of the crew

     he moves behind the others  suddenly he freezes in his
     tracks and slowly rotates his helmeton his shoulder in the
     glare of his helmet beam we see the a hideous looking sea
     spider  its thick legs moving eerily down his arm

     carefully so as not to disturb the creature a mechanical
     motor hand moves into position below it and in one quick
     movement snares it

     close on metal waist pocket  the latch opens and the
     writhing sea spider is shoved inside  from the pocket we
     move up the divers suit until we see the name sixpack on
     the breastplate  he looks around to see if anyone has
     noticed then continues on toward the shack

     on two diversjones and dejesus

     they walk together to the shack  a latino voice dejesus
     comes over the radio singing an old miller beer jingle in an
     exaggerated accent

                                dejesus
                   when its time to relax
                   one thing stands clear

     inside on beck

     as he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker we see
     he aches to be a part of their comaraderie but is alienated
     by age and rank  he is the shack boss management  he
     listens as a booming black voice joins in offkey

                                jones voiceoc
                   millers tastes too good to
                   hurry through

     as the singing continues beck looks over at an empty chair
     in front of a bank of equipment monitors  the vital signs
     of each miner and his equipment are registered on this
     console  the chair in front of them sits conspicuously
     empty  this doesnt please beck neither does a hand
     written sign under the console which states  the doctor isout

     dejesus pov

     inside his helmet we see the grid of led gauges monitoring
     vital signs

                                dejesus
                   beer after beer

     suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom
     corner inside dejesus helmet  the words to the song freeze
     in his mouth  his voice becomes edged with panic

                                dejesuscontd
                   oh shit

                                jones radio

                                dejesus
                                rising terror

                   beck  doc  help me

     inside

     beck grabs his microphone  he tries to remain calm but
     there is a definite tremble in his voice

                                beck
                   give me a readout dejesus

     sixpack looks over the group then suddenly crushes the
     empty coke can in his hand punctuating the action with a
     huge belch

                                dejesus

     dejesus springs for sixpacks throat as we cut to

     beck  same

     becks eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks

                                beck

                   one but we cant let something
                   like this tear us apart

     beck glares ready for an argument but as we pull back we
     see hes talking to the mirror in his tiny quarters

     apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard
     look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away

                                beck
                   shit

     he turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at
     college graduation with his eastern establishment looking
     father  leadership howto books likethe one minutemanager etc line his bookshelf with technical manuals on
     underwater mining

     he opens his door to leave when suddenly a loud metallic
     groaning noise stops him cold  the entire shack seems
     shifting like a giant waking from a nap

     mess

     the noise stops the fight between dejesus and sixpack cold
     all eyes go to the ceiling and walls

                                jones
                   fuck the suits manthis
                   place is going to kill us first

     just as suddenly as it began the groaning noise stops and in
     its place we hear an intermittent rattle in the air system
     only cobb seems undisturbed by this sound

                                dejesus
                                listening
                   there it is again

     lower ring corridor

     beck approaches the mess and as he nears it we hear cobb
     ranting inside

                                cobbs voiceos
                   and if youre lucky
                   enough to make it back home
                   to your house that looks the
                   fucking same as everyone elses
                   youll find your wifes just as
                   fat as she was when you left and
                   the only reason your kids aint
                   strung out on the drugs they were
                   using when you left is that
                   theyve found some new drugs
                   which fuck em up even more
                   you people just dont appreciate
                   how good youve got down here

     beck hesitates at the door to the mess as though screwing
     up his courage then takes a deep breath and enters as we

                                                        cut to

     inside the mess

     everyone looks up as beck enters and the room goes quiet
     beck notices docs empty chair

                                beck
                   doc eat already

                                jones
                   the good doctor hasnt showed yet

     looks are exchanged  sixpack smirks knowingly

                                beck
                                to dejesus
                   how do you feel dejesus

                                dejesus
                                obviously embarrassed
                                to be singled out
                   okay

                                beck
                   better let the doc take a
                   look at you after dinner

                                sixpack
                   yeah since he was busy earlier
                   when you needed him

     he cracks up and beck turns on him

                                beck
                   cut it sixpack

     sixpack shuts up but beck notices the others feel the
     seriousness of docs absence during the emergency

                                beckcontd
                   leave the doc to me  im
                   going to talk to him

                                sixpack
                                sarcastically under his
                                breath to bowman
                   makes me feel better already

     beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about
     something else  he clears his throat

                                 beck
                   ive been looking at the duty

                   company got to abide by the rules

     five faces stare at beck  theyre looking for weakness
     this is a challenge to his authority

                                beck
                   i know all about the contract
                   the point is you can follow the
                   goddamn contract to the letter and pull

                   can get it done tonight and call
                   tomorrow a down day  its up to you

     this leaves the group momentarily speechless  even dejesus
     comes out of his stupor

                                dejesus
                   you giving us a day off

     beck nods  cobb eyes him suspiciously

                                cobb
                   what about our quota

                                beck

                   tons off quota  barring an
                   unforeseen problem you should
                   reach it easily on the last day
                                he looks at the group
                   its just a day off  you dont
                   have to take it i just thought it
                   might help

     the others look around for agreement but jones doesnt need
     anyone elses approval hes already made up his mind

                                jones
                   count me in

     bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree
     buoyed beck moves ahead businesslike

                                beck
                   cobb jones i want you to do

                   any other suit problems she should
                   know about

     sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses

                                sixpack
                                to willie

                   the latch is screwed up  or

                                disgusted
                   right

     lower ring corridor  same

     on beck  he starts out of the mess and by chance finds
     himself walking with willie  beck is obviously
     uncomfortable with the crew even after 28 days together
     she smiles friendly at ease

                                willie
                   you did good

                                beck
                                a little surprised
                   what

                                willie
                   todaywith dejesus  that
                   was smart thinking to get him
                   inside

                                beck
                   there probably wasnt anything
                   wrong with his suit

                                willie
                   stillyou did the right thing

     she turns off toward the swamp leaving beck with the tiny
     but honest compliment  he savors it

     the swamp  later

     the swamp where dejesus came up is ankle deep in greasy
     bilgewater  the door slides open willie enters and
     switches on a bank of fluorescent lights  the room is
     spooky even with the lights  the giant machine suits we
     saw earlier outside hang from racks like sleeping monsters

     willie straps on a utility belt and checks her toolsa
     motorized screwdriver a power wrench a longnecked
     lasertipped soldering ironlooks like a longnecked
     screwdriverthen splashes through the bilge water to the
     control switch and hits the start button

     nnnnnnnnnn  a motor moves one of the suits along the track
     toward willie  as it turns the corner toward us we see it
     says  dejesus

     docs office  same

     beck opens the door to docs quarters and we see doc putting
     on a fresh shirt  a man in his 50s he must have once been
     quite handsome and intelligent but has now gone to seed

                                doc
                   i must have dozed off

     beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of old granddad
     whiskey  he picks it up

                                doccontd
                   snakebite medicinenever
                   pack my bag without it

     beck doesnt smile  he puts the bottle back down and doc
     watches him in the mirror

                                beck
                   are you planning on working tomorrow

                                doc
                   well ill be on the golf course
                   in the morning  then if i dont
                   have any babies to deliver

                                beck
                                cutting him off
                   we almost had an accident today
                   dejesus suit

     the doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with beck

                                doc
                   you got something to say to me son

     beck definitely has something to say but confronted he
     falters

                                beck
                   ii think its important to
                   have the second officer on deck

     doc smiles and goes back to buttoning his shirt

                                doc
                   ill keep it to nine holes
                   in the morning

     the dormitory  same

     small but functional  the bunks can be closedoff with a
     privacy door  photographs and bumper stickers on the walls
     of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an
     otherwise sterile environment

     willies bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary
     maps  sixpacks privacy door has a bumper sticker which
     proclaims  i may be fat but youre ugly and i can diet
     dejesus has posters of the alps and the rockies  bowmans
     has clipped pages from gourmet of meals she dreams for
     cobbs has nothing as if perfectly content to be where he
     is instead of somewhere else  inside jones bunk is an
     indoor basketball goal

     bowman and sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a
     sponge and pail  sixpack pauses and smirks his eyes on
     bowmans chest

                                sixpack
                   christwhat a pair

     corridor a  same

     jones and cobb are kneeling in a corridor unfastening a big
     plate on the floor with a power wrench  overhead a huge
     plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization
     system  the interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire
     exposing the throbbing machine floor of the shack

     cobb removes the last bolt and jones lifts off the
     floorplate exposing the guts of the shackthe bilgedark
     and wet  without the plate the rattle in the air system is
     much louder and sinister

                                jones
                   listen to it for christsake

                                cobb
                   ah its just old like me

                   the next shift deal with it
                   but long as were here

     he pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops
     it down into the wet darkness without hesitating he climbs
     down stopping at the bottom to look up at jones  jones
     seems in no hurry to accompany him

                                cobbcontd
                   you gonna sit there on your
                   butt or give me a hand

     jones reluctantly starts down after him

     becks quarters  same

     beck in his quarters  he seems to be talking to himself but
     as we move around him we see he is talking to a video
     monitor  on screen we see martin 30s a slick
     bureaucratic executive with transocean corp whose face is
     all we see on the video monitor

                                beck
                   two hundred and fiftytwo

                                taking notes
                   sounds like a good week beck
                   in facti put your folder
                   in front of the vice president
                   of district operations last night

     beck stops  martin notices his concern

                                martincontd

                                martin

                   going and who your friends are
                   know what i mean

     he stares hard at beck but doesnt wait for an answer

                                martincontd
                   the one thing ive learned in
                   this company is you cant have
                   enough friends  its the only
                   way to survive

     close on a boom box lower ring corridor  same

     the boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring john denversrocky mountain highdejesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he
     works on the intercom system  he finishes closing a metal
     box which says  onboard communications

     swamp  same

     on willie  she has connected dejesus suit to the diagnostic
     computer and is going through the computerized
     checkpointsan electronic list of literally hundreds of
     possible problems

                                willie
                                to herself
                   probably a short

     suddenly the computer pauses on one  it says  electrical
     short

                                williecontd
                   good guess williams

     she types in a help command and the computer screen
     displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most
     electrical engineers baffled  willie hardly bats an eye

                                williecontd
                   piece of cake

     she immediately opens the circuit panel on dejesus suit and
     pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt  with
     two quick spot welds she repairs the short then replaces
     the panel  finished willie presses the control switch and
     the suits begin to move along the track  a new suit rounds
     the corner toward us  it says sixpack

     the bilge  same

     the walls are dark and moist  water drips from the pipes
     the rattle in the air system continues loudly as jones leans
     over and hands cobb another tool  crouched in the humming
     machinery cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy
     hand kneads it a couple of times then grins at jones

                                cobb
                   okay watch this

     the swamp  same

     the monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound
     in the gloomy swamp as the huge suit labeled sixpack stops
     directly in front of willie  she reaches up to open the
     pocket latch when she stopslistening  the noise in the
     air system has stopped

     the bilge  same

     jones looks incredulously at cobb  he cant believe thats
     all it took  cobb starts gathering up the tools

                                jones
                   so thats all you do

                                cobb

     the swamp  same

     in the gloomy silence willie reaches for the hinged pocket
     in the waist of sixpacks suit  some water drips out  she
     pushes the spring a second time  the pocket opens
     nothing

                                willie
                                miffed
                   nothing wrong with this

     suddenly the hideous sea spider springs out onto the
     workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward willie  she
     backs away and it drops into the water at her feet

     the dormitory

     bowman looks at dejesus who comes to the door then to
     sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead

                                willies voiceoc
                                over intercom

                   problem williams

     swamp

     willie watches the sea spider move in the water toward her
     as becks words come over the pa  ignoring beck she
     watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings
     the soldering iron down into the water with a loud hiss
     skewering it  she presses the intercom button and lifts the
     skewered sea spider out of the water

                                willie
                                to beck

     the mess  later

     bowman sits at a portable computer terminal and watches
     stock prices scroll across the screen  every so often she
     freezes a stock and types the command  info  the screen
     immediately changes to a financial report of the company in
     question as if prepared by a broker  in a matter of seconds
     bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company

     across the room from her willie exercises with dumbbells
     while she studies an astronaut training manual  she looks up
     at bowman

                                willie
                   made your million yet

                                bowman
                                studying the screen
                   not yet

                                willie
                   hows transocean doing

     this causes bowman to turn and look at willie

                                bowman

     types in transocean corp

                   that sounds interesting but theyre
                   too tied to their holdings  remember

                   i lost a bloody fortune  thats

     coke across the room to dejesus

     centerfold her body twisted into an awkward position
     representing mad desire

     sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the
     photo

     he stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and screams  the
     sea spider is suddenly right there on his shoulder dead

     sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head
     against the roof of the bunk then stumbles out screaming
     he hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams
     in more pain

     the whole dorm looks up amazed cobb takes off his
     sunglasses even jones and dejesus temporarily sober up to
     stare

     like a good dog the rov follows her to a safe position

     on monitor  the camera holds on the spot  suddenly the
     ground shakes violently on the monitor screena mini
     earthquake charge

     willie returns to the site of the charge and reinserts her
     drill easily removing a test sample

     willie holds out the sample to the rov so beck can see
     inside

     int control room close on becks rov monitor

     he stares at the image on the screen

                                beck

                   more light sixpack

     there is no answer  willie turns around  her helmet lamp
     eerily illuminating the darkness around her  sixpack is
     nowhere to be seen

                                williecontd
                   sixpack

     she turns in the other direction and suddenly blinding
     lights are turned on

                                sixpack
                   boo

     sixpack laughs  his lights now on he stands right behind
     her

                                willie

     she again holds out her hand to the rov

     inside shack

     beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start
     the tape then after five seconds releases the button

                                beck

                   dont worry darlin im

     suddenly sixpacks foot hits some loose rock and slides

     willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight
     turning becoming smaller then disappearing as his radio
     goes dead

     inside on beck

                                beck
                   whats wrong  what happened

     underwater

     on willie  she has stopped in her tracks  all around her is
     blackness  her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness

                                willie
                   sixpack  sixpack

     then she looks downa cliff right in front of her feet
     the drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers

     becks voice brings willie back

                                becks voiceradio

     jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight
     suddenly bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in

                                bowman
                   sixpack is lost

     corridor  moments later

     bowman jones and dejesus are heading for the control room
     where they are joined by cobb

     the image on the screen widens and we see the opening is a

     close on the monitor  the picture zooms in on the corner
     and willies added light suddenly brings the letter m into
     focus

     beck presses the red record button and pans the rov slowly
     across the bulkhead of the ship  the next letter is an a

     paperback book under a stack of papers  discreetly he
     covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off

                   watch and learn amigo

     control room  later

     close on monitor screen

     we see a thin bearded man in his late fifties a russian
     ships captain talking to the camera in russian  the tape
     is of poor quality and water spotted

                                docs voiceos
                                translating
                   another party last night  more
                   vodka  the infirmary is filled
                   as it is  i confiscate what
                   i can but i know the government
                   observers have more

     suddenly the captain hears a noise offscreen and goes to
     the camera and turns it off  the tape goes blank

     on doc

     he stops the tape and presses another button on the console
     willies video of the huge hole in the hull of the ship
     appears on another screen

                                doccontd
                   see that gash  the way the
                   edges protrude inward is like
                   from a torpedo explosion  it
                   couldnt have come from within
                   like an accident

     he looks back at beck who we see is sitting behind him and
     has also been watching the tape  beck looks at doc and
     shrugs

                                beck
                   what do you want me to say
                   that it all sounds mysterious

                                doc
                   these observers were doing something
                   a testi think they sank that ship
                   on purpose to cover up their mistakes

                                beck
                   what mistakes
                                he shakes his
                                head wearily
                   look i think its no big deal but
                   if you want to find out why this
                   ship sank have maritime run a check

     he gets up and goes to the door  doc watches him

                                doc
                   i did  they have no record of
                   the wreck
                                beat
                   the marshal goloviev is now on
                   a tour in the baltic sea

     beck stops  this is a mystery

     close on combination lock becks quarters  same

     fingers fiddle with the combination  he pulls on the
     handle  the safe doesnt budge

                                dejesus
                                whisper
                   its not the phone number

     we pull back to see that dejesus is alone in becks darkened
     quarters he talks to the pa  suddenly we hear bowmans
     voice over the intercom

                                bowmans voice
                                on intercom
                   okay try the social security
                   number

     dejesus puts his fingers back on the safe dial

                                dejesus
                   okay give it to me

                   check that vodka

     beck looks at him  it is obvious that he doesnt trust doc
     with the vodka but hes diplomatic

                                beck
                   this is a mining shack not
                   a lab doc  if theres something
                   strange with the vodka its safe
                   till we get back

     upper ring corridor

     on cobb  standing watch for dejesus  suddenly the door to
     the control room opens and beck walks out  cobb grabs a
     walkietalkie

     becks quarters on dejesus

     he hears cobb and freezes  he looks aroundthe cramped
     quarters dont offer much in the way of hiding places

     intercut with bowman and others in dormatory

     they react similarly to the sound of cobb on the pa

     on cobb and beck corridor

     beck stops outside his door and sees cobb

                                beck
                   something wrong cobb

                   just let me put this in
                   my safe

     before cobb can react beck opens the door to his quarters
     and steps inside

     becks quarters  we see no sign of dejesus  cobb follows
     into the room looking carefully around for sign of dejesus

     in the mirror to becks bathroom cobb spots dejesus
     pressing against the wall  cobb suddenly starts to sweat
     bullets  beck quickly unlocks the safe opens it and puts
     the videotaperight next to the bottle of vodkawe see cobbs reaction  beck turns

                                beck
                   something wrong

     cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow beck out
     he sneaks a look back at dejesus in the shadows who gives
     him a thumbs up

     mess  later

     five specimen cups filled with vodka  bowman takes hers and
     looks at it questioningly  cobb watches the door for signs

     sixpack  who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it
     suddenly spits the vodka out

     if listening for the others then he removes a silver flask
     with cyrillic letteringthe silver object he palmed in the
     swampand smiles as he takes a long pull  suddenly wham

     the privacy door to sixpacks bunk is slammed open

     its empty then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot

     corridor b

     on willie  she is jogging through the corridors  suddenly
     there is a great groaning noise  willie stops and looks
     through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor  the
     dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim
     light  the groaning ends and she jogs on to the swamp

     as she passes the door she notices the light and stops  beck
     stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with
     the parachutelike container transporters we saw outside
     he sees her

                                beck

                   after a month of it youd think
                   id be used to it

     she moves into the swamp and goes to the lift lock stopping
     under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung
     above her and begins doing her chinups as beck watches her
     lean body easily doing the exercises

                                beck
                                watching her

     int the infirmary  same

     doc and sixpack  doc takes a blood sample seals it and
     opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is
     stored in a refrigerated unit  the plastic bags of blood
     are labeled with the various crew members names

     sixpack watches him from the examination table  he is
     shivering violently and scared

                                sixpack
                                hes losing it
                   please docim coldi hurt

     we see a change in docs demeanor  he is suddenly needed
     and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to
     the challenge

                                doc
                   im just going to take a tiny
                   piece of skin to look at under
                   the microscopeafterwards ill
                   give you a sedative

     skillfully doc takes a skin sample  sixpack screams

     view through the microscope

     an enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity
     we see it literally spreading before our eyes

     on doc

     he leans back from the microscope  there is awe on his face
     for the first time since first year medical studiesand
     there is fear of the unknown  he looks over his shoulder at
     sixpack his shivering has stopped he lies still on the
     table

     underwater

     lights move in the blackness but there is an order to the
     actions and a crispness to the voices  people doing work
     that is moving sharply  pride in what theyre doing

                                dejesus

     the container transporters fill with compressed air and lift
     the container as the miners guide it to the track

     int infirmary shack  same

     doc is at the console of his computer  as words appear on
     the screen obviously in response to his query

     would appear to indicate a virus of unknown origin

     doc shakes his head disgustedly

                                doc
                                to himself

                                typing angrily
                   then take a guess goddamnit

     he finishes typing and waits for an answer  the cursor
     flashes the word processing  then an answer comes up
     genetic alteration  the words send a chill down docs
     spine

     swamp room  later

     the mood is happy  like a high school football locker room
     after a winning game  dejesus climbs out of his suit and
     slaps beck on the shoulder

                                dejesus
                   good work out there mr becky

     beck obviously pleased looks at the others  jones sums up
     the feelings of the entire group

                                jones
                   thank you sir

     becks grin suddenly disappears at the sight of a flashing
     red light over the intercom

     infirmary  later

     beck is standing in the doorway of the infirmary glaring at
     doc who sits with his bottle of old granddad

                                beck
                   dead  this morning you said

                   skin rash kill you in eight
                   hours

     doc looks at beck wearily and hands him a mask

                   here  put this on  you examine

     beck hesitates then puts on the mask

     sick room

     as beck enters masked sixpacks back is to him under the
     sheets  slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the
     sight  the black splotches have nearly all grown together
     his fingers have lengthened and become more webbed  most
     dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become
     flared and elongated  though not bleeding the open veins
     are visible

     infirmary

     doc pours some bourbon in a glass and takes a sip  beck
     enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet

                                beck

     back to the main corridor  as they leave we hold on the
     door to the sick room behind bowman

     bowman writhes on the examination table in pain  carefully
     she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to
     throw up

     close on bowman

     at the sink in the infirmary  she rinses her face in the
     sink and pulls back her hair suddenly she stops and brings
     her hands in front of her face

     lower ring corridor  same

     beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the
     infirmary with jones  he opens the door and freezes

     what he sees  the examination table where jones left her is
     empty  the room deserted

                                jones
                                pointing to
                                examination table
                   i left her here

     doc comes up behind them then turns  he hears to a hissing
     sound down the ring corridor  he turns from the others and
     moves slowly toward the noise

     shower room

     doc enters the shower room full of steam and the sound of
     water

                                doc
                   bowman

     there is no answer and he moves toward the shower

                   bowman  its doc  im here
                   to help you

     the water continues to run  no answer  carefully doc
     opens the shower door

     what he sees  bowman  dead  her wrists have been cut and
     blood swirls down the drain

     doc sadly squats down beside her  the death effects him
     greatly  he feels helpless then suddenly his eyes widen
     and he carefully reaches out and takes bowmans limp arm
     turning it supine  there running the length of the arm we
     see the black scales

     infirmary

     jones and beck lay bowmans body carefully onto the
     examination table in the infirmary  through the sick room
     door we see the sheet shrouded body of sixpack  doc covers
     bowman with a sheet as

                                                      we cut to

     the mess  later

     the remaining crew doc and beck assembled in the mess
     doc sits quietly almost in a daze

                   in time

                   want out of here

     their argument is suddenly cut short by a noise from the
     corridor  a thump  the crew stops their grumbling and
     listens  a moment later we hear another thump  beck looks
     at jones

                                beck
                                motions for jones
                                to come with him
                   jones
                                to the others
                   stay here

     ring corridor

     beck leads the way slowly toward the infirmary where the
     sound is coming from  outside the door they hear it once
     more  thump

     carefully he enters the infirmary and we see the
     examination table is empty  beck goes to the sick room and
     stops in the doorway  jones moves behind him and his eyes
     suddenly widen

     what they see  both bodies now are in a motionless hideous
     conglomeration on the the table

                                                  slam cut to

     close on heavy zipper

     zzzzzzzzzzzzzz  it is quickly pulled shut running the
     length of a heavy plastic bag closing both bodies inside

     int corridor b  later

     dressed in their rubber latex suits cobb jones dejesus
     beck and willie carry the body of sixpack and bowman in the
     zippered bodybag  now well over three hundred pounds the
     bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to
     transport

                                dejesus
                   cmon cobbyoure slacking

                                cobb

                   i aint goddamnitits
                   jones

     before jones can argue beck cuts them off

                                beck
                   shut up all of you

                                cobb
                   mr beck the contract states that
                   no body can be disposed of without
                   authorization of

                                jones
                   fuck the contract man

     the group turns into the swamp where doc waits for them by
     the lift lock  rounding the corner cobb bangs into the side
     of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the package  like
     dominoes willie also looses her grip then dejesus  the
     bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even
     harder for everyone to get a handhold

                                beckcontd
                   cmonlift

     the group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to
     their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on dejesuss face

                                dejesus
                   heyi feel something
                   its moving  hes alive

                   i feel it toosomeones trying
                   to get out

     cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for
     the zipper

                                jones
                   cobb whatre you doing

                                cobs
                   but he aint dead  he aint
                   dead

                                beck
                   cobb  stop

     but cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag
     beck tries to stop him when suddenly wham  a dark
     appendage rips through the zipper and flails like a
     pressurized firehose  it beats wildly for several second
     then lashes out at cobbripping a gash on his forearm

     while cobb screams in pain beck yanks the appendage off
     cobbs arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a
     sharp tonguelike proboscis which has stabbed cobb like a
     dagger

                                cobb
                   it bit me  it bit me

     while beck and willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage
     doc rushes to the lift lock

     dejesus and jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag
     into the lift lock

                                jones
                   push hazy

     the bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its
     occupant  jones digs his shoulder down into the task just
     as the bag suddenly rips in several places  a tear rips
     open next to jones head revealing the head of bowman her
     vacant eyes only inches from jones face

                                jones
                   oh jesus christ  i aint
                   never gonna sleep again

     suddenly a whining noise sounds behind them  beck looks
     back to see cobb approaching with a battery operated
     underwater chain saw  hes clearly intending to cut the
     creature with the whirring blade

                                beck
                   no

                                cobb
                   it bit me

                                dejesus
                   its sixpack

                                cobb
                   im going to kill it

     dejesus turns to block cobb while the others continue to
     wrestle the bodybag into the lift lock  the bag suddenly
     splits and a scaly arm protrudes  it reaches out grabbing
     dejesus  beck pulls him free and yells

                                beck
                   close the lock  now

     doc hits the lever  the elevator doesnt move

     rrrrrriiiiippp  a scaly leg rips out of the body bag

                                beckcontd
                   hit it again

     doc hits the elevator switch again harder

     nnnnnnn  the lift lock door whines closed and a horrifying
     scream rises from the lock

     close on the lift lock

     the end of the appendage is severed in the closing door
     disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water

                                beckcontd
                   flush it

     doc flips a switch and the scream of the vacuum pumps drown
     out the scream in the lift lock the wails of cobb and the
     splashing sounds of the severed threefoot section of gory
     muscle which slip silently and undetected under the
     workbench

     a second later the elevator returns empty silent
     bloodstained

     beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior lock  the
     exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the
     flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it
     grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of
     the shack lightsinto the darkness

     beck turns and looks at his savaged crew  willie jones
     dejesus doc look like wetsuited butchers  splattered in
     blood numbed by the experience they are brought together
     by having simply survived  jones holds up willie  dejesus
     leans against the bulkhead  in the far corner cobb sobs
     quietly

     showers  later

     clouds of steam  vaguely seen through the steam willie is
     scrubbing herself almost desperately as though the
     spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her
     skin  finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her
     head against the wall of the shower stall

     dormitory  same

     beck and jones open the privacy door to sixpacks bunk
     after some digging which produces five months supply of
     pornography the empty flask clatters to the floor  beck
     picks it up

                                beck
                   i think we just found our
                   problem

     mess  later

     cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand  jones
     and dejesus sit at a table and willie laces up her shoes for
     a run  there is a feeling of anger among them

                                dejesus
                   serves his ass right to get
                   it  motherfucker brings that
                   shit onboard  i hope his
                   fucking ass rots in the sea and
                   is shit upon by the fish

                                jones
                   fucker could have gotten us
                   all killed

                                cobb
                   he knew better than that

     willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all
     coldly

                                willie
                   you guys sure werent so holy
                   when you were shooting that
                   vodkait could have been you

     she gets up and walks out into the ring corridor

     the russian ship

     we are moving along the ships corridor that willie walked
     looking for sixpack

     we pull back to reveal we are watching a video screen in the
     control room

     doc and beck replay the tape of willies search for sixpack
     on the russian ship  on the monitor screen we see willies
     pov of the infirmary  the light dances off the broken glass
     as she turns then the flash of white we saw before as the
     light moves out into the corridor

                                doc
                   hold it  rewind it

     beck rewinds it

     on screen  we see the scene again  light dancing off the
     cabinets  as the light starts to turn

                                doc
                   stop it

     beck pauses the tape  we see nothing doc is confused

                                doc
                   back it up slowly

     beck does and we watch docs face as he stares intently at
     the screen  suddenly he sees it

                                doc
                   there

     on screen  we see it  caught in the turn of the camera now
     frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains
     of a man  only it is clear that this is no ordinary man
     fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than
     normal  but it is the large head and long sharp teeth that
     especially catches our attention

     mess  same

     on a beautiful bavarian setting

     as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is
     actually one of dejesus jigsaw puzzles  he takes a piece
     of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and
     places it perfectly into position on the puzzle  jones
     watches him amazed

                                dejesus
                   you know that innsbruck
                   has 64 square miles of ski
                   slopes man  think about that
                   sixtyfour square miles

     he picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits
     it into place as jones watches  its blowing jones mind

                                jones
                   howd you do that

                                dejesus
                   what  thative done this
                   one before  you hungry  im
                   hungry

     he gets up to go into the mess and jones looks at him in
     amazement

                                jones
                   hungry  after what we just
                   went through i may never
                   eat again

     on willie

     she jogs down the corridors toward the swamp  the shack
     creaks and willie looks down through the grating passing
     below her feet  it is dark down there  her feet pound off
     the metal grating

     low angle  we watch willie from below as she jogs past  then
     we tilt down to the dark still water of the bilge  suddenly
     something stirs in the watera ripple like a trout in a
     stream

     control room  same

     using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions
     of the skull on the videotape doc enters these measurements
     as they are read off to him by beck  as each of the
     measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins
     to appear on the computer screen followed by a name
     danakil man

                                beck
                   they found this

                                doc
                   no  i think they isolated
                   him in genetic engineering
                   homo aquaticus

                                beck
                   was there such a thing

                                doc
                   danakil manone of our
                   ancestors  named for the
                   danakil alps in ethiopia

                                beck
                   not exactly a big ocean
                   country

                                doc
                   it was when it counted a couple
                   of million years ago when the
                   seas came in and drove us into
                   the water  most homo sapiens
                   didnt make itdanakil manadapted

     on willie

     running  she jogs past the machine room  looking in the
     machines seem alive pulsing the beating heart of the
     shack  there is something else though  we feel something
     in there watching her

     control room

     on doc

                                doc
                   some say thats why were
                   basically hairless for less
                   water resistance faster swimming
                   speeds

                                beck
                   but what about those scales
                   or that leechlike thing that
                   bit cobb

                                doc
                   why stop with just one aspect
                   of marine life  why not incorporate
                   the best genetic components the
                   ocean has to offer

                                beck
                                pointing to screen
                   well if they were perfecting an
                   aquaman then whys there a dead
                   one onboard that russian ship  why
                   isnt he out swimming around

     doc looks up at the image on the screen  the huge skull
     stares back hauntingly

                                doc
                                beat
                   he obviously lacked something
                   in his environment

     dormitory  same

     on cobb  he sits on his bunk and peers under his bandage
     he turns on an overhead reading light and looks again
     suddenly a voice startles him

                                jones voice
                   turned black yet

     at first startled cobb recovers and answers sharply

                                cobs
                   that aint funny

                                jones
                   relax cobb  if it was
                   going to turn it would have
                   done its trick by now

                                cobb
                   thats easy for you to say
                   you aint the one that got bit

     jones starts to leave when he suddenly notices something on
     cobbs bunk  he picks it up and we see a photo of cobbs
     family

                                jones
                   dont tell me youre getting
                   soft on us cobbie  youre
                   the fellow who always said

     cobb snatches the photo back from jones and glares at him
     with the same old hard cobb look

                                cobb
                   nothings changed goddamnit

     jones leaves and cobb waits till he is gone then looks back
     at his photo  his look changes softening  absently he
     scratches his bandage

     swamp

     willie enters and checks her running time on her watch  she
     bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly

     overhead shot

     we are watching her from above  for a moment she is quiet
     as if listening for a noise somewhere in the swamp  she
     looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the
     workbench

     mess  same

     dejesus looking for food  in the gloom of fluorescent
     lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a
     snack

     he notices that the floors wet near the sink  he frowns
     and hears a small noise like something shifting slightly
     he moves to investigate crouching low peeking into the
     shadows under the sink into a litter of cleanser bottles
     pails ragsall he can see are shadows  he looks more
     closely actually sticking his head under the sink when

     suddenly something touches his shoulder from behind  dejesus
     jumps bumping his head on the sink as he whirls to see

     jones looming over his shoulder looking down at him

                                jones
                   man everybody is jumpy
                   what are you doing

     not fully recovered from the start dejesus rubs his bruised
     head

                                dejesus
                   getting some food

                                jones
                   under there

     dejesus gets to his feet points at the water under the
     sink

                                dejesus
                   look  water

                                jones
                   probably the plumbing  you
                   gonna make me finish that puzzle
                   by myself or what

     dejesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at
     jones

                                dejesus
                   no ill be right there

     he looks down at his sandwich as jones starts out of the
     galley  something is missing

                                dejesus
                                to himself
                   mustard  need mustard

     he opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty

                                dejesus
                                muttering to himself
                   sixpack

     he throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next
     to the refrigerator for a new jar and reaches inside

     suddenly like a snake a two foot chunk of muscle attaches
     to dejesuss wrist  with his free hand dejesus tries to rip
     the twisting writhing thing off  pulling at it he reveals
     part of sixpacks faceone eye and part of his
     mouthunderneath the surface

     dejesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and
     causing an avalanche of pots and pans

                                dejesus
                                in pain
                   ahhh

     inside the mess

     jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when
     he hears the clatter of pots and pans

                                jones
                   hey hazywhatre you doing
                   nowcooking

     there is no answer and jones looks up

                                jonescontd
                                concerned
                   hazy

     he goes to the door and looks in  his eyes widen at the
     sight of dejesus staggering toward him with the squeezing
     hunk of muscle

                                jonescontd
                   holy shit

     he keeps coming at jones who backs away slowly from his
     friend

                                jones

                   dont touch me

     jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to
     the galley  he closes it rushing through into the mess to
     the ring corridor where he runs into cobb

                                cobb
                   whats going on

                                jones

     jones runs out and leaves cobb by the door  cobb watches
     him go  as the noise in the mess intensifies we hear
     banging on the door then dejesus anguished cries

                                dejesus
                   help me  help me

     cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm

     upper ring corridor  same

     jones meets beck and doc leaving the control room

                   sixpack  like a big leech
                   with those teeth

                                doc

                   watching the door

     int lower ring corridor  same

     deserted  there is no sign of cobb and the door to the mess
     stands open  the mess is empty  beck is the first one down
     the ladder followed by jones

                                jones
                   cobb  hazy  oh shithes

                   shut up both of you  weve
                   got to find it

     beck suddenly looks around noticing something

                                beckcontd
                   wheres willie

                                cobb

                   you and doc check the rooms

     int the lower b corridor  same

     jones and beck move down the spooky corridor toward the
     swamp  overhead water moves through the desalinization
     conduit  jones eyes it warily

     swamp

     they enter the quiet swamp  the suits hang silently like
     sleeping monsters  beck steps into the equipment room

     jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him
     their empty masks stare at him hauntingly  he reaches the
     end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw
     willie doing chinups  he looks down and sees her headband
     floating in the bilgewater

                                jones
                   willie

     suddenly willie lowers herself from the bar behind him

                                willie
                   yeah

     the sudden sight of her nearly gives jones heart failure he
     stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and willie
     drops from the bar laughing

                                willie
                                grinning

     willie picks up the strain in jones voice her smile fades

                   whats wrong

                                jones
                   dejesusits got him

     the equipment room  same

     jones willie and beck move quickly  beck pulls a portable
     laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits
     and attaches a portable power unit to the back  turning it
     on it becomes a sinister closerange weapon

     willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated
     container transporters  beck notices and then looks up at
     jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle
     pumpearthquake device we saw willie use earlier

                                beck
                   i thought they were your friends

                                jones
                   were dosswere

     beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from
     him

                                beck
                   you fire that in here and
                   youll bring the whole place
                   down

     jones thinks about it for a moment then reaches for one of
     the acetylene tanks  he lights the end of it and a long
     blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the swamp
     jones grins

     infirmary  same

     doc and cobb move into the infirmary  doc goes into his
     office  he takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer
     and then looks up through the levolor blinds into the
     infirmary  what he sees upsets him

     int swamp  same

     jones working the intercom

                                jones
                                to intercom
                   jones to doc  doccobb

     he looks back to beck concerned

                                jonescontd
                                to beck
                   think it got em

                                beck
                   no its not going through
                   the intercoms busted  i thought
                   dejesus fixed that

                                jones
                                beat realizing
                   he did

     infirmary  same

     doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the infirmary to
     the storage counter across the roomwhere the blood is
     stored  we see what disturbed himthe door to the
     refrigeration unit is ajar  doc opens the door to the
     cabinet  the plastic bags are now empty  each one has been
     drained

     lower ring corridor  same

     cobb moves out of the infirmary carefully down the eerie
     corridor his mining tool in front of him for security
     there is a sinister feel to the place  each step only
     reveals a little bit of space ahead of him  suddenly he
     stops  in front of him across the hall a cabinet which
     says  onboard communications is torn open  it is where
     dejesus fixed the intercom the day before

     close on the cabinet

     the door is shattered  carefully cobb opens the door and
     we see the guts of the wiring have been torn outthe entire
     system has been disabled

     cobb carefully examines the damage when suddenly a scaly
     handlike appendage slams into the cabinet door trapping
     cobb and sending his weapon to the floor  cobb turns
     directly into

     the leechlike mouth  its sharp teeth shine in the light
     poised to strike

     cobbs eyes closed screams like a maniac waiting for the
     tentacle to attack  then suddenly an ungodly scream echoes
     in the corridor

     cobb opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone  doc is
     holding the smoking mining drill his eyes glazed as if he
     has seen the devil itself

                                cobb
                   what happened

                                doc
                                absently
                   italmost got you

                                cobb
                   what was it

     doc shakes his head dumbly  he is in total shock

     the mess

     the remaining group is assembled around the table  jones
     watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers  he
     listens

                                cobs
                                excitedly
                   i saw it  its big

                                beck

                   bigger than dejesus  how

                                doc
                   its had a meal

     he holds out the empty blood bags  a change has come over
     doc since bowmans death  the experience has slightly
     deadened him

                                willie
                   it needs blood

                                jones
                   fucking greatyou telling
                   me we got a fucking dracula
                   in here with us

                                doc
                   it would explain the suction
                   like appendages

                                jones
                   like a leech

                                beck
                   thats why theres a dead one
                   on the ship  it ran out of blood

                                jones
                   what dead one on the ship

     he looks from doc to beck

                                jonescontd
                                sharply
                   someone want to let the rank
                   and file in on your little
                   secret

     doc looks at beck then jones

                                doc
                   the monster appears to be
                   a genetic aberration

                                jones
                   no fuckin lie

                                doc
                   it has many traits of deep
                   sea marine liferegeneration
                   scales gills even a period
                   of dormancy
                                more to beck
                   but the fact that it remembered
                   where the plasma was stored or
                   where the communication wiring was
                   may imply that it has some other
                   quality

                                cobb
                                panicky
                   whatwhat

     beck locks eyes with doc

                                beck
                                to doc
                   that it acquires intelligence
                   from its victims

                                doc
                   intelligence may not be the right
                   word

                                jones
                   fuck semantics doc

                   middle of a typhoonno thank you
                   ill take my chance down here

     willie looks at beck

                                willie
                   what can we do

                                beck
                   our only chance is to lure
                   it to the swamp and flush it
                   like we did the other

                                cobb
                   and howre we going to do that

     beck checks his flamethrower and looks at jones

                                                     time cut to

     the mess  later

     on beck  he flexes his arm as a needle is taken from it  we
     see a halfpint of blood in a bag held by doc  he secures
     it and hands it back to beck

                                doc
                   be careful with it

                                beck
                   dont worry i dont want to
                   give up any more

     he looks over at jones who watches the door  jones looks
     back and nods  the coast is clear

     lower ring corridor  same

     the door to the mess opens and beck slips into the shadows
     of the hall  a second later jones follows  in the dim
     light they begin moving toward the lower b corridor to the
     swamp

     mess  same

     cobb doc and willie alone in the mess  cobb scratches his
     bandage  doc notices

                                doc
                   still bothering you

                                cobb
                   itches like hell

                                doc
                   take it off and let me have
                   a look

     cobb pulls back the bandage and looks at the gash

     insert cobbs wound  pink and healing

                                doc
                   looks good to me  ill rebandage
                   it though

     he looks at willie

                                doccontd
                   willie would you clean it
                   for me  im going to the
                   infirmary for supplies

     he turns and willie stops him with a firm grip

                                willie
                   you cant go out there alone

                                doc

                   do whats best for this crew
                                he pulls away
                   i need my bag

     the lower ring corridor  same

     the door opens and carefully doc steps out into the
     corridor  he looks toward the infirmary then starts up the
     ladder to the upper level instead

     close on drops of blood into a small pool

     a grisly sight

     we pull back to reveal the drops coming from the plasma bag
     of becks blood  beck stops the drip and moves on into the
     darkness of the corridor

     control room

     doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of
     the control room  his face lit by the computer monitor  he
     types furiously

     computer screen

     emergency escape bubblesready for activation

     doc pauses looking at the message then moves his hand to
     the send command and presses it

     the mess  later

     willie prepares a clean bandage as doc examines the cut  he
     smiles at cobb like a friendly country doctor  the tired look
     now gone from his eyes  he seems revitalized

                                doc
                   there good as new  just
                   keep your paws off of it
                                to willie
                   do you have the new bandage ready

     she nods  doc turns back to the sink and cobb holds out his
     arm to let willie put the new bandage on  as cobbs arm
     comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his
     shirt  willie stops just before applying the bandage  the
     movement intensifieslike snakes moving wildly beneath the
     cloth  cobb whitensbreaks out in a sweat  willie backs
     off

                                willie
                   docdoc

     she steps back and doc moves into her place as suddenly a
     leechmouthed tentacle erupts from cobbs waist  its razor
     sharp proboscis punctures docs chest right at the heart and
     the leach mouth with its hundreds of teeth attaches with
     vacuumlike suction

                                doc
                   no

     but it is too late  willie falls back screaming as cobbs
     gash rrrrrrrips open  the flesh opening grotesquely from
     the inside and inverts scalyspreading over cobbs body
     like a bushfire

     corridor b

     close on the pool of blood

     a huge shadow falls over the pool left by beck  a scaly
     tentacle suddenly whips across the floor  the dejesus
     creature  we see the flash of its appendages  its head
     an eye opens and looks up

     what it sees  the outline of beck lying hurt fifty feet
     away

     it starts down the corridor toward its preybeck

     on beck

     a little behind him with the homemade flamethrower jones
     waits in the shadows  suddenly beck hears something

                                beck
                                whispers
                   i hear something dont fire
                   until were both in the swamp

     jones moves a little farther back

                                beckcontd
                   dont let him see you

                                jones
                   dont worry

     as the creature approaches we see beck stand up like a
     wounded animal  he begins dragging his injured leg behind
     him as he retreats toward the swamp  the footsteps move
     faster  its closing

     int ring corridor  same

     on willie  she bursts out the door to the mess and heads
     toward corridor b

     door to the swamp

     beck moves through the door to the swamp and positions
     himself by the door  he looks back and we see jones for the
     first time flamethrower poised ready to fire

                                jones
                   cmon baby cmon

     on the shadow of the creature

     it moves steadily toward the door moving right to the
     doorway  carefully it moves a dark horrible handlike
     appendage inside the doorframe

     on beck and jones

     poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing

                                willies voiceos
                   beck  jones

     on willie

     she turns the corner and freezes  there less than ten feet
     away is the creature  a tentacle whips excitedly like a
     tail

                                willie
                   oh god

     as the creature starts to turn for willie beck suddenly
     closes the vaultlike door to the swamp on creatures hand
     trapping it viselike in the door

                                beck
                   run willie  run

     the creature throws back its head and screams in pain as the
     heavy door severs its appendage

     on beck and jones

     as the writhing handlike appendage squirms in front of them
     jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls
     like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move

                                jones
                   well done  just like
                   momma makes em

     beck opens the doorthe corridor is empty  willie and the
     creature are gone

     on willie running

     she heads back toward the ring corridor around the inner
     path toward corridor a  in a full run now every panel
     and instrument looks even more sinisterwhere is cobbdoc
     creature

     on the dejesus creatures severed appendage

     as the creature moves after willie we see its bloody stump
     suddenly sprout a new appendage  like a starfish it grows
     another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost

     on willie

     she turns down corridor a  a noise overhead in the water
     conduit causes her to look up when suddenly a black arm
     reaches out from the shadows and pulls her into the dark
     doorway to the machine floorit is jones  he pulls her
     between him and beck in the shadows

                                beck
                                whispered
                   wheres cobb and doc

                                willie
                                recovering

     control room

     beck is followed inside by jones and willie  it is empty

                                beck
                   lock the door

     jones rolls the large vaultlike door closed and locks them
     beck goes to the console and checks the instruments
     suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his
     tracks  a red light blinks ominously on the console

                                beck
                   shit  he sent them all

                                willie
                   the escape bubbles

     she and jones stop in front of docs console

                                jones
                                gravely
                   look at this

     beck looks at docs computer screen

     on screen we see docs message  hope that our sacrifice
     will mean that the human race will never know this awful
     mutation

                                willie
                   what is it

                                jones
                   the good doctor signed our
                   death warrant

     suddenly there is a tremendous banging on the door  like a
     hundred sledgehammers pounding the heavy steel door trying
     to break it down  jones readies his weapon but just as
     suddenly the banging stops  beck willie and jones all
     nervously exchange looks

                                willie
                   well at least were safe inside
                   here

                                jones
                   for how long

     beck slides behind the console and quickly types in a
     message  we see it on the screen  shack six reporting
     please disregard previous message

     suddenly martins face appears on the video screen

                                martin
                   thank goodness youre still
                   alive

                                jones
                                yells nervously
                                at the screen

     martin smiles calmly back at the three of them

                   please relax mr jones  every

                   message we were concerned but
                   would never have deserted you

     jones lets out a breath  willie stares straight at the
     screen

                                willie
                   whenareyou coming for us

                                he looks at weather

                   keep you posted

     he turns off his screen and the picture in front of beck
     jones and willie goes blank

                                beck
                   hes right  why dont you get some
                   rest  ill stand the first watch

                                             time cut to

     control room  later

     jones sits near the vent sound asleep his weapon across
     his stomach  near him willie lies still eyes open  she
     watches beck across the room standing at the window

     he stares outside into the darkness for a moment then
     as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the
     blank computer screen

     close on computer screen

     request weather summaries january 1421  the cursor
     blinks back ominously then races across the screen  file
     closed

                                beck
                                to himself
                   martin you asshole

     suddenly he hears a voice behind him

                                willie
                   they know dont they

                                beck
                                quietly
                   yeahi think theyre just
                   deciding what to do with us

                                willie
                   maybe they already have

     she moves into docs seat in front of the console and calls
     up the stock market program that bowman was monitoring
     earlier

     on screen  we see  stock prices

     willie types in a series of commands

                                beck
                   what are you doing

                                willie
                   seeing how my stocks doing

     on screen  the words transocean corp  the capsulized report
     comes up on screen  transocean corp took a bath on world
     markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was
     revealed to investors  the board of directors

                                willie
                                impatiently
                   where

     she scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the
     words

     the screen  accident took place in shack six southeast
     sector of pacific zone 10seven dead  all bodies
     missing  their names follow

     on willie  as her name comes up she shivers

                                beck
                   i cant believe theyd
                   just leave us

     a voice behind them causes them to turn

                                jones
                   welcome to the union boss
                   were all expendable

     he is now awake  he sits up against the air vent  suddenly
     beck listens the room is deathly silent  he looks over to
     the air vent  jones is listening also

                                willie
                   what is it

                                jones
                   the airs stopped

     whoop  whoop  suddenly a klaxon horn sounds hysterically
     a blue light on the console blinks on and off  it says
     air  beck turns to the instruments

                                beck
                   were on backup air

                                willie
                   how much time does that give
                   us

                                beck
                   less than an hour  its ruptured
                   an air duct

                                willie
                   cant we fix it

                                jones
                   therere twenty miles of
                   pipe in the bilge they
                   could have tappedin anywhere

     suddenly we hear a sound we havent heard in a long time
     the rattle that jones and cobb fixed  jones and beck home
     in on the telltale noise

                                jones
                                almost to himself
                   cobbjob security

     he locks eyes with beck

                                beck
                   theyre drawing us out

     he leaves his seat and jones checks his weapon as willie
     watches

                                willie
                   you cant go out there thats
                   what they want

     beck checks his makeshift flamethrower

                                beck
                   we dont have much choice
                   without air the internal
                   pressure will fall and

                                jones
                   crunchimplosion

     willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining
     tools the laserdrill she powersit up to check it  her
     action stops both men and she catches their looks

                                willie
                   you dont think im sitting
                   in here do you

     int corridor a  same

     carefully the three move into the lower ring corridor  as
     they move we suddenly hear a new sound deep like distant
     thunder  the sides of the shack tremble slightly

                                willie
                                low
                   the shack

                                jones
                   shes wondering whats
                   happening  were losing
                   air faster than i thought

                                beck
                                to jones
                   which way

     jones moves to the lead and turns down corridor a

     int corridor a

     the sound of the powerwrench removing the bolts from the
     flooring  the cover is removed and beck and jones peer down
     into the darkness  willie stands guard with the flame
     thrower

     on jones  he peers into the darkness below  he wasnt a big
     fan of the bilge even before the creature now hes scared
     shitless

                                beck
                   ill go first

     before jones can protest beck drops the ladder and climbs
     down into the dark bilge  jones waits till hes at the
     bottom then starts down behind him  willie looks back

                                willie
                   dont spend all day down
                   there

                                jones
                   dont fuckin worry i
                   aint

     bilge

     from somewhere in the darkness we hear the hissing sound of
     escaping oxygen and the familiar rattle of the air system
     as soon as jones reaches the bottom rung beck shines a light
     into the eerie underground area

     pipes run overhead and on the walls  a broken electrical
     conduit sparks over their heads  the floor is ankle deep in
     greasy water  they start toward the noise

     on willie

     her back is to the solid walloutside wall  her eyes move
     from one end of the corridor to the other not lingering
     long enough to distract her  sweat runs down her face and
     we hear another tremor in the shack

                                willie
                                to herself
                                calming herself
                   okay williamslets hear a
                   tune
                                beat quietly
                                at first
                   off we gointo the wild
                   blue yonder

     another rumble from the shack causes her to pause  she
     catches her breath and starts again

                                williecontd
                   flying high into the sky

     she suddenly looks into the main machine area behind the
     wire mesh of the other wall  was it something moving

     bilge

     on beck  he moves around a corner we recognize from before
     with jones and cobbs repair  beck floods the area with
     light and the break in the line is visible  the pipe has
     been torn from the wall it is totally unreparable  whats
     worse electrical wires hang down showering sparks into the
     water

                                jones
                   jesus christ

                                beck
                   can you fix it

                                jones
                   no way

                                beck
                   think  can we stop it
                   block it up  shut down
                   the line somewhere  think

                                jones
                   i am thinking man  you
                   think i want to die  i am
                   thinking  i

     suddenly his eyes widen  beck sees this and turns  in his
     light we see the glint of long teeth and the huge black
     frame of the cobbdoc creature  its leechlike appendage
     whipping in front of it like an excited cats tail  before
     it can strike jones pushes beck out of the way and fires a
     blast of flame from his flamethrower  the creature screams
     and disappears

     as beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes
     out sending the bilge into greater darkness

                                jones
                   i hit it  but i cant see
                   it  can you see it

                                beck
                                standing
                   no

     jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a
     thought

                                jones
                   the swamp  theres an over
                   ride switch in the swamp

     they start for the ladder when wwwwhhhhhhhhip out of the
     darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around jones
     arm  the deadly proboscis which stabbed cobb is poised
     like a dagger about to be plunged into the black mans
     thigh

                                jones
                                screams
                   ahhh

     instinctively beck whips out the mining saw and severs the
     tentacle  the unseen creatures scream echoes through the
     bilge  beck grabs jones by the arm and pulls him toward the
     ladder

                                beck
                   hurryget out

     quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor
     fifteen feet away moving closerteneightthen
     suddenly another appendage thrusts between the rungs of the
     ladder at them  beck ducks and leaps to the side  he is
     less than six feet from the creature  in the dim light we
     see it wickedly bare its teeth

     becks eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and
     spot the exposed power cable  the creature steps forward
     directly under the hole in the floor  it is about to lunge
     when a voice from above distracts it

                                willies voiceoc
                   hey you

     the creature looks up and sees

     on willie standing over the opening her flamethrower
     pointed straight down  she fires sending a searing blue
     flame into the bilge

     beck watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives
     him the moment of distraction he needs  he leaps out of the
     bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken
     power cable from the wall

                                beck
                   jones  get your feet out
                   of the water

     jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as beck
     thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the creatures
     feet

     in a blinding flash of electricity

     the current surges through the cobbdoc creature sending it
     instantly rigid  a second later it crashes forward into the
     water

     moving hand over hand toward the ladder jones quickly climbs
     out followed by beck

     the shack continues to shake each jolt stronger than the
     last  as they emerge willie helps them

                                beck
                   cmon the swamp

     they start for the swamp down corridor a when an enormous
     shudder goes through the shack causing the lights to blink
     and the floor to open beneath beck  the jolt knocks him
     back into the bilge  only grabbing onto the pipes just
     above the water stops him from falling back in

     jones stops and looks back over the missing grating

                                jones
                   beck

     jones moves instinctively back for him but another jolt
     only widens the gap  beck yells to be heard over the din of
     the collapsing shack

                                beck
                   go on

                                jones
                   no

                                beck
                   thats an order

                                jones
                   fuck your orders

     he leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts
     his hand down into the darkness  beck lets go of one hand
     then the other to grab jones extended arm  in one
     herculean effort jones pulls him out of the bilge  together
     they leap across the chasm as the desalinization conduit
     collapses over their heads and water floods into corridor a
     behind them  they have to go around the other way

     as they run

     klaxon horns sound and a recorded female voice warns  five
     minutes until implosion

     flash cuts of

     the lights flicker and fail causing the emergency lighting
     to go on and casting an eerie strobe effect on the escaping
     three crew members

     falling ceiling beams crash down in front and behind

     seams bend under the strain rivets pop

     straining machines send scalding geysers of steam into the
     corridorsand suddenly the floor gives way beneath willie
     she leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the
     firm ground

     jones leads the way toward the swamp with willie behind
     him and beck covering the rear

     they reach the end of the corridor and willie and jones turn
     into the swamp annex  willie hits the door opener  rrrrrr
     it doesnt budge  the pressure has bent the door frame

     beck arrives

                                willie
                   its jammed

     immediately beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand
     held spreaderlike a jaws of lifefrom the wall  he
     turns back to the swamp when a black scaly arm suddenly
     bursts through the wire mesh of the machine floor and pulls
     beck against the wire  it is the dejesus creature

     his head held in place by the powerful arm beck looks
     almost directly into the dark eyes of the creature  its
     gilllike slits flare  its mouth opens and we see a flash
     of its razor sharp teeth

     before beck can move the leechlike appendage ruptures the
     steel mesh and its razorsharp proboscis plunges like a
     knife for becks face  at the last instant beck move his
     head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh  the mesh
     loosens the creatures grip and beck manages to reach a
     mining drill from the tools on the wall  as the appendage
     starts to strike again beck buries the whining tool into the
     creatures tentacle and breaks free

     scooping up the spreader beck rushes to the swamp door where
     jones and willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door
     open

                                jones
                   where the hellve you been

                                beck
                   i got hung up  try this

     willie stands back and beck thrusts the spreader into the
     tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made  with jones
     help the two men force open the door and all three rush
     inside the swamp  beck closes the door behind them

     the recorded female voice intones  five minutes to
     implosion  and we feel it happening

     the bilge water on the floor of the swamp ripples with the
     vibrations

     the walls shake

     the huge metal suits rock like clothes on a clothes line
     one falls and crashes into the water

     jones throws open the control panel and grabs the red
     handled emergency air switch but he can only move it half
     way  it is jammed by the pressure

                                jones
                   it wont go

     willie grabs it with him but even together it is not
     enough  the handle breaks off in their hands

     steam jets whip down on them from above

     the water at their feet now boils from vibration

     the female voice intones  four minutes

     beck turns and sees the suits in the lock

     he grabs willie and pushes her toward the lock where her
     suit hangs

                                beck
                   the suits  get in them

     willie moves quickly but jones doesnt

                                jones
                   the suits  are you crazy
                   howre we going to get to
                   the surface

     beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing tanks of
     compressed air and deflated container transporters

                                beck
                   like this

     he looks up at jones who grins with renewed hope and they
     begin pulling the equipment out

                                beckcontd
                   get them in the lock

     jones and beck drag the tanks and the parachutelike
     container transporters to the lock

     on willie  she climbs into her suit and activates her
     generator  instantly her vital signs spring to life around
     the perimeter of her helmet

     the female voice trembles from the vibrationsthree
     minutestoimplosion

     beck and jones throw the last of the supplies onto the
     elevator and beck holds out the seismic tool jones tried to
     arm himself with earlier  he takes the tool from beck and
     sticks it in the vest of his wet suit

     then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the
     lock  beck will have to wait on his to move along the track
     to the lock

                                jones
                   your suit becky

                                beck
                   just get in yours

     jones climbs onto the lock platform and slides into his
     suit

     beck hits the suit track button and his suit begins moving
     along the track toward the lock  a suit turns the corner
     from the storage room followed by one labeled beck

     beck looks at the walls theyre shaking harder  he moves
     along the suit rack when suddenly the creature bursts from
     behind the suits shattering them like an explosion  a huge
     tentacle hurls toward beck like a spear

     beck ducks just in time grabbing a fire ax and chopping off
     the appendage  another tentacle jabs for beck

                                willie
                                screams
                   look out

     but it is too late  it knocks the ax from becks hand and
     sends him to the floor  beck looks up at the lock in time to
     see jones seal himself into his suit

                                jonesradio
                   im in

                                beck
                                to the others
                   go

                                willieradio
                   no

     the creature approaches beck

     beck looks at the others one last time

                                beck
                   go now  thats an order

     jones hits the elevator button and the lock closes as the
     elevator sends them down without beck

     beck stands and arms himself with a mining drill which he
     swings at the creature driving it back  as beck gets the
     upper hand the creature turns its hideous face and beck
     freezes  there attached to the back of the creatures head
     is the grotesque face of dejesus

     dejesus eyes suddenly blink  hes still alive  his lips
     tremble in agony

                                dejesus
                   kill mekill me

     beck momentarily stopped by the face lunges forward with
     the drill and embeds it in the side of the creature

     as the creature falls back hurt beck looks up at the lock
     elevator as it returnsit is emptythe others have made it
     out  his suit continues down the track and stops in the
     lock  he still has to make it if he can just get there

     the recorded female voice sounds  one minute to
     implosion

     beck races to the lock and starts to climb into the suit
     his arms slide into place his legs drop into the heavy
     metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the
     generator

     becks pov  his vital signs light up around the perimeter
     of his helmet but he sees something elsethe creature
     charges toward the lockits arm reaches out to yank beck
     out of the elevator  instinctively beck swings his
     motorized leg into the creatures snarling mouth knocking
     it backwards and stunning it long enough for beck to hit the
     elevator button  but it doesnt work

                                beck
                   no

     he hits again still nothing

     the recorded female voicenineteen eighteen  her
     voice begins to quiver

     beck pounds on the button and looks up just as the creature
     dives for him its huge scaly hand grabbing him around
     becks leg

     close on the elvator button  beck pounds it one last time
     and nnnnnnnnnnnn

     the lock closes crushing the creature as it flushes beck
     outside seconds before the entire structure collapses with
     implosion and suddenly explodes in a huge shudder of energy

     underwater  later

     whoosh  a parachutelike container transporter zoom toward
     the surface  a heavysuited crew member flashes past us
     its helmet light pierces the darkness then disappears  a
     moment later another transporter follows racing out of the
     darkness after the first

     becks pov  we see the vital signs lit in a ring around his
     helmet  the depth gauge races past with blinding speed as
     he moves closer to the surface

     willies pov  she tilts her head upwards  she snaps off her
     light and sees instead of black a lighter gray then
     suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her  at
     first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her then
     we see it againa glimmer of light

                                willieradio
                   light  beck i see light

     on beck

     he follows her look  light is coming fast brightening as
     they rise  the led numbers inside their helmets click
     off125 100 75

                                beckradio

                   ejecting

     she yanks at the handle on the chest plate and whoosh  the
     plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle  her
     hand gropes for it

     sunlight is streaming down through the water as she rushes
     upward

     whoosh  the helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as
     she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons

     no longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward willie
     frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface

     suddenly she breaks the surface and catches a glimpse of the
     sun dazzling through a million droplets of water as a huge
     swell carries her up even higher

     then shes underwater again struggling desperately to pull
     the tab on the life jacket around her neck  suddenly a male
     hand grabs the tab for her and pulls  she looks up at beck

                                willie
                   we made it

                                beck
                   wheres jones

     holding onto each other willie and beck ride a swell  at
     the crest we see jones in the trough below face down  beck
     breaks away from willie and swims through the waves to reach
     jones  reaching him beck pulls his face out of the water
     and inflates his life jacket

                                willie
                   is he okay

     beck lays jones head back against the life jacket  for a
     moment  jones seems lifeless then his eyes blink and squint
     against the sunlight  beck turns back to willie and as he
     and jones ride the next crest he gives her the thumbsup

                                williecontd
                                jubilant
                   the sun  the sun

     jones looks at beck and grins

                                jones
                   what happened to that typhoon

     calm sea  later

     beck willie and jones cling to each other as they search
     the horizon

                                willie
                   are you sure you saw something

                                jones
                   how many times i got to tell
                   you  i saw a ship

                                willie

                   our flares

                                beck
                   well fire one more that
                   leaves us one last one

     beck pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it
     into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark
     water  the light fades willie looks at jones

                                willie
                   are you okay jonesy

                                jones

                                willie
                                testing him
                   whos the best power forward
                   in the nbajameson

                                jones
                                tired but
                                with fight
                   jameson  who are you trying
                   to con

     they both manage a weak laugh then beck sees something

                                beck
                   ill be damned  looka flare

     as a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just
     fading against the sky

                                willie
                   it saw us

                                jones
                   answer them and quit kicking me

                                willie
                   im not touching you

     whoooooooosh  beck fires another flare into the sky  as the
     flare arcs downward willie feels another bump and for the
     first time sees the sharks circling them

                                willie
                   nono no no

     the sharks tighten the circle as the flare fades

     ext us coastguard ships bridge  same

     a captain watches the flare fade through his binoculars and
     speaks to someone os

                                captain
                   i thought you said youd
                   combed this area

     he lowers his binoculars as we widen to reveal martin
     standing on the bridge  he also lowers his binoculars and
     smiles coolly as he lies

                                martin
                   we didmany times

                                captain
                                looks at martin
                                then to a lieutenant
                   initiate rescue

     we hold on martins face as from

     the fore deck of the ship

     a rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks
     off toward the fading flare

     ocean  same

     jones willie and beck stay bunched close together
     suddenly willie feels another bump

                                willie
                                panicky
                   it hit me  where are they

                                beck
                   i cant see them

     suddenly he is bumped by a shark  willie sees one only two
     feet away  they are surrounded  suddenly jones stare to
     taunt the sharks aggressively

                                jones
                   all right  ive had enough

     he pushes away from the group despite becks attempt to stop
     him

     watch stunned  even jones is surprised

                                jonescontd
                                to willie and beck
                   whoa  did you see those fools
                   run  they know whose boss

     he jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time we
     see a gash across his forearm

     underwater pov

     as jones crows triumphantly we suddenly see his wet suit
     ripping along his thighs

     surfaceocean

     jones is chortling suddenly his smile vanishes something
     is happening

     we hear the drone of the approaching helicopterthump
     thump thumpthe blades of the helicopter sound out over
     the waves  its lights are visible  willie and beck wave
     frantically as jones drifts closer to them

     underwater

     jones legs  his wet suit is now completely split open and
     we see the black scales spreading

     the helicopter

     hovers over the group below and lands on the water  its
     blades beat the surface into waves  the winch operator
     hurls out a rescue harness and beck helps willie into the
     ring  he clicks the fastener and suddenly they both lock
     eyes  before willie can say anything beck falls back and
     signals the winch operator who begins hauling her to safety
     immediately beck locks back at jones and extends his arm

                                beck
                   jonesygive me your hand

     willie reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the
     harness  the winch operator throws it back across the water
     where

     beck grabs the harness

                                beck
                   cmon jones

     jones reaches out his hand  he is almost there when
     suddenly rising out of the water behind them is the
     sixpackbowman creature in all its hideous glory  huge and
     gruesome its long teeth glimmer in the light  it goes for
     beck but jones moves between them

                                beck
                   jonesy no

                                jones
                   get out of here becky

     the creature grabs jones and pulls him violently under
     beck watches horrified as his friend disappears  numbed he
     clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly we see a
     boiling of water where jones disappearedbubbles
     risingand then jones bloody and tattered life vest bobs
     to the surface several feet away from beck

     beck reaches out for it just as the creature appears again
     it turns and focuses on beck  beck keeps going for the life
     vest as the creature starts for him

     on helicopter

     the winch operator and willie watch in horror as the
     creature bears down on beck

                                winch operator
                   is he in the harness

     close on jones tattered vest  beck reaches it  his fingers
     wrap around the bicycle pumplike seismic tool in jones
     vest pocket  the creature is right on top of him

     chunk chunk beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles
     rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around becks body
     in a death grip  its horrible mouth starts to open

                                beck
                   cmon motherfucker open up

     the creatures mouth widens and as it starts to strike beck
     thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw andis suddenlypulled from behindout of the creatures graspthe rescue
     cable is taut  the helicopter is taking off

     becks pov rising shot  beck rises suddenly out of the
     water the creature growing instantly smaller below him
     until boom the seismic device explodes in the
     sixpackbowman creature blowing it to bits across the ocean
     surface  the shock wave sends the helicopter banking off
     toward the ship with beck safely attached by cable below it
     the winch operator pulls him in

     ext coast guard ship  later

     beck dressed now in crisp white clothes stands on deck of
     the ship  he glances occasionally at a door nearby marked
     infirmary then looks up as the captain approaches and
     shakes his hand

                                captain
                   mr beck i understand
                   you passed your physical with
                   flying colors  and ms williams

                                beck
                                worried
                   i dont know yet shes still
                   in there

                                captain
                   well youll be glad to know
                   you have a friend onboard

     beck looks up surprised as suddenly martin joins them

                                martin
                                excitedly
                   beck  i told them youd
                   make it  no one back at
                   transocean believed me but
                   i never gave up on you once
                                smiling
                   so how are you feeling

     beck looks at martin for an instant then hauls off and in
     one incredibly smooth punch knocks martin on his can across
     the deck

                                beck
                   bettera lot better

     just then the door to the infirmary opens and willie appears
     with a new outfit on  smiles at beck

                                willie
                   im fine

     beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a steward
     approaches with a tray of whole cooked fish hideous looking
     things like anglers lobsters crabsminiature leviathan
     the sight is almost too intense for beck and willie  the
     captain notices

                                captain
                   i thought we might have some
                   wonderful seafood  but if theres
                   something else youd rather have

     willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at
     the captain and smiles

                                willie
                   how about a burger and fries

     she and beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the
     deck with the captain

     as we pull back the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the
     distance and we are at the

     surface of the ocean

     riding the swells rising and falling before slipping
     beneath the waves and descending again into the cold
     depths





                                the end
