		fade in

            a clock alarm sounds over titles on black  we hear someone
            clearing congested lungs coughing up phlegm a slight crash
            stops both the cough and the alarm

            ext georges beach shack  morning

            the cottage is a tiny peeling paint rattrap set dead center
            on a small ocean front culdesac surrounded by four massive
            postmodern mansions

            int georges beach shack bedroom  morning

            george nelson 42 squints and shivers as the spotty morning
            light and ocean breeze enter through an open window  bold
            waves crash against the cliffs outside the room  a fivefoot
            wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style
            making movement in the room next to impossible  george
            stands shirtless in underwear and coughs again  he steps
            over a pile of tools and stands at the window facing the
            sea  a happy sounding tune by guster what you wish for
            begins with the lyrics woke up today to everything gray
            and all that i saw just keeps going on and on

            ext webbers house  morning

            the postmodern house is threelevels of concrete and glass

            int sam webbers bedroom  morning

            earrings and painted black nails  the song continues with
            sweep all the pieces under the bed close all the
            curtains and cover my head  sam looks wasted as he climbs
            out of bed and rummages through his dresser retrieving an
            empty bottle of prescription drugs he tosses the bottle  he
            walks to a desk where a halfbuilt model of a house sits
            unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs
            it  sam enters the closet and digs into a pile of dirty
            clothes pulling out the tie to a robe he knots it around
            the closet pole and then twists it once to form a noose  he
            slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body though
            we dont see exactly what hes doing below his neck its
            evident through his jerking arm that hes masturbating

            wash her hands  the song continues if this serenade is
            not what you want its just how it is  colleen appears
            distracted for a moment  she walks outside onto the terrace
            with wet hands then bolts back in breezing through the

                                colleen
                      this is ridiculous

            we must not see exactly what they see but out the window and
            almost beyond view a stream of urine arks out from george

            this stops colleen for a moment it was difficult  george
            walks back to the cottage and locks guster in before stepping
            into an old ford truck and driving off  colleen watches him

            george can only raise the paper towels

                                george
                      a bird caught me

            bryan grabs a trashcan and holds it up george tosses the
            ball into the trash and sits down

                                bryan
                      orange juicecroissant

            bryan motions with his hand as he sits

                                george
                      im good thanks

                                bryan
                      what are you on

                                george
                      pardon me

                                bryan
                      how much weight have you lost

                                george
                      ohnothing  thirty pounds  i just
                      havent been very hungry

                                bryan
                      hows your wife

                                george
                      when we divorce a decade ago she was
                      very very angry
                          beat
                      now shes just hostile

            bryan nods and laughs as he takes a chunk of croissant and
            chews as he talks

                                bryan
                      rightshe marriedwhat was he

                                george
                      he buys and sells the world

                                bryan
                      peter webber  right  quite the
                      spotlight on that guy

                                george
                      i did tell you didnt i  that id be
                      ready to start the berlin model today

                                bryan
                      well thats sort ofyoure sure youre
                      not hungry

            bryan is anxious as he holds up the rest of the croissant 
            george shakes his head no  bryan tosses his croissant into
            the trash can and leans forward

                                bryan contd
                      this isnt me
                          beat
                      we can show clients endless options
                      change anything in a matter of hours on
                      the computer  but you wont change

                                george
                      typing and clicking myself to renderings
                      isnt why i started building models

                                bryan
                      all of us are typing and clicking
                      george  whether we want to or not

                                george
                      im not

                                bryan
                      which is why we bid out a quarter of our
                      projects  it doesnt make a lot of sense
                      anymore to want what we dont have and
                      dont want what we do

            george glances around the office angered by the thought hes
            being fired

                                george
                      ive been here twenty years

                                bryan
                      maybe thats too long

                                george
                          hopeful
                      maybe

                                bryan
                      thats too long

            george nods as he stares at bryan

                                bryan contd
                      listen they decided on a week a year
                      severance but i got them to twentysix 
                      thats six months salary george 
                      medical and everything for six months 
                      you can learn all you need to on the
                      computer long before that  maybe find a
                      job closer to home

            bryan is rattled by georges blank stare  he takes his glass
            of orange juice and sits back in his chair taking a sip all
            the while keeping an eye on george

                                george
                      my wife left me because i wasntvery
                      emotional  i kept trying to explain that
                      my father sucked all the emotion from me 
                      drunks do that sometimes  make their
                      kids afraid  make them unwilling to
                      express themselves

            bryan knows hes supposed to say something he just cant
            seem to figure out what

                                bryan
                      oh

                                george
                      how old are you

                                bryan
                      forty

                                george
                      we were probably in school together  you
                      went to berkley

            bryan lights up at the sound of his alma matter

                                bryan
                      class of eightysix  i didnt know you
                      were there

                                george
                      i was a sophomore when i got the call my
                      parents were dead

            this is not the direction bryan had hoped the conversation
            was headed

                                george contd
                      my dad had a blood alcohol level of 18 
                      a little high  drove right into oncoming
                      traffic  killed my mother with him  a
                      lady in another car  hurt her daughter 
                      a fiveyear old girl  i think about her
                      still

            bryan wants this to end  he leans forward with a whisper

                                bryan
                      listenmaybe i can get you a year

                                george
                      i hate this job

                                bryan
                      what are you talking about  you love
                      your job

                                george
                      from the day i startedto today  cant
                      stand it

            bryan is perplexed as george stands

                                bryan
                      then it sounds like im doing you a
                      favor

                                george
                      it may sound that way but i react out of
                      fear  my life has nothing to do with
                      what i like or dont like  you havent
                      been listening have you

                                bryan
                      i didnt know there would be a quiz
                      george

                                george
                      for everything

                                bryan
                      well i feel better about this now

                                george
                      good  i was hoping for that

            relieved and not understanding anything about irony bryan
            stands and extends his hand  george shakes bryans hand
            without malice

                                george contd
                      ive got one favor to ask

                                bryan
                      what can i do for you george

                                george
                      i built my first model here when i was
                      twenty  there are hundreds of them on
                      shelves around the office  twenty years
                      of my life  i was wondering if i might
                      be able to pick a few to keep to take
                      home  only the ones that really mean
                      something to me

            bryan recoils slightly from the request

                                bryan
                      oh wellthose arei mean we dont
                      get to keep our work  i could maybe ask
                      them if you could choose one  but you
                      know frankly george you were the best 
                      computer models cant begin to match the
                      beauty you gave yours  theyre a part of
                      this firm  they inspire me  i go out
                      there and sometimes just stare at
                      something ive designed  it amazes me 
                      i would miss that too much
                          beat
                      look i may be going out on a limb but
                      you go out there and look them over
                      every single one of them and pick the one
                      you like the best and take it with you 
                      just run it by me first just in case
                      you knowbut im sure itll be okay

                                george
                      thank you

                                bryan
                      well its the least i can do

                                george
                      yes it is

            george nods and leaves  bryan looks lost and guilty again

            int benson kiddler feinsilber and assoicates  morning

            george walks around the maze of cubicles back to his own  he
            finds an empty box and starts to pack  against a wall a
            large rack is filled with spools of architectural plans 
            george pulls one of the plans down rolls it out and detaches
            the wooden spool  without warning and with a fury hard to
            fathom he proceeds to bat and smash a shelf of beautifully
            rendered models  heads pop up in other cubicles as george
            walks out of his own and armed with a frightening rage
            methodically attacks model after model resting on shelves
            just below massive plate glass windows that frame downtown
            los angeles  steven gardner who asked for his model without
            grass rushes to within feet of george as he witness his
            creation deconstruct into shards of cardboard and plastic

                                steven
                      mother of god  not my house

            george stops for a second to focus on steven but steven is
            smart enough to run  george continues on with the business
            of disassembling his work

                                voice
                      oh please please no

            the plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine 
            george works up a sweat as he whacks model after model
            portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office as
            though bombed in war  bryan burkes secretary inches as
            close as she dares

                                secretary
                      uhmr burke would like a word with
                      you george

            george lowers his stick as he faces her

                                george
                      ohokay

                                secretary
                      in his office  when youre able

                                george
                      thank you

            with that george finishes what he began only minutes prior
            the complete and utter destruction of every model displayed
            on every shelf in the office save one  workers huddle
            together collectively moaning and moving en mass from the
            mayhem  george picks up the sole surviving model in his arms
            and cradles it carefully as he walks into bryan burkes
            office

            int bryan burkes office  morning

            bryan cowers behind his desk as george enters with his model
            in one hand and the long wooden stick in the other

                                george
                      ill take this one if thats okay

            it takes bryan a few aborted attempts to answer before he
            simply nods

                                george contd
                      thank you for going out on a limb and
                      allowing me one

            bryan nods again then quivers as george steps forward leans
            the stick against the desk and extends his hand

                                george contd
                      youre a great architect and a miserable
                      human being

            bryan winces as he extends his hand  they shake hands and
            george grabs hold of the stick again

                                bryan
                      thank you

            george walks around the desk and bashes in a model hidden on
            the floor one that bryan had obviously wanted to save

                                bryan contd
                      oh fuck

            george drops the wooden spool and walks out of the office as
            bryan garners the courage to stand

                                bryan contd
                      youre not even an architect and youre a
                      miserable human being

            george turns around only long enough to answer

                                george
                      youre right  you win

            george closes the door behind him  bryan stares down at the
            remains of the model he gets down on his knees and carefully
            gathers up the pieces

            ext downtown los angeles  morning

            george is sweating as he walks with his box of personal items
            under one arm and the model under the other  dizzy he stops
            for a moment and tires to orient himself glancing one way
            then the other before staggering back and pressing himself
            against the building for support  sweat beads and drops from
            his nose and chin as the song across the universe begins
            by the beatles  george sets the box down but clings tightly
            to the model as he closes his eyes  

            pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my open
            mind possessing them caressing me

            george drops face first to the cement crushing the model
            beneath him

            montage as the song continues

            george is probed and poked by doctor after doctor  an
            ultrasound test followed by a ct scan followed by a mri
            results in more tests

            a flexible tube is slid down georges throat as dye is shot
            into his body  sounds of laughter shades of life are
            ringing through my open view inciting them inviting me 

            a long blunt needle is shoved into georges side for a biopsy
            of his pancreas  xrays are lit and highlighted as doctors
            ponder the specks the disease  

            finally george is opened up nearly bloodless slice through
            skin muscle and fat reveals death limitless undying love
            which shines around me like a million suns which calls me on
            and on across the universe 

            george is wheeled down a long hall to the critical care unit 
            nothings going to change my world nothings gonna change
            my world

            int hospital room  evening

                      that took care of the pain

            george opens his eyes again as an attractive nurse enters
            with a tray of food

                                george

            suddenly alarmed by her emotion the nurse removes her hand
            and stands back away from george

            the door before walking back to george she brushes back his
            hair with both hands then fingers the curves of his ears
            finally resting her thumbs on his lips

                                nurse

            george steps away from the bed slightly rattled by alyssa

                                george
                      alyssa

            alyssa sits down on the bed beside guster and starts to
            bounce up and down  george takes another step back

                                george

            alyssa lies down on the bed lifting the sheet to her nose

                                alyssa contd
                      are these clean

            george is alarmed  guster licks alyssas ear

                                george

                      monday

            george bangs his head with his hand and starts to search the
            room

                                george
                      my keys

            alyssa reaches out and slides a finger down his scar

                                george
                      nothing  i cut myself

            george pats down his pockets

                                george contd

                      summer ive decided

            george opens the drawers of a small desk and a chest not
            paying attention to alyssa as she raises her leg and runs her
            hands down the stubby skin

                                alyssa contd
                      paula cole isnt a vertical kisser

            george dabs his keys from the floor beside the chest

                                george
                      make the bed for me would you  i gotta
                      run

            george turns around to alyssas leg up and a great view of
            her underwear

                                colleen os
                      what are you forty

            george whirls around to face colleen as alyssa lowers her
            leg

                                george
                      i forgot where i put my keys

                      i was just showing him my hair

            alyssa miffed as she stands

                                alyssa contd
                      i think you need to rethink what you
                      think of me

            alyssa walks around her mother and out of the garage 
            colleen stares at george

                                george
                      her leg hair

            colleen turns and walks out

            int georges truck  late morning

            george drives the four miles north to robins house listening
            to paula cole  he turns into emerald bay a guardgated
            community and a guard waves him in

            ext webbers home  late morning

            george rushes from his car and tries the front door but its
            locked  he rings the bell and lois the maid answers

                                lois
                      mrs webber is in the backyard

                                george
                      and sam

                                lois

                      ohgood

            int sams room  late morning

            sam has a cd by marylin manson on loud as he packs a suitcase
            on his bed  the knock on the door is barely heard  another
            knock draws his disapproval

                                george os
                      sam

            sams face turns sour as he yanks the door open

                                george contd
                      ready

            sam shrugs and returns to finish his packing

                                george contd
                      i think youll have fun this summer

            its nearly impossible to hear george over the music

                                george contd
                      dont forget your headphones

            the music is quickly driving george crazy

                                george contd
                      would you mind turning it down

            this doesnt register with sam

                                george contd
                      it wont all be work you know

            george is once again seemingly unheard  he walks to within
            inches of sam and grabs his head and yells into sams ear

                                george contd
                      it wont be all work you know

            sam pulls away from the touch and turns the music off

                                sam
                      i heard you already

            george walks to the sliding glass door and stares down at the
            boys and robin in the pool

                                george
                      your mom and the boys can drop by

            ext webbers backyard  late morning

            ryan and adam are on their backs on rafts as robin swims laps
            between them  suddenly like a ufo crashing to earth sams
            suitcase spirals downward straight into the pool barely
            missing both adam and ryan

                                sam
                      no fucking way

            the boys are knocked off their rafts as robin takes off her
            goggles and focuses on sam up on his balcony

                                sam contd
                      you liar  you stupid liar  i hate you

            george bursts out of the kitchen onto the patio

                                george
                      hes not spending the summer in tahoe

            sam walks out of the kitchen to confront his father

                      who are you anyway  i dont even know

            george walks to the edge of the pool and scoops up the
            suitcase holding it out as it drains

                                sam
                      mom tell him im not going  you already

            robin is in an uncomfortable position as she glances at sam
            before focusing on george

                                robin
                      i did say he could go

            sams eyes well with tears as his voice cracks  robin is
            ready to concede

                      go get in the truck sam

            sam jerks away from his dad as dramatically as he can manage

                                sam
                      go fuck yourself

            george drops the suitcase and grabs sam by the arms  as much
            as sam tries to resist hes clearly no match for his father

                                george
                      your nose ring comes out of your nose

                          upbeat
                      think of it as a family tradition

            sam glares at his mother before grabbing his soggy suitcase
            and stomping out of the backyard  robin is stunned silent by
            georges decisiveness

            int georges truck  late morning

            sam is pressed against the passenger side door  george walks
            from the backyard and opens the truck door to climb in but is
            stopped by sams suitcase  he lifts it out and sets it in
            the bed then slides into the cab sitting on the soaked
            seat  george rises up and turns to sam who is sullen and
            silent

            ext georges shack  afternoon

            sam is shirtless on his back on the roof of the shack
            sunning himself as george struggles to extricate a sofa from
            a doorjamb  guster is asleep on the grass under a tree

                                george
                      sam  imfor like three minutes

            after another bout of trying george drops the sofa and steps
            back to glance up at sam

                                george contd
                      thats okay  if i break my back daddys
                      gonna buy you a naval ring

            no reaction from sam

                                george contd
                      and if that naval ring dont fit daddys
                      gonna rub you down with the sun screen

            sam glances down at his father puzzled by the verse

                                george os contd
                      i want you wearing sun block  and i want
                      you down here to help me  now

            sam dismisses his father without a word  he simply adjusts
            his face back to the sun  george walks away  a sudden spray
            of water drenches sam forcing him to his feet in a cold
            panic  george stops the hose water pelting

                                george contd
                      it works on guster

            moments later

                      you know what else helped guster 
                      neutering

            the slightest alarm crosses sams face

            int georges garage  evening

            george is shirtless in shorts boiling pasta on a portable
            stove as he heats a sauce in the microwave  a dresser topped
            with plyboard serves as a countertop other than a sink being
            across the garage near the toilet this is a fairly well
            equipped makeshift kitchen

                                george
                      do you want garlic bread

            george waits a bit to make sure no response is no response 
            then stuffs a hunk of garlic bread into the toaster oven

            ext georges garage  evening

            sam is sitting on the edge of a cliff that drops twenty feet
            to the ocean guster is whining for attention behind sam

                                sam
                      well get over here then stupid

            guster inches forward on his belly which makes sam smile

                      are you afraid of heights guster

            sam drops to his belly and stretches out to pet guster

                      the fall probably wouldnt kill me
                      anyway

            guster inches closer and licks sams face  george walks out
            with a tray filled with spaghetti garlic bread and a coke

                                george
                      thinking of jumping

            george sets the tray on the ground beside sam

                                sam
                      pushing

            george walks to the edge of the cliff

                                george
                      only jump after you hear the wave crash
                      against the rock  the water will take
                      you out  let it  swim a little north
                      and youll see the sand

            sam sits up and faces his father with a trace of alarm

                      first time i did it younger than you i

            george suddenly leaps forward and disappears into the sea as
            a wave crashes against the rocks below

                                sam
                      oh shit

            sam scurries to his feet and scans the ocean for his father
            the only thing visible is darkness

            guster is lapping up the dinner bread and all as sam calls
            out again  in a bit of a panic sam runs from the cliff

            ext pacific coast highway  evening

            the traffic is heavy as sam runs against it  without a
            sidewalk and with parked cars blocking a reasonable path
            this is a dangerous trek north

            ext aliso creek beach  evening

            sam runs to the edge of the water and anxiously waits for his
            father to emerge from the sea  a jogger startles sam  he
            steps into a wave that soaks his shoes  george floats on a
            wave into view and stands in waist high water only to be
            knocked way back down  he rises and falls and rises before
            making his way to the sand and sam

                                sam
                      are you totally insane

            george coughs and drops onto the sand exhausted  sam storms
            off angry that he cared enough to get angry

            ext georges shack  evening

            sam is winded as he walks off the street to the middle of the
            yard  he glances around for guster

                                sam
                      guster

            guster bounces out of the garage with spaghetti sauce
            covering his muzzle

                      youre so busted dude

            sam sits down on the grass and plays with guster who yaps
            with joy as he breaks away and closes the distance with the
            abandon of a puppy

                      even in the bush tribal people and like
                      that have a place for both  its like a
                      law

            wipes his mouth with a towel  he faces sam

                      probably in the bible

            george drops his pants and climbs into bed  he pulls the

            near the ocean in a chaise lounge listening to music through

            nose  sam stares at his father  a black range rover pulls
            to a stop and robin steps out with a pizza box in her hands

                                robin
                      thought you guys might be hungry

            and starts eating  george glances at sam as robin sets the
            box on the table and sits down

            the table and sits down by robin ready to beg

                                george

                      the first and the last

            george sets his sandwich down

            george opens the box and pulls out a slice  sam appears
            disinterested as george starts in on the slice of pizza

                                robin contd
                          to sam

            grabs a piece for herself

                      used to be anyway

            george responds with a pleasant face hes not going to
            explain his weight loss right now

                                george
                      why the first and the last

            robin sets her slice of pizza down as she studies george

                                robin
                      the first because i wasnt sure you
                      really loved methe last because i
                      wasnt sure i really loved you

            george nods  though it may appear that sam isnt interested
            in the conversation his ears are perked

                                george
                      i was up on the roof this morning
                      tearing it down and it struck me as
                      strong as anything ever has  that im
                      happy today

                                robin
                      what have you been before today

                                george
                      it was just that maybe the way the sun
                      struck the ocean the sound of the waves 
                      it was simple whatever it was  then i
                      started thinking about the last time i
                      felt this good
                          beat
                      its been a long time

                      the only time i can think of for sure i
                      was holding onto sam in the ocean saving
                      him from the waves

            george turns to sam whos caught staring at his father

                                george contd

            robin inexplicably starts to cry  she instantly tries to
            take it back pressing her hand to her mouth wiping her
            eyes but whatever emotion has her has her good  both
            george and sam are confused and concerned

                                sam
                      i have to go

                                george
                      ah  oh

                                kurt os
                      i know theres an explanation

            george pulls back the shower curtains just enough to see kurt
            standing by in his police uniform

                                george
                      no hot water

            george is shivering as he closes the curtain back up

                                kurt
                      mr dokos called to complain that you and
                      a boy are squatting illegally in the
                      garage of your house

                                george
                      check the permits  it was built as a
                      guesthouse  its a legally rentable unit
                      grandfathered when south laguna was
                      incorporated

            without warning the copper tubing holding the hanging
            curtain falls to the ground  george turns the water off and
            grabs a towel  unfortunately his ass is not what the towel
            covers

                                kurt
                      now that should be illegal

            int alyssas family room  evening

            alyssa and colleen are curled up on the sofa as josh and sam
            stick their heads in to say goodbye

            with kurt in the only chair george hands him a cup of coffee
            and sits down on the pullout sofa which is pulled out

            sam is gone in a flash  kurt studies george for a second

            kurt nods agreed hes not

            int robins kitchen  evening

            robin arranges an attractive plate of food which she sticks
            in the microwave  peter walks in wearing different clothes
            but the same personality

                                peter
                      i hope your exhusband is equipped for
                      the havoc of sam because it seems
                      absolutely blissful here tonight

            he sits down at the table opening up a newspaper as robin
            stares at him

                                robin
                      do you think its odd your kids dont hug
                      you

                                peter
                      should i

                                robin
                      it would worry me

            peter glances up from the paper focusing on robin

                                peter
                      if i let everything that should worry me
                      worry me id be dead from worry

                                robin
                      what would you be if you asked adam and
                      ryan to run in now and hug you

                                peter
                      id be you

            the answer bothers robin enough that peter cant concentrate
            back on the paper

                                peter contd
                      ill do it if thats what you want

            robin walks out of the kitchen  peter folds the paper and
            shoves it across the granite counter

            int joshs porsche  night

            sam and josh are parked on a street that overlooks the valley
            east of laguna beach  they share a joint as josh explains
            the specifics of the job

                                josh
                      you dont have to do a thing  just get
                      in and get out  as quick as you can 
                      close your eyes and think of whatever

            sam hands the joint to josh

                                sam
                      whats your deal with alyssa

                                josh

                                sam
                      i wasnt sure

                                josh
                      she wouldnt even fucking go out with
                      until she was sixteen  i mean thats
                      not even a rule just her own thing  she
                      like figures things out on her own and
                      then thats it

            a black mercedes benz pulls to a stop a ways down the street 
            josh hands sam a cell phone

                                josh contd
                      if this rings run

            sam is scared and it shows

                                josh contd
                      he already knows everything about what he
                      cant do  you can tell him not to even
                      look at you if you want

                                sam
                      im thinking its too weird now

            josh pulls a baggie of grass and holds it out for sam who
            takes it and stuffs it in his pants pocket

                                josh
                      it beats working

            josh hands sam the joint

                                josh contd
                      inhale and get out

            sam is quick to inhale but slow to get out  josh takes the
            joint and sam steps out  he walks slowly to the mercedes
            opens the door and climbs in  josh turns the cd on to
            gusters all the way up to heaven  sam closes the door to
            the mercedes  he said to only look up he said to never
            look down down is where we came from its an odd song
            sung in a happy tempo a whistling refrain overtakes the
            lyrics as josh inhales  he said to hope for the best and
            take a load off my chest  soon i could be happy and go all
            the way up to heaven and go all the way back home 

            with the music loud josh misses the police car as it stops
            behind him without the lights  too late for a getaway he
            fumbles for his cell phone and tosses the joint out the open
            window  the officer approaches the porsche with his hand on
            his gun 

                                officer
                      what did you toss into the brush

            josh furtively presses send on his cell phone as he faces the
            officer with a guilty face

                                josh
                      nothing

            he said i might need his help no one gets high on
            themselves  i just seem so lonely hes just trying to be
            nice and spread around his advice  i could be happy

                                officer
                      turn off the music

            as the music stops the door to the mercedes opens and sam
            hops out with his pants around his ankles  the officer
            notices and walks towards the mercedes  the parking lights
            flash red as the car starts and flees the scene  sam yanks
            up his pants and leaps down the hillside falling and rolling
            in the brush as the officer yells for him to stop  josh
            starts his car but the officer dissuades him from leaving by
            removing his gun  josh turns off the engine

                                josh
                      oh its working now

                                officer
                      what did you toss into the brush

            before josh can feign innocence again the brush starts to
            smolder  busted

            ext hillside  night

            sam is spotted with weeds and dirt as he continues his way
            down the steep hillside holding up his pants  after hes
            sure hes safe he sits down and rests his head in his hands 
            he starts to shake frightened by his actions  he drops onto
            his back buttons and zips his pants as he starts to cry 
            slowly he stops crying but keeps staring up at the sky
            which is loaded with stars and a full moon  mesmerized by
            the brilliant night sam cant stop staring

            ext georges shack  morning

            george is removing the last of the windows carefully prying
            it out of the casement as robin pulls up in her range rover 
            she steps out dressed in levis boots and a tshirt
            carrying a large bag

                                robin
                      lunch

            she smiles and walks toward george dropping the food sack on
            the patio table

                                george
                      its not breakfast yet

                                robin
                      i dreamed about your house last night

                                george
                      finished or unfinished

                                robin
                      it was perfect george  amazing  it was
                      so real

                                george
                      didnt you once dream you could lick
                      people well though

                                robin
                      that wasnt a dream  that was sam

                                george
                      ohwith his ear infection

                                robin
                      my tongue around the edge of his ear is
                      what cured him

            george isnt quite sure how to take her comment  finally he
            points to the garage

                                george
                      go in there and lick his attitude

                                robin

                      its what i believe george

            george stares at robin for a second before he nods

                                george
                      you were wrong about the first year you
                      know

            it takes robin a second to understand hes saying he loved
            her when they married

                                robin
                      ive been wrong a lot in my life

                                george
                      hindsight  its like foresight without a
                      future

            robin almost smiles george confessing love ten years dead

                                robin
                      i have three hours before i pick up adam

                          beat
                      where will i be most useful

            robin glances around assessing the best use of her time

                                george
                      with your hands or your tongue

                                robin
                      youre not well

            robin picks up a pile of splintered board and tosses them in
            the garbage bin  george nodshes not

            later

            robin and george carry a twelvefoot beam from inside the
            shack and set it down on cinder blocks  both look exhausted
            as they head back in for another beam  sam saunters out of
            the garage in shorts sits down on the patio chair and opens
            the sack his mother had packed for lunch  he pulls out a
            peanut butter and jelly sandwich and starts eating as george
            and robin emerge from the shack with another beam

                                george
                      good morning

            robin and george set the beam down and turn to sam as they
            both wipe sweat off their faces  sam chews his sandwich
            ignoring them both

                                robin
                      im late

            robin walks close to sam trying to capture his attention

                                robin contd
                      ryan has a game later  he asked if youd
                      come and watch

            sam glances up at his mother just long enough to let her
            know he hates her then drops the sandwich and walks back
            into the garage  a city inspectors car pulls to a stop on
            the street and bob larson steps out with a clipboard  robin
            passes him as she walks back to her range rover

                                bob
                      mr stevens

            bob and george shake hands as robin drives off

                                bob
                      bob larson  do you happen to have an
                      unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a

                      a sink

                                bob
                      allowed outside the enclosed area

            sam walks out of the garage in long pants and a shirt

                                sam
                      where is it

                      i might have a solution

            george grabs his chain saw and walks to the garage with sam
            and bob in tow

                                sam
                      whered you put it

            int garage  afternoon

            george walks to an armoire and empties it  he grabs a hammer
            and bangs pries and pulls the back off then dumps the
            cabinet onto the floor

                                sam
                      i know you took it  i want it now

            george yanks the chain saw to a roar and fashions an oval cut
            a few feet deep on the cabinet base  he kills the saw lifts
            the armoire and scoots it in front of the toilet

                                george
                      doors

            bob grimaces as george opens the armoire revealing the
            toilet inside

                                bob
                      i hate to ask about a window

                                george
                          to sam
                      i flushed it down the toilet

                                sam
                      no  oh my god

            george jerk starts the chain saw again and fashions a small
            opening above the toilet ripping through the studs wire
            mesh tar paper and stucco  fine dust invades the space like
            a storm  bob coughs as he writes in his book  george kills
            the chain saw and sets it down as he surveys his work

                                sam contd
                      if i had a gun id kill you

            bob seems fairly anxious to conclude his business

                                bob
                      i assume youll fill theuh window
                      with glass

                                bob
                          a little rattled
                      i would say youre in compliance

                                george

                      that called you happy

            george is staring at sam  bob backs out of the garage

                                bob
                      you and me both

            with bob gone george walks to sam and gets in his face

                                george
                      everything about you is my business 
                      what you smoke what you swallow what
                      you sniff its all my business

            sam slams his fists against his own chest maddened

                                sam
                      ive been using since i was twelve

                                sam
                      you cant make me do a thing

                                george
                      sit down for a second

                                sam
                      no

            george gently guides sam back onto the bed  sam hops up mad

                                sam contd
                      ill call the cops if you touch me again

            george sets sam back onto the bed not so gently this time 
            sam is less eager to hop up in defiance

                                sam contd
                      oh so youre in the big shit now  child
                      abuse  people go to prison for what you
                      just did to me

                                george
                      my dad used to play a game  i never
                      really understood what it was until after
                      he was gone

            sam appears immensely disinterested

                                sam
                      i was holding for someone  that wasnt
                      even mine

                                george
                      the game was to make me smaller than he
                      was  no matter what  he could be almost
                      invisible as a human being but i had to
                      be smaller  so if i got good grades i
                      was a pussy for not playing football  if
                      i cut my hair for him it wasnt short
                      enough  if i shaved it i looked like a
                      psycho  i never won the game  not once 
                      and if he couldnt make me smaller with
                      words

            tears well in georges eyes  sam is caught up enough in what
            his father has to say that he has to feign his lack of
            interest

                                sam
                      ill have to pay him back

                                george

                      in your answer to everything  youre
                      barely alive

                                sam
                      im not even listening

                                george
                      you know that great thing though  is
                      that change can be so constant you dont
                      even feel the difference until there is
                      one  it can be so slow that you dont
                      even notice that your life is better or
                      worse until it is
                          beat
                      or it can just blow you away  make you
                      something different in an instant  it
                      happened to me

            george walks to the garage door as he wipes his eyes  he
            stops and turns back around to face sam

                                george contd
                      build this house with me

            george walks out leaving sam on the bed to think

            ext georges beach shack  afternoon

            george gathers a pile of splintered boards and tosses them
            into the dumpster  he works while guster sleeps

            later

            the sun is fierce low on the horizon with a heat that
            distorts the distance  george is sweating and shirtless as
            sam walks out of the garage with the gloves on and stands
            staring at his father  after a beat george notices him

                                sam
                      i have to pay back what you flushed down
                      the toilet
                          beat
                      i want ten dollars an hourthen im
                      done

            george nods  he points out the roofless shell of a shack

                                george
                      it all has to come down before we can
                      start again
                          beat
                      knock it down

            george picks up a sledghammer and hands it to sam  sam
            hoists the hefty hammer and with some true effort slams it
            on a sideboard  he slams again and again as george picks up
            a slightly smaller sledgehammer

                                george contd
                      i hated this house from the second my
                      father cheated everyone and put it in my
                      name

            george takes a good hard whack at the wall knocking a huge
            hunk of it down  sam stops to watch

                                george contd
                      twenty years of hating what you live
                      inwhat you are  this is the end of
                      it sam  im gonna build something of me

                                sam
                      dont  i dont want it

            george yells as he lands the hammer into the wall again  sam
            is alarmed by his fathers blatant rage

                                george
                      do whatever you want with it  i dont
                      care  all i want from you is for you to
                      remember we built this house together

                      we havent build shit  youre just
                      tearing down your father

                                george
                      try it  it feels good

            george strikes another blow to the house joined with a mad
            wail  sam starts low a whisper of a scream but quickly 
            builds soon rivaling george in volume as he pounds away 
            this soul letting cleansing ritual is both impelling and
            frightening to watch  tom and barbara colleen and her maid
            step out of their houses drawn and perplexed by the guttural
            noise

            int ryan and adams room  morning

            foundation  sam walks out of the garage with a towel he
            shields his eyes from the morning sun as he watches his
            father work  without makeup or a nose ring and with the
            black dye gone from his hair and the polish from his nails
            sam is a handsome kid

            doors  they work with gloves and brushes and appear
            meticulous in their application  alyssa and sam nail and
            bolt the corner posts to the rim joist as robin and george
            work on the stick framed door deck 
            while george is moving a little slower than usual it appears
            that the pain is nearly gone  as the song ends robin rushes
            toward the radio

                                robin
                      i brought a few of my own

            robin runs to her car and retrieves a few cds  she slips
            the cd in and we hear john hiats distance  its a slow
            soft song that brings a smile to georges face

                      its been a while

                                george

            robins body moves slightly to the music as she smiles 
            george grins  the boys arent sure what to make of the
            advice  you are the beautiful love my lover i am the
            distant shore so far away  there is so much to uncover
            loves hiding  what is this distance for  what is it for

                      whos up for a dance

            robin glances around for any takers finally focusing on

                                adam os
                      just dont hug me too tight

            adam walks to his mother and they hold hands as they dance 
            sam sits down to watch  george wears a smile that wipes the
            last of the pain from his face

                                george
                      oh im worse  much much worse

            robin waits to see how worse  george finally walks to her
            and takes her in his arms  he must have been better than
            this  the waltz smooths out as they dance closer holding
            tighter  we fill the air with silent stares  but still no
            one there we are strangers  alyssa decides its time to
            go

                                alyssa

            sam watches alyssa walk away but hes quickly drawn back to
            his mother and father dancing  ryan appears anxious unsure
            of the music and george

                      when did you fall in love with my dad

            the dance stops  george lets go of robin as she focuses on
            ryan

            george drops back onto his back  he takes his time to
            answer

                                george
                      when you started first grade and your mom
                      went to work it was so she could save
                      for an apartment  but then she met peter
                      and skipped the idea of renting

                                sam
                      hes got nothing to do with me

                                george
                      i couldnt imagine how i could compete
                      with him for any part of you  so i
                      didnt  he wanted you to have his last

                      prick today

            george turns onto his side to face sam again

                      i wish you had told me then

            sam turns away from his father and puts his headphones on 
            the music bleeds through the headphones in a muffled rumble

                                george
                      i put a gun to my fathers head once

            georges voice is soft  theres no chance sam can hear

                                george contd
                      have you ever thought like that  ive
                      been thinkingwatching you work  how
                      much do you hate me
                          beat
                      he was passed out 
                      just screaming at my mother before 
                      about nothing  undercooked meat  i
                      went back to my room put the barrel
                      close to his ear and chickened out again 
                      not my dad  hid in my room  not even
                      me
                          beat
                      of course it was a bb gun  but it still
                      would have hurt like hell

            sam notices his fathers mouth moving and takes off the
            headphones

                                sam
                      are you talking

                                george
                      i was just thinking about my mom  she
                      wouldnt leave him  i remember one time
                      she made us dinner wearing sunglasses  i
                      mean it was dark outside and in  but we
                      never talked about it

                                sam
                      sun glasses

                                george
                      to hide a black eye

                                sam
                      why wouldnt she leave

                                george
                      i think she was terrified of living with
                      himbut maybe even more terrified of
                      life without him

                                sam
                      i would have killed him

                                george
                      everything would have been better if you
                      had  youd have liked your grandmother 
                      and thered be a girl out there thatd
                      have her mother  i remember reading
                      about her in the paper  they couldnt
                      find her father and her mother was dead 
                      i still feel guilty about that

                                sam
                      do you ever wish you had done it

            george thinks about that for a second

                                george
                      i loved him too much

                                sam

                      mom

                      to shave your chest

                      just the two of us

            he closes in on her kisses her cheek

                                robin
                      after the kids are back in school

            robin whispers her answer  peter pulls away and settles down
            on his back  robin doesnt move for the longest time 
            finally she eases onto her back and turns out the light

                      know beautiful person you had ever
                      known  what was that

                                george
                      i cant pick you up

            george wants to answer quickly dismiss the impossible and
            move on but emotion catches him offguard  he forces a
            smile

                                george
                      lets not do this okay

                      you

            robin is surprised by the question  she nods her head

                      absolutely  theres not a doubt in my

            behind her ear  ryan sort of saunters over to george with
            his hands sunk deep in his pockets  without asking george
            wraps his arms around ryan with a hug  afterward

                                ryan
                      i just wanted to know where mom was

            eyes on dale as he opens his arms wide

            hesitant to comfort her  theres a moment where all that

            after an awkward amount of time she wipes her eyes wipes
            her nose crosses around the table to sam and kisses the top
            of his head then his cheek  without a word she walks to

            david dokos stares at sam for a long time before glancing at
            kurt and his police uniform for just a second

                                sam contd

                                sam
                      the payoff

            sam walks back to the ladder and hammer leaving kurt and
            alyssa confounded  david takes a step back

                                david
                      ill justchange clothes

            sam pounds in another shingle as david walks quickly back to
            his house

            int georges hospital room  morning

            george is unconscious as robin enters and sits down beside
            him with a video camera

                                robin
                      i found the last time you were happy

            robin adjusts the viewfinder and presses play on the camera 
            george doesnt wake up  on the tiny screen we see a younger
            george in the ocean his arms wrapped around sixyear old
            sam he shields sam from the waves and kisses his sons hair 
            robin rests the camera on the bed as the video continues to
            play  she takes hold of georges hand and begins to weep as
            she presses her head on his chest  an envelope with robin
            and sams name on it rests on the nightstand beside the bed

            int georges house  morning

            twenty men along with tom and barbara alyssa and colleen

            or cabinets as the house begins to take its final shape

            adam and ryan walk into the house as sam focuses on peter
            who keeps his distance

            peter nods hesitates for a moment before walking up the
            driveway to sam

            int georges hospital room  afternoon

            georges bed is empty stripped of everything  robin is
            still sitting in a chair beside the bed a letter resting on
            her lap  a nurse stops at the door

                                nurse
                      are you sure we cant call anyone

            on roof shingled  the sun drops behind the house causing a
            halo of bright light to envelop it

            int georges house  late afternoon

            most of the workers have gone home because most of the work
            is done  all the floor are handscrapped cherry huge beams
            and wood planks lend a strength to the ceiling  the kitchen
            cabinets are in the bathrooms are complete  sam ryan

            adam and ryan run down the stairs  peter stops cleaning a
            brush and walks to the window as sam stands still

            ext georges house  late afternoon

            adam runs to robin and meets her midyard with a hug

                                adam
                      when does george get to come see his

                                robin

            adam and robin are staring at the house  ryan can see the
            strain on his mothers face

                                ryan
                      is george okay

            all robin can do is shake her head no

            int georges house  late afternoon

            sam backs away from the window  peter turns to face him 
            standing straight as he can being as brave as he can tears
            well in sams eyes as he softly shakes  peter walks to sam
            and wraps his arms around him

                                george vo

                      need to be big  it didnt even need to

                      myself a life  i built myself a house

            sam clings to peter completely lost in sorrow

            ext georges house  late afternoon

            adam and ryan have their arms wrapped around their mother as
            we pull back and watch the sun set the sky off in dazzling
            hues of orange and red

            int range rover  one week later

            robin is driving with sam beside her in a lowmiddle income
            neighborhood in santa ana  sam is holding the letter

                                robin
                      youre sure about this

                                sam
                      yeah

                                robin
                      you could keep it and rent it out

                                sam
                      this is what he wants

                                robin
                      i read the letter  you read the will 
                      he wants you to keep it  to live in it
                      some day

                                sam
                      then maybe this isnt what he wants but
                      this what he was hoping for
                          beat
                      maybe its what i want

            its clear to see that robins proud of sams decision  she
            checks an address on a piece of paper and pulls to a stop  
            sam steps out of the car holding the letter

            ext santa ana apartment building  morning

            sam is shaking slightly as he walks up the cracked concrete
            walk to the door  he rings the bell

                                george vo
                      twentyone years ago my father crossed a
                      doubleline  he changed my life and the
                      life of a little girl forever with that
                      mistake  i just cant stop thinking
                      about her

            a woman in her midtwenties opens the door in her wheelchair

                                woman
                      hello

            sam is very nervous as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out
            a set of keys

                                sam
                      my father built you a house

            the woman is confused as sam holds out the keys

            ext georges house  morning

            the house is majestic in its setting among the trees and
            grass on the jagged just of rock that accepts the constant
            crash of ocean against it with a solid permanence  this is
            where if you were a house you would want to be built
			                                                                the end
