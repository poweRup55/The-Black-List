               fade in

               ext suburbia  night

               a beautiful late summer night crickets chirping sprinklers 
               sprinkling

               we pan across one particular lawn up one particular tree 
               where we see the peeper jon lovitz sitting on a limb he 
               has a bottle of wine some sandwiches a walkman suddenly 
               the lights turn on

                                     peeper
                              whispering
                         showtime

               we see a young mother walk into the room outside the peepers 
               window she is wearing business attire

                                     peeper
                         rough day at the office mrs dunleavy

                         slip off those work clothes and get 
                         into some sweats

               the mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes rubbing 
               her feet

                                     peeper
                         oh my god yes i wish you would let 
                         me rub those feet of course i 
                         wouldnt use my hands heh heh heh 
                         heh

               he sips some wine

               the mother starts to unbutton her blouse she takes it off 
               revealing a nice bra

                                     peeper
                         looks like victoria just told me her 
                         secret

               the peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook mouthing 
               the words as he goes

                                     peeper

                         for months months i tell you

               the mother starts to unbutton her pants her young son walks 
               in wearing a scouts uniform

                                     peeper

                         just getting comfy

               the son talks to his mother excitedly

                                     peeper

                         great knots today or whatever now

               the son not going anywhere sits in a chair

                                     peeper
                         now what this simply wont do

               the peeper takes out a cell phone and dials the son answers

                         wants to see if your mothers panties

                                     mother

                         our tree

               the peeper gets nervous

                         tell her no tell her its just a 
                         big bird

               the peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises 
               we see scottie with his sling shot the mother nods yes he 
               shoots it it hits the peeper square in the head he falls 
               to the ground with a thud

                                     peeper
                         mrs dunleavy please come help me 
                         and wear your bikini

               the peeper looks up he sees scottie pushing a television 
               out the window it lands on top of the peeper hes dead

                                                                  hard cut

               int hole  day

               the peeper is zooming down a hole walls of dirt racing by 
               on all sides

               the peeper is falling down down down the whole way 
               screaming like a fiveyear old girl

               peepers pov

               we see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the peeper 
               races towards the opening which is lit by fire he screams

               ext fire gates of hell

               we see the gatewall of flames we hear screaming wham we 
               see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in a 
               heap in a shallow pit of coals

               dazed he stands and we see other people shooting through 
               the fire wall at different levels note all the arrivals 
               clothes are now burned  shredded

                                     gatekeeper os
                         welcome

               the peeper looks left to see the gatekeeper standing at his 
               station greeting the new souls with mock cheer

                                     peeper
                         am i in hell

                                     gatekeeper
                         what do you think

               a giant bird appears and bites the peepers crotch area we 
               leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to

               matte painting hell

               music up running with the devil by van halen

               the vast and insane kingdom of hell a road leads toward it 
               like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals we see 
               the black castle in the distance the camera zooms into the 
               castle to one particular window

               int nickys room  day

               looks like an american teenagers room  models a dresser 
               heavy metal posters tons of ozzy stuff everywhere but no 
               bed  devils dont sleep nicky is air guitaring to the 
               song over at the stereo we see the cassette playing titled

               nicky who falls backward into the table breaking it

               adrian and cassius are playing darts theyre aiming for 
               peoples faces that are coming through the wall

                                     cassius

                                     adrian
                         ive been waiting on this day for 
                         ten thousand years

               he throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead

                                     human dartboard
                         aaaah

                                     cassius

                         hell ill keep the torture going

                         make the torture you have to let 
                         people feel a sense of relief

               cassius whips a dart which hits one of the human dartboards 
               in the eye

                                     human dartboard
                         aaaaaaaaaaaah

                                     adrian
                         then again the beauty of dad retiring 
                         is what he says doesnt matter 
                         anymore

               cassius pulls out the dart the eye comes with it

                                     cassius
                         ill take that

               cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it thwack  
               it splatters like a grape

                                     human dartboard
                         was that really necessary

               nicky enters sheepishly

                                     cassius

               cassius snaps his fingers in nickys face

                                     cassius
                         hey hey hey wanna mind wrestle

               cassius eyes start glowing red

                         actually ill take a rain check 
                         on

               nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible 
               force

                                     cassius

               nickys head slams back down again

                                     cassius
                         got ya again

                         got me for sure yes

               he grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the 
               head

                                     cassius
                         got ya now heres the big finish

               nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his 
               own crotch

                                     nicky
                         oh no please cassius

               nickys hand is being possessed it gets closer and closer 
               until it latches on to nickys crotch

                                     nicky
                         aaaaah

               cassius concentrates even harder making nicky twist his own 
               hand nicky screams even louder adrian smiles they dont 
               notice that dad wearing a sweatsuit and with very small 
               devil horns enters behind them

                                     dad
                         what are you boys doing

               cassius releases nickys hand

                                     nicky
                         nothing dad just rearranging the 
                         furniture

                         maybe this will help you remember

               dads eyes flash red and cassius punches himself hard in the 
               nose sending him back against the wall and down to the floor

               dad gives nicky a wink nicky smiles dad has an air of 
               confidence and power

                                     dad
                         now everybody sit down

                                     nicky
                         hey dad im almost finished laying

                         tape i really think its a 
                         masterpiece

                         okay kid well listen to it later

               he leads the boys to the throne area we see outside the 
               window the peeper staring in sexily dad looks shakes his 
               head just then the bird appears and attacks him dad closes 
               the curtains

               nicky adrian and cassius sit on little stools at the foot 
               of his throne dad lights a cigarette with his finger the 
               tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks 
               down at his three sons

                                     dad
                         my dad your granddad lucifer was 
                         thrown out of heaven by god and rules 
                         here in hell for ten thousand years 
                         and after this ten thousand years 
                         had passed he decided to abdicate 
                         his throne

               confused nicky sheepishly raises his hand

                                     dad
                         to step aside
                              nicky lowers his 
                              hand
                         and let me become the ruler of 
                         hell this as some of you might 
                         know is my ten thousandth year as 
                         prince of darkness so i think the 
                         time has come to discuss who will

                         thought and careful consideration 
                         ive decided that the ruler for the 
                         next ten thousand years is going to 
                         have to be me

                         the important thing for the stability 
                         of our rule is to maintain the balance 
                         between good and evil and i dont 
                         think any of you are ready for that 
                         responsibility yet you need the 
                         wisdom that comes only with the 
                         passage of time

                                     cassius
                         you work your ass off for ten thousand 
                         years hurting people helping others 
                         hurt people then you get a decision 
                         like that

                                     adrian

                                     cassius
                         its just such a slap in the face

               adrian turns to the monster

                                     adrian
                         um excuse me were having a private 
                         conversation here

                         yeah get out of here beat it

               cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the monsters face  
               the monster shrugs and walks off

                                     adrian
                         twentythousand years ago grandpa 
                         lucifer said it is better to rule 
                         in hell than serve in heaven well 
                         im getting tired of serving in hell 
                         we need a place where we can rule

               cassius throws a rock at the monster he yelps then turns 
               around motioning like hes thinking about coming back 
               cassius sees this and gets enraged

                                     cassius
                         oh you wanna be a big man bring it 
                         on lets see what you got

               the monster upon further reflection throws his hands up in 
               an aw phooey gesture and continues walking away

                                     cassius
                         thats what i thought

                                     adrian
                              to cassius

                         seconds

                                     cassius

                         rule

                                     adrian
                         what do you think about earth

               cassius seems to think this isnt a bad idea

                                     adrian
                         we could create our own hell there

                                     cassius
                         you saying we go up there and kill 
                         everyone

                                     adrian
                         eventually cassius but first we 
                         corrupt as many as we can so that 
                         when we do destroy them

                                     cassius
                         their damned souls will be ours

                                     adrian
                         its our time brother

               the two look at each other they start running toward the 
               fire wall knocking souls out of their way

                                     gatekeeper

               close on an elderly kind looking cardinal he ascends the 
               steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation  
               we see that tv cameras are covering the sunday service he 
               begins his homily

                                     cardinal
                         in todays gospel the lord tells us 
                         who we are to live if we wish to 
                         attain the splendor of heaven or 
                         something like that jesus sure says

                         with a whiffle ball bat

               the crowd stares dumbfounded we see that the cardinal is 
               standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box 
               with the top open

                                     cardinal

                         the herpes no he hasnt done a 
                         damn thing for any of us

                         the lord gave my son the strength to 
                         get off drugs

                                     cardinal

                         hashish he made me laugh 
                         occasionally

               a young man and his pregnant wife stand up

                                     young man
                         after we tried for many years the 
                         lord finally helped my wife conceive 
                         a baby

               to raise the roof then thinks better of it the cardinal 
               points to a welldressed man in the front pew

                                     cardinal

                         our socalled sins maybe we should 
                         all just have fun and do whatever 
                         the hell we want

                         amen to that let the sin begin

               the hubbub grows to a roar several people start fighting 
               over the money in the collection plate

               the cardinal smiles knowingly at the mayor we hear the 
               cardinals thoughts  in adrians voice

               int grand central station  pavillion  moments later

               the police are escorting beefy and todd through the terminal

               a thick yellow smoke shoots out of beefy enveloping the 
               group beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs

               archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into 
               adrians leg

                         the only way to save your dad is for

                         claims his throne will have 
                         unimaginable power

               one year later

               over the skyline of manhattan

               ext street  central park west

               pan up from a moving baby stroller to reveal nicky and valerie 
               both pushing it we see beefy walking with them unbelievably 
               happy

               a nice old lady bends down to the stroller

                                     lady
                         oh what an uncommonly beautiful 
                         baby

                         only a quarter maam

               she tickles the baby it giggles and a small stream of fire 
               shoots out of his mouth and singes the old ladys eyebrows

                                     nicky
                         zachariah say youre sorry

                         sorry

               the lady scurries away nicky and valerie laugh and continue 
               walking in absolute bliss they pass the preacher who runs 
               towards us

                                     preacher
                         he has spilled his seed he is

                         the unholy union were all gonna 
                         die

               the preacher runs straight into the camera black
