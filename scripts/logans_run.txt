               please note the crystal will be used in the left hand of all 
               characters

               fade in

               before and during titles

               ext sky night

               the moon and stars are visible but as camera looks down 
               the screen fills with dark billowing clouds camera moves 
               into the clouds and just as they blank out the screen a 
               distant shimmer of light becomes visible moving toward it 
               the shimmer becomes

               ext dome of glass  night

               a glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into 
               the clouds that press it camera continues to move in until 
               the detailed structural webbing of the dome fills the screen 
               and then camera moves through it and we see

               ext the city  day

               shining below the dome which we now see as a series of dome
               like structures standing off without end  a marvelous 
               crystalline city of great openness building clusters green 
               plazas fountains multileveled but human scale 
               crisscrossed by the flickering clear tubes of the mazecars

               closer angle  rooftops

               as a mazecar slides softly to a stop

               rooftop  the runner

               the hatch opens and a man in a hurry leaves the mazecar and 
               runs swiftly along the rooftop and disappears into an open 
               elevator which instantly starts to descend

               int residence plaza  the elevator

               from a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down 
               from a great height as it reaches the courtyard the runner 
               darts out pushes into the crowd

               with the runner

               as he reappears around a corner skirts a brimming pool and 
               makes for a kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out 
               of the courtyard he is moving even faster now glancing 
               back as if he fears pursuit

               another angle  corridor

               above at the railing of an oval light well dressed in black 
               and silver a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in 
               one hand  and watching it is francis

               with the runner

               moving rapidly down the corridor he suddenly stops as if 
               feeling the presence above he looks up sees the sandman 
               and his face breaks in terror he wheels frantic screaming 
               runs back into the hall

               the sandman francis

               vaulting the rail dropping lightly to ground level weapon 
               poised

               pov

               the crowd melting parting to reveal the runner backed against 
               the pool people are yelling shaking their fists terribly 
               excited and fearful

               the sandman

               emotionless aims fires

               the runner  close

               seeming to burst aflame in the lens then slipping below 
               frame to reveal francis sauntering forward holstering his 
               weapon the crowd closing in behind him applauding 
               congratulating him

               the sandman

               arriving at the pool where the body lies half immersed he 
               leans over lifts the right hand from the water revealing a 
               palm with a black flowercrystal shape in it he lets the 
               hand fall back now as the crowd cheers and applauds him

               clear sparkling flowerlike camera pulls back to reveal

               int nursery corridor

               the crystal is in the hand of a sleeping infant who is behind 
               glass in one of many cubicles standing outside looking in 
               logan dimly lit in the soft glow of the cubicle where the 
               sleeping infant lies swaddled and coccooned in the rosy 
               autotender which caters to the babys every need faint 
               music bubbles like distant laughter

               logan

               logan is twentyfive strong virile yet sensitive with a 
               kind of austere grace

               he is somewhat manic proud as he peers through the 
               nursery window into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles three 
               sleeping infants logan is knocking on the soundless glass

                                     logan

               entering

                                     francis
                              shaking his head in 
                              mild mocking 
                              disbelief
                         you are here i couldnt believe it 
                         when they told me what are you doing

                                     logan
                              still knocking on 
                              the soundless glass
                         turn this way
                              as one of the infants 
                              stirs smiles bubbles
                         no no not you you

               francis tries to pull logan away from the window but logan 
               is intent on waking one of the infants

                                     francis

                         pool and when he terminated his 
                         hand
                              breaks off as logan 
                              is paying no attention

                         up

               francis starts to pry at the panel knowing it will sound 
               an alarm

                                     logan
                         hey cut that out

               too late there is a sound of alarm chimes the area in which 
               they stand is bathed in a violet glow logan grabs francis 
               firmly and stops him from prying at the panel

                                     logan
                         now youve done it

               the chimes stop but the glow continues a metallic voice 
               is heard

                              with affection to

                         even the alarm didnt wake him

               as francis starts out

                                     logan
                              one last look joining

                         all right francis im with you

               they move off down the corridor the lights behind them 
               dimming as they pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light 
               children automatically tended

               chimes soft a lullaby and a soothing impersonal voice

                                     voice

               as they exit nursery logan stops and takes one final look 
               backward

                                     francis

                         the babies are

                                     francis
                              putting a card key 
                              into a door which 
                              opens soundlessly
                         not in my time

               they move through the door which closes

               ext maze station  night

               they are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced 
               doorways each glowing faintly they pause waiting

                                     francis
                              peering at logan 
                              curiously
                         why

                                     logan
                         just wondered what happens

                                     francis
                              shrugs
                         dunno flameout maybe whatever 
                         happens you can bet its final but 
                         who would want to find out

               one of the doorways brightens and the word arcade appears 
               on it the two men move to the spot as a mazecar stops 
               they enter it through the doorway which dims behind them as 
               the mazecar whooshes softly off into a kind of twilight

               int mazecar  logan and francis

               the door slides shut they sink into seat forms which yield 
               to them they move off

               ext mazecar

               moving through the city at terrific speed giving us glimpses 
               of the city as it goes slowing finally as we see

               the city  featuring arcade

               brightly lit garish we get only a glimpse as the mazecar 
               disappears into a tunnel

               mazecar station  arcade

               as the mazecar stops opens and logan and francis exit into 
               a gathering crowd

               full shot  arcade

               glittering crowded throngs of people moving on many levels 
               some walking some on moving platforms its the great white 
               way luna park  you name it gaudy booths and entrances 
               featuring every delight  too much to take in at a glance

               with logan and francis

               as they thread their way through a crowd which admires them 
               when it notices them across halls and up moving platforms 
               the goodnatured argument continuing

                                     logan
                         but you dont know you just say 
                         what everyone says one for one 
                         one for one

                                     francis
                         well why not thats exactly how 
                         everything works how else could the 
                         city stay in balance  you have a 
                         better idea

                                     logan
                              laughs
                         no but at least i wonder sometimes  
                         instead of doing that one for one 
                         song of yours you sound like a 
                         sleepteacher with a stuck tape

                                     francis
                         well the minute you get a better 
                         idea you can stop wondering

                         you know logan  you wonder a lot 
                         too much for a sandman

               they are passing the facade of a relive shop the signs urging 
               people to relive your most precious memories do it again 
               and again refresh and renew anytime

               as they cross the entrance two men come out grinning 
               broadly falling into step just ahead of logan and francis 
               then one of the men stops abruptly almost colliding with 
               them he mumbles an apology and starts back to relive

               as he disappears into the relive shop his friend shrugs 
               cheerfully to logan and francis and moves on

               arcade  another angle  new you

               they are moving past a shop called new you 483 when a man 
               comes cannonading out thrilled and excited he rushes over 
               to a pretty young woman who has been eying logan and francis 
               plants himself in front of her with his hands framing his 
               face

                                     man

               emanates from the box

               francis watches as logan wheels in one direction the 
               beeping stops he turns in another direction again there 
               is no beeping

               as logan turns in a third direction the beeping commences 
               logan and francis move swiftly in that direction and the 
               beeping grows louder and louder until logan and francis 
               see

               wide angle  a man

               running

               chase

               intercut between logan and francis following the running man 
               in the great hall empty we can hear the crowd screaming 
               in carousel offstage

               a logan and francis separate to encircle the running 
               man

               b the running man turns a corner and for a moment logan 
               cannot see him

               c as logan turns the corner francis is on the other side 
               and fires at the running man just missing him

               d francis winks at logan as he pursues the running man up a 
               ramp and logan gets it a little cat and mouse is in order

               note the chase will be the directors option

               e logan fires just missing the man francis fires 
               again just missing too

               f the man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp to 
               various levels and areas

               g both barrels of logan and francis respective guns glow 
               again as they fire with both just missing the running man 
               once more

               h the mans face is crazed and sweating the house is 
               going berserk as he has been chased to a high level

               i he stands frozen petrified driven to the edge of a high 
               balcony by the shots  teetering now he is in full sight 
               of logan francis is across the hall

               j the runners face he looks at death twenty feet away  
               logan aims

               k francis watching smiling at the perfect moment

               l logans face a shadow of thought a hesitation

               m the runner lunges logan fires misses

               n francis fires a salvo drives the runner back to the rail 
               where he teeters again throws his hands in front of his 
               face and plunges the screaming in carousel reaches a peak

               with logan

               as he arrives at the dead body of the runner bends over 
               him turns the mans left hand up we see the flower crystal 
               black logan takes out his transceiver

               insert transceiver

               a mans face visible logan checks it against the face of 
               the dead man they are not the same

               another angle

               as francis comes up waits logan moves the transceiver to 
               the dead mans face rests it on his forehead

               insert transceiver readout

               the words appear ident affirm new you 483 alteration

               logan

               scowls for a moment then shrugs he takes out a small flat 
               pouch and methodically strips from the body its few personal 
               things stuffs them into the pouch then his eye is caught 
               by the mans right hand clenched logan opens it a metal 
               ankh on a bit of chain it means nothing to logan who stuffs 
               it into the pouch and closes it now again he fiddles with 
               the transceiver speaks into it softly

                                     logan

                         ready for cleanup

               done with his job he rises to face francis

                                     logan
                              smiling
                         that was a great shot you made

                                     francis

                         what were you doing wondering

               logan shrugs hes not sure himself together they walk off 
               down the hall passing camera

               another angle

               we see in the distance a pair of stickmen descending into 
               the hall riding through the air on their odd vehicles 
               passing overhead then descending one hovers not far away as 
               the other comes down hangs a few feet over the body

               1st stickman and body

               the driver makes sure hes in position then presses a button 
               on one of the arms of the vehicle there is a broad spray of 
               vapor from the bottom which covers the corpse

               corpse insert

               it turns to crystals which sag away from the human form as 
               a sand sculpture erodes when its dry

               1st stickman close on heap of crystals

               satisfied he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of 
               the shot as it leaves the second machine moves down and 
               into its place

               2nd stickman

               glances at the crystals maneuvers into position presses 
               his buttons

               closer angle  the crystals stickman

               sucked up into the machine as it hovers as the floor is 
               once again bare the 2nd stickman revs slightly and his 
               machine pulls up and away

               another angle

               as the stickmen move up and out we see the exhilarated crowd 
               beginning to pour out of carousel

               logan and francis  arcade

               descending from the top level  not much of a crowd francis 
               is gesturing toward the hallucimill

                                     francis

                                     francis
                              calling after him

               back to logan

               hesitates as a couple push past him gleefully on their way 
               he looks and we see

               pov  arcade upper levels

               the people from carousel starting to pour in loud happy 
               ready for more fun

               logan

               not with it he turns and starts making his way downwards 
               towards the exit

               logans apartment

               as he enters idle restless he crosses to a sideboard  
               makes himself a drink sips doesnt like it gets rid of 
               it makes another he fiddles with things a game  sits 
               gets up now he is beginning to feel the drink takes another 
               belt smiles now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked 
               by a console with many dials

               at the wall recess

               as logan dials blurred and smoky images appear in the recess  
               a slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors he tunes it in 
               and the figure of a smiling young man appears  bejeweled 
               lustrous willing

               logan at the console

               bored as mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man 
               dissolves he dials again and now a beautiful young woman 
               takes shape it is jessica

               jessica and logan

               still in the recess she makes no gesture of interest no 
               smile around her neck from a collar a dangling ankh it 
               catches logans eye he smiles clicks another dial and she 
               becomes real he reaches out a hand and leads her out into 
               the room

               logan and jessica

               as jessica turns to him logan moves in strongly and embraces 
               her  but to his surprise she resists logan still holding 
               her loosely is amused and surprised

               in an admiring sexual way from her toes to her head 
               briefly noticing in the process that she is wearing an 
               identical piece of jewelry that he has taken off the dead 
               runner around her neck

               jessica nods

                         too

               suddenly francis and two dishevel led young women burst in 
               and come laughing toward logan and jessica stoned hilarious 
               they crowd around logan one of them embracing him in the 
               wild hilarity jessica slips away and logan seeing her go 
               makes a vain effort after her francis notices laughs amid 
               the noise he shouts to logan

               at logans expression he roars with laughter francis picks 
               up an atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters 
               and a great pink cloud settles over them all

               black door opens revealing logan and francis who now enter a 
               mammoth room as they walk they pass four giant 
               lifeclocks white yellow green and red

               each lifeclock pulses out the moments of every person alive 
               in the city governing everyones crystal changes 
               automatically shifting to the next lifeclock when the time 
               comes

               there are no humans

               francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the 
               room above which is a circular overhang there is a 
               groove the shape of a palm crystal on one part of the 
               circular table

               francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents 
               of the dead runners pockets and starts putting the contents 
               on the table these contents are the ones from the runner 
               francis has killed at the beginning of the film

               the moment the first item touches the table it activates 
               a scanner on the overhang above

               francis stands alongside the table his attitude is very 
               matteroffact he has been through this procedure many 
               many times he touches his head the hangover and 
               logan smiles moments later the scanner stops the word

               identify appears on a screen francis places his palm into 
               the groove and the words clear francis7 appear on the 
               screen

                                     francis
                         see you in the hydrotoner

               logan nods

               francis exits as logan places the contents of a plastic bag 
               with the items he has taken off the runner who jumped to his 
               death among them is the oddshaped piece of jewelry

               logan is standing nonchalantly as the scanner moves over 
               the items waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as 
               francis was earlier

               the scanner continues scanning

               logan starts becoming impatient but the scanning goes on 
               and on and on

               now logan is clearly puzzled it has never ever taken 
               anything remotely resembling this length of time

               suddenly directly before him on the screen the word

               probability blinks on and off on and off catching 
               logans attention as logan turns toward the screen the 
               scanner stops moving the word probability blinks off and 
               is replaced by the word

                                        approach

               we can tell from logans expression as he walks to the 
               corner that he has never seen this before

               logan sits in a chair in the area facing the screen there 
               is a stellar groove that we have seen on the table the 
               shape of a palm crystal glowing on an arm of the chair

               the word on the screen is now

                                        identify

               logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the 
               groove we hear a humming noise then the piece of jade 
               jewelry appears on the screen and below the piece of jewelry 
               the following words appear on the screen

               a moment then logan moves toward her hungrily pulling her 
               in to him as the door closes

                                                               dissolve to

               with logan and jessica

               walking along a handsomely landscaped stream laughing 
               together stopping to admire the beautiful fish koi

                                     jessica

                              turning her gently 
                              back
                         maybe youll think of something

                                     jessica

                         i wish i knew what you think i know

               logan smiles at her both knowing whats false but drawn to 
               each other anyhow they commence walking again

               another angle

               the followers ahead now watching trying to make up their 
               minds as to whether jessica is bringing logan to the ambush 
               as they argue logan and jessica approach

               with logan and jessica

                                     logan

               as they pass jessica looks full in the face of one of the 
               followers looks away logan does not notice the followers 
               are partly reassured one of the men is now holding a garrote 
               made from his necklace the man who first followed gestures 
               and the others go off purposefully he continues after logan 
               and jessica as they exit round a corner

               ready room

               as 1st sandman returns still cheerfully chewing francis is 
               reluctant to give up his place and when he does he remains 
               standing there watching he loves the work  they all do

               logan and jessica entering logan is aware of jessicas 
               increasing tension he pretends unconcern but he is wary

               another angle

               behind them visible through the crowd  two of the men we 
               saw before the follower and the man with the garrote they 
               are moving so as to intersect with logan and jessica where 
               the crowd is thickest streams coming together to move to a 
               higher level

               featuring jessica

               as they move fearful  torn between her promise and her 
               feeling for logan catching a glimpse of the followers she 
               makes a small sound hesitates pretends to have stumbled

               the ambushers

               closer now closing in  the wire garrote gleaming between 
               the mans hands

               logan and jessica

               suddenly she stops he comes round facing as people eddy by 
               them logan looks at her searchingly

                                     logan
                         tell me jessica

               behind him the two men move in the man with the garrote 
               raises his hands one more step logan senses something 
               halfturns just as we hear a familiar urgent sound  the 
               sound of his transceiver behind him the man hesitates drops 
               his hands logan takes the transceiver from his belt and 
               moves out of the crowd to the side jessica with him now he 
               bends to read the message and jessica cranes her head to see 
               too

               ready room  francis and sandmen

               as the runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its 
               message

               the sandman at the console turns and says

               they enter the car which instantly moves off as it passes 
               the men in ambush come forward and read the destination 
               they ring for another car which pulls in immediately

               another angle

               as the two jam into the mazecar which rockets off in 
               pursuit

               as jessica turns her head looking somewhat guilty the 
               mazecar slides to a stop

               a warning light pulses on the cars console and a recorded 
               voice speaks before the hatch opens

                                     voice

               now the hatch opens they step out logan first jessica 
               timidly looking around behind them the hatch closes the 
               mazecar sighs away into the distance

                                     jessica
                         ive never been in this quadrant
                              looks off
                         is that arcade off there

               there are standing on the mazecar platform  a high overlook 
               like an elevated station

               pov  the city beyond the walls of cathedral

               arcade shining like distant fireworks

               ext mazecar m platform  cathedral

               below them a narrow sharply angled concrete canyon 
               buttressed walls rising featureless the look of an old 
               fortress blank dim and cool still visible over an opening 
               the chiseled legend cathedral plaza  2025 ad  skidmore

               jessica shivers looking around her logan takes her arm and 
               they descend into the canyon move toward the wall their 
               footsteps the only sound

                                     logan
                         let me go first sometimes theyre 
                         waiting just inside there  to rush 
                         you when it opens

                                     logan
                         quickly now 

               he helps her through the narrow opening  the portals walls 
               are very thick they turn abruptly and see

               int wall  dazzle chamber

               a room of angled reflecting surfaces at one end a jagged 
               corridor also mirrored leads away the zigzag angled effect 
               creates an absolute confusion of images but logan leads her 
               unhesitatingly across the chamber to the corridor jessica 
               hangs back momentarily certain shes about to smash into 
               something

                                     logan
                              guiding her
                         just follow  no matter how it 
                         seems

                                     jessica
                              doing her best
                         but what is this  why

                                     logan
                              as they enter the 
                              corridor
                         the cubs when theyre flying on 
                         muscle theres no way to catch up 
                         without the dazzle theyd just go 
                         past us 
                              gesture
                          too fast

                                     jessica
                         muscle i dont know that one

               logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor its stop and 
               go  a fun house in which you can get hurt

                                     logan
                         its unauthorized no good for anyone 
                         over thirteen anyhow  shakes you 
                         to pieces  speeds everything up to 
                         a blur 
                              he is amused
                         you can see what happens when some 
                         flying cub tries to go through this 
                         on muscle  splat

               jessica reacts to what logan has said then a moment 
               later

               another angle

               as they approach the end of the corridor a small figure in 
               a tattered garment approaches them she stops singing as she 
               sees logan and jessica

                                     jessica
                              gently

               and hair is tangled

                         old lady

               as soon as she finishes her last sentence mary grabs at 
               jessicas clothing tearing a pin piece of jewelry off 
               and running away swiftly

               as jessica instinctively starts after her logan holds 
               her back

                                     logan
                              shaking his head
                         not here might be a decoy

               cautiously logan and jessica exit from the wall stepping 
               out into 

               ext cathedral itself

               an area of rubble and dilapidated buildings

               logan crouches holding the transceiver and fanning the area 
               listening

               sound a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds 
               steady

               logan gestures to jessica to follow him and moves carefully 
               in the direction of the beeping quartering occasionally 
               like a hunting dog coming up to an angle of wall he stops 
               flicks the sound off puts the machine back onto his belt 
               he gestures to jessica to stand still then he straightens 
               steps out calls

                                     logan
                         runner

               silence jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does 
               the runner moves from behind an upright and stands the figure 
               is shadowed the arms out palms facing in a kind of gesture 
               of surrender in the runners left hand the tiny red crystal 
               pulses on and off the runner is a woman

               there is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly 
               jessica gasps grasping at him

               as logan whirls

               another angle

               suddenly from everywhere out of the shadows a pack of 
               snarling cubs materializes  moving with blinding speed at 
               their appearance the runner whirls and races off into the 
               dark shadows logan makes a futile gesture after her then 
               turns to face the cubs

               a strutting feralfaced fourteen or fifteen year old heads 
               the pack dressed in fiercelooking tatters and hung with 
               ripoff trophies he gestures to one of his followers to 
               stand still

                                     billy
                              speaking of the runner

               the camera pans the other cubs mean filthy

                                     a voice

                         we are right billy

               there is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest

                                     logan

               some murmuring as the pack watches their leader

                                     billy

                         shut up shut up your damn mouth

               logan falls back into a fighting crouch but before he can 
               strike a blow he is grabbed and slammed against the wall 
               of an abandoned building

                                     another voice
                         let him suck muscle thatll shut 
                         his mouth lets watch him shake 
                         himself to death

               we see the cubs take out drugpads they squeeze the pads and 
               inhale the muscle at once their movements become blurringly 
               rapid they take menacing positions  some leaping overhead

                                     a voice
                         give him some muscle

               like lightning they change positions and flash around logan 
               and jessica

               close on  jessica

               watching terrified

               close on  logan

               being held against the wall by cubs as

                                     another voice
                         shake him to death

                                     a voice

               another angle  including billy

               moving a drugpad against logans face

               logan is holding his breath desperately trying not to 
               breathe the muscle directly from the pad into his system

                                     billy
                              chilling laugh
                         hes trying to hold his breath

               as billy presses the pad tighter against logans face

               with all his might logan wrenches his arms loose drops 
               to the ground and pulls out his gun

               he fires and fire girdles a pillar and they start to back 
               away

                                     billy
                         we can rush him we can take can 
                         take him again we can

               the pack hesitates stops backing away

                                     logan
                              moving the gun slowly 
                              back and forth
                         all right how many of you want this 
                         to be lastday

               the pack moves back again and disperses leaving billy 
               facing logan alone

                                     logan
                         come on billy come on you cut 
                         a sandman didnt you

               logan tucks the gun back into his waist

                                     logan
                         come on billy cut me come on

               after a beat billy turns and runs away

               logan comforts the shivering jessica for a moment then takes 
               out the small box from his pocket and turns it until it 
               starts beeping

               the camera pans logan and jessica following the sound

               they move over the rubble and cautiously around abandoned 
               buildings

               we hear a scream and hear the cubs whove only obviously 
               found and attacked someone the sound is coming from a 
               different direction than where the beeping is coming from

                                     logan
                              shaking his head
                         theyve got someone else why would 
                         anybody come here

               jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly

               the beeping is now very loud

               logan homes in on an abandoned building enters crosses 
               swiftly to a door inside and kicks it down

               we see the runner the woman cringing expecting death

               full shot  logan and the woman

               frozen for a moment in fg a figure stirs moves and we 
               see it is francis his weapon is drawn and aimed but as he 
               watches he lowers the barrel and smiles the is logans 
               job

               close on  jessica

               watching logan and the woman

                              quietly
                         dont be afraid 

               before logan can continue the woman who is now wild
               eyed and hysterical lunges at logan and starts grappling 
               with him

                                     woman
                         ill kill you ill kill you

               after logan pushes her away and she falls down

                                     logan
                              breathing hard
                         im not going to hurt you

               slowly she rises

               logan takes out the ankh

                                     logan
                         sanctuary anything

               logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round 
               object the size of a large marble

                                     logan
                         if they find you throw this hard 
                         enough to break it then hold your 
                         breath till you get away its 
                         blind gas

               her reaction is blank then with desperate ferocity she 
               attacks logan again

               during the course of the struggle logan subdues her again

               jessica enters bends over the nearcrazed runner as logan 
               holds her eyeing him the woman stands and takes the small 
               round object she appears somewhat bewildered as logan and

               the woman turns staring insanely her mouth opens like a 
               fish as francis fires his gun a moment later as the burning

               at the flash of fire from francis gun they turn logan and 
               francis eyes meet a beat then logan grabs jessica and 
               pulls her away

               francis

               after a long long hesitation takes out his small plastic

               int sandman ready room  francis

               distracted ignoring the greetings of sandmen who are 
               monitoring the city

               another angle  francis

               walking past the giant lifeclocks into the debriefing area

               the scanners begin moving

               moments later the scanner stops the word

               identify appears on a screen francis pauses a moment and 
               places his palm into the groove

               now he takes out the items of the dead woman runner and places 
               them on the scanning table

               an alarm sounds and the word

               reject flashes on and off on the screen

               sandmen come running into the area

                                     sandman
                         what happened

               francis hesitates then quickly as if changing his 
               mind taking the items off the table

                                     francis

               there are also various photographs on the walls suggestions 
               for changes to foreheads eyes cheeks lips etcetera the 
               chatty informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor 
               or barber shop

               there is a receptionist seated behind a desk in a corner

               logan and jessica walk up to the desk

                              with pride
                         and i did it myself right on there

               full  angle  the surgical apparatus

               aesculaptor mark iii  the latest in servosurgical designs 
               completely selfcontained  tiltbed cryojector services 
               embedded in the platform the mark iiis laser heads are 
               integrated into the whole cocoon swiveled and gimbaled so 
               as to be able to focus any of the surgical beams in 
               microscopic delicacy or widebladed scraping

               the machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x
               ray table on an angle  the great slotted laser heads 
               overhanging it and integral with it from the cryonic receptor 
               base there is a steady exhalation of cold  the vapor seeping 
               steadily downwards blurring the endlessly looped and tangled 
               tubes and wires and containers which join in solid state 
               circuitry so that any random or involuntary twitch of a 
               patient will be instantly compensated by an equivalent move 
               of the laser head  keeping the focus precise

               at one end  where the halves of the mark iii join is n 
               console of switches and dials  lights nod servorecorders 
               which control the operation from the first injection of cold 
               to the final healing vacuum drafts and scar burnishing with 
               the air of a magician demonstrating doc goes to the console 
               and flips switches instantly the table responds  the 
               platform tilting the crablike laser arms descending flexing  
               small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash harmlessly across 
               the table beaming doc turns it off and the whole apparatus 
               subsides

                                     doc
                         i designed it myself
                              slightest beat

                         fullbody job

                                     logan
                         just the face

                                     doc
                         fine holly will get you ready 
                         youre in good hands believe me

               holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on logans tunic

               as holly brushes her fingertips lightly down logans arms

                                     doc
                         holly works here because she gets a 
                         lift out of watching the table

               logan follows holly to the table jessica remains behind 
               with doc who speaks to her with soft urgency

                                     doc

                         all right he gets a face

               the surgical table  logan and holly

               logan lies down

               the table ripples accepting his weight prisoning and 
               positioning him

                                     holly

                         dark hair

                              face
                         we can start by narrowing the 
                         cheekbones

               doc presses buttons on the control board jessica who is 
               standing next to doc is slightly startled as the table begins 
               to hum as a pair of laser beams separate themselves from 
               the overhead cluster and extend toward logan forming inner 
               cones as they approach

               cryojector needles start to close in on them nearing their 
               faces and shoulders slowly the visible cold streaming off 
               the points

               a vibrobeam begins to keen

               sound an insistent chiming

               doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man 
               whos been called to the phone too many times he turns to a 
               phonelike apparatus nearby shifting the table into neutral 
               as he turns the table and the laser heads stop moving

                                     doc
                              as if speaking on a 
                              phone

                              expression changing
                         done

               doc turns back to the console pausing to stare intently at 
               logan then up at the brightly smiling holly something in 
               his look registers and hollys smile fades now doc engages 
               the machine again

                                     doc
                         pay attention sandman im proud of 
                         this machine

               as he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into 
               position near logans face it pauses as

                                     doc
                         with this one theres no waiting for 
                         scar burnishing its all in one 
                         watch now

               the laser arm sweeps across logans forehead and cheeks 
               leaving a bright trail of blood as

                                     doc
                         but heres the improvement instant 
                         healing  before you feel a thing 
                         watch now

               doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along 
               the track spraying healing fluid magically the blood 
               vanishes and the skin is moist and whole

               the surgical table  logan

               his face tense  he knows somethings wrong over him hollys 
               bright face with its rapt look shes not sure but she enjoys 
               whatevers happening

               back to doc

               who is playing the console as he speaks

                                     doc
                         perfect depth adjustment on this 
                         one sandman the beam will cut 
                         through that uniform and just exactly 
                         through the skin beneath  absolute 
                         precision watch now

               and the machine does its stuff slashing through logans 
               tunic  a seam of blood following the rip

                                     doc
                         of course it doesnt mend uniforms 
                         sandman but otherwise it does 
                         everything doesnt it just imagine 
                         what would happen to you if the 
                         healing stopped functioning

               and the arm moves back again spraying the healing fluid 
               into logans new wound again the blood disappears

               suddenly docs look is ferocious he turns off the healing 
               switch and punches buttons fiercely the laser arms begin to 
               move wildly and the sounds become shrill holly looks alarmed

                                     holly
                         no youre scrambling the table 
                         hell be cut to pieces doc

                                     doc

                                     logan
                         no  im running

               machine begins to whine loudly

               jessica tries to turn the machine off doc starts to wrestle 
               with her as

               intercut close angles  the cluster above logan

               moving

               holly

               watching two stun beams lower

               doc knocks jessica down she is groggy on the floor as the 
               stun beams lance into logans cheeks

               the table holds him biting into his right leg below the 
               knee

               quick cuts of doc and holly

               watching intently as

               close angles  logan and the cluster above him

               as surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the 
               waist leaving two threads of blood a vacuhead dips to suck 
               the blood away neatly

               another angle  logan

               as logan desperately sucks in his belly trying to flatten 
               himself into the table

               close angles  logan and the cluster above him

               as laser blades cut into his face followed by a spray of 
               healing liquid on the cuts

               close  on holly

               excited flushed as

               close  on logan and the cluster above him

               as two wide blades of light sweep downward and hover three 
               inches above his neck and keep lowering humming 
               loudly and one inadvertently frees logans right arm

               close on  doc

               shocked as logan reaches for his gun

               close  on logan and the cluster above him

               as dozens of laser beams slash toward logan he twists 
               away and breaks off jumping off the table

               doc rushes logan holding what appears to he a frozen police 
               billy

               in an instant he has knocked logans gun away and as logan 
               looks down at it we see it lying on the floor completely 
               frozen

               slowly doc moves toward logan the short smokecolored stick 
               menacing in his hand

                                     logan
                              outofbreath
                         what i told you is the

               abruptly doc lunges toward logan missing him as logan 
               ducks away

               as doc turns to attack logan smashes his elbows into docs 
               chest and doc falls back onto the table

               close on  holly

               screaming as doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of 
               sparks and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short 
               out and various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces 
               holly tries to fight her way into the mess to help doc but 
               jessica recovering pulls her down and the two struggle

               close on  doc

               in terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons

               logan

               making an effort to stop the machine pulling levers and 
               pushing buttons in vain he sees whats happening pulls 
               jessica away from holly and grabbing up his gun and tunic 
               heads for the entrance crossing the waiting room they are 
               stopped by the sight of

               francis

               entering gun in hand

               reverse angle  logan and jessica

               as they face francis

               full angle  francis logan and jessica

                                     francis
                              frowning
                         whats going on logan

                                     logan
                         it has nothing to do with you

                                     francis
                              choking but still 
                              loyal

                         i saw you logan tell me

               suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst 
               of smoke and noise momentarily drawing francis attention 
               instantly logan jumps him grabs and throws him sprawling 
               without a look back he and jessica run out

               francis

               enraged finds his gun on the floor and before rising gets 
               off a shot at them as they disappear then leaping to his 
               feet dashing off in pursuit

               arcade tracking

               logan and jessica running through arcade

               logan and jessica

               suddenly she pulls him in another direction

                                     jessica
                         follow me logan stay close

               as they run into hallucimill francis never too far 
               behind spots them and follows

               ext hallucimill  two shot  logan and jessica

               exiting from the other side and running through the crowd 
               toward and into a love shop followed by francis coming 
               out of the hallucimill too and running toward the love 
               shop

               int love shop  logan and jessica

               as they enter the hot darkness the love shop is throbbing 
               with sexuality in it the darkness breaks at irregular 
               intervals  when booths and cubicles flare into brilliance 
               each time revealing an orgiastic tableau the love shop is 
               multileveled and the random flashes may appear from any 
               direction at any time blinding and stunning the viewer 
               logan and jessica pause to get their bearings and as they 
               do a beautiful wanton grabs logan pulling and laughing

                                     wanton

               time to see a man almost carrying her off then the light is 
               gone again and jessica with it

               logan and the wanton

               as she tears at his clothing wrapping herself around him 
               trying to pull him down then as the light flares again she 
               suddenly lets go and grabs another man logan is freed 
               starts looking for jessica

               series of shots

               logan hunting through the love shop fighting them off

               intercut shots

               of the suddenlyilluminated tableaus sex manifold and 
               multiform  everybody doing it

               another angle  francis

               entering starting to look around  grabbed by one of the 
               laughing wantons

               logan  jessica

               brief glimpses of them looking for each other

               francis

               hunting both

               with logan

               as he suddenly collides with a woman  shoves her away and 
               sees its jessica now together they make for an archway 
               where multiple mirrors enclose them

               suddenly they are in darkness then a heavy door slides open 
               and jessica leads logan through the opening behind them the 
               door slides shut again

               francis

               desperately trying to get rid of a woman sees a flash of 
               logan and jessica far across the room  sees them leave 
               then hes pulled down again as the orgy continues

               int an immense metal stairway

               after a moment jessica takes logans hand and they start 
               down in the darkness the sounds of love shop still heard 
               from behind the wall

                                     logan

                              interrupting
                         you think sandmen will
                              before she can answer

               then she turns his hand over the crystal blinks red  on 
               off

                         face

               logan embraces her but his look is strange and remote they 
               continue down into the darkness

               behind them the sounds of love shop die away and only their 
               footsteps are heard

               francis

               at the mirrored archway looking around carefully testing 
               he knows they went through somehow hands claw at him  he 
               brushes them away as he searches

               with logan and jessica

               they have come to the foot of the stair here the flooring 
               shines wetly in the darkness

                         turn your hands over palms up
                              beat
                         in a moment a light will shine in 
                         your eyes walk into it  jessica 
                         first then you sandman you will

                         your hands do you agree

               logan nods

               jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable 
               in the dark then suddenly  in front of her  a blindingly 
               bright narrow rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely 
               jessica moves forward even she has to stoop logan is close 
               behind as he bends awkwardly into the opening the light 
               goes out

               logan  jessica  sanctuary hq

               as he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to 
               the side pulling her with him the move fails both are 
               pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and 
               the sudden appearance of glasssilver spear points pressed 
               against them logan is unable to draw his gun

                                     voice
                         hold still sandman or die where 
                         you are

                                     2nd voice
                         is she the one

                                     other voices
                              like angry stage 
                              whispers

                         both jessica you sold us sandman 
                         butcher sandman murderer

               logan and jessica stand rigid against the spear points only 
               their heads turning to the echoing sibilants the spotlight 
               goes off

               int sanctuary hq  logan jessica  close

               in the darkness we see the glasssilver spear points are 
               glowing all around them the long shafts falling away into 
               darkness the points steaming gently when they touch  
               making an instant wincing burn logan moves  a spear point 
               presses  he flinches

                                     logan
                         im a runner she brought me here 
                         because i begged her to help me

               he turns his palm the red crystal blinks impressively in 
               the darkness

               at the sight a babble of sounds argument

                                     voice
                         hes lying no sandman ever ran

                                     2nd voice

                         have killed runners all your life

                         now its my turn and i want to live

               another angry murmur of voices over it jessica suddenly

                                     jessica
                              shouting

                         or were the same as they are  
                         deciding who lives and dies

               one of the points lifts and touches jessicas cheek a quick 
               fierce burn she shrieks  a tiny sound  and is silent

               logan

               reacts fiercely spinning against the spear points he is 
               jabbed and pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get 
               jessica closer shielding her with his body but the spear 
               points are too much he subsides as voices rise angrily 
               kill him now

               suddenly a ringing alarm all sound stops at once and we 
               hear a clatter of footsteps down the iron stair and across 
               the outer floor the spotlight bursts on again and a figure 
               staggers into the chamber straightening into the light 
               hair disheveled hands in front against the glare its holly

                                     holly

                         holly

               she lowers her hands and we see her tattered frightened  
               the bright smile strange she comes to herself a bit looks 
               to the side and sees logan and jessica pinned against the 
               wall

               she reacts with fear at the sight

                                     holly

                         after 

               holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid

                                     holly
                              pouring it out

                         running

               another angle

               the spear points are withdrawn logan and jessica relieved 
               but shaken wary

                                     logan
                         may we move

               long beat then 

                                     voice
                         i saw we pass them through somebody 
                         help holly

               other voices mumble agreement holly moves off into the dark 
               room hands reaching out to help her

                                     voice
                         you two just go straight ahead 
                         follow the corridors with the pipes 
                         overhead to the end then use the 
                         key

               as the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a 
               dim glow around the perimeter we see were in some kind of 
               large underground chamber  some part of the vast 
               undercellars of the city the light is enough to reveal that 
               there are perhaps twenty people in the room reds and greens 
               both  but all are silhouetted no face seen theres a 
               kind of aisle open down the rooms center and its obviously 
               the way they are to go logan and jessica move off logan 
               pauses

                                     logan
                         i dont know who you are id like

                                     voice
                         it doesnt matter who we are follow 
                         the tunnel to the end

                                     logan
                         will there be someone to tell us 
                         where to go from there

               murmur of discussion then

                                     voice
                         someone will follow when you come 
                         to the lock he will tell you how to 
                         go on the other side jessica may go 
                         with you as far as the lock

                                     logan
                              a deep breath
                         no jessica goes back now take her 
                         back
                              suddenly his tone is 
                              urgent as he speaks 
                              to her
                         now go on back back outside 
                         jessica

               she is bewildered by the change

                                     jessica
                         why no no im going with you

                                     voice
                         only to the lock after that theres 
                         no way back

                                     jessica
                              small voice
                         i dont care im going to sanctuary 
                         with you

               a babble of voices impossible she ignores watches 
               logan

                                     jessica
                         will you take me with you

                                     logan
                         why jessica youre still a green

               jessica shakes her head she doesnt know why

               logan puts his arm around her marveling trying to 
               understand moved but suddenly he remembers the urgency of 
               the moment he wheels pulling her with him

                                     logan
                         come on then  theyll be here any 
                         minute

               uncomprehending she starts to run with him too late an 
               explosion shakes the chamber  the wall bellies inward and 
               a group of sandmen led by francis burst into the room 
               firing as they come

               panic turmoil people running screaming  the alarm bell 
               ringing ringing as sandmen methodically slaughter the people 
               in the wreckage of the room

               logan and jessica

               as the brief onesided battle rages echoing shots and 
               screams in the dust filled room logan pulls her down out of 
               the way they watch helplessly suddenly the figure of a 
               sandman looms before them he stares at logan unsure logan 
               reacts draws fires the sandman is smashed away burning

               logan

               suddenly aware that he has killed a sandman jessica pulls 
               him down again into the shadow neither realizes that the 
               soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room

               another angle

               francis quartering the room like a hound searching 
               searching stopping as he sees

               francis pov

               the crystal blinking red eerie in the darkness

                                     francis
                              believing the blinking 
                              crystal is jessicas
                         logan i know youre in here whatve

                         logan now now logan

               after the slightest beat logan fires and francis falls a 
               great chunk of the cave roof falling between him and logan  
               all vision obscured while explosions and screams continue

               logan and jessica

               as he pulls her shakily to her feet she nods shes okay 
               he leads her off down the tunnel

               with logan and jessica  tunnel

               following the tracks the way leads down curves recurves 
               but always down

               another angle  including lock

               as logan and jessica rush toward it the corridor has widened 
               into a kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like 
               an immense submarine hatch

               the tracks run straight to it and beneath it the base of 
               the door tands in a couple of inches of water

               with great urgency logan and jessica examine the huge door 
               logan gives the wheel a tug nothing

               sound a whirring like clockwork a metallic bell sound 
               and then a recorded voice

                                     voice
                         runner this is the last gate use 
                         your key now when the bell sounds 
                         again use your key good luck 
                         runner may you find sanctuary

               silence then the bell chime sound and a light illumines the 
               center of the wheel where theres a kind of keyhole the 
               whirring continues for about ten seconds then it stops and 
               the light goes out

               logan and jessica

               hearing a sound they turn and see

               another angle  pov

               far behind them in the wet glisten of the tunnel a bobbing 
               light and shadow  the sound of running

               close on  logan and jessica

               as jessica takes the ankh from her neck  fumbling with the 
               chain

                                     jessica
                              breathlessly
                         every key only works once and 
                         only a lastday key must open this 
                         door they said it would fit  
                         but

               she tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one but her hand 
               shakes logan tries to steady her  and in helping she 
               drops it into the dark pool of water they fall to their 
               knees searching desperately then logan remembers

                                     logan
                         wait  i have the one i took from 
                         the runner

               sound the same as before as logan searches his pockets for 
               the runners ankh

               logan finds it just as the whirring sound has stopped again 
               and the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel

               as logan and jessica wait for the sound etcetera to repeat 
               again another tremendous explosion is heard rocking 
               everything in the distance jessica can see the shadow of a 
               figure approaching

               as the sound etcetera repeats once more logan pushes 
               the ankh into the lighted center of the wheel the ankh fuses 
               and the lighted center becomes brighter as the door opens

               there is a hesitation in which logan turning his head 
               back realizes what he has done and is shaken

               as the shadowed figure looms larger

                                     jessica
                         theres no turning back is there

               logan turns and pushes jessica through the door following 
               her as the door closes and they are

               on the other side

               now they can still hear the sound etcetera for the last 
               time

               beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in 
               which food was raised and harvested what we see is an endless 
               shadowy labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into 
               the green darkness  a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks 
               and ramps intersecting the huge tanks the levels are multiple 
               and everything is slimed rusted rotted and wet

               in the tanks themselves are shoals of fish gardens of 
               seaweed etc the machinery for harvesting and winnowing has 
               long since gone to rust  and visible in the great tanks 
               are the wrecks of vessels and gear  the kind of stuff 
               cousteau and co are using now

               footing is dangerous  a slip from any catwalk means a plunge 
               into water and some of the walkways are well under water 
               anyhow from an invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping 
               and everything is crusted and smells of salt and decay and 
               life in the darkness

               with francis

               as he arrives at the door the ankh glowing as before

               but francis has a light he examines the door with it and 
               as it lights the pool of water on the ground it picks out 
               jessicas ankh francis stoops gets it and looks from it to 
               the one glowing

               logan and jessica

               bewildered  uncertain as their eyes adjust to the dim 
               light finally logan gestures this way and sets out

               note the action of the sequence is the action of people 
               groping through a labyrinth they go along gripping a rail 
               where possible sometimes sinking deep into water sometimes 
               rising above it they run into blind endings and retrace to 
               the last junction  always trying for what looks driest and 
               seems to stretch farthest along the great wall

               with logan and jessica  series of cuts

               a making their way along the walkway side by side

               b stopping as the walkway disappears under water logan 
               wading in while she waits  until he reemerges she follows

               c choosing between diverging ramps having to return

                                     jessica
                         how do we know this is the right 
                         way

                                     logan

                         must have been a savage world

               logan shrugs but the idea makes him queasy too

               g they stop tired peer through at the wreckage of a small 
               inspection vessel and suddenly hear

               sound footsteps coming halting water sloshing steps 
               again

               pov  through the maze of tanks  a light

               moving hunting

               jessica nods frightened logan slips off into the darkness 
               in a moment hes back his face  is grim

                                     jessica

               he nods

               logan and jessica

               trying to move faster now logan makes a wrong turning and 
               they must go back but as they do so francis is ever closer  
               a gigantic distorted shape now visible through the eerie 
               glass  then suddenly seeming small and distant

               as they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the 
               wall suddenly

               francis

               looming huge gun drawn apparently only a few feet away

               logan and jessica

               logan desperately claws at machinery succeeds in starting 
               motion somewhere what sounds like a generator begins 
               laboring ancient machinery groans

               they turn and run as they hear

                              distorted echo

               is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see

               the door

               a waterlock with a wheel as the light passes logan heaves 
               desperately on it it starts to give as the light comes back 
               and they are revealed

               close  on francis

               aiming at logan then slowly moving his hand until jessica 
               is in his sights

               logan  jessica  francis

               francis fires  tremendous sound echoing and resounding 
               one of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts 
               over everything through it logan manages to get the door 
               open and pushes a halfdrowning jessica through

               int the shaft

               a sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move 
               groaning when the waterlock door closes

               logan slumps to the floor

               int shaft  two shot  logan and jessica

               moving at an extremely high speed we can see the outside  
               flickering  dark light  dark light and finally to 
               a white color they lie slumped motionless finally it stops 
               the door opens into a kind of glistening darkness suffused 
               by a bluish glow it is now very cold

               in the silence logan stirs groping he touches jessica who 
               moves close to him logan puts his arm around her and they 
               rise slowly tentatively he leads her out into the dark 
               chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find 
               themselves what little light there is seems to come from 
               the left arm around jessica logan starts to move

                                     jessica
                              whispering

                         cant go back

               he starts to move again but jessica hangs back

                                     jessica
                         wait

               logan mouths us a strange word and why not in the 
               last minutes he has done strange things

               int ice cavern

               suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from 
               the side and revealing for the first time where they are

               angle

               before them a vase dim iceshrouded storage area row upon 
               endless row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness 
               their legends and contents unreadable in the thick covering 
               of ice and frost to the side a bright light

               logan and jessica

               walk toward the light

               with logan and jessica

               we see a huge highdomed cavern ringed and ornamented with 
               extraordinary ice sculptures  they are everywhere otters 
               fish a tusked walrus  overhead a flight of birds

               another angle

                                     voice

               box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs

                                     box
                         up there

               logan helps jessica up to the pedestal as they stand there

                         up there

               logan looks at jessica her beauty is glowing in the 
               lamplight

               logan takes jessica into his arms

                                     box
                         enchanting is that what humans do

               by this time logan and jessica are no longer listening to 
               box their arms are enveloping one another with strong 
               feelings

                                     boxs voice
                         superb

               another angle  including box

               as his metal hand begins to buzz he brings it to the base 
               of the huge column supporting the cavern

               as he works furiously at incredible speed

               logan and jessica

               oblivious to box their feelings intensifying as they 
               continue to hold one another

               close  on box

                                     box
                              stepping back
                         done behold

               reverse angle  logan and jessica

               before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and 
               passionately

               their mood is broken by

                                     boxs voice
                         done done done

               logan and jessica break they turn and see

               full angle  the ice sculpture

               box has captured them perfectly shimmering with life 
               filled with emotion

               wide angle  including logan jessica and box

               there are tears in jessicas eyes as she reacts to the 
               sculpture

                                     jessica
                              squeezing logans 
                              hand
                         its glorious

               logan helps jessica off the pedestal and they both start to 
               dress

                                     logan
                         all right now you keep your bargain

                                     box
                              rapt by his work
                         wait for the wind wait and hear the 
                         birds sing over you

                                     logan
                              only interested in 
                              getting out
                         were ready

               box mumbles as he leads logan and jessica toward the rear of 
               the ice cavern

               int ice room

               as box enters followed by logan and jessica

               this room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide

               it stretches back as far as the eye can see

               the ice along the left wall is frosted but the ice along 
               the right wall is perfectly clear

               and embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall 
               are

               wide angle  men and women

               standing in erect positions

               at first it appears that they might be more of boxs perfect 
               works of sculpture

               but as logan and jessica examine them closely through the 
               clear ice it is soon apparent that they are real people 
               who have been frozen

               close on logan and jessica

               horrified as they move slowly along the wall

               another angle  including the men and women frozen in the 
               wall

               we can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in 
               the palm of their right hands

               logan walks to the end of this wall each frozen body has a 
               number above it the final bodys number is 1056 that 
               number which the voice in sandmans headquarters revealed as 
               the number of missing runners

               the camera pans logan back to box

               another angle  including box

               as logan turns toward him

                                     logan
                              stupefied
                         how did they get in here

                                     box
                         regular storage procedure the 
                         same as the other food the other 
                         food stopped coming and they started

                                     logan
                         what other food

                                     box
                         fish and plankton sea greens and 
                         protein from the sea
                              pointing to the 
                              frosted ice wall
                         its all here  ready  fresh as 
                         harvest day fish and plankton sea 
                         greens and protein from the sea 
                         and then it stopped coming and they
                              gesture
                         came instead so i store them 
                         here im ready and youre ready 
                         its my job  protein plankton 
                         grass from the sea

               logan pulls out his gun

                                     logan
                         tell us how to get out or ill 
                         destroy you ill kill you

               box laughs the same loud roaring laugh we heard earlier 
               then

                                     box
                              calmly
                         such a beautiful pair ill stand 
                         you facing one another

               box starts his saw hand buzzing he turns all the flesh parts 
               of his body away from logan and starts advancing toward him 
               and jessica who is now standing behind logan

               box is now like an armed vehicle

               logan fires the fire reflecting harmlessly off boxs metal 
               frame

                                     box
                              advancing
                         resign yourself

               medium angle  logan and jessica

               retreating as logan fires again and again to no avail

               as logan and jessica retreat further and further toward the 
               rear of this room and

               reverse angle  box

               advancing we can see person after person embedded in the 
               clear wall of ice a strange mute audience to this tothe
               death drama

               two shot  logan and jessica

               finally reaching the rear wall of this room as

               reverse angle  box

               relentlessly moving toward them

               two shot  logan and jessica

               seemingly pinned back against the rear wall

               logan is firing his gun futilely with his right hand while 
               moving his empty hand against the rear wall trying to 
               find a knob or button which might open it

               the entire time he never takes his eyes off

               reverse angle  box

               getting closer the saw is buzzing loudly

                                     box
                              chilling tone
                         i make such a small quick incision 
                         you can hardly feel it

               reverse angle  logan and jessica

               against the rear wall we can see but they cannot 
               that above them on the ceiling there are a number of 
               exposed cables

               full angle  logan jessica and box

               box is practically upon them as he lunges forward with his 
               whirring saw hand logan pushes jessica to the floor and drops 
               down alongside her

               box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk 
               of ice out of the rear wall as

               logan shoots at box from the floor level upwards trying 
               to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body he 
               misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling

               there is an explosion

                                     box
                              looking up screaming
                         no the coils

               box rushes past logan and jessica toward the huge ice cavern 
               containing his sculptures

                                     box
                              still screaming
                         all my work all my work

               as logan and jessica stand

               angle  the refrigerant coils

               bursting open discharging great streams of gases

               logan

               seeing the effect shooting again and again at the ceiling 
               and walls

               another angle

               coils bursting everywhere vapor billowing into the cavern

               another angle

               huge slabs of ice instantly loosening crashing over

               full shot

               as the effect multiplies  in the hissing vaporsculptures 
               crashing over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and 
               crashing

               box

               careening around wildly in the growing ruin as the lights 
               dim and flicker out

               angle

               the ceiling full of birds loosening crashing down upon box 
               again and again like great spears and wedges

               box

               buried in his work still feebly moving then still as the 
               roaring ice crashes down in the terrible darkness

               logan and jessica

               cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks  saved 
               only by being in an angle of the cave

               full shot

               the screen blotted out by the cavein going out of focus 
               silence then

               sound ice melting water running

               logan and jessica

               stir in the dimness amazed to be alive

               sound a heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block 
               falls into the water

               as it falls the cave is suddenly illuminated again they 
               look and see the light is coming from a great fissure in the 
               wall  opened by the last ice fall water rains across the 
               opening

               logan and jessica make their way to it step out

               ext high ledge

               water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt

               they are blinded by

               sunshine a huge rising sun

               as logan and jessica shield their eyes then realizing 
               that the dazzling light will not go away

               standing together in fear of the sunrise

                                     jessica
                         is there something on fire

               logan shakes his head he doesnt know

               as logan looks up at the sun

                                     logan

               clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge

               lower  an area of boulders

               suddenly a fairly strong wind starts blowing

                                     jessica
                              frightened

               she looks at him uncertainly he puts an arm around her and 
               they set out again

               picking his way through the ruined cave puzzled

               ext forest area

               as logan and jessica reach it

               they are startled by the sound of birds singing for a 
               moment then continue through some high grass and thorned 
               bushes being scratched etcetera

               a swarm of insects attack logan and jessica fight them 
               off

               the sun is starting to go down as they see a rabbit dart 
               away in the grass startling them for a moment

               francis

               coming out through the fissure in the rock squinting at the 
               unexpected light from the sky then setting out as logan and

               with logan and jessica  a bushy area

               they come upon bushes of berries logan picks a few looks

               very cautiously

               he reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on 
               the ground

               he picks a few off the bush is ravenous but finally 
               too frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat 
               any

               as he angrily crushes the berries in his hand then wipes

                                     old man

                         they be cats of course each one

                                     jessica
                         but there are so many of them do 
                         you know each one separately

                                     old man

                         all have three
                              reciting
                         the naming of cats is a difficult 
                         matter it isnt just one of your 
                         holiday games you may think at first 
                         im mad as a hatter when i tell you 
                         a cat must have three different 
                         names
                              a beat
                         an ordinary name and a fancy name 
                         thats two do you want to guess 
                         what the third one is

               logan and jessica are silent

                                     old man
                              reciting again
                         but above and beyond theres still 
                         one name left over and that is the 
                         name that you never will guess the 
                         name that no human research can 
                         discover  but the cat himself knows 
                         and will never confess
                              reaching down and 
                              stroking another cat

               one of the cats jumps off his lap

                              eyes for a moment

                         theres nothing to go on to jessica

               logan continues to shake his head through jessicas following 
               line

                                     jessica

                         many who dont want to die want 
                         it so much that a place called 
                         sanctuary becomes real but it 
                         doesnt exist it never existed

               we can recognize all of them with the exception of the 
               dozen or so that come after ford

               as logan looks at the portraits he recognizes lincoln

                                     logan
                         thats the same fellow whos outside

               as francis suddenly appears alongside her

               jessica is terrified speechless francis glances across 
               the chamber sees logan when he speaks it is softly but 
               urgently

                         what did you do to him

               jessica is silent francis tone becomes increasingly sexual

                         and now youve killed him you know

               francis starts to tear off her clothes obviously to rape 
               but his expression remains cold and without passion

                                     jessica

               logan looks up and we see francis crouched behind the 
               railing of the first row of the gallery with his gun 
               pointing down at logan holding the terrified jessica with 
               his other arm

                                     old man

                              interrupting wild
                         why did you do that

               francis leaps from the gallery and falls on logan

               wide angle  cats

               scattering in all directions as

               close action shots  francis and logan

               in hand to hand combat punching kicking wrestling

               intercut with jessica and the man reacting

               jessica deeply disturbed the man enjoying himself as if 
               logan and francis were putting on a show for him

               the fight  series of shots

               a francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on 
               logan

               b as logan slumps to the floor and francis cries to follow 
               through his advantage by crushing logans face with his foot

               c logan grabs francis foot and twists it sending francis 
               reeling backward

               d standing logan grabs a table and hurls it at francis 
               who ducks

               e francis sees a steel flagpole with an american flag that 
               has sixtyone stars and takes hold of it

               f francis moves toward logan with the menacing steel 
               flagpole in front of him

               g logan is wary watching every movement of the steel 
               pole

               h francis swings the steel pole twice we can hear the 
               whishwhish as it cuts through the air with logan avoiding 
               the blows

               i on the third swing logan grabs hold of the steel pole 
               and swings around on it kicking francis in the chest

               j francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward 
               francis and logan look at one another for a brief anguished 
               moment as logan crashes the steel pole which he is now 
               holding down on francis head

               k francis crumbles to the floor feebly he raises a hand 
               toward logan

               logan touches francis hand and francis grasps his wrist 
               holding death off with the strong grip

                                     francis
                              delirious
                         that was the right shot  look out 
                         there hes trying to break free 
                         watch it logan steady now

               his eyes focus briefly and he sees logans palmthe crystal 
               shining clear and white francis is suddenly radiant

                                     francis
                         logan you renewed

               and he is dead

               jessica and the man

               the man walks over to francis and bends down

                                     old man
                         oh my he died

                         can be visited by the living

               logans eyes are glistening with tears the man starts out

                                     old man

               jessicas words dont help as logan shakes his head then

                                     old man

                         all right

               the man sits down

               gently logan lifts francis body trying to straighten 
               him out from the slightly twisted position he assumed when 
               he fell to the floor

               after resting francis body on the floor again he cradles 
               francis head in his arms

               walking

               ext wooded area  night  logan jessica and the old man

               as they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the 
               distance

               the old man marvels at what he sees they walk on

               long long angle  logan jessica and the old man  day

               walking up the beach toward the domed city we get an idea 
               of the scale they appear as ants in front of redwood trees

               logan jessica and the old man

               approaching the wave power inlet in fg they

               hear the roar of the water

               as they approach cautiously they see

               wave power inlet

               waves pounding over acres of strange stepped construction 
               descending to a vortex

                                     jessica
                         what does that water do

                                     logan
                         its part of the hydrogalvanic system 
                         the ocean tides are changed into 
                         energy somehow

                                     jessica
                         is it inside the city

                                     logan
                         of course
                              a beat
                         i dont know where
                              frowning
                         i just took them for granted
                              logan takes jessicas 
                              hand
                         its our only chance

               the camera pans logan jessica and the old man down the 
               strange stepped construction until they reach

               full angle  a pool of water

               at the center of this immense water flowing construction of 
               steps

               after a beat jessica looks at the old man

                                     logan
                              softly
                         i know
                              after a beat to the 
                              old man

                                     old man

                              kissing the old man
                         goodbye

                                     old man
                         oh my

               the old man watches logan and jessica dive into the pool and 
               disappear

               the old man

               he bends and plays with the water in the pool for a moment 
               like a young child at a pond or lake

               int power center of the city  logan and jessica

               emerging from the water

               it is a labyrinth of humming turbines automonitored cables 
               and impulse collectors

               logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an 
               exit

               great hall  at carousel entrance

               as the crowd is pouring in

                                     logans voice
                         no dont go in there 

               the crowd turns and looks up at

               logan

               on a high balcony in the great hall

               looking down at them

                                     logan
                         you dont have to die no one has 
                         to die at thirty you dont have

                         shes seen it believe me

               there is an angry murmur in the crowd as logan continues

                                     logan
                              holding up his palm
                         see its clear the lifeclocks 
                         are a lie  carousel is a lie

               widen angle  including sandmen

               trying to grab logan there is a struggle some sandmen are 
               knocked over the railing

               but remaining sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues 
               logan and jessica

               the crowd cheers and continues into carousel as

               int sandman debriefing area

               it is the same area where logan received the original 
               assignment to find and destroy sanctuary

               in the rear with the panel open the sign reading

               probability blinks on and off

               logan is dragged in by a number of sandmen

               we see jessica too still groggy being held by sandmen in 
               the bg of the shot

               logan is placed on the chair in which his crystal was altered

               appear  one after the other  in response to questions 
               each of these heads is logan each revolves slowly on its 
               axis as it responds

               as the real logan in the chair is questioned each of the 
               heads answers in turn they are each a part of his persona 
               and his brain
