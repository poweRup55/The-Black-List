	as the credits run we intercut the following two sequences


	ext nevada desert  idols  day


	a slow drift through a collection of crudely constructed
	surreal sixfoot tall idols  like modern demons 
	grotesque  disturbing we lap dissolve between details of
	their twisted anatomies  headlamp eyes bright metal claws
	broken glass teeth

	ext nevada roads  desert  day

	two vehicles one a volkswagen bus decorated with stylized
	flames the other a 66 thunderbird speeding along a series
	of eerily empty desert roads somewhere in a wilderness of
	sand and heat

	end credits

	ext nevada desert  day

	a violent wind howls around but through the sand wecan just
	make out a large ominous building  the house of william
	nix  its walls are whitewashed and scrawled with graffiti 
	the family of idols surrounds the doorway guarding it on
	screen the words  nevada  thirteen years ago

	ext nixs house  day

	were at the front door now which stands open  leaning
	against the doorframe is a scrawny wildeyed youth about
	sixteen  his name is butterfield  hes got a brooding
	almost sultry look on his face  one of his eyes is black
	the other milky blue  hes whittling something with a
	scalpel distantly the sound of car engines  butterfield
	narrows his eyes

	butterfields pov

	the volkswagen bus and thunderbird are approaching the
	house

				butterfield
			softly
		swann

	he turns from the door  in his haste he drops the wood hes
	whittling  hes been carving a deaths head

	int nixs house  rooms and corridors  day

	the house no longer serves any domestic function  it has
	become the temple and dormitory of nixs small apocalyptic
	cult  as we go through the house with butterfield we glimpse
	a little of what life here is like 

	the rooms are murky and chaotic  the walls painted with
	scenes of cities and landscapes burning and creatures from
	some unspeakable nightmare attacking raping and devouring
	helpless humanity  the atmosphere is joyless and
	oppressive 

	the passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
	way to the heart of the house  only oil lamps set on the
	floor light these claustrophobic corridors

				butterfield
		master

	int nixs house  meditation room  day

	a dozen cultists sit crosslegged on the floor in front of
	their leader william nix  his black hair grows to his
	shoulders  his eyes are deep and glittering his voice
	seductive  a terrifying yet charismatic presence 

	all the cultists  who are a crosssection of obsessives 
	wear the same simple tshirts painted with the cults sigil 
	they watch nix in adoration 

	as nix speaks he juggles a flame passing it from hand to
	hand with casual ease

				nix
		and the fire said to me  nix nix
		youre my instrument from now on
		youll be called the puritan

				cultists
			murmuring
		puritan

	nix you will find a few good men and women and together
	together you will cleanse the world

	butterfield enters 

				butterfield
		master

	nix looks up

				butterfield
		swanns here 

	nix rises smiling

				nix
			to cultists
		well come back to this get about
		your business 

	as the cultists disperse nix and butterfield exit into

	int nixs house  sanctum  day

	a place of nightmares hanging from the middle of the ceiling
	is another grotesque sculpture three times the bulk of a
	large man and made of metal flyblown animal parts and
	knotted rope  it is vaguely cruciform but its swaying
	creaking bulk is not even faintly christian  it is a
	perverse sickening image evoking insanity and agony

	from the shadows in the corner we hear a young girls soft
	sobbing

				nix
		hush

	nix goes to the girl  she is twelve beautiful blonde and
	presently in a state of mortal fear  she sits bound in a
	fetal position her face soaked with sweat and tears her
	mouth bloodied her cheek bruised

				nix
		i said hush

				girl
		please  let me go

	from the opposite corner the screech of nixs pet baboon 
	nix goes to it  the animal is large and lethal

				nix
			to baboon
		what is it

	the baboon pulls on its chain staring at the girl and baring
	its teeth as it screeches

				nix
			to girl
		i think hes in love

	he unshackles the baboon  the animal pads toward the girl
	trailing its chain

				girl
		keep it away from me

	nix catches hold of its chain  holds it back  the baboon
	starts screeching again scrabbling at the girl its nails
	catching her arms and legs drawing blood

				girl
		please please

	nix watches her terror dispassionately

				butterfield
			also watching wide
		eyed
		want me to shoot swann

				nix
		you dont like him do you

				butterfield
		he wants your magic

				nix
		maybe  go fetch him

	butterfield exits  nix advances on the girl

	three men and two women still sit  one of the women is
	breastfeeding a baby

				1st man

	and now we see that there are snakes everywhere  in the
	cultists clothes and hair  even on the baby  quaid turns
	away  and  shock  theres a snake on the door frame
	winding around his hand  he strikes it to the ground and
	drives his heel down on its head

	jennifer enters a gloomy room  she goes to a mattress where
	a blonde girl lies with her bare back to us

	pressed to a wound between her breasts  it is not the girl

	she pulls the cloth away  she has carved the cult sigil into
	her flesh  the bloody knife lies beside her jennifer
	retreats to the door and exits back out into

	pimm is standing against the wall clutching a crucifix he
	is ashen with terror  jennifer snatches the crucifix from

	pimm points down the passageway towards nixs room

	int nixs house  passageway outside nixs sanctum  day

	swann wipes sweat from his upper lip then reaches down to
	his belt to check the gun tucked out of sight at his side 
	he turns the door handle

	int nixs house  sanctum  day

	swann steps inside  nixs chair has its back to him the
	folds of nixs robe are visible however  swann hears a
	muffled sobbing from the far side of the room 

	on the girl now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth

	swann starts towards her his footsteps barely audible  as
	he approaches the chair  the baboon leaps at him screeching

	he reaches for his gun  the chair topples  the baboon half
	dressed in nixs robes bounds towards swann

	int nixs house  sanctum  day

	nix has swann trapped against the wall and is working his
	fingers against swanns temples  working working like a
	psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient

				nix

		really looks like

	swann struggles but he cant get free of nixs hold 

	and now  horribly  nixs fingers slide beneath the skin

	and now at last  the violence of nixs deaththroes
	diminishes  nixs body bends like a bow arching off the

	evereager billy steps into the recess  and  

	two spiked latticed gates close on his arm

				harry
		you go through these  go on

	reluctantly billy does so  harry picks up a faded
	photograph of the doorway to nixs house with the sigil
	painted on it and butterfield the child standing in the sun 
	there are other cultists standing around  and in the doorway
	 a barely visible figure and all the more intimidating for

	a horror we recognize  a mans hand pressed into the flesh
	of another mans head

				billy
		take a look at this

				harry
			looking at it
		a nix specialty

	billy is getting subtly spooked now  he puts the etching
	down and starts to go through others in the series  we
	glimpse them as he does so  in one a man regurgitates a
	serpentine form made of flame  in another a man stares at
	his own hand which is stripped of flesh  there is no bone
	beneath  only a form of solid blackness  in a third we see
	a head with a slit in the middle of the brow emanating
	darkness

				billy
		i dont know any of these tricks

	harry studies the etchings

				harry
			a slow burn
		maybe theyre not tricks

				billy
			mystified
		i mean theres no instructions
			realizes what harry said
		what do you mean theyre not
		tricks

				harry
		what did vinovich say something
		about walking a path between 

				billy
		trickery and divinity  yeah he
		says that all the time

		thats because he knew  hed seen

				billy
		knew what

	out of the corner of his eye harry sees a motion between the
	bookstacks  billy frowns  harry puts his fingers to his
	lips  gestures for billy to take cover billy backs away 
	harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion 

	something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks  a
	figure in a straightjacket with his head bowed

	harry takes out his gun 

	billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks harry
	goes after the apparition 

	the track is completely silent 

	suddenly the creature appears behind billy  it looks up
	its face that of a psychotic  burning eyes manic smile 

	it tears open its straightjacket and reaches for billy who

	of smoke 

	harry waves his hands through it  its completely ethereal 

	but its still terrorizing billy

				billy
			in mortal terror
		get it off me

	harry glances around  sees a light flickering between some

	vanishes  billy is left hyperventilating on the ground

		im out of here man  are you

	harry picks up a handful of papers from the nix file

	dorothea appears behind him

				dorothea
		harry  wait

	harrys at the bottom of the stairs now  across the hall in
	a passageway an eerie silhouette  we can make out no detail
	of clothing or face

				harry
		what the hell

	suddenly the shadowy figure comes at harry  a blast of
	energy bursts against harrys face  as it breaks against his
	skin we see for three frames or so a glimpse of harrys
	skull

				harry
			in pain
		aah

	harry fires at the figure  the shadows fold up around the
	stranger like an origami puzzle  hes gone

				dorothea
		its him  its nix

	harry goes out into the passageway

				harry
		valentin  get some lights on

	as if in reply to the command a burst of vivid white fire
	erupts behind harry  he swings round to see the stranger
	unfolding out of the shadows again defying physics and
	physiology to do so  the fire is at his feet like a serpent
	writhing on the ground  it comes at harry  harry fires at
	it but it comes at him faster still rising to burn harrys
	leg  he retreats the fire racing after him he makes for a
	door and flings it open  hes in  

	int swanns mansion  casket room  night     

	the fire follows him across the ground and strikes his hand 
	harry drops the gun  looks up to see the stranger in the
	doorway arm raised to will the fireserpent on  but then
	he hesitates  harry glances round and sees that the
	stranger  whose face is still a dark smear  is staring at
	the casket

				harry
		somebody you know

	dorothea appears behind the stranger  sees harry burned and
	sweating cornered against the casket

				dorothea
		oh my god

	the stranger looks round  harry snatches up the gun
	supporting his burned hand with his good hand  levels the
	gun at the stranger  the fire raises its head like a cobra

				harry
		which goes first  my face or
		your heart

	the stranger draws a deep breath  the fireserpent withers
	and dies

				dorothea
		who in gods name are you

	she reaches for the stranger who simply folds up again gone
	into darkness  the wind blows through the house masking his
	exit

				dorothea
		are you all right

				harry
		find valentin  find him  get him
		in here

	dorothea disappears  harry takes one of the candleholders
	and jams it under the casket lid  wood splinters  he starts
	to force off the lid 

	valentin and dorothea enter

				valentin
		what are you doing  this is
		sacrilege

	he starts towards harry  dorothea goes after him and catches
	hold of his arm  her expression is a mingling of fascination
	and dread as harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
	pulls 

	inside swanns corpse

				valentin
		are you satisfied now

				harry
		no

	harry holds valentin back with one hand and puts his finger
	into the corpses mouth

				dorothea
		harry

				harry
		its all right  its not

	he now has four fingers in swanns mouth and seizes hold of
	his lower jaw  it cracks  

	 and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex

				harry
		plaster doesnt bleed

	he tosses the jaw to valentin

				harry

	then nix appears in the doorway mostly hidden by shadow

				nix
		ive come back to share the wisdom
		of the grave  will you hear it

				cultists
		yes yes

				nix
		follow me then

	he steps out of the doorway  the cultists let out sobs of
	adoration  nix locks at dorothea

				nix
		do i know you child

	he reaches for her  pulls her close to his body dorothea
	keeps her selfpossession but only just

				nix
		oh yes i do dont i  no gun
		this time child
			a beat
		wheres swann

				dorothea
		i dont know where he is

	nix picks her up so that her feet are inches off the ground


				nix
		hell come  weve got unfinished
		business he and i

	then he carries her down the passageway to the meditation
	room walking on the glass apparently indifferent to the
	wounds hes receiving 

	the cultists follow

	int nixs house  meditation room  night

	nix strides into the middle of the room

				nix
			whispered to dorothea
		something terribles going to
		happen  but if you hold on to me
		very tight you may live a little
		longer

	the cultists enter the room knees and hands bloody

				nix
			to cultists
		are you ready for my wisdom

				cultists
		tell us tell us

	int nixs house  sanctum  night

	harry pushes open the window and climbs in  swann follows 
	he is frozen by the memory of what happened here 

	on swann as the track fills with eerie echoes of that
	terrible event  nixs screams  the gunshots  the sound of
	the screws grinding into nixs flesh

				swann
			in terrified awe
		this is where we killed him

				harry
			looking at table
		you didnt try hard enough

				swann
		i cant i cant go any
		further

	harry nods and gently detaches his arm from swanns panicked
	grip  he crosses to the door 

	suddenly butterfield reaches out of the darkness and
	catches hold of harrys leg throwing him to the ground 

	he has one of the instruments in his hand  he stabs at
	harry striking the ground between harrys legs

	int nixs house  meditation room  night

				nix
		here is my wisdom

	he stamps on the ground  cracks spread from his foot in all
	directions on the cultists amazed by this manifestation of
	power

				barbara
		show us puritan

				norman
		yes show us

				all
		show us  show us

	with a roar a pit four or five feet across opens up beneath
	nix and dorothea  nix hovers over it  its utterly dark
	perhaps bottomless 

	dorothea screams

	int nixs house  sanctum  night

	hearing dorotheas cry harry looks back towards the
	passageway  butterfield pulls the instrument out of the
	ground and stabs at harry a second time  but swann catches
	hold of his arm

				swann
			to harry
		whatever hes doing to her stop
		him

	and harrys up and away 

	int nixs house  passageway  night

	 he dashes over the glass 

	int nixs house  meditation room  night

	on nix dorothea clasped close to him  he revolves as he
	floats over the chasm below then

				nix
			to unseen cultists
		you see i escaped the grave so i
		have to give something to the grave
		in return

	on the cultists listening to their lord with love in their
	eyes 

	a slit opens in the middle of nixs forehead above the
	bridge of his nose this is an image we saw in the prints in
	the library and from it comes a wave of darkness  as nix
	revolves the darkness strikes the ground around the
	cultists

	at first they dont realize whats going on  they think this
	is some kind of bizarre blessing 

	then the ground starts to liquify beneath them

				norman
		whats happening

				nix
		i have to give something back so
		im giving you

	theyre starting to scream now as they sink into the ground 
	they struggle of course but the earth seems to be hungry
	for them  they are dragged down thrashing as they sink

				barbara
			sobbing
		why  why

				nix
		youre not worthy  none of you 
		only swann was worthy you just
		waited like lambs

	harry appears in the doorway  nix still swinging round has
	his back to harry

				nix
		well im not your shepherd

	harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him  the ground
	is now resolidifying around the cultists some of whom have
	disappeared from view completely some of whom still reach up
	out of the dirt  the scene has a surreal beauty to it
	despite its horror  screaming faces locked in the solid
	ground  twitching hands the same harry starts towards nix
	and dorothea gun levelled  so far he has avoided nixs
	gaze

	int nixs house  sanctum  night

	butterfield and swann are locked in a lifeordeath struggle 
	they tumble back against the table upon which nix was
	resurrected  it collapses under them and for a moment swann
	is stunned  butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
	and stabs at swann who rolls out of the way in the nick of
	time 

	the blade catches him in the arm however

				swann
		aah

				butterfield
		go on bleed
			he slashes at swann
		again
		go on  go on

	butterfield comes after him and swann backs off against a
	wall  he spits out a serpentine flame which races across
	the floor and leaps at butterfields face

				butterfield
			screaming
		no

	he falls backwards his face on fire  swann doesnt wait to
	watch him die but races out into the passageway blood
	running from his wound

	int nixs house  meditation room  night

	harry is staring up at dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
	the stillsticky ground  hes a yard from the edge of the
	pit now 

	nix swings round

				nix
		youre not swann  who are you
			a beat 
		oh i know what you want he lets
		dorothea slip from his arms  

	harry flings himself towards the hole and catches hold of
	dorotheas arm before she falls away into the abyss  his gun
	goes spinning across the ground back towards the door
	leading to the passageway

				dorothea
		oh god

				harry
		hang on

	nix reaches down to torment harry  but before he can make
	contact

				swann vo
		nix

	nix looks up

				nix
		there you are 

	suddenly nix isnt interested in harry and dorothea he
	steps onto solid ground and walks towards swann his tone
	suddenly conversational

				nix
		ive had a lot of time to think
		about you  where i went wrong

	with nixs back turned harry pulls dorothea back out of the
	chasm

				swann
		and

				nix
		i should have been honest with you
		right from the start  i wasnt
		born to show people the error of
		their ways  i was born to murder
		the world

	on harry as he leads dorothea to the door  harry glances
	back into the room

				nix
		you could still help me do that

				swann
		why would i want to

				nix
		because youve got nothing else to
		live for

				swann
		not true

				nix
		the woman has a new love in her
		life  your friends are dead
		nobodys left to save you but me

	he lays his hands on swann  draws him into an embrace

	on harry and dorothea

				harry
			to dorothea
		ive got to help him

				dorothea
		you cant

				harry
		nix has got to have a weak spot 
		everybodys got a fucking weak
		spot

	a noise he turns and suddenly 

	butterfield is there  his face is horribly burned but hes
	still very much alive

				butterfield
		bastard

	he launches himself at harry driving them both back into the
	broken glass  a fight ensues carrying them out into the
	passageway 

	nix has swann in a bearhug

				nix
		will you help me 

	a beat  then swann nods

				swann
		yes

	nix lets him go

				nix
		you know ill kill you when were
		done  i have to

				swann
		yes

				nix
		but until then its you and
		me the way it always was

				swann
		yes

	dorothea at the doorway watches this bizarre exchange
	swanns eyes flicker towards her  nix turns

				nix
		wait you still feel something
		for that bitch

				swann
		no

				nix
		liar

	nix makes a gesture and swann is flung against the wall
	pinned there like a fly legs off the ground

				nix
		will  you  never  learn

	with each word nix almost casually throws a gesture in
	swanns direction and though there is six feet between them
	they have the force of terrible blows  one to the ribs 
	they crack  one to the face  it bleeds  one to the legs
	one to the arms  they all break  then nix turns towards
	dorothea

				nix
		shes just flesh swannnieboy
		ill show you

	he moves towards dorothea  swann falls to the ground
	broken

				swann
		harry

	int nixs house  passageway  night

	the fight between butterfield and harry continues

				swann vo
		harry  stop him

	harry looks up  sees dorothea retreating from the door and
	running off into the darkness 

	butterfield comes at harry again  harrys got no more time
	for this creep  he delivers butterfield a backhand swipe
	and butterfield lands face down in the glass  we dont see
	the impact  hearing its enough 

	harry looks down at the body  then 

				nix vo
		where is she 

	harry turns

	nix is on him like a luoaernaut treading on butterfields
	body as he comes at harry

				nix
		where did she go

	nix grabs hold of harrys head with one hand and presses the
	fingers of the other hand against harrys temples he
	struggles to get free but nix is simply too powerful

	nixs fingers slowly slide beneath the skin of harrys
	temples  as before theres no blood

				nix
		youve got swanns disease you
		think a little courage a little
		love and itll all be all right 
		wrong

	his fingers slide all the way in

				harry
		oh god

	harry wrests himself free of nix and stumbles away his eyes
	are bloodred  nix is a few yards behind him

				nix
		tell me where she is and ill
		make it go away

	harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare

	harrys pov

	the apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move  a face
	screams  fire blossoms 

	on harry verging on insanity

				harry
		oh god oh god

	harrys pov

	harry sees a woman wrapped in the sicklysensual embrace of
	some glistening barely visible obscenity  we cant see her
	face  only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
	devourer

	on harry

	as he approaches the wall on which this woman is painted 
	reaching out for the image

	harrys pov

	the woman reaches for harry

				woman           
		help me

	on harry

	as he touches the wall

				harry
		dorothea

	he starts to scratch out the plaster on which the image is
	painted

				harry
		dorothea  dorothea

	harrys pov

	darkness swallows the image of the woman  she is still
	screaming when she disappears

	int nixs house  meditation room  night

	on swann dragging his broken body to the door

	int nixs house  passageway  night

	on harry 

	literally beating his head against the wall

				harry
		no  no  no

				dorothea vo
		harry

	harry stops  dare he believe this is truly her voice

				dorothea
		its not real harry

	harry turns around  dorothea is there

	harrys pov

	for a moment he sees dorothea as she is

	on harry relief flooding his face  then 

	harrys pov

	 the image morphs  dorotheas beauty is replaced by
	primeval muck 

	on harry appalled  dorothea grabs hold of him

				dorothea
		harry  listen to me whatevers
		good between us believe it

	harrys face is deathly white and pouring sweat  hes
	fighting the delirium  or doing his best


				harry
		 oh god

				dorothea
		im here harry

				harry
		yes

				dorothea
		yes

	nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind harry

				nix
			to dorothea
		there you are child 

	harry starts to look round

				dorothea
		dont look

				harry
		i have to

				nix
		come on child  i want swann to
		see you die 

	harry turns and looks at nix

	harrys pov

	nixs face darkens as it morphs  and the flesh in the middle
	of his brow unfolds revealing a dark pulsating third eye

				nix
			to harry
		what are you looking at

	on dorothea who has gone to the door of the meditation room
	and now slips inside 

	on harry staring up at nix

	on dorothea reemerging from the meditation room  in her
	hand harrys gun  harry looks round at her

				harry
			points to his brow
		there there

	on nix as he looks up at dorothea 

	on dorothea as she raises the gun  she fires 

	the bullet strikes nixs forehead  he sinks to his knees
	blood pouring down his face from the hole where his third eye
	used to be

	on harry as nixs mindhold falters  he leans against the
	wall shaking

				dorothea
		harry

				harry
		im okay  im okay

	harry opens his eyes  looks up at her

	harrys pov

	the last of the morphing fades  he sees dorothea as she
	actually is  dorothea goes down to comfort him and they
	embrace 

	suddenly a roar from nix  they look towards him 

	 it isnt over 

	one last terrifying transformation is overtaking nix as he
	kneels in the glass  his sallow flesh is running in streams
	up his body towards the dark hole in the middle of his
	forehead 

				nix
		one last illusion

	 his humanity is disappearing vanishing into the vortex of
	the bullet wound

				dorothea
		oh my god

	harry and dorothea start to get up 

	nix is no longer human  he is a shape of gleaming darkness
	stripped of features  he opens his mouth the only visible
	element on his body is his toothed maw which looses an
	utterly inhuman shriek

				swann vo
		 damour

	harry glances through the door into the meditation room
	swann is on the threshold 

	nix rises now  he is a terrifying spectacle his bulk
	somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form 

	he comes at dorothea who has no choice but to back away into
	the meditation room

	int nixs house  meditation room  night

	the pit still yawns in the middle of the floor dorothea is
	backed towards it by nix 

	when nix speaks his voice is not remotely human  it is
	demoniacal

				nix
		i am the purest of the pure  i am
		the darkest of the dark

	harry is at the door now starting towards nix

				swann
		harry  you cant kill him 

	harry crouches beside swann

				harry
			whispers
		he did something with the ground

				swann
		yes

				harry
		can you do it

				swann
		i dont know

				harry
		try

	on dorothea  shes a couple of yards from the pit now

				nix vo
		im beyond heaven  im beyond
		hell

	suddenly harry lunges at nix grabbing hold of his legs 
	nix topples

	on swann who puts his hands on the ground  closes his eyes 

	a wave of liquification runs through the ground from swanns
	broken fingers  

	 the cultists bodies move in the softening ground like
	corpses in surf and roll towards the pit their dead faces
	resurfacing 

	barbaras body floats past nix and disappears over       
	the edge of the pit

				harry
			to dorothea
		get out of here

	the ground is very liquid now and the corpses are lodging
	around nix as theyre all carried towards the pit  sos
	harry of course 

	nix tries to get up but hes too late  the corpses weigh
	him down the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
	hold and harry still clings to his legs

				nix
		no  no  no

	hes at the edge of the pit

				dorothea vo
		harry

	harry looks round  dorotheas behind him risking the
	flowing ground to offer him a hand 

	nix starts to fall into the pit  at the last minute he
	reaches for harry as  

	 harry is pulled out of reach bv dorothea 

	together they stumble to the door where swann still lies 
	they look back to see 

	nix as he goes over the edge of the pit and falls screaming 

	at the door dorothea lifts up swanns head  hes dead she
	closes his eyes

				cut to

	int the pit

	what we are about to witness is the longest falltohis
	death by any villain in the history of cinema 

	nix is falling through rock  still screaming  he crashes
	against a layer of stone which his body smashes to
	smithereens  and as he falls 

	int nixs house  passageway  night

				dorothea
		is it finished

				harry
		i think so

	no its not  nix keeps falling breaking through another
	layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
	earth 

	and now theres a hint of fiery light below  hes
	approaching magma

	int nixs house  passageway  night

				dorothea
		come on

	she puts her arms around him  kisses him sobbing with
	relief

	int the pit

	nix hits a layer of molten rock and screaming he
	disappears  a burst of dark roiling energy erupts from the
	spot where he sank and starts up the pit 

	int nixs house  meditation room  night

	the room trembles  theres a roar in the earth

	int nixs house  passageway  night

				harry
		what the fuck 

				dorothea
		harry

				harry
		out  out 

	they race for the front door 

	int the pit

	 the wave of energy like a howling dark wind ascends at
	a breathtaking rate

	int nixs house  passageway  night

	harry and dorothea race for the open air as

	int nixs house  meditation room  night

	the energy erupts from the pit

	ext nixs house  front door  night

	harry and dorothea stumble out into the night 

	int nixs house  various  night

	the energy howls from room to room eroding the images off
	the walls blowing out the doors destroying all the
	resurrection equipment in the sanctum 

	ext nixs house  desert  dawn

	harry and dorothea stumble to the car  they look back at the
	house as the cacophony of destruction dies down 

	on the rim of the sun as it peeps over the desert horizon

	int nixs house  various  dawn

	the sunlight creeps through the rooms as the dust settles

	int nixs house  meditation room  dawn

	the hole in the floor closes up and is sealed silence
	reigns

	ext nixs house  desert  dawn

	harry and dorothea get into the car  harry glances back at
	the house  nothing

				harry
			quietly
		its finished

	ext nixs house  front door  idols  dawn

	on the idols and the front door virtually destroyed by tine

	we drift through them intercutting with

	ext harrys car  desert road  dawn			   

	harrys car speeds away leaving a plume of dust as

	the credits roll
