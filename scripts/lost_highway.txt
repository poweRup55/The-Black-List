               cigarette we see his back but with each glow of the 
               cigarette ash we see his face reflected in a mirror on the 
               wall across from him in the darkness there starts the sound 
               of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture 
               window just off screen as the curtain moves hardedged 
               light begins crawling across the room and we see everything

               renees face its a face fred has never seen before fred 
               quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp and looks 
               quickly back at renee whose face is now her own

                                     renee
                         fred are you all right

               fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face renee 
               covers his hand with her own and closes her eyes

                                                                  fade out

               ext the madison house  day

               renee finds another envelope on the doorstep she opens it 
               pulls out a videotape a large dog is barking incessantly 
               somewhere in the neighborhood renee looks around to see if 
               she can see the dog

                                                                    cut to

               renee brings the videotape upstairs with the rest of the 
               mail she is a bit puzzled and unsettled she puts the tape 
               down on a table she stares at it fred comes in

                         while then decided to get up

                                     fred
                         who the hell owns that dog

               fred notices the tape and manila envelope on the table

                                     fred
                         whats that another tape

               fred picks it up

                                     fred

               fred goes to the vcr and inserts the tape he turns the 
               television on he is about to start the tape  he looks up 
               for renee shes hanging back

                                     fred
                         well do you wanna watch it

               again renee seems to be nervous about what could be on the 
               tape but she hides this from fred and walks toward the couch

                                     renee
                         yeah

               renee sits on the couch fred starts the vcr and joins her

               as before we first see it on the tv then the videotape 
               fills the frame this tape shows the front of the house as 
               before then shows the interior of fred and renees house  
               at night

               the eerie droning sound goes throughout

               the camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings 
               looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into 
               their bedroom where we see fred and renee sleeping the 
               tape image then goes to snow

               fred and renee stare at the snowy tv picture after a few 
               moments of silence renee gets up and switches off the set 
               she is visibly shaken trembling she stares fearfully at 
               fred who seems less disturbed

                                     renee

               fred as he plays seemingly oblivious to his surroundings 
               his eyes open and shut as he clamps down on the horn

                                                                    cut to

               in the back of the club the side door slowly closes

               int the madison house  stairwell  living room  day

               fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction 
               of the stairwell we hear someones steps coming up the 
               stairs its renee who eventually comes into view she is 
               holding another manila envelope she arrives at the top step

               she and fred lock eyes

               fred takes the envelope opens it and pulls out a third 
               videotape without saying anything fred takes the tape to 
               the vcr he inserts it very carefully slowly he hits play 
               turns on the television and he and renee sit down on the 
               couch together and begin to watch with great apprehension

               again we begin with a wide shot and then the tv monitor fills 
               the screen we see the interior of the house at night the 
               camera glides looking down from a high angle along the hallway 
               and into the bedroom where fred and renee are sleeping

               again the droning sound plays throughout

               in the bedroom where fred and renee are seen sleeping 
               suddenly fred on the tape slowly awakens as the camera 
               holds on him he rises and turns unnaturally in the bed as 
               if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the 
               room he comes to a sitting position his head straining 
               upwards looking in the direction of the camera at this 
               point the videotape image turns to snow

                                                                    cut to

               int the madison house  living room  day

               fred and renee are on the couch the tv remains on showing 
               snow

               renee is very upset crying

                                     renee
                         what the hell is going on

                                     fred
                              equally horrified  
                              frightened
                         i wish i knew

               fred reaches over and tentatively takes renees hand in his  
               she trembles allows him to touch her but otherwise does 
               not respond suddenly she jumps with fright

                                     renee
                         what was that

                                     fred
                         what

                                     renee
                         on the tape there was something 
                         else on the tape

               fred gets up and rewinds it passing an image

                                     renee
                         there play it

               fred runs the tape forward

               we see snow  then a halfsecond long medium shot of fred on 
               his knees near the bedroom wall on renees side of the bed 
               he is looking directly at the camera  his face a ghastly 
               grimace contorted his eyes are wide with horror

               fred runs it back again and freezes the tape there on his 
               tormented image this image fills the screen he and renee 
               stare at it

                                                               dissolve to

               int the madison house  living room  day

               the detectives with fred and renee are seated on chairs and

               intoxicated

               fred who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on 
               makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks 
               when the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely 
               then sets the empty glass down on the bar then he swallows 
               the other drink too and sets down the glass

               fred looks at the man in front of him but speaks again into 
               the phone

               back to the mystery man who takes it folds it and puts it

               disappears down by the engine

               mr eddy sits smiling at pete as he works

               pete pops up and gives mr eddy the thumbs up and gets 
               back into the car

               mr eddy carefully pulls out into traffic and accelerates 
               when he gets the chance

                                     mr eddy

               mr eddy hangs a right turn and heads up into the hills

               mr eddy takes the big pullman along the scenic mulholland 
               drive  cruising smoothly a silvergray infiniti is moving 
               up fast behind the mercedes

                                                                    cut to

               int mr eddys 600 pullman  day

               mr eddy looks into his rearview mirror

                                     mr eddy
                         oh shit is that what i think it 
                         is

               pete turns and looks back a car is tailgating them the 
               silvergray infiniti the two assistants in the backseat 
               turn nonchalantly to take a look  then they return their 
               look to mr eddy

               mr eddy starts to take a slow turn  keeps looking at the 
               infiniti in the rearview mirror

               the assistants look to one another take a deep breath

               mr eddy slows slightly and then keeps the pullman steady at 
               32 mph the infiniti moves up ten feet behind the pullman 
               and blows its horn

               mr eddy rolls down his window

               the assistants are paying close attention  they buckle their 
               seatbelts

               pete notices a tension in the car he watches mr eddys 
               face

               mr eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road pastes a 
               polite courteous smile on his face puts his left arm out 
               the window and waves the infiniti by

               the infiniti jets forward and swerves around the pullman  
               when the cars are side by side the irate driver in the 
               infiniti gives mr eddy the bird and flies past

               close on mr eddys right foot as it slams down on the gas 
               pedal

               the pullman catapults forward toward the infiniti

               pete is thrown back  he grabs on to the door handle and the 
               seat for support

               the pullman gains on the infiniti in a flash the infiniti 
               tries to go faster but mr eddys pullman has much more 
               power

                                     mr eddy
                              clenched teeth
                         this is where power and mechanical 
                         excellence pays off

               mr eddy jams the pullman into the back of the infiniti and 
               pushes it faster and faster along mulholland the driver of 
               the infiniti tries to brake and bluegray smoke streams out 
               from beneath the infiniti with a scream of burning rubber

               at a turn mr eddy steers his massive mercedes and the 
               infiniti ahead on a gutwrenching path off the road up a 
               mountain and into a little glade of trees dust and brush 
               fly everywhere

               mr eddy and his assistants leap from the pullman and make 
               for the drivers side of the infiniti

               mr eddy throws open the infinitis door and pulls the 
               trembling and screaming driver out like a rag doll

               mr eddy pulls out his 44 ruger blackhawk and pistol whips 
               the driver to the ground he smashes the butt of his gun 
               across the mans face tearing a gash which starts to gush 
               with blood

               mr eddys assistants each draw 45s and point them at the 
               driver

               mr eddy redfaced with anger leans close to the man

                                     mr eddy
                         dont you ever fuckin tailgate

               mr eddy hits the driver in the side of the head with his 
               gun

                                     mr eddy

               intervals with eerie stretches of silence crickets in 
               fractured cadence a distant television  a fly buzzing slowly 
               in the room a moths wings beating against light bulbs in 
               the ceiling fixture  the washing of dishes

               petes reaction to these sounds is one of petrified confusion  
               underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly steady drone

               bedroom door as he moves the amplified sounds shift

               he can hear laughter the laughter seems to be loud but at

               the laughter  to hide it

               he pulls in beside vs car and shuts down the engine the 
               usual crowd is at the drivein including sheila

               pete goes up to v and carl and says hello he lights a 
               cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the 
               awning above v and carl both notice that pete is in a bad

               away and take one of her girlfriends hands  leading her 
               out to dance to the loud music

               pete watches her dance suddenly he cant see her he thinks 
               maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the building  
               out of view he moves to look and his head is struck by a 
               violent pain he grabs his head with his hand and leans 
               forward v grabs his arm

                                     v

               tries to push him away but he holds on tighter  laughing 
               with his buddy

               crosses quickly to the man dancing with sheila he slams his 
               fist into the mans nose  almost snapping the mans neck in 
               the process the man goes down bleeding

               pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready 
               for a fight he hits the man in the gut  the mans head 
               goes down and pete brings his knee up cracking the mans 
               face the mans torso flies up with petes knee  then 
               continues on as the man falls to the floor pete picks him 
               up ready to hit him again but the crowd pulls him off

               alices story

               we see alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room it 
               feels like we are inside of a large building  maybe an office 
               building

               alice is waiting nervously

               a slickster in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a 
               closed door

               there is another door off the room which is open onto a room 
               where a muscle man in tiny briefs is doing bench presses

               no one is saying anything

                                     alice
                              voiceover
                         i went to this place they made me 
                         wait forever there was some guy 
                         guardin the door i started gettin 
                         nervous in another room i could 
                         see some guy liftin weights both 
                         these guys gave me the creeps 
                         they never said anything to me so 
                         i just smoked cigarettes and waited

               we move in on a nervous exhale of smoke to a close up of 
               alice waiting

               we see a close up of the man guarding the door

               we see a close shot of the man bench pressing a lot of weight

               suddenly there are two knocks on the other side of the closed 
               door the slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack  
               he talks quietly to someone alice cant see then he turns 
               opens the door and gestures for alice to go through

               alice puts out her cigarette  her hand is shaking

               she walks over past the slickster and enters a much larger 
               room there are about fifteen men in the room  all leaning 
               comfortably at different points on the walls there is only 
               one chair in the room  mr eddy is sitting in it

               no one says anything to her but one man nods his head and 
               from this nod alice feels she should walk to the center of 
               the room she does and she instinctively turns to the man 
               sitting in the chair

               they all just stare at her silently she looks around 
               nervously  her eyes return to mr eddys

               suddenly a man steps quickly up to her  draws a pistol and 
               cocks it against her head

               alice goes weak in the knees her eyes fill with fear

               the men continue to stare

               mr eddy gives alice a small gesture as if to say well

               somehow she knows what they want even though they havent 
               asked for it with words

               alice starts to undress  slowly  in as sexy a way as she 
               knows how

               the men just stare without expression

               when she is completely naked mr eddy gestures her over to 
               him soon she is on her knees in front of him  making herself 
               available for whatever he wants

               mr eddys pov  alice looks in his eyes she reaches her 
               hand up to stroke his cheek

                                                                    cut to

               alice doesnt say anything she drops her hand  looks down

               they start to make love  undressing each other and kissing

               the front porch

               sheila gets to her feet  crying she looks down at pete 
               who remains lying on the front lawn

               for pete every word and every sound is loud and distorted 
               the droning sound returns

                                     sheila

                         great question in the east the 
                         far east when a person is sentenced 
                         to death theyre sent to a place 
                         where they cant escape never 
                         knowing when an executioner will 
                         step up behind them and fire a bullet 
                         into the back of their head it 
                         could be days weeks or even 
                         years after the death sentence has 
                         been pronounced this uncertainty 
                         adds an exquisite element of torture 
                         to the situation dont you think 
                         its been a pleasure talking to you

               but crashes on something on the other side

               he freezes  listening he hears the wind blowing through 
               the trees and distant music from inside  a slow jazz piece  
               he hears echoing sounds of love making

               he makes his way around back  goes up the stairs and tries

               pete and alice drive up to a one room cabin built on stilts 
               next to a dry lakebed they both get out and go up the stairs 
               to a porch where alice knocks on the door there is no answer

               alice opens the door but there is nobody inside

                                     alice
                         well have to wait

               the hot wind continues to blow

               alice and pete walk back down to the car

               the headlights are on and alice reaches in through the window 
               and switches on the radio she cant get anything in but 
               static with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out 
               she hits the seek button the radio starts to search

               pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching 
               her alice walks slowly to him

               the camera captures this from a back seat perspective  then 
               drifts toward them

                                     pete
                         why me alice  why choose me

               the radio sticks on a particular tune  a tune filled with 
               longing alice begins to dance she takes petes hand and 
               pulls him close to her

                                     alice
                         so we can be together you still 
                         want to be with me dont you pete

               alice gives pete that wild smile

                                     alice
                         more than ever

               she kisses pete over and over he begins to kiss her back 
               she starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare 
               of the headlights the hot wind caressing them

               the scene is out of a dream alice and pete help each other 
               undress as they dance in and out of the light and the wind 
               whips at their bodies

               they sink down on the soft ground and start making love

               the lights from the headlights combine with the starlight 
               bathing them in a pristine glow

               the music fades and the radio begins to seek through static 
               for another station the music it finds now is loud and 
               intense

               alice  her hunger appearing now becomes carnivorous in her 
               approach to love making with pete she is the aggressor 
               highlycharged  she wants more and more  taking not giving 
               insatiable

               the headlights flare their bodies in blinding light they 
               become amorphous glowing shapes burning in the light

               pete is trying desperately to please her  to have her

               the driving music fills with cracks of piercing static the 
               radio strains to hold the station

               petes whitehot body clings to alice he chokes with emotion

                                     pete
                         i want you i want you

               with a burning smile alice rolls them out of the beams of 
               light into the darkness the wind billows a black cloud of 
               dust around them

               alice pulls away from pete and brings her dark mouth to his 
               ear

                                     alice
                         youll never have me

               alice glides away from pete and stands up looking down at 
               him from above

               she turns and walks naked to the cabin where she disappears 
               within it

               pete turns face down on the ground in the darkness hes 
               holding his head and shaking

               as he starts to stand  he turns into the glare of the 
               headlights and we see that it is not pete  but fred

               as fred stands up the cars lights dim and the radio fades

               fred looks at the car he sees some movement inside fred 
               looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat

               close up of the man  its the mystery man from andys party

                                     voice from behind fred
                         hello

               fred turns toward the cabin and sees the mystery man now 
               standing in the doorway

               fred turns again to the car but this time its empty he 
               looks back at the cabin and sees the mystery man still in 
               the doorway

                                     mystery man
                         here i am

               fred is dizzy with fear and confusion

               he pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to 
               the cabin toward the mystery man who goes inside fred stops 
               in the doorway he looks around

                                     fred
                         wheres alice

               fred looks around again but there is no one there except the 
               mystery man  standing in the center of the room fred stares 
               at him

                                     mystery man

               fred freaks scared to death he bolts down the stairs to 
               the car stumbling more than once

               fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical 
               charge by the use of the headlights and radio

               the mystery man appears in the doorway of the cabin he starts 
               toward fred

               the starter motor moans as fred twists the key frantically

               the smiling mystery man is almost at the car

               the engine catches fred revs it  throws the car in reverse 
               and peels out away from the mystery man whose hand is 
               reaching for him

               fred swerves the car around  throws it in drive and takes 
               off across the dark desert

                                                                    cut to

               around his throat  trying to hold his neck together blood 
               is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of

               and renees house

               shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit

               freds face begins to change again grotesquely contorting 
               as he races into the vortex his tormented scream blends 
               with the howling siren of the police car gaining on him
