                              interrupting

                         the storm will probably die down 
                         by then my suggestion is that we 
                         better all try and get a good 
                         nights rest

                         thats what it is its a slow 
                         horrible death

               when the significance of this outburst finally sinks into 
               the chaotic minds of his listeners they turn to conway 
               hopefully certain he will refute it but conway looks 
               beyond them at george from his noncommittal silence they 
               realize that georges statement is the truth they slip 
               into their seats the place is heavy with a fatalistic 
               silence george slowly crosses to his seat near conway 
               avoiding his accusing eyes suddenly the air is rent with 
               harsh bitter laughter from gloria they all look up

               they all look up as chang enters he is escorted to his 
               place at the head of the table by two servants who stand 
               on either side of his chair

               straight  studying them  as the others bend over their

                         im glad you like it its made 
                         right here in the valley

                                     lovett
                         now that dinner is over if youll 
                         excuse us were very anxious to 
                         discuss ways and means of getting 
                         back home

                                     george
                         the first thing we want to do is 
                         to cable the foreign office all 
                         of england is waiting to hear about 
                         my brother theres a cruiser at 
                         shanghai ready to take him back

                                     chang
                         really well as regards cabling 
                         im afraid i cant help 
                         unfortunately we have no wireless 
                         here as a matter of fact we have 
                         no means of communication with the 
                         outside world

               george stares at him suspiciously  and then turns to conway 
               for his reaction  but conway is apparently disinterested 
               in the whole conversation

                                     barnard
                         not even a radio

                                     chang
                         its always been a source of deep 
                         regret but the mountains 
                         surrounding us have made reception 
                         almost impossible

                                     george
                         in that event we better make 
                         arrangements to get some porters 
                         immediately some means to get us 
                         back to civilization

                                     chang
                         are you so certain you are away 
                         from it

                                     george
                         as far away as i ever want to be

                                     chang
                         oh dear

                                     lovett
                         of course the porters will be 
                         very well paid  that is within 
                         reason

                                     chang
                         im afraid that wouldnt help you 
                         see we have no porters here

                                     lovett
                         no porters here

                                     chang
                         no

                         what about those men we met this 
                         morning

                                     chang
                         yes those are our own people 
                         they never venture beyond the point 
                         where you were met this morning 
                         it is much too hazardous

               close shot  conway

               to intercut with above speech

               he has remained quiet throughout the scene apparently 
               interested only in a paper in front of him upon which he 
               has been writing

               insert what has been occupying conways interest it is a 
               picture of chang which he has been listlessly drawing

                                     barnard
                         how do you account for all this 
                         who brought it in

               they all turn to chang expectantly

                                     chang
                         oh yes there is a tribe of porters 
                         some five hundred miles from here 
                         that is our only contact with the 
                         outside world every now and again 
                         depending upon favorable weather 
                         of course they make the journey

                                     george
                         how can we get in touch with them

                                     chang
                         in that respect you are exceedingly 
                         fortunate we are expecting a 
                         shipment from them almost any time 
                         now—

                         what exactly do you mean by almost 
                         any time now

                                     chang
                         well weve been expecting this 
                         particular shipment for the past 
                         two years

                         yes

               barnard and lovett look shocked george starts to say 
               something but the words choke in his throat

                                     chang
                         but i can assure you gentlemen 
                         if there is a prolonged delay 
                         shangrila will endeavor to make 
                         your stay as pleasant as possible
                              rising

                         is getting late i do hope you all 
                         sleep well good night

               the servants move his chair back before he goes however 
               he turns to conway

                                     chang
                         good night mr conway

               conway a little surprised at the distinction in his behalf 
               nods

                                     conway
                         good night sir

               chang exits there is a hushed silence following changs 
               departure

                                     lovett
                         thats what i mean  mysterious 
                         mr conway i dont like that man 
                         hes too vague

                         it seems to me we should be 
                         grateful we were in a bad mess 
                         this morning
                              a wave of his hand
                         after all this is quite pleasant 
                         why not make ourselves comfortable 
                         until the porters do arrive

               while he was speaking the muted strains of a violin float 
               into the room conway rises

                         george ive been putting things 
                         together do you notice the 
                         resemblance between those natives 
                         and the pilot and why did those 
                         clothes materialize so conveniently 
                         when they met us at the plane 
                         chang himself just said that they 
                         never venture beyond that point 
                         what brought them there unless it 
                         was to meet us

                         there must be some connection 
                         between the plane and this place 
                         they must have deliberately brought 
                         us here why bob what reason 
                         could they have for doing a thing 
                         like that

                         moderation we preach the virtue

                         natives we rule with moderate 
                         strictness and in return we are 
                         satisfied with moderate obedience 
                         as a result our people are

                         why we have no crime here what 
                         makes a criminal  lack usually

                         to possess something owned by

                         only very rarely you see it would

                         well in that event it would be

                         youd be surprised my dear conway 
                         how a little courtesy all around 
                         helps to smooth out the most 
                         complicated problems

               shaped and except for a piano a harp and several chairs 
               is otherwise sparsely furnished at the extreme end the 
               room is set off by an alcove of stained glass extending 
               from the ceiling to the floor where it finishes with a 
               deep window seat at the piano we see an old man  and by 
               his side is the girl conway saw last night they finish 
               playing and both laugh heartily

                         at some time in the future you 
                         will have the pleasure of meeting 
                         her

               conway turns for one last glimpse of the girl and then 
               turns to chang looking up at his face puzzled and amused

                         some man had better get ready to

                         books instruments sculpture  do 
                         you mean to say they were all

                         porters

                                     chang

                         know it we do not buy or sell or 
                         seek personal fortunes because 
                         well because there is no uncertain

                         our valley is very rich in a metal 
                         called gold which fortunately for 
                         us is valued very highly in the

                         i see gold for ideas you know 
                         mr chang theres something so 
                         simple and naive about all of this 
                         that i suspect there has been a 
                         shrewd guiding intelligence 
                         somewhere whose idea was it how 
                         did it all start

                                     chang
                         that my dear conway is the story 
                         of a remarkable man

                                     conway
                         who

                                     chang
                         a belgian priest by the name of 
                         father perrault the first european 
                         to find this place and a very 
                         great man indeed he is responsible 
                         for everything you see here he 
                         built shangrila taught our 
                         natives and began our collection 
                         of art in fact shangrila is 
                         father perrault

                                     conway
                         when was all this

                                     chang
                         oh let me see  way back in 1713 
                         i think it was that father perrault 
                         stumbled into the valley half 
                         frozen to death it was typical of 
                         the man that one leg being frozen 
                         and of course there being no doctors 
                         here he amputated the leg himself

                                     conway
                              shocked
                         he amputated his own leg

                                     chang
                         yes oddly enough later when he 
                         had learned to understand their 
                         language the natives told him he 
                         could have saved his leg it would 
                         have healed without amputation

                                     conway
                         well they didnt actually mean 
                         that

                                     chang
                         yes yes they were very sincere 
                         about it too you see a perfect 
                         body in perfect health is the rule 
                         here theyve never known anything 
                         different so what was true for 
                         them they thought would naturally 
                         be true for anyone else living 
                         here

                                     conway
                         well is it

                                     chang
                         rather astonishingly so yes and 
                         particularly so in the case of 
                         father perrault himself do you 
                         know when he and the natives were 
                         finished building shangrila he 
                         was 108 years old and still very 
                         active in spite of only having 
                         one leg

                                     conway
                         108 and still active

                                     chang
                         youre startled

                                     conway
                         oh no just a little bowled over 
                         thats all

                                     chang
                         forgive me i should have told you 
                         it is quite common here to live to 
                         a very ripe old age climate diet 
                         mountain water you might say but 
                         we like to believe it is the absence 
                         of struggle in the way we live in 
                         your countries on the other hand 
                         how often do you hear the 
                         expression he worried himself to 
                         death or this thing or that 
                         killed him

                                     conway
                         very often

                                     chang
                         and very true your lives are 
                         therefore as a rule shorter not 
                         so much by natural death as by 
                         indirect suicide

                                     conway
                              after a pause
                         thats all very fine if it works 
                         out a little amazing of course

                                     chang
                         why mr conway you surprise me

                                     conway
                         i surprise you now thats news

                                     chang
                         i mean your amazement i could 
                         have understood it in any of your 
                         companions but you  who have 
                         dreamed and written so much about 
                         better worlds or is it that you 
                         fail to recognize one of your own 
                         dreams when you see it

                                     conway
                         mr chang if you dont mind i 
                         think ill go on being amazed  in 
                         moderation of course

                                     chang
                              chuckles
                         then everything is quite all right 
                         isnt it

               starts running george levels his revolver and sends a 
               stream of bullets after the fleeing servant who 
               miraculously manages to skate around a corner unharmed 
               conway runs into scene reaching george and with a quick 
               flip of his left hand he smacks him over his revolver arm  
               and with his right he punches him flush on the jaw

                                     conway
                         george you idiot

               conway pockets the gun and bending over george a pained 
               expression on his face starts to lift him

                         say conway is it true about us

               camera quickly swings over to the nethermost corner of the 
               room where scarcely visible sits an old man of 
               indeterminate age in the gloom only the outlines of his 
               pale and wrinkled face can be seen it yields an effect of

                         at shangrila since your arrival

                         personally ive enjoyed your 
                         community very much but my friends 
                         do not care for this mystery they 
                         are determined to leave as soon 
                         as—

               while he has been speaking his eyes have been gradually 
               taking in the details of the old man the camera quickly 
               follows his gaze  to crutches leaning against the mans 
               throne  then looking down to his legs one of which 
               appears to have been amputated

                         an admirer of yours for a great 
                         many years

               conway evinces surprise

                         oh not of conway the empirebuilder 
                         and public hero i wanted to meet 
                         the conway who in one of his books 
                         said there are moments in every 
                         mans life when he glimpses the 
                         eternal

               the quotation captures conways interest  and his eyes 
               widen

                         that conway seemed to belong here 
                         in fact it was suggested that 
                         someone be sent to bring him here

                                     conway
                         that i be brought here who had 
                         that brilliant idea

                         of course i have suspected that 
                         our being here is no accident 
                         furthermore i have a feeling that 
                         were never supposed to leave but 
                         that for the moment doesnt 
                         concern me greatly ill meet that 
                         when it comes what particularly 
                         interests me at present is why 
                         was i brought here what possible 
                         use can i be to an already thriving 
                         community

                         we need men like you here to be 
                         sure that our community will 
                         continue to thrive in return for 
                         which shangrila has much to give 
                         you you are still by the worlds 
                         standards a youngish man yet in 
                         the normal course of existence 
                         you can expect twenty or thirty 
                         years of gradually diminishing 
                         activity here however in shangri
                         la by our standards your life has 
                         just begun and may go on and on

                         but to be candid father a 
                         prolonged future doesnt excite 
                         me it would have to have a point 
                         ive sometimes doubted whether 
                         life itself has any and if that 
                         is so then long life must be even 
                         more pointless no id need a 
                         much more definite reason for going 
                         on and on

                         we have reason it is the entire 
                         meaning and purpose of shangrila 
                         it came to me in a vision long 
                         long ago i saw all the nations 
                         strengthening not in wisdom but 
                         in the vulgar passions and the 
                         will to destroy i saw their machine 
                         power multiply until a single 
                         weaponed man might match a whole 
                         army i foresaw a time when man 
                         exulting in the technique of murder 
                         would rage so hotly over the world 
                         that every book every treasure 
                         would be doomed to destruction 
                         this vision was so vivid and so 
                         moving that i determined to gather 
                         together all the things of beauty 
                         and culture that i could and 
                         preserve them here against the 
                         doom toward which the world is 
                         rushing
                              pause
                         look at the world today is there 
                         anything more pitiful  what madness 
                         there is what blindness what 
                         unintelligent leadership a 
                         scurrying mass of bewildered 
                         humanity crashing headlong against 
                         each other propelled by an orgy 
                         of greed and brutality the time 
                         must come my friend when this 
                         orgy will spend itself when 
                         brutality and the lust for power 
                         must perish by its own sword 
                         against that time is why i avoided 
                         death and am here and why you 
                         were brought here for when that 
                         day comes the world must begin to 
                         look for a new life and it is our 
                         hope that they may find it here 
                         for here we shall be with their 
                         books and their music and a way of 
                         life based on one simple rule be 
                         kind
                              pause
                         when that day comes it is our 
                         hope that the brotherly love of 
                         shangrila will spread throughout 
                         the world
                              pause
                         yes my son when the strong have 
                         devoured each other the christian 
                         ethic may at last be fulfilled 
                         and the meek shall inherit the 
                         earth

               a long silence ensues during which conway so engrossed is 
               he in all he has just heard scarcely notices the lama 
               who has risen slowly and now stands before him the lama 
               reaches down and gently touches him on the shoulder

                                     conway
                              scarcely audible

                         night

               expression of deep absorption

               leading to the garden lovett emerges from one of the rooms 
               and sees him he beckons to those inside and almost 
               immediately they come out and start toward conway

               conway is walking along a street in the valley it is a 
               quaint thoroughfare unlike anything we have ever seen 
               before the small onestory huts along its very narrow 
               sidewalk are of singularly varied architecture  giving 
               the impression of being homemade  as a result of this 
               no two are alike only one characteristic about them is 
               similar  their cleanliness something about the atmosphere 
               is fresh and wholesome and peaceful in front of several 
               of the huts native women sit  some weaving on a tapestry 
               board some nursing babies some asleep and some just 
               sitting the keynote is contentment

               street conway finally arrives at a garden spot the 
               suddenness of this is startling too  because of its 
               beauty sighing contentedly conway throws himself at the 
               foot of an overhanging tree and leans against the trunk

               he throws his head back shuts his eyes  in a restful and 
               contemplative mood he remains this way quietly for a few 
               seconds when he is attracted by the singing of a chorus 
               of childrens voices he glances around

               in hand amongst the sculpted shrubbery and rows of flowers 
               there is a sudden pealing of bells the two of them look 
               off and pause their gaze momentarily captured by 
               picturesque snowcapped peaks in the distance

                              when they break
                         ive thought about it for years
                              softly
                         i knew youd come and i knew if 
                         you did  youd never leave
                              a whisper
                         am i forgiven for sending for you

                         forgiven
                              a pause
                         you know when we were on that 
                         plane i was fascinated by the way 
                         its shadow followed it that silly 
                         shadow racing along over mountains 
                         and valleys covering ten times 
                         the distance of the plane it was 
                         always there to greet us with 
                         outstretched arms when we landed 
                         and ive been thinking that somehow 
                         youre that plane and im that 
                         silly shadow that all my life 
                         ive been rushing up and down hills 
                         leaping rivers crashing over 
                         obstacles never dreaming that one 
                         day that beautiful thing in flight 
                         would land on this earth and into 
                         my arms

                         we got here apparently its worked 
                         with some people perhaps its 
                         because they lack the courage to 
                         do anything about it but not me 
                         chang youre up against the wrong

               he stares uncertainly for a long while with a slow 
               realization that the high lama is dead quite unaware that 
               he is being moved emotionally tears well up in his eyes 
               while still sitting this way unable to stir he becomes 
               conscious of activity around him

               faced at the lama then in intervals of seconds groups 
               of lamas hitherto unseen enter softly and silently and 
               gather around the high lama we hear indistinguishable 
               murmurs that might or might not be prayers conway is only 
               vaguely aware of their presence  and after a few moments 
               scarcely conscious of what is actuating his movements he 
               drifts away from the murmuring lamas and walks in the

               conway stands in front of a window  his arms extended 
               across  peering out moodily he is watching a solemn and 
               slowmoving procession of torchlightbearers  the funeral 
               rites of the high lama  accompanied by cermonial music 
               and drumbeating

               george appears in the doorway he looks around and espies 
               conway for a moment he stands uncertainly and finally 
               enters

                                     george

               as conway turns  and seeing him evinces no emotion 
               whatsoever

                                     conway
                              a murmur
                         hello george

               george looks at him peculiarly conways behavior is odd 
               in view of their strained relationship

                                     george

                              running his hand

               as he says this he jumps to his feet george is startled 
               by his tone and manner

                                     conway

                                     conway
                              strongly
                         because you cant do you know 
                         what will happen to her if she 
                         leaves shangrila shes a fragile

                         out of this valley and shell fade

                         this would be funny  if it wasnt 
                         so pathetic why she isnt a day 
                         over twenty

                                     conway

                         probably one of the few decent

                              cynically
                         so everyone is serenely happy in 
                         shangrila nobody would ever think 
                         of leaving

                         its all just so much rot shes 
                         pleaded with me ever since i came 
                         here to take her away from this 
                         awful place shes cried in my 
                         arms for hours for fear id leave 
                         her behind and whats more shes 
                         made two trips to the plateau to 
                         bribe the porters  for me

                                     conway
                              doesnt want to

               as he speaks he has crossed to door leading to adjoining 
               room conways eyes are glued on him

                                     george
                         come in a minute

               after a few seconds maria appears in the doorway and stands 
               there timidly

                                     george

                         maria my brother and i have decided 
                         we cant take you along

               marias face collapses

                                     maria
                              small frightened 
                              voice

               she rushes to george and throws her arms around him

                                     maria
                         but you promised me you promised 
                         to take me with you

               over her shoulder george looks victoriously at conway who 
               cannot believe his ears suddenly maria wheels on conway

                                     maria
                         its all your fault it was all 
                         arranged until he spoke to you 
                         why cant you leave us alone

                                     conway
                         do you mean to tell me you want to 
                         leave shangrila

                                     maria

                         another minute ive waited a long 
                         time for this chance to go and 
                         youre not going to stop me now

                         i thought the porters had 
                         instructions from the high lama 
                         not to take anyone

                                     maria
                         the high lama who pays any

                         and finally he disappeared over 
                         that very mountain pass that they 
                         themselves dared not travel

               as their glasses come together  camera moves up to a close
               up of them  and as the music starts  the picture

                                                           dissolves to

               moving in front of conway  as he walks forward with a 
               steady step  his head held high  his eyes sparkling  
               snow pelting his face

               over his silhouetted back

               as he walks away from the camera and we stay with him a 
               long time as he approaches a hill

                                                            dissolve to

               another long shot

               he has now ascended to the middle of the steep hill  his 
               gait unchanged the camera pans up to the summit of the 
               incline  and we see that beyond it the horizon is filled 
               with a strange warm light conways figure  in silhouette  
               disappears over the hill  bells ring  and as the music 
               begins to swell

                                                               fade out
