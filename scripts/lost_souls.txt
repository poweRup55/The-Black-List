            screenplay by 
            pierce gardner





            fade in on

            black screen

            sound os  a choked back breath gasping lungs looking for
            air the struggle for life and we 

                                                            flashcut to

            int limbowater  another time

            gasping for breath continues more relentless harder
            heavier and into the frame we see fragments slowed into
            special motion dreamlike surreal

            dirty blonde hair lifts and tumbles 

            bubbles pop through the murky water 

            a hand and then its attached arm swims in trouble trying to
            climb

            and then floats as if disembodied momentary

            the swimmer drifts then a brief effort twisting signs of
            struggle

            a leg pushes off the nothingness threatened an impossible
            fight

            and the claustrophobic gasp a last chocked back breath as
            other sounds begin to bleed in the crackle of a radio a few
            voices murmuring and then more clearly 

                                womans voice os
                      jesus please jesus

            the water blurs opaque into a murky veil of illusion and we

                                                            dissolve to

            int ford fiesta  morning

            the cracked windshield of a blue ford fiesta  the clouded
            form of the drowning swimmer is replaced by a small plastic
            dayglo cross that sways as the fiesta is lifted up on a tow
            truck hoist  a paramedic jogs over to the car as

                                paramedic os
                      hold it hold on

            the fiesta stops its ascent  the passenger side door opens
            and the paramedic reaches in and snares the bopping cross

            ext city street  morning

            the paramedic carries the plastic symbol over to a middle
            aged woman whos sitting on a stretcher wearing a foam neck
            brace and looking totally relaxed  this minor fenderbender
            is an ignored sideshow on a quiet commercial street

            as the woman reclaims her crucifix a lanky man strides by
            overcoated against the fall weather  we follow the man as
            he rounds the corner

            ext another city street  morning

            and as he walks on he gazes out at a small catholic church
            ahead

            st ursulas is a modest seminary sitting adjacent to the
            church  and just in front behind a chain link fence is

            an asphalt playground used by the churchs preschool
            program  a group of children play there in happy confusion
            watched by two female daycare workers

            ext playground  morning

            one of the daycare workers alternately pushes two kids on
            the swings using one hand  in her other hand she holds a
            cigarette  her clothes are worn her sneakers frayed  a
            simple gold cross hangs loosely from her neck  shes got
            ancient holes in her ear lobes from another earlier time
            but no longer any earrings  this is maya larkin  the kids
            shes pushing are singing frere jacques as they soar up and
            down on the swings  

            the second daycare worker more nicely dressed shoots maya
            disapproving glances as she gives her swinging child modest
            pushes  

            a latino boy walks up to maya both his shoes are untied and
            his jackets unzipped  he points to his feet

                                maya
                          with mock severity
                      look at you

            she moves away from the swings puts out the cigarette and
            stoops down tying his shoes  after she finishes maya
            watches him run back into the throng  he dashes past the
            lanky man standing just ten feet away  a powerful figure
            claude lareaux is in his sixties  a stern heavy expression
            glances his face 
            maya stands back up slowly looking at him a more serious
            expression on her face now  she tosses her cigarette as we

                                                           smash cut to

            ext rural road  morning

            a nondescript chrysler new yorker as it winds its way down a
            rural road

            int chrysler moving  morning

            the cars driver is a fleshy man in his forties named john
            townsend  hes anxious a nailbiter with the worn hands of
            a worker  townsends slightly nervewracked but trying to
            settle it all inside

            maya touches a forefinger across her upper lip warm she
            moves forward covering heat vents with a cupped hand
            uncomfortable then finally flipping off the heat altogether
            which makes a final whooshing gasp  she powers open the
            electronic window a rough hum as

            close on

            lareaux in the back seat watching her  seated next to
            lareaux is a dark haired kind looking man in his 30s
            jeremy

            maya straightens the cuffs of her shirt sleeves  first the
            right then the left  then she repeats it all  townsend
            notes the repetitive movement

            and the radio is on in the bg

                                radio dj 1
                      so it says here in todays news that
                      science is looking for a lost minute of
                      daylight

                                radio dj 2
                      yeah whats that all about  they have
                      satellites now that can read our atm
                      receipts from outer space but no one
                      knows how we lost a minute of sunlight

                                radio dj 1
                      when they find that minute

            townsend flips off the radio  there is an excruciatingly
            loud pause as everyone in the car sits quietly  then maya
            turns sideways leaning towards the backseat and whispers to
            lareaux

                                maya
                          muffled by roar of passing
                           truck
                      why are you doing this to me

                                lareaux
                      i know maya but youll understand when
                      you see this man  i really need your
                      strength

            maya silently acknowledges his remark

                                lareaux contd
                          subbed in french
                      ensemble pour toujours quio quil
                      arrive

            maya reaches over putting a soft hand on townsends knee

                                maya
                      good seeing you again

                                townsend
                      whish the circumstances were different

            as maya turns back around in her seat lareaux looks up sees
            townsends dart of worry in the rear view

            ext kings county mental hospital  morning

            lareaux his overcoat open walks down the dim corridor  we
            now see hes a priest  hes wearing a black cassock with a
            waisthigh surplice belt and a narrow purple stole  he
            carries a bible  townsend maya and jeremy are right beside
            him  we see jeremy is also a priest  townsend is carrying a
            hard black leather suitcase

            large windows bordered by huge pillars circumscribe the
            neverending corridors  thick doors line the walls each
            with a tiny observation window filled in with octagonal wire
            patterns  the foursome avoids looking directly at any of
            those windows

            they pass other rooms doors wide open lined with several
            beds each separated by worn curtains

            intext second corridor  morning

            sitting next to a door on this corridor is the hospitals
            chief resident psychiatrist dr leslie allen  shes casual
            calm and intelligent  a mature woman in her late 50s still
            attractive at peace with herself  as she sips a cup of
            peppermint tea she glances outside through a window
            opposite her chair at a huge old tree the antithesis of the
            sterile prisonlike environment inside  she finds ways to
            remain grounded in this place

            as lareaux and company approach dr allen switches her gaze
            and

            int patients room  morning

            the room has been painted hot pink  the only furniture is a
            large table a chair and a bed  a few books sit stacked on
            the table albert beutels cryptology george flecks shaping
            space and claude shannons seminal mathematical theory of
            communication among others on advanced math

            a slightly round man named henry birdson is seated in the
            single restraining chair compulsively writing numbers on a
            yellow legal pad  he wears green hospital pants and tshirt

            he looks up and smiles at all his visitors a blinding angry
            smile

                                birdson
                      how do you like the color in here
                          glancing over barred windows
                      sposed to be relaxing

            maya and townsend avoid looking at birdson  maya straightens
            the cuffs of her sleeves  lareaux puts his bible and a small
            crucifix on the table

                                lareaux
                      hello henry  do you know why were
                      here

            birdson nods pleased with himself  he stretches languidly
            drops his pad onto the table and yawns

                                birdson
                      looking forward to it  do you have a

            confined space  cheesy lace curtains drape across plexi
            sliding windows a soft and constant whispering of the our
            father in the bg and we see a younger lareaux longer
            hair moving gracefully toward maya

            subtitled in latin

            screaming continues  mayas on a bed her head jerks

                      but deliver us from evil

            a crucifix follows its own shadow as we

                                                       crosscut back to

            int patients room  morning

            townsend opens the black leather suitcase  inside rolls of
            duct and masking tape two bibles three rosaries a
            scapular bottles of holy water and a gold chalice sitting
            in foamladen velvet for the communion eucharist

            maya quickly and expertly locks in birdsons chair
            restraints  arms and legs

            father jeremy pulls out a roll of duct tape sealing the desk
            drawer shut  then he sets up a portable tape recorder on
            the table  secures that as well

            birdson restrained maya pulls large squarecut pieces of
            blackout cloth out of the suitcase  she grabs a roll of
            masking tape tearing two pieces of it with her teeth right
            off the roll  a searing jarring sound unexpected every
            time  moving to the door she immediately tapes a square of
            blackout cloth over the observation window  as the cloth
            drops dr allens face disappears

            maya tears several more pieces of masking tape continuing to
            block out each window

            int hospital corridor

            two hours later dr allen is reassuring one of her patients 
            shes calm focused helpful

                                patient
                          pointing to his stomach

                      open cant you see it  my stomachs
                      been eviscerated

            suddenly an orderly bursts around the corner sprinting
            toward her

            int hospital corridor

            dr allen and the orderly are jogging down the hallway  the
            sound of screaming can be faintly heard in the distance

            dr allen starts to run leaving her patient holding her
            stethoscope and pocket for anything that might fall out  her
            breathing is slightly labored  her patient screams after
            her

                                patient
                          freaked

                      help me

            int hospital corridor

            a stunned laura allen stands outside birdsons room as two
            more orderlies frantically try to pry open the door

                                dr allen

            from the room a chorus of tormented voices is heard  a
            hideous cacophony that builds in intensity with each passing
            moment punctuated by sharp explosions of wood and glass

            it sounds like the room is being torn to pieces  along with
            everyone in it

            something heavy hits the door on the other side

                      thanks for having me sally

                                sally
                      peter youre now writing a book about
                      the viznick case  you seem to be making
                      a career of studying sensational
                      murderers  i have to ask how does it
                      make you feel when you sit in courtrooms
                      day after day face to face with alleged
                      killers

                                peter
                      well longterm exposure to things like
                      this tends to give you a sort of
                      clinical understanding of the subject 
                      after awhile you begin to make friends
                      with it so to speak

                                sally
                      its as if you are saying the closer you
                      get to evil the less evil it becomes

                                peter
                      no the less mystifying  good and evil
                      are only illusions  there is no such
                      thing as evil with a capital e  that
                      suggests some third party bad guy
                      pulling all the strings

                                sally
                          a bit mesmerized
                      youre referring to the defenses
                      efforts to prove that george viznick is
                      tormented by demonic voices

                                peter
                      there werent any voices

                                sally
                      not even from some mental illness as
                      the prosecution asserts

                                peter
                      as if theres another cause for little
                      voices  no sally viznicks a
                      manipulator hes clever he has what i
                      call malignant narcissism

                                sally
                      what do you mean by that

                                peter
                      well we all have a degree of
                      narcissism sally but a malignant
                      narcissist is dangerously selfobsessed

                                sally
                      are you saying hes legally sane

                                peter
                      well george viznick is in the grayest
                      of gray areas in the sanity spectrum 
                      viznick is not psychotic 
                      hes simply unable to submit to any
                      higher authority

                                sally
                      meaning viznicks a man who answers to
                      no one  not even god

                                peter
                          steps ahead of her
                      right  if you believe in god  as a
                      narcissist viznick couldnt blame
                      himself for the alleged murders  he
                      created the voices after the fact  in
                      order to avoid the simple truth that
                      there is no outside force that guides
                      george viznick and that george viznick
                      needs to pay

                                sally
                          personally interested
                      and what about you  what about peter
                      kelson  where is your moral compass

            peter is momentarily serious interior then the brief slight
            smile

                                peter
                      well lucky for me im not on trial
                      sally  however i like to think im the
                      actual needle on the compass  morality
                      is which way youre facing  the needle
                      always points north

            sally smiles a sucker for that sort of crap

            lining the road move by in a sort of blurred landscape

            peter resumes driving mildly irritated

                                claire
                          getting back to the

                      its great of you to let william and

                      its susans cooking claire  thats
                      why uncle james lets them stay

                                father james

                      well if peter here would hop off his
                      laurels long enough to marry you

            at the wheel peter gazes straight out at the road  no
            expression  but he cringes inwardly

                                claire
                          interrupting for peters sake
                      you wearing a watch father

                                father james

                      can you check the century hand for me 
                      mine seems to be ahead

            james laughs  peter shakes his head  the notion of
            commitment more private to him that to his more expansive
            uncle  claire inadvertently glances at peter then she looks
            out her window an awkward inward moment

            impressive dinner awaits them  they take their places behind
            their respective chairs  a routine  buzz of conversation

            susan moves in carefully balancing a few ceramic platters
            and then she bends over the table squeezing the last plate
            onto a huge wooden table already covered with plates of
            various food  then she sits down herself  takes a little
            breath

                                susan

                          to peter
                      peter in life you should never deny
                      the giver the pleasure of the gift
                          amused to claire
                      all those years raising him  they seem
                      to have had absolutely no effect  now
                      william at least he listened to me

                                william
                      lets eat already

            father james bows his head and immediately the family
            follows  a signaled almost unconscious gesture known to
            everyone  they all look down except peter  claire gives him
            an annoyed glance

                                father james
                      bless us oh lord for these thy gifts

                      father jack in whose memory we gather
                      here every year  may their souls and
                      the souls of the faithfully departed
                      rest in peace  amen

            a stark silence as peter and william remember  claire looks
            at susan  then

                                peter
                      hey will remember that dream i used to

                      you know right after

                      recurring dreams are never
                      insignificant

                                peter
                      okay ill tell you  im reading a book
                       i cant remember what the book is when
                      i wake up  but i realize halfway
                      through its something ive written  or
                      will write  anyway i get to the end of
                      the book and im feeling very satisfied
                      and i close the cover to read the title
                      and it only says xes  three
                      letters  for some reason that makes me
                      feel great and i wake up

                                claire
                          looking around at the silenced
                           table holding back a smirk a
                           moment then
                      peter xes is sex spelled
                      backwards

            more silence then james bursts out laughing  then susan
            cant gold it back and then william

                                peter
                          looks around big smile
                           turning into laughter
                      what can i say  im not a master of the
                      obvious

            and that sends everyone into an uncontrollable fit of
            laughter and as theyre all in various states of choked back
            hysterics suddenly williams laughing becomes seriously
            uncontrolled and then

            williams head involuntarily jerks backward his eyes begin
            to roll up

            susan is first to notice while laughter continues in the
            bg and she leaps to catch him

            as william starts to tip over backward in his chair peter
            then realizes and together susan and peter ease william onto
            the floor and turn him on his side

            james grabs a pillow from an armchair in the room shoving it
            under williams head and

            as williams epileptic attack winds down slightly susan
            looks up at james

                                susan
                      its been a long time since his last
                      seizure  i guess weve got to adjust
                      his medication again

            int seminary hallway  night

            the shadowy figures of maya and john townsend can be seen
            almost in silhouette

                                townsend
                      and what are you thinking we should do
                      now

                                maya
                      ive filed a report with father frank

                                townsend
                      a lot of good thatll do

                                maya
                      we need all the help we can get

                                townsend
                      ive dealt with these people before
                      maya  theyre not going to help us

                                maya
                      well see father frank in the morning 
                      theres nothing to be done until then

                                townsend
                          on edge
                      alright maya  well do it your way

            int seminary chapel  night

            a troubled john townsend prays to god for answers

            int seminary office  early morning

            father frank a sweetfaced priest in his 40s is conferring
            with two church officials  we track him as he exits the
            office and cross through to

            int altar  continuous

            a janitor polishes the marble of the ornate altar  father
            frank enters and pauses a moment to watch the man at work

                                father frank
                      dont forget to polish the brass
                      afterwards

            ext seminary garden  continuous

            the seminary has a small planted meditative garden shoe
            horned in behind the rectory buildings

            maya sits on a simple wooden bench her tiny cross glinting
            off sunlight  her eyes are closed and her head is tilted up
            toward the sun

            maya snaps out of her reverie as father frank approaches

                                father frank
                          kind but resolved
                      maya the diocese has rejected your
                      report  and i must say i agree with
                      them

            a jet roars overhead deafening momentary noise  father
            frank looks up a moment then

                                father frank contd
                          comforting tone
                      i dont mean to belittle you but weve
                      been through this before  satan is not
                      what you think he is  satan is not some
                      creature

                                maya
                      you werent there  give me time to get
                      some proof

                                father frank
                      please maya  im trying to get us into
                      the next century and you insist on this
                      medieval nonsense

                                maya
                      if you really believe in god why is it
                      so inconceivable that his enemy is just
                      as real

                                father frank
                      maya for the last time i will not
                      tolerate these obsessions

            anxious maya rubs her cross between a thumb and forefinger
            distractedly

            int seminary stairwell  early morning

            maya crosses through the dim hallway and heads up the stairs

            int seminary bathroom  continuous

            a bright clean bathroom with new fixtures and fluorescent
            lights  maya comes in trying to contain her frustration 
            turns the water on  she watches the water a moment  then
            puts her hands in  cool on her wrists  splashes her face

                                maya
                          despairing
                      stupid man  i cant do this

            at that moment she hears something  its faint but
            unmistakable  the sound of scraping metal on metal  then it
            stops  

                                maya contd
                      hello

            no response

            angle from above

            maya faces all six stalls  she walks to the first one
            pushes open the door  its empty  she repeats this at the
            second stall the thirds the fourth the fifth  all are
            vacant  now the last one  she pauses just a second

            the lights hum  she pushes it open  its empty  disturbed
            she turns back to the sink and as she looks down the water
            flows instantly backwards disappearing up into the faucet

            she turns back again watching the room change from pristine
            to rotting decay  the stalls behind her have changed  the
            doors are closed again  theyre battered chipped scarred 
            rusty water flows from underneath  she whirls around  on
            the stall directly behind her the letters x e and s
            have been scratched into the metal in loose flowing script 
            at the same time the lights go dim  the hum is uneven more
            menacing  alarmed maya closes her eyes then opens them 
            the vision remains  her breathing gets lighter faster 
            fingers appear on the top of the stall door behind her  the
            door is pulled open  a man in inside wearing hospital
            clothes  its henry birdson  his eyes bore into hers  hes
            got a knife in his right hand  petrified she stares back

                                maya contd
                      youre not real

            he leers and nods yes i am  he steps toward her  every
            instinct in her body screams at her to run  but she stays
            put  and we hear a choked back breath and birdson slowly
            extends his knife just inches from her face

            closer to her face  then closer still  until the tip of the
            blade is slowly creeping toward mayas eye  

            ecu

            of the tip of the blade literally millimeters from her
            pupil  closing painfully slow  maya braces herself

            ecu

            of the tip of the knife now only a hair away  

            angle on

            birdson  he smiles  and thrusts  she suddenly reaches up
            and grabs for the blade  the lights flare horrifyingly
            bright for a split second  we hear a surreal distortion of
            mayas voice crying out

            and birdson vanishes  mayas looking at a pristine
            bathroom its unmarked stall doors pulled tight  victorious
            but drained she slumps forward

            int lareauxs room  morning

            inside father lareauxs spartan room at the seminary lareaux
            lies in bed his face turned towards the wall  hes
            mumbling  maya has pulled herself together and sits by the
            bed with father jeremy and an irritated father frank 
            in the bg john townsend is urgently riffling the books and
            papers on lareauxs desk  most of which we see are about
            demonic possession

            unknown to anyone townsend slides two of the books under his
            coat

                                father frank
                          to maya
                      leave him alone

            maya doesnt want to hear that  she leans closer  the full
            wound of her childhood pressed back into her eyes

                                maya
                          compassionately
                      father its me maya  tu mentends

            lareaux rolls over and looks at her  the change in his
            appearance is shocking  his eyes are redrimmed and his
            expression is unfocused

                                lareaux
                          with a nursery rhyme cadence
                      the ark sank the sun set the ark
                      sank again

                                maya
                      father im right here

                                lareaux
                          like a child
                      the ark sank the sun set the ark
                      sank again

            his eyes are wild  father frank turns to maya

                                father james
                      hes not going to respond

            maya slowly backs away

                                father frank
                      the doctors concerned he may never come
                      out of this dementia

                                maya
                      he will  he has great faith

                                father frank
                      but bad judgement  and now you see how
                      dangerous the consequences can be

            maya moves over to a silent john townsend

                                maya
                      john  ive got to head back to the
                      city
                          to father jeremy

                      whatsoever
                          maya hurriedly writes her
                           pager number down for jeremy
                      anything okay

                                father jeremy
                          under his breath
                      i wish i could help

            maya smiles sweetly at father jeremy

            int seminary hallway  morning

            maya and townsend confer down the hall from lareauxs room

                                townsend
                      its uselesslook at him

                                maya

                      to be sure

                                townsend
                          agitated
                      sure of what  who cares if this guy is
                      devoid of faith or sleeps over a
                      pentacle  results are what lareaux
                      would want

            maya stares intently at townsend  father jeremy approaches
            from down the hall aware of the tension between them

                                townsend contd
                      you dont want to face it

            townsend walks away

                      is he going to be okay

            a list of names all doctors  some have bene crossed off 
            and as we pull back we see mayas on the phone on a bedford
            main drag and as she dials she pivots in the booth anxious
            thought process a pencil being lobbed between two fingers 
            suddenly a voice over the phone

                                maya

                      you bye

            maya crosses off another doctors name from her list  drops
            in two more quarters as several sit stacked by the phone

            maya glances around  as she checks her list tapping out
            another number she takes a deep breath as she sees

            a man walking his dog  the dog suddenly stops squats and
            takes a greasy shit right on the sidewalk  maya cant
            believe it wants to say something but the line picks up

                                maya contd

            out another number  maya bends the silver phone cord
            distractedly back and forth awhile and as the line picks
            back up

            intercut as necessary

                                peter
                      a narcissist doesnt admit it  its the
                      extreme of selfdenial

                                maya
                          ignoring peters comment
                      and i also believe in god and the devil 
                      in fact i know they exist

                                peter
                      well by saying that youre
                      acknowledging the existence of a higher
                      power  which to a narcissist is
                      impossible

                                maya
                      i murdered my parents mr kelson  and

                                maya
                      in the end the jury saw it my way

                                peter
                      well then it all seems to be working
                      out for you  listen ms

                      do you remember henry birdson  the math
                      professor who won the salwen medal then
                      went home and killed his family

                                peter
                          irritated
                      whats that got to do with you

                                maya
                      last week the catholic church certified
                      him as genuinely possessed  you realize
                      how rarely they make that ruling

                                peter
                      i do

                                maya
                      an exorcism was just held for birdson 
                      it failed  disastrously  which means
                      theres still a demonic spirit present
                      in his body
                          then
                      i was wondering perhaps youd like to
                      go meet henry  hes pretty amazing

                                peter
                      ill bet

                                maya
                      on television you seemed so sure of
                      yourself  if youre really that
                      confident youd be willing to let
                      someone prove you wrong

                                peter
                      the world would be so much simpler if it
                      were all just about good and evil 
                      unfortunately i find it much more
                      slippery and elusive place

                                maya
                          intrigued by peters mind
                      well i think its very simple  heres
                      a tape of birdsons exorcism
                          drops tape on peters desk
                      ill be at the public library  tomorrow
                      at 2 if you want to meet him

            maya rises and heads for the door  seductive  a certain
            power in her clarity

                                maya contd
                      i believe that murder and murderers are
                      the most interesting proving ground for
                      these kinds of questions  dont you

            peter knows he agrees but before he can respond shes gone

                                                           smash cut to

                          indicating noise
                      great sound  how the hell do you live
                      with that all day

            josef laughs politely he likes peter  peter presses the
            elevator button and waits sticking his free hand in a pocket
            and as he pulls out mayas tape he remembers as

            the bell to the elevator dings and the door slides open 
            peter inspects the tape with some curiosity then stuffs it
            back into his pocket momentarily lost in thought  stepping
            into the elevator he suddenly pulls in a breath startled

            but when peter reaches for the cart she waves him off with a
            deepening in her scowl that we dont want to see get any
            deeper  the elevator door slides shut

            int hallway  continuous

            peter puts the key in his door apartment 5a  glancing down
            the hall he sees mrs levotsky struggle toward her door  as

            int peters kitchen  continuous

            peter heads into the open kitchen  the flood lights on the
            outside cast strange distorted shadows of people moving 
            peter reaches down behind the refrigerator and fishes out a
            pack of cigarettes  he turns on the vent over the stove and
            lights up blowing the smoke directly up into the vent
            tapping the ashes directly down the sink drain  unseen by
            peter a cigarette ash drops and lands on the stove

            int peters living room  continuous

            peter reappears a moment later holding a bottle of beer 
            takes off his jacket laying it on top of the sofa  he moves
            over to the cd player where he flips on some contemporary
            music  then he takes a long swallow of beer and sits back
            down into the sofa

                                peter

            of green and yellow up to the orange and occasionally red
            indicating the volume is pushing complain

            in response mrs levotsky bangs on the wall a little harder

                                                            dissolve to

            close on

            wings of transparent green and yellow fabric  its locked in
            a tiny vice its barbed hook shining

            int peters living room

            peter all concentration is bent over a magnifying glass
            using two tiny precision hooks to wrap thread onto the lure 
            hes at a table in the corner of the living room  a colorful
            collection of finished lures are displayed on his work area
            below a watercolor of a man flyfishing

            peter gets frustrated as he repeatedly tries to hook a thread
            and misses  in the bg a leather framed photo of peter
            with his parents at an exquisite lake  peter pushes himself
            back from the table  takes a beat  walks over and picks up
            the tape maya gave him

            he studies it for a second  then he naps off the cd player
            puts the tape on the cassette deck and hits play  theres
            no sound  he turns the volume way up  theres a hum but
            nothing else  annoyed peter hits forward then play 
            still nothing  he pushes the volume to the top

                                peter
                          to himself

            is heard  mrs levotsky raises her cane in desperation

            int peters living room

            from this pov the tape continues to play soundlessly

            peter hears rapid pounding from mrs levotskys apartment 
            faster more frantic  the pictures on his wall shake
            violently

                                peter

            mrs levotskys pounding continues for some time  finally
            ending in a booming thud  peter looks up at the wall waits
            then smiles

            peter bends down to snap off the tape failing to notice that
            the lights on the equalizer are pushing high into the red on
            all channels  he turns off the tape and puts on a sonny
            rollins cd  the music begins at an earpiercing volume

            guard enters with a replacement outfit  viznick stands

            peter looks up and sees the shocked guard staring at
            viznicks bare back  its covered by an enormous tattoo
            depicting christ hanging upside down from the bottom of a
            cross pinned there by a nail through his feet  his dangling
            arms end in stumps  his severed hands are still nailed to
            the crossbar  the effect is horrific yet mesmerizing  as
            peter watches viznick puts on a shirt covering the tattoo
            and then sits with his back to peter  the cops and guard
            exit  peter moves closer to the glass

            maya and peter enter the room  followed by the orderly  a
            motionless birdson lies on his bed  eyes closed 
            his body curled backwards at a horribly severe angle and his
            arms are wrapped tightly around his torso  hes a gruesome
            sight  an iv tube is taped to his wrist and an eeg is
            attached to his head  the brain wave monitor indicates no
            activity

            a beaming dr allen walks in  shes a little starstruck

                                dr allen
                      mr kelson what a pleasure to meet you

                      criminally insane are impeccable  i am
                      a fan

                                peter
                      quite a compliment coming from you

            dr allen realizes mayas beside him

                                dr allen
                          to peter
                      when your secretary called she made no
                      mention of her coming too

                                peter
                          glancing at maya
                      my secretary

                                dr allen
                      youre aware that this woman was party
                      to the socalled exorcism

                                peter
                      no i wasnt actually

                                dr allen
                      you should know i never felt mr birdson
                      needed anything but professional
                      psychiatric care  and then minutes
                      after they left he suffered a stroke 
                      hes comatose  no brain wave activity
                      at all

            dr allen adjusts birdsons iv unit retaping an already
            swollen hand

                                peter
                      so you dont believe his condition is
                      the result of anything supernatural

                                dr allen
                      of course not  they put him through
                      severe mental stress  causing this
                      aneurysm

                                maya
                      dr allen could you please tell mr
                      kelson what you heard as you tried to
                      enter mr birdsons room

                                dr allen
                          ignoring maya
                      i certainly hope youre not lending any
                      credence to this

                                maya
                          aggressive
                      what did you hear

            peter looks at dr allen questioningly

                                dr allen
                      the patient was in great distress 
                      naturally he wasyelling

                                maya
                      and was he in distress when you opened
                      the door  or was he sitting here
                      relaxed at this table

                                dr allen
                          calmly
                      there is a medical explanation for
                      everything that happened

                                maya
                          boring in
                      you heard voices you know you did

            theres a silence in the room  dr allen stares at maya

                                orderly
                      it sounded like a hundred people to me

            maya peter and dr allen turn and look at the orderly 
            peters shocked by the orderlys admission  glances back at
            dr allen

                                dr allen
                      ive already said mr birdson was
                      agitated  victor why dont you go and
                      check on the patient in room 5

            her tone is frighteningly friendly  the orderly leaves 
            peter looks at maya then dr allen

                                peter
                          curious
                      just describe it to me the scene when
                      you came back

            as peter speaks maya has an uncomfortable feeling  she
            turns and sees birdson staring at her  eyes wide open 
            above him the monitors still showing no brain wave
            activity  he grins at her

                                maya
                      oh my god

            peter and dr allen turn quickly  as birdson snaps his eyes
            back shut

                                maya contd
                      he just woke up  hes awake

            what they see is a motionless man in exactly the same
            position as before  the monitors still showing nothing but
            steady horizontal waves

            dr allen shakes her head at mayas outburst  dismissive of
            her altogether and then to peter

                                dr allen
                      im surprised at you mr kelson  and
                      now im afraid im going to have to ask
                      the two of you to leave

            int range rover

            peter drives out the hospital gates  mayas with him  the
            radio is on  peters angry

                                peter
                      where do you get off pretending to be my
                      secretary

                      aneurysm and now hes in a coma

            maya doesnt answer  peter stops at a red light  a pick up
            truck full of teenagers with a young girl at the wheel radio
            blasting soul music pulls up next to them maya uses the
            moment to get out and walk quickly away  peter watches her
            go for a moment then stares at her paper coffee cup picks
            up his cell and dials a number

                      wherever theres room

            peter feels a tap on his shoulder  a waiter serving hors
            doeuvres is standing there

                      none for me thanks

            the waiter wipes the frame and as he does john townsend is
            revealed beads of sweat glistening on his brow and a gun in
            his hand

                                townsend
                          whispering
                      god will forgive me the time of
                      transformation is so near

            he points it at peters face  peter is in shock  everything
            around him seems to blur except the gun floating a few feet
            away  but townsend hesitates obviously conflicted

            and suddenly the woman to peters left screams  the
            waiters tray goes flying  with astonishing speed william
            flings himself onto townsend  they both go down  a shot
            rings out  pandemonium  screams  shouting  peter sees
            that william has townsend in a brutal headlock  townsend
            looks panicked helpless  peter is pulled back as the two
            men disappear beneath a swarm of other bodies

            int ballroom  night

            uneaten food and overturned chairs testimony to their hasty

                          enjoyably ghoulish
                      apparently she killed herself sometime
                      last night
                          confidentially
                      the paramedics told me she hung herself 
                      climbed up on her dresser stocking
                      around her neck but i dont know  she
                      was completely rheumatoid
                          realizes hes speaking with
                           too much relish
                      its a shame  anyway though you should

                                josef
                      a few hours ago

            claires blown away by the nights events

            int peters hallway  continuous

            peter has slowed to look at the yellow police cordon as
            claire moves on into their apartment

            int peters kitchen

            a bit later peter and claire both still shaken sit across
            from a relieved father james drinking coffee

                                father james
                      its moments like this that make it
                      clear  all that matters is those we
                      love are with us

            peters touched  he pats james on the shoulder

                                claire

            claire stands exhausted  she bends down kissing peter on
            the cheek only because james is there and then she gives
            peter a sweet hug

                                claire contd
                          deeply felt
                      i dont know what id do without you

            peter hugs her tightly  an emotional moment

                      im going to bed  dont be long

            claire exits  james looks at peter sees the nights events
            have taken their toll

                                father james
                      what is it

                                peter
                      something he said just before

                                father james
                      he spoke to you

                                peter
                      yeah  it didnt make any sense

                                father james
                      listen to me peter  you cant let the
                      ravings of a madman disturb you okay

                                peter
                      youre right but its funny  all my
                      life i thought i was simply a man who
                      didnt believe in any of it

                                father james

                      but its true  i have no faith  its
                      strange  when that gun was pointed at
                      my face tonight i was surprised but
                      never frightened  it was as if i knew
                      nothing could possibly happen to me
                      andin that one moment i didnt care
                      about anything  not eve my own life

                                father james
                      peter  your life must matter to you
                      because it matters to all of us who love
                      you

                                peter

                      faith james  i dont understand it
                      but i want you to know that despite our
                      differences i admire you and i always
                      will

            father james stands and claps his hand on peters shoulders

                      i appreciate your saying that  im
                      gonna go now  i believe youre wanted

                      believe it too

            peter grabs the pictures out of her hand and pitches them
            into the hall

                                peter
                      and the point is

                                maya
                      at the exorcism birdson boasted that
                      satan is about to take over the body of
                      a man
                          long pause
                      you are that man peter

                                peter
                      what

                                maya
                      its true  birdson knew your name he
                      was writing it in numerical code  it
                      wasnt easy but i figured it out  it
                      spelled your name

                                peter
                          sarcastic
                      why didnt birdson just say so

                                maya
                      if youre possessed you cant reveal
                      anything satan wants hidden  unless you
                      trick him

                                peter
                          now completely unimpressed
                      trick him

                                maya
                      the good outwitting the bad  its like
                      birdson had a split personality

                                peter
                          hes had it laughs
                      you should think about getting
                      professional help

                                maya
                      youre already contaminated  its why
                      you couldnt hear the tape  theres
                      probably a pentacle near your bed  to
                      sanctify you

                                peter
                      im not going to be drawn into this

                                maya
                      i know this sounds crazy  i understand 
                      check your parents blood types  are
                      you sure your parents are your birth
                      parents

                                peter
                      my parents are dead  dont even think
                      of bringing them into this

            the school bell rings  within seconds the hallway is
            flooded with kids and teachers

            a smiling father frank stops out of a classroom  as he sees
            maya and peter down the hall his face darkens  he starts
            towards them

                                maya
                          moving to peter whisper
                      youre about to become the antichrist
                      who is born unholy and becomes the door
                      to eternal suffering in this world

                                peter
                          pissed off at himself now
                      if you or any of your lunatic friends
                      ever come near me again

            peter notices father frank moving up on maya and takes off
			
			ext street  outside seminary  day

            an angry peter walks to his range rover  the wind is up and
            it has started to rain  peters underdressed hunching his
            shoulders against the elements  hes parked a distance from
            the seminary  as he begins a slow jog to his car the rain
            begins to come down a bit harder  suddenly peter slips on
            the wet pavement and falls scraping his hand  a moment
            while he gets his bearings and then he picks himself up the
            rain now shooting down the side of his face

            int mayas room in the seminary  continuous

            an anxious maya sits at her desk  suddenly theres a hard
            knock on the door and father frank enters  maya looks up
            unprepared

                                father frank
                      ive had it  townsends dead  the
                      police are calling and now i see you
                      having a scene in front of the children 
                      im sorry maya youve been with us for
                      many years but effective immediately
                      im rescinding your right to live at the
                      church

                                maya
                      father i have nowhere else to stay

                                father frank
                      you have a sister in new orleans

            maya looks up at him but father franks out the door

            int father lareauxs room  continuous

            father lareaux sleeps quietly quasi fetal  maya moves to
            the room soundlessly  a renewed sadness stabs her at the
            sight of lareaux  she studies him a moment then cups his
            face in her hands  slight disturbance in lareauxs body
            like a childs startle reaction  maya lets go and leaves as
            quietly as she came

            int italian restaurant  day

            upscale  claire and peter at lunch  peter is clearly
            agitated  his clothes are still wet and pretty wrinkled 
            claire looks at him with tenderness

                                peter
                      im gonna have to get a restraining
                      order  what a nightmare

                                claire
                      i dont know  in a way im glad it all
                      happened

            peter looks at her skeptically a little pissed off

                                peter
                      youre glad somebody tried to kill me

                                claire
                          nervous about confronting him
                      no of course not but i think now that
                      this has happened a lot of things can
                      start to come out

                                peter
                          still pissed
                      yeah like

                                claire
                          coming on a little stronger
                      like you need to admit that losing your
                      parents when you were twelve was
                      traumatic

                                peter
                          unafraid
                      its with me all the time claire i
                      just dont like to talk about it

                                claire
                      well it shattered your faith in
                      everything

                                peter
                          trying to lighten it
                      im just temporarily off my game

                                claire
                          boring in
                      you need to believe in something besides
                      yourself

                                peter
                      i believe in you

            a moment where claire hesitates then she decides to let
            herself be flattered

                                claire
                          leaning in close to peter
                      i love you  you look a mess 
                      why dont you go home and clean up
                      before you go back to work

            claire kisses peter brief but deep as she gulps in a short
            gust of air

            outside the rain has stopped as claire gets up taking off
            for work without him

            ext street  outside seminary  day

            maya is sitting on an iron bench outside the playground  a
            shoulder bag with some of her belongings lays beside her 
            she stands picks up her sack and walks across the street to
            a small diner

            int diner  day

            its warm crowded and noisy  waitresses banter with
            longtime customers about the ups and downs of everyday life 
            maya enters in a state of complete distress  she sits at the
            counter next to a mother and her little girl  their drinks
            and sandwiches are spread out everywhere  the little girl
            cusp her hand around a tall glass of milk  she wears black
            patent shoes a red jacket hood attached  maya bows her
            head and covers her eyes  shes losing it

                                maya
                          whisper
                      i cant do this anymore

            the little girl about 4 years old tugs on mayas sleeve

                                little girl
                      you have to put your napkin in your lap

                                mother
                          embarrassed
                      gina

            maya looks at the solemn little girl

                                maya
                          to her mother
                      its okay
                          she puts her napkin in her
                           lap
                      better

                                mother
                      im sorry shes very into rules

                                little girl
                      doesnt your daughter put her napkin in
                      her lap

                                maya
                          softly
                      i dont have a daughter  im not
                      married

                                little girl
                      arent you lonely

                                mother
                      okay gina thats enough

            maya sees the little girl wants an answer  moved she bends
            close and whispers in her ear

                                maya
                      i have someone who takes care of me

            she pulls back  the little girl looks up at maya
            reprovingly

                                little girl
                          cruelly
                      but hes dead  jesus is dead

            and then she smiles at maya a wicked smile  maya looks at
            the little girl and then at her mother  the mothers eyes
            are sparkling with malice  the room begins to warp and
            distort  and we hear a choked back breath

            horrified maya quickly turns in her chair and faces away
            from the vision praying silently with eyes closed  after a
            moment she opens her eyes  the room looks normal again  in
            the reflection of the mirror across the counter she sees that
            the two seats next to her are empty the utensils untouched 
            sighing with relief she turns back  but the little girl and
            her mother are still there  the mothers face suddenly looks
            elongated her eyes move too close together and her nose
            disappears  a frightening distortion but momentary  and
            the little girls smile widens with spite

                                little girl contd
                      youre so weak

            with a loud frightened cry maya sweeps her arms out
            knocking all the nearby glasses utensils and dishes to the
            floor with a tremendous crash  milk bleeds over the counter 
            all eyes turn to her  distraught maya sees the little girl
            and the mother are gone  she grabs her bag and runs out the
            diner

            int peters apartment  day

            its quiet shadowy  the aquarium has begun a slow leak and
            a small puddle of water has pooled beneath it  peter enters 
            he notices the water on the floor  he goes into the bedroom

            int peters bedroom  day

            the ledge of the building across the way can be seen from
            peters window  a woman is moving near the ledge setting
            out a grouping of potted geraniums  from downstairs a shaft
            of light is visible

            peter changes his clothes  then he feels the scrape on his
            hand  looks at it  as he moves to the bathroom  washes his
            hand and as he does so he checks his reflection in the
            mirror  stares at himself a moment then sticks out his
            tongue  checks it  and then dries his hand moving back to
            the bedroom carrying his towel with him  peter glances at
            his bed a moment  halfamused he leans over and checks
            behind the picture hanging above the headboard

            nothing

            then he bends down checking under the bed  again nothing

            then he moves to a bedroom closet pulling down a black and
            gray speckled file box

            inside a series of newspaper clippings graphic photos 
            yellowed with age on of which falls on the bed titled
            unsolved brutal murders  peter riffles past the clippings
            to the coroners report

            he speed reads it until he gets to his parents blood types
            andrea kelson  a negative  jack kelson  o positive 
            peter stares at the information  confused by what its
            supposed to mean  then he pulls on a turtleneck sweater
            ready to go back out

                                peter
                      this is ridiculous

            peter exits the bedroom and steps back towards the living
            room carrying the towel

            int peters living room

            peter passes through to his front door throwing his towel on
            the puddle of water

            int secretarys ante room  peters office  day

            peter walks in eyeballing mrs quintanas desk

            a pad  he holds it out for peters inspection  peter is
            rattled

                          pleasantly
                      goodbye

            he sticks out his hand and grabs peters  his expression
            changes from one of amused disdain to fascinated curiosity

                      transformation is so near

            but the voice is that of john townsend

                                peter
                          really shaken

            high angle on

            peter stands in the middle of the sidewalk as the wind
            violently whips at his jacket  he gazes upward to the mute
            gray sky  finally he lowers his eyes  he sees something
            that angers him

            ext catholic church  day

            a sprawling catholic church stands before him  peter regards
            it with wrath  he pushes open the door and tries to enter
            but a group of lithuanian parishioners pushes past him
            blocking his way a priest calls a farewell

                                lithuanian priest os
                          in lithuanian

            int catholic church  continuous

            its dark forbidding  the priest exits around a corner 
            peter looks at the vast and spacious altar  above it is an
            enormous wooden crucifix  peter moves down the aisle toward
            the altar

            ecu

            the sorrowful face of the christ figure looks down on peter
            with pity  the body hangs gaunt wracked with pain  the
            wrists pierced by nails the feet cruelly hammered together

            peter stops at the first pew  he looks up at the crucifix 
            defiant

                                peter
                      go ahead do something  show me

            he waits  for a splitsecond theres a pristine silence 
            then the sound of the wind rises in the church  with that
            the right wrist shatters with a noise like a rifle shot 
            freed from one of its supports the heavy wooden christ slams
            forward at an awkward angle  the other wrist snaps in two

            for a second the christ figure trembles  then with a
            sickening sound the entire wooden body falls forward swings
            sideways and plummets down  peter doesnt want to look  the
            figure is now hanging upside down held only by the brace at
            its feet  above it each hand remains pinned to the cross 
            its an exact copy of viznicks tattoo

            inside the center  the children are carefree and
            rambunctious unaware of the adult drama taking place around

            from the line heading back to the school  they circle back
            toward maya and swoop by her waving exuberantly then return
            to the line and go into the school  the daycare worker
            follows them as

            peter walks through the gate  he walks fast toward maya who
            sees him coming from a distance  maya continues rocking
            ever so gently on her swing  peter puts out his hands and
            stops it  stares at her scared

            maya nods  peter exits the room  she hears his footsteps
            fade away and a door slam  as she stands up she knocks
            townsends jacket off the chair  a book falls out of a
            pocket  its on of the books townsend took from lareauxs
            room  maya opens it

            an intrigued maya turns another page

            int garage  night

            peter enters  sees a switch  flips it on and a fluorescent
            light buzzes on  he peruses old boxes two dusty black
            filing cabinets  ruston curtain rods a box of broken
            appliances and an old stove covered with an orange tarp

            int master bedroom

            as maya reads she hears a light scraping noise  she
            glances up  silence  she waits  nervous maya then goes
            back to her book  excited she spots something thats
            important  she hears another light sound

            she steps into the bathroom and freezes

            int bathroom  night

            henry birdson is standing in the corner same green
            regulation drawstring pants and matching tshirt  he has a
            fishgutting knife in his hand  with an evil smile he
            calmly steps forward imitating the gesture maya saw in the
            restroom at the seminary  he raises his knife holding it
            out in front of her  maya stands still  she wants to run
            more than anything in life but she doesnt  instead she
            reaches out one hand and touches the knife ever so gently
            with the tips of her fingers  fro a second neither one
            moves  mayas face registers great fear  birdson slides the
            knife back  maya sees blood on her hands coming from a cut
            on her fingers  she trembles but doesnt run  maya uses
            the humility and calm of an experienced exorcist

                                maya
                          a whisper
                      henry christ loves you

            birdson looks at her with the impassive malignant gaze of a
            snake

                                maya contd
                      christ can save you henry

            birdson shakes his head as mayas dangling cross picks off
            particles of pure light

                                maya contd
                      just say his name say his name and
                      youll be free

            birdson agitated moves closer

                          soothing
                      say his name

            he slowly traverses the air in front of her face with his
            knife  maya steps back trapped her eyes never leaving
            birdsons

                                maya contd
                          with love
                      christ loves you

            for a split second the real henry birdson appears then he
            smiles grotesquely and in a new voice

                                birdson
                          lascivious
                      yes but does he swallow

            very fast

            maya dives out the door  with a snarl birdson recovers and
            lunges for her
			
			int master bedroom  continuous

            maya throws herself back into the bedroom slamming the door
            shut behind her as birdsons body smashes into it  maya sees
            birdsons shadowy form trying to break the glass with an
            animallike fury  scrambling against his mounting pressure
            maya tries but fails to get the lock to close  the door
            shudders as birdson pummels it with his body  birdson
            cracks the glass  a spiderweb of shards rips through the
            window

                                birdson
                          different voices
                      fucking bitch  open the door

            maya drops lareauxs book shouldering her weight against the
            door  he hits it so hard it opens  maya shoves it back
            and straining manages to lock it  at the same moment she
            realizes theres no more pressure on the other side  she
            stops pushing

            pov

            over her shoulder we see the door behind her slightly open 
            she turns and realizes this takes two steps toward that door
            and then freezes  mayas in the center of the room
            equidistant from all the doors 
            she looks back at the door to the bathroom  no shadows block
            the light at its base  ever so slowly keeping her eyes on
            the bathroom door she reaches over unlocks and then pulls
            open the door to the hall  it swings open silently  she
            strains listening as hard as she can  but the only sound
            she can hear is her own shallow breathing  she says a silent
            prayer  then steps gingerly toward the door to the hallway 
            as she takes a second step

            birdson bursts through the bathroom door behind her  he
            leaps and slashes at her cutting her arm as she bolts
            through the door to the hallway

            birdson races in knife held high  peter grabs the small
            reading table and uses it as a shield as they scramble to
            their feet  whipping the knife back and forth at lightening
            speed birdson corrals them into a corner  it takes all of
            peters skill to keep him at bay

                                maya
                          dawning realization

            as birdson makes another thrust towards them maya suddenly
            jerks the chair away clearing a path for birdsons knife to
            hit peters abdomen

            peter screams bracing himself for the impact an impact that
            never comes

            birdson freezes stopping the thrust millimeters from peters
            stomach  hes caught in an unseen trap paralyzed

            in that split second peter realizes mayas right  he takes
            the chair and smashes birdson in the head  birdson goes
            down  peter kicks him  he doesnt move  peter grabs
            birdsons knife

            he looks back at maya whos holding her upper arm  blood
            begins to drip down her side  peter immediately grabs hold
            of her hand carefully pushing her arm up in the air

                      from the dead  townsend discovered it
                      in one of lareauxs books

            peter goes to the window grabs one of the lightweight
            curtains and uses the knife to shred a piece  he takes it
            and bandages mayas arm

                                maya contd

                      my birthdays tomorrow

            with peter and maya in the foreground we see although they
            dont that birdson sits up his eyes open staring at a
            point above maya and peter  a horrible rictus smile moves
            across his face  birdsons eyes roll back into his head
            until only white remains  then he begins to jerk
            uncontrollably his face contorting into one frightening
            expression after the next  peter grabs the fish knife
            moving in front of maya

            birdsons limbs begin to torque out of control  he convulses
            on the floor then suddenly sits up closer to camera  his
            eyes roll back down into a normal position  his face becomes
            calm  he looks at peter and maya  a horrified look crosses
            birdsons face as his arm rotates backwards bones snapping
            and muscles ripping

            involuntarily spewing from birdson in everchanging animal
            like voices

            birdsons head turns on his neck in unnatural manner his
            body still convulsing  as he stops speaking his head snaps
            back around so hes facing peter and maya

            suddenly the chandelier above them flickers the globes
            exploding and showering them with shards of glass  birdsons
            entire body begins to vibrate urine seeping out from beneath
            him  then horrifyingly a horn like protusion begins to
            push out from the upper edge of birdsons head growing
            straininguntil finally the horn bursts through blowing his
            head apart  birdson falls back onto the floor  and as
            birdson finally dies peter looks at the corpse then drops
            heavily onto an arm of a chair  drained maya sits next to
            him  they lean against one another together in trauma

                                maya

            highways dark except for peters headlights as they roll
            up and down a hilly back road  trees lean in on both sides 
            the effect is eerily like driving in another world

            maya flips through lareauxs book  a bible she took from
            townsends house sits on her lap  looks over at peter a
            moment

            up ahead the road begins to parallel a lake  glimpses of
            black water can be seen through the trees  she powers down
            her window to get some air  maya looks over at peter  his
            face appears normal  then she seems to hear a soft sound 
            gasping for breath  then

            the car suddenly drifts into the other lane heading straight
            for a guard rail which outlines the lake  instinctively
            maya lunges for the steering wheel

            rail but careens off the road 
            the car rips through the bushes with an explosive roar and
            skids down the bank and plunges into the lake below  and we

                                                            dissolve to

            an enormous splash of water as peters car disappears into
            the lake the water bubbling and as we go under we see the
            windshield crack and splinter and then we hear a rough
            screech of brakes  a horrendous long skid and

                          a smile emerges
                      thats true

            maya smiles back

            ext country market  night

            just past midnight  a small dirty white stucco and wood
            country mart  the only light is a stark household flood

            two people leave the market carrying a six pack and a few
            munchies  they hop into their car and take off

            and at the edge of the lot peters car is parked

            int country market

            peter and maya snap the lids of their coffees  somewhere a
            radio is on  maya moves to the aging cashier as peter walks
            over to a wall of generic firstaid remedies  he grabs the
            largest bandaids there  and as he joins maya at the
            counter we see its the cashiers radio

            cashier looks them over as he turns up the volume

                                deejay contd
                          sarcastic
                      now this daylight thing is up to two
                      minutes and scientists say sooner or

            peter pays  out of pennies the cashier pulls out a new roll
            and bangs it open inside of the register

                                deejay
                      now ill never be on time for work

            ext market

            peter and maya sit on the edge of the curb sipping coffee 
            maya pulls out her cigarettes and lights up  she offers him
            the pack  he gratefully takes one lights up and inhales

                                peter
                      why did you lie to me about your
                      parents deaths

                                maya
                      i was desperate  i knew you wrote about
                      murders  i needed a way in

            suddenly a car motors toward them  just as a deer decides to
            cross the twolane road  the cars high beams startle the
            deer it stops snaps a stunned look at peter and maya  a
            moment of stillness then it gallops to safety just as the
            car speeds by  suddenly quiet again

                                peter
                      close call  for the first time in a
                      long time its really hitting me 
                      lifes tenuous

                                maya
                      i know it is  right after my parents
                      died i went to the beach
                          short intake of breath
                      i was in the water  everything was
                      calm  and then one of those really big
                      waves hit me  hard  pulled me straight
                      to the bottom  i struggled and finally
                      ran out of air
                          gulps air
                      if it hadnt been for my sister who
                      pulled me out i wouldve drowned 
                      legally dead for a couple of minutes is
                      what they told me

                                peter
                      no oxygen to the brain

                                maya
                      maybe thats my problem

                                peter

                      townsend  get rid of me  i wouldve

                                maya

                      being

                                peter
                      what about after

                                maya

                      your soul will be at peace  if we kill
                      you satan cant stay

            she see him react to this

            int peters living room

            the door opens  its dark except for the luminescence of
            peters aquarium  we see some of the fish are listing and
            the aquarium still has a slow leak  the floors wet

                                peter
                      claire are you home

            he snaps on the light  silent  stuffy  he opens a window

                                maya
                      more air  always a good thing

            int bedroom

            peters box of records is on the bed where he left it  the
            ancient news articles are scattered  some fallen onto the
            floor

            peter picks everything up as maya sifts the contents on the
            bed  we see passing glimpses of a passport bankbooks
            insurance policies a will a set of keys and then a
            parchment copy of peters birth certificate  maya picks it
            up

            close on

            time of peters birth is 455 pm

                                maya
                      tomorrow afternoon  four fortyfive

            peter absorbs this

                                peter
                          false bravado
                      plenty of time

                                maya
                          fingers set of keys in box
                      what are these

                                peter
                      i dont know  extra apartment keys 
                      whats it matter

                                maya
                          desperate
                      maybe i should check lareauxs book 
                      its in the car  be right back  dont
                      go anywhere

                                peter
                      sure

            maya leaves the room  moments later peter hears the front
            door open and close  doesnt move then suddenly in a
            flurry of anger he knocks the phone off the bedside table 
            a lamp flies off with it  then he stands and sweeps his arm
            across the top of his bureau knocking off pictures moments
            a jewelry box  turning he flips over a chair and kicks it
            viciously

            breathing hard he slumps back on the bed  across the room
            he sees a picture of claire has slipped partially behind the
            bureau  its glass has shattered and only half her face is
            visible

            peter immediately picks it up  stares down at this smiling
            girlfriend  he lays it carefully back on the bureau trying
            to regain some control  he breathes deep then begins
            gathering everything back on to the bed  he looks at the set
            of keys  picks them up  compares them with his own set

            trying to think he stares out his bedroom window at the
            building ledge across the way  he sees the potted geraniums
            now arranged a simple red flourish

            then a light snaps on in the apartment below and as he looks
            down noticing it his eyes shift a momentary realization
            and he looks back down at the keys and leaves his apartment

            int elevator

            peter gets on  he looks at the unknown keys again  then
            pushes the button for the fourth floor

            int apt 4a  night

            peter knocks softly on the door  then more loudly  no
            response  he tries on of the new keys slowly giving it a
            turn  it works  he tries the lower lock  the click of this
            key is audible as

            int apt 4a

            the door swings open to a dark apartment  peter stands
            warily at the door then flips on the lights  nothing there 
            no furniture  no occupance

            peter steps in and closes the door  he looks around at the
            emptiness  a cockroach scurries across the floor in front of
            him

            int living room

            he walks through the living room and

            int bedroom 

            only a small table and lamp have been left in the corner 
            peter switches on the lamp  he notices the ceilings been
            dropped  a grid of white tile panels held by a lightweight
            metal frame  he stares at it

            very slowly he raises the broom upward and pokes on of the
            panels  it moves easily  he pushes harder and manages to
            angle the panel sliding it back so that some of the
            original ceiling is visible  he sees

            a lurid splash of color a tiny fragment of white line and
            part of a strange design

            peter stares hard at it  he grabs the small table from the
            corner and drags it to the center of the room  standing on
            it he can now easily reach the tiles with his hands

            he smashes the panels loose knocking them out and dropping
            them on the floor  two three four more tiles  then five

                                                       time jump cut to

            the floor below him is littered with ceiling tiles  peter
            looks up at

            ceiling

            an enormous pentacle  nine feet wide  it sprawls across the
            ceiling  runic symbols crest its edges  for a moment
            peters mesmerized

            int fourth floor hallway

            the door of apt 4a is thrown open  peter takes off
            leaving the door ajar behind him

            int peters apartment  continuous

            the front door is thrown open  peter steps in to see

            maya standing slightly tense talking to somebody  the
            other voice is obscured by the sound of a garbage truck
            moving down the street  and as peter moves farther inside
            past the door he sees

            claire sitting on the overstuffed chair

                                claire
                          gets up
                      there you are  my god darling ive
                      been so worried  are you alright

                                peter
                      claire

                                claire
                      this is the personyou were talking
                      about

                                maya
                      where were you

            peter holds out the keys to claire ignoring maya

                                peter
                      whatre these

                                claire
                      i dont know  what are they

                                peter
                      i found them in your file box

                                claire
                      must be a spare set

                                peter
                      i thought the spare set was in the
                      kitchen drawer

                                peter contd
                          to claire
                      you were hiding them

            claire gets up moving to peter and reaches to embrace him 
            he lets it happen but doesnt reciprocate

                                claire
                      honey youre exhausted  do you want to
                      lie down for a little while

                                peter
                          moving across the room
                      i found the pentacle

            mayas eyes widen with alarm  she turns quickly toward
            claire whos watching them  and as peter follows mayas
            stare in one slow move claire pulls a beretta from a drawer
            in the aquarium table  she points the gun directly at maya

                                claire
                      shes been stalking you peter

                                peter
                      so youre going to kill her  put the
                      gun down claire

            claire ignores him but before she can make her move peter
            has grabbed her wrist twisting her back into the living
            room trying to pull the gun out of her hand  claire wrests
            free of peter

                                claire
                      listen to me i love you peter im
                      trying to protect you

                                peter
                      you really had me going claire  i was
                      finally ready to propose to you

                                claire
                      were still going to be together

                                claire contd
                      theres nothing you can do about it  
                          to maya
                      ive fucking had it with you

            she lunges at maya one powerful move but as she does maya
            moves out of the way  and as maya spins around claire goes
            for her again but she trips on the wet floor losing her
            balance  as peter grabs to catch her she crashes horribly
            through the glass shelves

            peter is horrified

            then he walks to claire and pulls the gun from her lifeless
            hand  maya and peter stare at each other in shock for a
            moment  then mayas pager sounds  she checks the number and
            goes to the phone and dials  as she does peter pulls a
            blanket off the sofa and covers claires body

                                maya
                      hi its me  whats going on

            she listens and her expression changes to one of relief 
            she hangs up the phone and turns to peter

                                maya contd
                      lareauxhes coming out of it  lets
                      go

            int range rover  night

            the car passes through the nearly deserted streets  a street
            sweeper passes brushes whirring

            ext seminary  dawn

            as the sunlight prisms on dewcovered grass peter and maya
            pull into the seminary parking lot

            int father lareauxs room

            a small crowd of priests including father frank is in the
            room  several stand next to the bed blocking a clear view
            of father lareaux  soft classical music plays  the mood is
            upbeat  as the door opens father frank sees maya lead peter
            in by the arm like a puppet or a lost soul

                                father frank
                          vindictively
                      im glad youre here  theres something
                      you need to see

            with only a cursory glance at peter he leads maya to the
            bed  the other priests move away  father lareaux is sitting
            up against his pillows  he looks good rosy cheeked  almost
            back to normal

                                lareaux
                          happy to see her
                      miette

            maya throws her arms around his neck smiling for the first
            time in a long time

                                maya
                      father  thank god youre better  i

                                lareaux
                          being careful not to wound
                           her
                      well in my prayers i realized weve
                      been fooling ourselves and probably
                      blown this all out of proportion  god
                      would never allow anything like that to
                      happen

            maya is floored  father frank looks at her scornfully

                                father frank
                      i told you this was myth all along

                                peter
                          confused
                      does that mean its over

            lareaux nods a yes at peter as maya sits on the old
            priests bed  peter stands beside her

                                maya
                      sowe won

                                lareaux
                          sweet smile
                      yes  we won thats right

            maya plays with her cross distractedly rocking it back and
            forth between her fingers  lareaux refluffs his pillows
            looking away from maya moving slightly making himself more
            comfortable

                                maya
                      we won because christtriumphed over
                      satan

                                lareaux
                      um hm  thats right maya

                                maya
                      so if christ won that means what does
                      that mean father  that satan

                                lareaux
                          tenderly swallowing back
                      would you like to rest miette  you
                      must be exhausted

            maya picks up a scapular from the dresser and moves in closer
            to lareaux

                                maya
                          insistent
                      so i guess satan lost  satan is the
                      weak one

                                lareaux
                          breath coming in shorter
                           bursts
                      miette come here and relax

            maya is crowding lareaux now the scapular thrust almost
            directly in his face

                                maya
                          repeating monotone
                      i can relax because satan the coward
                      trembles before christ right

            father frank moves over to maya with another priest  sees
            lareaux is having trouble breathing

                                father frank
                      all right  thats enough for now  hes
                      just recovering  take it easy maya

            but maya resists their tugging arms leaning closer to
            lareaux

                                maya
                      but doesnt he tremble father  doesnt
                      he cower like a frightened jackal 
                      satan the halfwit

            maya continues taunting her cross dangling over lareaux

                                maya contd
                          as slowly as she can
                      the whimpering slave of christ  the
                      impotent dog on gods leash

            maya thrusts the scapular onto father lareauxs forehead  he
            recoils violently as though burned

                                lareaux
                          vicious another voice
                      hell make christ crawl

            the entire room stares transfixed at lareaux  maya look at
            peter then father frank as she moves carefully off the bed
			
			int father lareauxs room  short time later

            a nervous father frank is supervising the jesuits as they
            empty lareauxs room of its extraneous contents  he avoids
            looking at maya  father lareaux sits calmly in a chair at
            the center of the room  none of the jesuits meet his eye 
            one priest tapes the curtains closed over the window  a lamp
            provides the only light

            int corridor outside lareauxs room  day

            peter and maya stand anxiously near the door waiting

                                maya
                      hes our best chance  if we can get him
                      back

            without realizing it shes touching her shirt cuffs

                                peter
                      what can i do

                                maya
                          emphatically
                      you have to be experienced to do this 
                      just wait outside otherwise you risk
                      killing him

            maya looks at him then clasps his hand briefly  she breaks
            off and walks over to father frank

                                maya contd
                      youll do it

                                father frank
                      i dont have the experience  father
                      thomas should officiate

            father thomas a tall jesuit in his forties strides down the
            hall 
            hes dressed in a long black cassock with surplice and
            purple stole  hes resolute  two other jesuits father
            malcolm and father jeremy follow him

                                                            dissolve to

            maya and father jeremy stand close together in the hallway 
            we hear her whispered murmur

                                maya
                      forgive me father for i have sinned

            int father lareauxs room

            the priests enter and begin to prep the room  father malcolm
            goes to the closet and takes out the briefcase we saw at
            birdsons exorcism  he opens it and takes out a bible a
            cross a vial of holy water

            we see father thomas don his cassock and scapular in the
            partitioned dressing area of father lareauxs room  maya
            enters  peter from the doorway sees her lock eyes with
            lareaux  finally she turns away  lareauxs smile widens 
            father thomas steps out from behind the partition

                                father thomas
                      tie him to the chair

            father thomas makes the sign of the cross  then he places
            the tip of his stole on lareauxs neck and his right hand on
            lareauxs head  lareaux flinches  father thomas places
            relics of the saints on lareauxs chest  he writhes as if in
            pain  father thomas sprinkles lareaux with holy water 
            lareaux reacts as though it were burning oil  finally
            father thomas kneels beginning the litanies of the saints
            in latin

            int corridor outside lareauxs room

            the last thing peter sees as the door closes is maya 
            serious tight professional and outside the door father
            frank is already mouthing his rosary

                                peter
                          to father frank
                      now what

                                father frank
                      theres nothing we can do but pray 
                      well be in the church

            father frank leads the other jesuits down the hall  within
            seconds peters alone  he looks at the door 
            then he slowly moves closer to it until hes a foot away 
            he tries to listen  nothing  he leans even closer

                                father thomas os
                          in latin

                      companions i command you   tell me
                      your name

            peter moves closer

                                father thomas os contd
                      by the love and power of christ who
                      has redeemed man from your grasp i
                      command you

            peter moves away and sits down on a bench in the hallway

            int small chapel  day

            fourteen jesuits of mixed race including father frank 
            chant prayers in latin

            int corridor outside lareauxs room

            peter is sitting on the bench  he hears

                                voices os
                      peter peter

            he looks down the corridor  he sees no one  he looks in the
            other direction and sees a janitor eating a sandwich and
            pouring a container of milk into a large glass  once again
            he hears

                                voices os contd
                      peter peter

            he looks at the door to lareauxs room and sees the wall
            breath in and out as if its alive  he runs to the door and
            puts his ear against it

                                father thomas os
                      be gone and leave this child of the
                      lord god almighty  be gone by the
                      power of christ  be gone by the power
                      of the holy spirit

            suddenly the imprint of a chair pushes against the wall as it
            will burst right through  peter jumps away  he approaches
            the door

                                father thomas os contd
                      in the name of christ i command you 
                      tell me your name

            suddenly a body slams into the wall which starts to ripple as
            if a subterranean shape were moving through it  the body
            appears to be climbing straight up the wall

            theres an explosion of noise shrieking and shouting the
            sounds of furniture being violently overturned  peter is
            mesmerized and scared  hateful voices swell up

                                voices os
                      too late too late too late too late

            peter touches the door knob to lareauxs room  it is
            freezing cold so cold it burns  he pulls his hand away and
            wraps his jacket around his hand

                                maya os
                      please no

            peter is torn  his hand again moves to the doorknob 
            another body slams into the wall  more noise cries of panic
            angerand pain

                                father thomas os
                      move move

            a growling animal is heard like a baboon shrieking  peter
            starts to turn the knob then stops  hes caught unsure
            until maya calls out in agony

                                maya os
                      peter help me  oh god

            peter flings the door open and steps inside

            int lareauxs room  day

            and then very fast  the door slams behind peter and locks
            itself tight  then peter sees

            the room is not destroyed  the room is freezing cold breath
            is visible  lareaux is tied to the chair  father thomas is
            standing over him with a crucifix in hand the eucharist on
            lareauxs head  maya and the younger priests are kneeling
            just behind father thomas overwhelmed

                                lareaux
                      gotcha

            the lamp immediately goes out  room is pitch black

                                father thomas
                      jeremy the door

            we hear fumbling grunting

                                father jeremy
                      iti cant

                                father thomas
                          continue subbing in latin
                      lowly beast through the power of
                      christ  let the door reopen

            voices begin  mocking speeded up versions of sentences
            weve heard before latin and english

                                lareaux
                          in peters voice
                      go on  do something  show me
                          in mayas voice
                      im scared im slipping back

            a beat  then a normal voice

                                peter
                      maya

            a torrent of profanity drowns him out  a thousand voices
            young and old crying cursing filling the air with hatred
            and spite  amidst this hurricane of sound the lights begin
            to flicker at ultrahigh speed creating a strobe effect 
            the window bursts open flooding the room with light  father
            jeremy races over and struggles to close it but cannot 
            maya is revealed praying eyes open  peter and father
            malcolm are crouched near the door  a terrified father
            thomas is bravely standing holding his crucifix in front of
            himself facing lareaux  or where lareaux was  the chair is
            empty  amid the deafening noise peter sees

            lareaux rise up behind maya and encircle her throat with his
            hands as the hellish voices reach a crescendo  lareaux
            begins to sing softly

                                lareaux
                      rockabye baby on a tree top

            peter leaps to pull lareaux off her but the aging priest
            surprised peter by grabbing him and hold him at bay  

            as peter struggles lareauxs expression shifts  his
            confidence vanishes and pain distorts his features  lareaux
            falls to the floor in agony 
            maya and peter bend down to help him but the noise makes it
            impossible for them to hear one another  maya pulls open
            lareauxs collar to try to get him more air and in that
            instant the voices stop  the lights pop on  maya leans
            close to lareaux whos dying on the floor mumbling
            incoherently  and on lareauxs forehead we see incisions
            resembling strange unknown letters  like theyve been cut
            from within  the incisions are repeated on the backs of
            lareauxs hands  the room is so cold steam pops off the
            breath  father thomas moves fast beginning the last rites
            in latin  he makes the sign of the cross on lareauxs
            forehead then

                                father thomas
                          to lareaux in latin
                      confiterisne vitia tua ante omnipotentem
                      deum  do you confess your sins before
                      almighty god

                                lareaux
                      the ark sank the sun set the ark
                      sank again

                                maya
                          desperately
                      father please dont die

                                lareaux
                          in great suffering
                      art sank sun set ark sank again

            maya leans down inches from the dying priest  peter moves
            beside her

                                maya
                      father

            for a split second lareaux surfaces from his confusion and 
            looks at her with a great kindness

                                lareaux
                      ensemble pour toujours quoi quil
                      arrive

            as he dies maya is momentarily inert tears of exhaustion 
            shes devastated and we hear a single grace note laced with
            an intake of breath as we

            the exorcism participants  father frank glares at maya as
            he helps clear the room

                          looking down at maya
                      i thought you were in danger

            maya backs away from lareaux who is being covered with a
            white sheet  a last glance and then she takes off with
            peter

            int range rover

            maya looks straight ahead trying to shake off her fear 
            peter looks at maya moved by her  puts an arm around her
            shoulder a momentary intimacy then he pulls away  finally
            maya looks at peter

                                maya
                      ill be all right

                      exorcism  i looked in every passage in
                      the bible and theres nothing about an
                      ark or a sunset that tells us anything

                                peter

            altar behind the reader  mayas shocked by the packedto
            capacity church  the crowd inside immediately switch their
            focus to maya and then to peter whos just moved up onto the
            altar standing unknowingly directly under the cross

            to maya and peter  the reader is wearing a small inverted
            cross around her neck

                      welcome

            in the crowd maya sees the little girl from the diner  maya
            is stunned  the little girl catches mayas glance giving
            her a sly smile and then looks away  her mother appears
            beside her  unnerved maya looks at peter desperate

            then the priest at the front of the church standing quietly
            next to the reader turns slowly toward peter oddly very
            calm  and we see its father james  he smiles  charming
            gracious

                          looking at gas can
                      did you really think you could just burn
                      the church down  that some ritualistic
                      hocus pocus could just end this

            alarmed peter looks at maya but her gaze is locked on
            james  then peter glances down at the dripping gasoline can
            in mayas hand and as she sets it down

                      the more you pulled away

                                peter
                          beyond anger beyond tears

                      legacy i could have given you

            peter moves the muzzle of the gun into james carotid artery

            close on maya

            the realization floods her

                                maya
                      dont  thats what they want

                                father james

                      if you commit murder you accept evil

            one by one people in the congregation begin to rise  peter
            cant believe what he sees  susan and mrs quintana

            stunned peter lets the gun lower a moment and then as he
            turns back to maya hes too late 

            james has moved behind maya holding a longbladed knife at
            her throat  james anchors it at her neck forming a
            shimmering upside down cross runic symbols carved into the
            sterling handle

            peter pivots pulling up the gun again aiming it back at
            james

                                peter
                      drop the knife

            he cocks the gun

                                father james
                      shes going to die right in front of
                      you

            peter looks at maya  her expression gives him the permission
            to do the unthinkable

                                maya
                          softly
                      let him kill me

            peters thrown off  maya lets her eyes blink closed  for a
            moment no one moves  the knife glints off the stained
            glass

            close on 

            peter  thinking  unraveling

                                father james
                          big smile
                      you have no idea how much you look like
                      your mother right now

            peter fires an echoing report bouncing from the cathedral
            ceiling to the travertine floor  father james falls
            mortally wounded

                                william
                      and you thought i was the family fuck
                      up

            peter sees william approaching from the pews

                                william contd
                      thank you maya  you served us well

            stunned peter gulps a mouthful of air lifts his gun and
            shoots william in the eye  immediate  the bullet powers
            through william lodging in mrs quintana  she coughs up a
            gurgling choke eyes wide  and as she dies gripping her
            neck she doubles over the back of a wooden pew

            the crowd reacts  maya grabs hold of peter edging him back
            toward the vestry and out of the church  as the congregation
            starts to press forward peter swings the gun back up and out
            toward them  it glistens off the chalices  they stop wary
            and as maya and peter finally turn their backs on the crowd
            they take off past the sacred eurcharistic relics

            int vestrysaint benedictus

            through the vestry and out the back door

            ext street  dusk

            peter and maya sprint for the rover

            int range rover

            peter and maya speed up the street  they turn the corner and
            continue up a street undergoing construction  fenced by
            sawhorse barricades its equipped with flashing warning
            lights

                                peter
                      how much time do we have

                                maya
                      not a lot

            peter races past the barricades sideswiping the steel
            sawhorses then suddenly he slams on the brakes skidding to
            a rough stop nowhere to go

            int range rover

            peter looks at maya then at the gun in his lap and back at
            her  conflicted emotions  he picks up the revolver  maya
            stares at peter  a huge fear rips through her body  peter
            hesitates  then hands her the gun

                                peter
                      if you can do itgo ahead

            maya puts the gun down  leans over and embraces him  they
            hold onto each other  a shared intimacy unknown to either
            of them

                                maya
                          a desperate whisper
                      im not strong enough for this

            peter reaches over and tenderly brushes the hair away from
            mayas face  then maya pulls away raising the tiny gun and
            time slows to a crawl

            maya holds the beretta  the strain etched on her face her
            hands shake her eyes well up  peter waits watching her 
            shes unsure  we hear a choked back breath  gasping lungs
            looking for air  the struggle for life

            the car clock seems frozen on 454  finally it turns over
            and

            nothing happens

            peters looking at her  he knows  hes sure of it  

                                peter
                      it didnt work  maya im okay

            peter reaches for her his face radiant joyful alive  she
            doesnt move a muscle  the gun barrel doesnt quiver

                                maya
                      oh peter

                                peter
                          changed tone
                      its me  put the gun down  maya

            tears roll down her face as she cocks the beretta

                                peter contd
                      if you really think im the devil then
                      shoot me

            out of the corner of her eye maya sees the clock  its hands
            rapidly spin backward

            ext range rover

            a high angle of the car from above  a shot rips through the
            air  then one more  maya exits the car  shes unsteady on
            her feet  the camera pans up into the night sky

            silence

            followed by a lowpitched disturbing rumble  a kind of
            grotesque groan  then some hum is heard  static  a not
            quitetuned in radio station becomes audible

                      i love this now scientists are saying
                      the days have suddenly stopped getting
                      shorter  it makes you wonder  do these
                      guys know anything

            the station fades out  theres a fragment of pop music more
            static then the radios snapped off  and we hear the sound
            of breathing light and steady

                                                            dissolve to

            ext rural road  day

            an aerial shot of a steel blue car as it cruises down a two
            lane highway  passing fields of cotton

            int blue car  day

            inside the car maya is driving  windows down  she looks
            serene at peace carrying her wound well as we

                                                               fade out

            alternate ending

            int range rover

            maya aims at peters head and pulls the trigger  peters
            thrown back against the seat  she fires again into his
            heart  maya lets the gun down slowly  tears streak her
            cheeks as she cups his face in her hands

                                                            dissolve to
