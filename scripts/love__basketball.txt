				coach miller contd
		but my philosophy is simple hard work
		and sacrifice
		theres a lot of basketball history and
		pride here at usc but just putting on
		the cardinal and gold doesnt make you a
		great player  hard work and sacrifice
		makes you a great player  what you were
		doesnt matter anymore  for the first
		time in your life you wont be the best
		youll be going up against women that are
		bigger and stronger and better than you
		ever imagined  so the question is how
		will you respond  well your answer
		better be hard work and sacrifice because
		thats the only way youre gonna make it
		through  vince lombardi preached it and
		i teach it there is only one way to
		succeed at anything and that is to give
		everything

	coach miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in
	monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions
	like her a lot of cockiness a lot of fear

				coach miller contd
		a few simple rules  eleven oclock
		curfew no exceptions  always be on
		time no exceptions  attend every class
		no exceptions  no drugs no alcohol no
		getting pregnant  and finally respect
		yourselves respect your coaches and
		respect your teammates right sidra

				sidra
		thats right coach

	monica stares at her mother  theres no going back

				monica
		so thats why we cant get along
		because id rather shoot a dumb jump
		shot

				camille
		youre the one always turning your nose
		up at me

				monica
		no i dont

				camille
		child please  ever since you were
		little you thought you were too good for
		anything i had to say

				monica
		i wasnt lena  i didnt care about nail
		polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray
		of your perfume

				camille
		what was so wrong with wanting to teach
		you the things i knew could help you

				monica
		because youre pushing me to be something
		im not

				camille
		so youre angry with me because youre
		standing here with your hair combed and
		wearing perfume

	monica is busted  it takes her a moment to come back

				monica
		im angry because i want a mother not
		martha stewart

				camille
		oh yes  the superstar female athlete
		whose mother is nothing but a housewife

				monica
		thats not it

				camille
		dont tell me you arent ashamed of that
		because i know

	monica stares at her mother

				monica
		i remember when i was eight years old
		you spent like four hours cooking up this
		fancy meal  all youd let me and lena do
		was set the table  and i guess you and
		dad got your wires crossed or something
		because he walks in with a couple of
		pizzas  and you didnt say anything
		you just threw the whole meal into some
		tupperware and tossed it in the fridge

				camille
		i dont remember that

				monica
		i do  you never stood up for yourself
		ever  if i was ashamed it was because
		of that

				camille
		thats ridiculous

				monica
		whats ridiculous is not being a caterer
		so your husband can feel like a man
		knowing his womans home cooking and
		ironing his drawers

	whap  camilles humiliation is immediate and she cuts off
	monica with a slap  camille curses herself for losing it

				camille
		dammitt monica

	monica is stunned hurt

				monica
		im sorry

	camille stares at her daughter devastated

				camille
		is that really all you think of me

	monica cant answer

				camille contd
		when i married your father all i wanted
		was a nice house with a big kitchen so i
		could start my catering business  and
		then i got pregnant with lena and then i
		got pregnant with you  and i put it out
		of my mind because thats what you did

	monica stares at her mother

				camille contd
		but you want to know what day i remember
		in high school you getting ready for the
		spring dance  i put my pearls around
		your neck told you you were beautiful
		and you looked like you were going to
		cry  that day i was happy i didnt have
		a catering business to run off to  my
		family had three meals a day had someone
		to pick up after them and when my
		daughters went to a dance i helped them
		get ready  thats what i came to care
		about

				monica
			softly
		thats all you cared about  i must have
		played in a thousand games and i can only
		remember you being to two

				camille
		you had your coaches and your father for
		that stuff  it never mattered one way or
		the other if i went to your games

				monica
		it mattered mom

	camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in
	her eyes  monica moves off the barstool and leaves
