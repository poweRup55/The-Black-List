leon
     aka the professional

     version 1 script

     from an original idea by luc besson

     notes
     the beginning is identical to the movie so we considered 
     useless reporting it here  its from mathildas first rifle 
     training scene that the original script is totally different 
     from the movie this version is much more violent and the 
     affective relation between leon and mathilda shows no more 
     ambiguities in this version mathilda was to be aged 13 or 
     14

              

     leon and mathilda arrive on the roof of a building which 
     faces central park they get close to a wall and maintain this 
     position sunlight floods the park

                               leonconcentrated
               firstly you look for more than one 
               minute because there are alarm systems 
               with one minute period  therefore you 
               wait and look  alarms firstly the sky 
               for helicopters nearby buildings  
               meanwhile you observe soils color and 
               will try to wear dresses of the same 
               color never lighter

     mathilda listens very carefully

                               leon
               ok good now you can assemble your 
               weapon  

     he opens the violin case and assembles a rifle with 
     telescopic sight and silencer

                               leon
               the rifle is the first weapon you learn 
               to use because you can keep far from the 
               client the more experience you have the 
               closer you get

     he finished assembling the weapon and hands it to mathilda 
     shes going to pull off telescopes cover

                               leon
               no always take it off at the last 
               moment because of light reflexes 
               theyll see you in two seconds

     they get close to roofs edge mathilda sits down and gets in 
     position

                               leon
               relax you must feel at ease

     mathilda leans down properly

                               mathilda
               ok im fine

                               leon
               good

     he removes telescopes cover

                               leon
               here this is the light scoop for night 
               shooting there you fix clients 
               distance how much to the bench down 
               there in the park

                               mathilda
               huh 500 meters

                               leon
               130 140

                               mathilda
               how can you say it

                               leon
               look when you can see his fingers its 
               50 meters  when you just see his hands 
               its about 80 meters when you 
               distinguish arms from body its 120130  
               when you see nothing more than a shape 
               you dont shoot  not very sure you have 
               one chance out of five to miss  a 
               contract means getting all chances on 
               your side 5 out of 5  you cant miss a 
               client never if the task is delicate 
               or the risk is too big you double that 
               is you insure yourself by another means

                               mathilda
               what for example

                               leon
               well if the guy is far in a car and i 
               know weather is going to be bad rain for 
               example i think i would plastic the car 
               with a remote here i shoot from the 
               distance and if i miss i plastic

                               mathilda
               what if you cant approach the car or he 
               changes car

     leon thinks

                               leon
               rocket launcher

                               mathilda
               oh really
                         she looks at the 
                         road and imagines
               but can you miss the car

     leon pulls a small box out of the violin

                               leonshowing a special bullet
               its a coded bullet you put it in the 
               rifle you glue it to the car no matter 
               where  then you take your rocket 
               launcher and the rocket will get there 
               automatically

                               mathilda
               wow its brilliant

                               leon
               yeah  come on have a little 
               training

     mathilda gets in position

                               mathilda
               wholl i aim at

                               leon
               whoever

     leon pulled out binoculars mathilda looks for a victim by 
     telescope she passes over playing kids

                               mathilda
               no women no kids

     leon smiles she learnt the lesson

                               leon
               begin from a steady target its easier

     she stops on a man whos reading a newspaper  the man wears 
     a suit herald tribune fat

                               mathilda
               the fat man down there on the bench

                               leon
               perfect

     mathilda aims at the fat man one of benchs boards explodes 
     the fat man turns his head he doesnt understand what 
     happened and resumes reading

                               leon
               try again the same

     second shot the bench explodes on the opposite side  the 
     man is still curious but doesnt understand

                               leonat binoculars
               too much to the left

     mathilda concentrates again and shoots nothing happens  
     mathilda wonders whether she missed again and prepares for a 
     new shot

                               leon
               wait

     the fat man softly leans down on his side

                               leon
               bullseye

     mathilda is happy but evidently she expected death to be 
     more spectacular

                               leon
               come on now a walking one

     mathilda aims at a businessman she really chooses the 
     ugliest one she shoots mans case explodes and he hides 
     behind a tree hes scared and doesnt move any more

                               leon
               good first shot

                               mathilda
               yeah but i didnt get him i got his 
               case and now hes behind the tree what 
               can i do

                               leon
               its not serious its just training 
               you have to learn from the beginning to 
               hit the target then to improve 
               precision youll train but on 
               cardboards

                               mathilda
               ok

                               leon
               now try a running guy

     mathilda gets back to telescope and looks for a jogger

                               mathilda
               the yellow and pink

                               leon
               ok

     the guy is footing sweaty with a walkman and headphones 
     mathilda shoots once twice thrice the bullets pass around 
     the jogger who cant see or hear anything

                               mathilda
               shit its hard when he runs

     leon hands her another charger

                               leon
               dont lose him concentrate there 
               reload  ok keep calm calm breathe 
               deeply  look at his movements  imagine 
               youre running with him breathe hold 
               your breathe his movements now 

     she shots and the guy gets a bullet in a thigh hes scared 
     but doesnt know where to go

                               mathilda
               did you see first shot  its good 
               isnt it did i learn well

     mathilda proudly smiles

                               leonserious and steady
               put tools away

     mathilda obeys seriously

     night over city the two are on a small buildings stairway

                               leon
               codes

     mathilda gets by his side for her new lesson

                               leon
               for codes there are two solutions  you 
               have to choose depending on your needs  
               first case you have time you need the 
               code for a later time so you wait for 
               night you get a box with soot powder and 
               blow a little on the keyboard  he does 
               it and pulls out a screwdriver

                               leon
               then you break the little lamp to be 
               sure the client cant see anything  you 
               wait for someone who gets inside so you 
               have just to see which numbers he 
               touched  once you know the four or five 
               digits you have to try all combinations 
               once per hour and not more than a minute 
               to do not get found

                               leoncontinues
               second case you have no time but you 
               mustnt get discovered  screwdriver

     he disassembles locks cover

                               leon
               here wires need the code  always four 
               wires

     an approximately 40yearold man climbs the stairway he 
     evidently lives in the building

                               man
               may i

                               leon
               pardon
                         to mathilda
               let pass

     leon opens the door by disassembled locks wires the man is 
     going to pass but doesnt leons going to resume his 
     explanation

                               man
               excuse me but what are you doing

                               leon

                               man
               do you teach her how to break buildings 
               doors dont you  dont you give a shit 
               about me  get away before i call the 
               police  the man is very nervous 
               searches in a pocket then pulls out an 
               antiaggression bomblet hell have no 
               time to use it leon pulled out his 
               silenced gun  a shot to the hand and the 
               bomblet takes off shots energy makes 
               the man turn around a second shot in the 
               back makes the man get over the parapet 
               and disappear in a decorative bush 
               almost without noise  mathilda is 
               immobilized leon looks around then 
               resumes

                               leon
               so the wire which starts from the 
               bottom of the metal part and then you 
               try the other three wires one by one

     at second wire the door opens leon smiles

                               leon
               simple isnt it

     she nods yes

                               leon
               whats up i dont feel youre 
               concentrated

                               mathilda
               yes yes

     she gets close to the parapet and looks at the bush

                               mathilda
               its incredible how did you do it

                               leon
               what

                               mathilda
               there the guy how did you do that 
               without even touching him without noise 
               its like you put him away how did you 
               do it

                               leonpause  proud
               did you like it

     she pauses and seriously looks at him

                               mathilda
               it was brilliant

     leon and mathilda at cinema on the screen fred astair 
     breaks out as usual

                               leontalking about fred astaire
               look at his movements whatever he 
               says whatever he does he never stops 
               sad or happy the movement always goes 
               on

     pirouette by fred astaire

                               leon
               look even the wall nothing stops 
               him  the movement goes on he uses 
               everything soil wall his rush his 
               weight  life is movement death is a 
               part of it

     mathilda listens carefully

                               leon
               so you have to let the client finish 
               the movement he started  its better he 
               thinks about other things and he cant 
               see deaths arrival  hes got no time to 
               suffer he isnt surprised  hes got no 
               time even to think  he departs without 
               realizing  he departs in the movement he 
               started

     mathilda looks at the screen sparkling eyes

                               mathilda

               informed about on my turf  im not 
               opposing but the least they can do is 
               informing me isnt it

                               leon
               yes

     mathilda outside sends a cuckoo to leon who slightly 
     leans down to reply tony didnt see anything

                               tony
               at a certain moment i thought maybe 
               leon would like working on his own so he 
               makes some little extras

                               leon
               dirty work and i kill no women and no 
               kids

                               tony
               thats what i later told myself  no 
               tony forget leon it cant be him he 
               likes too much his job to make such a 
               slaughter

     leon cant avoid looking at mathilda whos looking up to 
     breathe better this little woman only survivor of a 
     massacre

                               leon
               tell me the money i earn and you keep 
               for me

                               tony
               do you need money

                               leon
               no just to know because its a 
               long time i work and i never did 
               anything with my money i should do 
               something

     tony is a little surprised by leons naivete

                               tony
               its true youre right did you meet 
               a woman

     leon smiles

                               leon
               no no

                               tony
               pay attention to women leon  they are 
               dangerous you know

                               leon
               yeah well i dont know i dont 
               know any

                               tony
               listen think about what you want to do 
               but dont worry your money is there and 
               its safer than in a bank banks are 
               robbed every five minutes

     tony makes an effort to laugh

                               tony
               anyway you cant have a bank account 
               so the discussion is finished

     leon nods

                               leon
               why cant i have a bank account

                               tony

               to fill in a lot of forms and you cant 
               write and theyll ask you your job your 
               employers name and you cant tell them

               tony his record is longer than his
               resturants menu  thats why you cant
               have a bank account

     leon thinks outside mathilda lets a young man approach her 
     they start talking leon gets nervous

                               tony
               but your money is there leon when you 
               want you ask me take

               to have some fun take its a gift

     she sweetly closes the door in face of him for a moment 
     hes blocked behind the door the receptionist is walking 
     along the hall and notices leon prostrated in front of the 
     door

                               receptionist

     hotel

              

     the receptionist is at his desk the hall is empty  mathilda 
     walks down the stairs slowly like a kid whos got nothing to

     mathildas old building
     mathilda slowly gets to her floor in front of the door a 
     thin yellow no entry police strip  a cop is distractedly 
     guarding the hall hes talking with a young black girl  
     mathilda gets in her apartment unnoticed  she gets in her 
     room recovers her teddy bear and her polaroid  then she 
     gets in the devastated living room theres dry blood almost 
     everywhere  in the corridor she raises one of parquets 
     boards a big roll of 100 bills is hidden beneath there is a 
     small checkbook too she carelessly puts everything away  
     noise in the apartment mathilda crouches down  stansfield 
     gets in together with two more guys  mathilda can see them 
     without being seen stansfield is evidently not at ease hes 
     justifying his actions in front of upperrank officers



                               stansfield
               so the guy was there hed hidden a 
               shotgun behind the tent here his woman 
               was armed too

     mathilda gets away the cop looks at her smiling

              

     mathilda gets back in the hotel room she sits on the couch 
     in front of the switched off television  one has never seen 
     nor heard her that concentrated and determined her face 
     looks thirtyyearold  noise from the lock she switches 
     television on anime leon gets in gets off his stuff hes 
     got a parcel he puts it on the table leon is stunned by her 
     lack of interest for the parcel

                               leon
               its for you  its a gift

     no reactions no replies

                               leon

                         he pulls out a 
                         small dress flowers 
                         motif hes very 
                         happy

                               mathilda harsh
               youd better directly buy the doll to 
               fit in it that would be clearer  leon 
               doesnt understand he takes the dress 
               and checks it out for defects

     she sighs and gets in the kitchen  leon gives up he sweetly 
     lays the dress down on the table and switches television off  
     mathilda comes back with a lot of pop corn she switches 
     television on again sits on the couch and turns volume up  
     leon is perplexed he doesnt speak he gets in the bathroom 
     for a shower  mathilda turns volume down she stands up 
     glances at the dress touches it by fingertips her face is 
     tense water flows in the bathroom but leon is at doors 
     small opening and observes mathilda she eventually leaves the 
     dress switches television off and gets to the window to look 
     at the sunset  leon feels bad he silently closes the door

              

     mathilda sits in front of him like in an arena

                               mathilda cold
               im sick of this leon

                               leon

               dont refrain you

                               mathilda

               you dont refrain me but at the same 
               time i cant get out

                               mathilda getting nervous

     she pulls out some dollars and puts them on the desk

               was there and i followed him thats 
               all

     leon tries to keep calm

               are you calmly telling me you spent the 
               day at fbi

     she shrugs her shoulders

                               mathilda

     leon looks at her then looks at the money

                               leon
               not taken

                               mathilda
               why

                               leon
               too heavy

     mathilda thinks fast

                               mathilda
               well then may you rent me your gear 
               for the day

     blocked on every front she sweetly starts crying

                               mathilda

               together  that would be good wouldnt 
               it

     leon intensely look at her neither severe nor badly just 
     cold like an iceberg

                               leon
               mathilda nothing is the same after you 
               kill someone  your life changes forever  
               youll can never cancel it neither from 
               your memory nor from your criminal 
               record  youll never sleep again like 
               before mathilda

     mathilda dries up her tears shes abandoned exhausted

                               mathilda
               if you knew leon  i killed one 
               thousand in my head  and this never 
               disturbed my sleep

                               leon
               ok and if its you who gets killed
                         mathilda doesnt 
                         reply
               then  talking about other peoples 
               death is easy but what about yours
               shes here she moves around you and 
               can get you in a thousandth of second 
               because it was your day your hour your 
               second

     mathilda looks at him leon gets confused

                               leon cont
               its written in the sky from the 
               beginning just you dont know then 
               someone announces you like this 
               suddenly did you ask yourself what time 
               you will die  well its now and its 
               too late already youve got a bullet in 
               your lungs already there

     he pushes her by his index finger enough to hurt her

                               leon
               painful isnt it
                         he pushes again
               you dont like talking about death 
               because youre like everyone you fear 
               it

                               leon
               well its this fear that makes you 
               live  its because you fear death that 
               you live with so much tenacity its 
               because of it that you bear whats 
               unbearable you can live in a hovel on 
               lots of trash everything is better than 
               death and the fear you have of it
                         pause
               but me leon i dont fear it any 
               more  they look at each other for a 
               moment  it takes a long to lose it this 
               fear but once you lost it you are 
               free and just then you can start 
               working properly because you can work 
               on other peoples fear play with it 
               because kill or get killed have become 
               just words do you understand

     mathilda slightly nods yes

                               leon
               you cant pretend to make this job 
               until you get beyond this stage the day 
               you get free of this fear not 
               before

     mathilda looks at his eyes without challenge

                               mathilda
               leon i have no fear  its so

     leon stares at her he tries to ascertain truth in mathildas 
     eyes  a long pause

                               leon
               ok

     he takes a weapon empties the cylinder then loads just one 
     bullet

                               leon cont
               do you know this game

     mathilda nods yes he turns the cylinder

                               leon
               one shot ahead i start  

     he gets the barrel to his temple so that if the bullet 
     explodes blood will get out with a downward angle hes ready

     he pulls the trigger nothing happens  he puts the gun in 
     front of her

     mathilda takes it she looks at him with so much love he 
     almost gets upset

     shes not scared shed just like things to be different 
     maybe shed like leon to open his heart to her she sighs 
     looks at the gun she takes it lifts the cock and aims the 
     weapon at her face shes resigned

                               mathilda
               love or death
     she gets the barrel in her mouth and looks at leon a tear 
     drop on leons front  she pulls the trigger nothing she 
     puts down the gun leon stands up turns around the table and 
     embraces her he holds her tight shes surprised she kindly 
     pushes leon back to look at his eyes

                               mathilda
               am i ready

     leon pauses slightly smiles and nods yes mathilda closes 
     her eyes happy and relieved she takes his hand and embraces 
     him for a long leon lets her do

     checks emergency exits then gets in front of a door he moves

               get to the end

     the man obeys leon hands the gun to mathilda

                               leonto mathilda

     she aims at him concentrated she signs to the man to move 
     left he obeys she pulls the trigger a dull noise the man 
     collapses to the floor

                               leon
               good safety now the second shot
     mathilda approaches the man and shoots again maybe too low 
     a squirt of blood on her dresses

                               leon
               here it is  look at your dresses now  
               how can you walk in the street now

     he recovers his gun

                               leon cont
               not a good work this when you shoot 
               from this angle you always get blood 
               everywhere  you have to move aside and 
               shoot with a little more angle 
               there this way

     he shoots it makes no difference to the man

                               leon cont
               can you see look not a drop come 
               on try

     he gives her the gun again mathilda moves on a side and 
     shoots perfect

                               leon
               good

     mathilda returns the weapon she looks for a little sign of 
     gratitude maybe a compliment but leon is hermetic

                               leon
               lets go

     mathilda is happy they drink mathilda drinks everything in 
     one gulp like shes used to with milk

                               mathilda slightly inebriated
               i thought we cant drink

                               leon

     waiter arrives with their dishes mathilda exploits his 
     presence to fill up again her glasses with champagne the 
     waiter gets away leon grabs the champagne bottle and voids it 
     in the ice cup

     going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath 
     walkman on she withholds a shout and gets against the wall 
     without moving she doesnt dare passing before the open door 
     again to join leon in the living room leon still thinks

     he looks around and sees mans overcoat still wet his wet 
     shoes are on the radiator

                               leon
               because he didnt get out

     leon stands up pulls out his gun and runs toward the 
     corridor  mathilda against the wall looks up to make him 
     understand its not too soon

     sit down and look at the man sleeping in the mid of his warm 
     bath leon pulls out his silencer and screws it on the gun

               fishing boat with in front a long pole 
               near the surface then near the cabin a 
               very tall mast with a little cabin for 
               the lookout

               the sea sometimes for days never sure

     rinaldi listens tony speaks and writes at the same time

                               tony cont
               sometimes its a lot of work for 
               nothing  and then you must know that 
               the bigger the fish is the older it is 
               the more expert it is  therefore 
               the more difficult he is to get  you 
               understand what i mean son

     blackboard

               other things

               reminds me a big yogurt warm and rancid

               older

     rain on the city  

     mathildas bored

     series of short sequences

      shes on the windowsill and looks at the flowing water that 
     will temporarily clean the city

     she smokes a cigarette

     she opens the double bass

     she assembles and disassembles a uzi last model

     she watches television falls on her head embedded in her 
     soft chair she eventually switches off at this extent the 
     program bored her

     she finishes her syrup peaches while listening to music

     she shoots some selfportraits by her polaroid mandatory 
     grimace

              

     no more rain  sun rays over the city

     tonys restaurant
     the old tony at his usual table three little boys in front 
     of him their hands on their eyes

                               tony
               dont peep ok attention

     emilio arrives and puts down a chocolate cake with five 
     candles on it

                               tony
               you can look

     the boys shout with joy stansfield now gets in the 
     restaurant with six men tony immediately stiffens  
     stansfield blows on the candles and leans toward the children 
     with a stupid smile

                               stansfield
               happy birthday

     without smiling he signs one of his men to regroup the kids 
     with emilio the children obey as if they feel its not the 
     moment to bother  tony doesnt oppose

                               tony

               for the moment ive got a quite bad 
               opinion about you  norman smiles

               very happy with the result  its right 
               this that makes me nervous now  i hope 
               youll excuse my temporary bad mood

                               tony
               then

                               stansfield to one of his men
               take me the pork

     one takes in the young rinaldi who had visited tony his face 
     is made swell unrecognizable

                               stansfield
               do you recognize him

                               tony
               even his mother wouldnt

     stansfield looks at rinaldi

                               stansfield
               youre right

     he pulls out his gun and kills him like one kills an insect 
     tony strongly stiffens emilio looks after the children

                               stansfield

               12000 you call back your shitful 
               cleaner and you tell him the contract is

               is my boss and id be really sorry with 
               losing him because hes a good boss  he 
               lets me work like i wish its fine 
               and 12000 to do nothing arent bad 
               arent they

     tony is really disturbed

               listen son you know as well as me this 
               kind of hitmen they come from nowhere 
               get the contract and disappear theyre 
               lonely worse than wolves

                               stansfield

               address

                               tony
               these guys have no place  they change 
               virtually everyday and his name  its 
               a surname

     stansfield pauses he stares at tony

                               stansfield to his right hand
               take me the children

     tony closes his eyes stansfield puts his gun on the table 
     children make a row in front of the table

                               stansfield
               come on i make you a favor  tell me 
               which is the one you love least ill 
               kill him first

     tony slightly sighs

                               tony
               you know boy i know their parents very 
               well i think they wont appreciate your 
               sense of humor

                               stansfield falsely naive
               huh really

                               tony serious
               if you touch them youll have all the 
               hitmen of the city on your ass

                               stansfield pause
               youre right its a little risky

     stansfield takes his gun and kills emilio

                               stansfield
               its good he had no family come on 
               speak now

     tony is petrified children shout and get under the table

                               stansfield
               else ill have to ruin this birthday

                               tony surrendering
               leon leone montana i know hes in 
               a small hotel in noho but i dont know 
               where houston street i think i 
               cant tell you more  even if you kill 
               all the neighborhood

     stansfield puts away his gun and stands up

                               stansfield
               thanks tony  justice will be grateful 
               for your precious collaboration  

     he points at emilios corpse

                               stansfield
               would you like me to call the police 
               for this little incident

     tony looks down then shakes his head no  stansfield smiles

                               stansfield
               good

     the group gets out children run into tonys arms

              

     new building
     mathilda sits at stairways end in front of a long corridor 
     and a small court
     five kids about 13yearold play baseball in the corridor



                               the boss
               youre the new one at 5th

     mathilda nods yes

                               the boss
               shall we explain her everything ok  
               this will avoid misunderstandings

     mathilda waits curious

                               the boss
                         to mathilda
               you cant sit here like that

                               mathilda
               huh why

                               the boss
               because you have to pay  its like a 
               parking meter if you stay you pay its 
               the rule

                               mathilda
               and how much is it

                               the boss
               ten dollars a month

     mathilda looks at them and pulls out a roll of 100 notes

                               mathilda
               got the change for 100

     the kid is impressed but tries not to show

                               the boss playing serious
               wait polys the treasurer
                         to poly
               poly have you got the change for 100

                               poly shrugging his shoulders
               why do you ask me  you know i havent a 
               dollar

     mathilda saves his face she hands him the note

                               mathilda
               its not serious  it means ill

     leon feels weird like he was falling in a trap without being 
     able to do anything  mathilda comes back with a glass of milk 
     she hands to leon  she lowers the tents to dim the strong 
     sunlight  mathilda heels down in front of him leon doesnt

     mathilda takes the glass from his hands and drinks half  she 
     passes her tongue along her lips to dry up the milk  leon 
     looks at her like a child in front of a sweet shop  she 
     returns his milk mathilda looks like a calm cat

     fingertip mathilda takes the milkdrop on leons lips and gets 
     it in her mouth  leon is going to cry

     face on leons lap who caresses her hair

               saying yes to  my mates told me the 
               first time they made love was awful  
               they had pain everywhere afterward
               but thats because they made it with men 
               they didnt love  in fact they did it 
               just to show off at the beginning 
               later they liked it  like 
               cigarettes

     leon closes his eyes kind of pain on his face

                         the door
               think

     mathilda gets out leon relaxes himself in the bed he shyly 
     opens his arms and learns how to exploit a bed

              

     inside the building
     mathilda comes back with her milk she gets out of the lift 
     and a hand covers her mouth

     the man is member of a swat team bulletproof jacket 
     gloves and uzi at hand hes not alone theyre seven

                               the boss low voice

               reply by nodding yes or shaking your head

               or something

     she approaches her hand to the wall two knocks three 
     knocks two knocks wrong code

     the boss is satisfied anyway he signs the group they get in 
     position mathilda in a corner a man remains with her

                               man
               dont fear

                               mathilda
               i have no fear

     the first three cops are in position the leader is nervous 
     everyone is ready he knocks the code on the door  reply 
     isnt late inside a classical music starts cops get in one 
     by one commando style  from the corridor one clearly sees 
     apartments open door and one clearly sees also the hand 
     above the door that sweetly closes

     in the corridor the other cops have no time they hear the 
     slaughter in progress shouts and shots for twenty seconds 
     then door opens again three corpses in the apartments 
     corridor the man with mathilda uses his walkietalkie

                               man
               shit we need reinforcements maximum 
               come on

     mathilda puts a hand in her parcel and pulls out a gun she 
     keeps along her body on doors side a small reflex its 
     leons periscope checking the other three cops progression

     two of them progress behind armored shields  suddenly 
     leons voice breaks the silence

                               leonshouting
               mathilda now

     leon appears from nowhere and empties his kalashnikov in the 
     corridor the three cops dont shoot for a long mathilda 
     lifts her arm kills the cop at lower landing and aims at the 
     cop who kept her

                               leonloud
               mathilda

     she appears in the corridor her hostage before her still 
     her milk with her leon is relieved

                               leon
               dont expose your back turn

     mathilda obeys and walks backward

     she needs her hostage for protection and he remains in front 
     of her leon covers her from the apartment

     a group of cops a dozen gets upstairs  leon breaks the 
     fire equipment niches glass unrolls the pipe in the 
     corridor throws the axe into the apartment and opens the 
     water at full pressure the pipe twists and beats all around 
     the corridor

     leon shoots reply is immediate fortunately mathilda is 
     behind her hostage his bulletproof jacket is insufficient 
     leon and mathilda get back in the apartment and close the 
     door leaving the hostage crucified on it

     mathilda is nervous  leon is concentrated

                               mathilda
               why did you unleash the pipe i dont 
               know

                               leon
               it will take them five minutes  how 
               long ago did they arrive

                               mathilda
               i dont know five minutes

                               leon
               good snipers cant be in position

     leon gets close to the wall and gets rid of the tents 
     allowing light to explode

     window explodes too they shoot like never before

                               leon
               ten minutes at least not five

     in the corridor cops eventually catch the pressurized pipe 
     and close the water on all fours leon and mathilda get in 
     the kitchen he gets the axe and the violin case by the way 
     mathilda is more and more nervous leon is more and more 
     concentrated

                               mathilda
               how shall we get out now leon

                               leon
               let me work well get out i tell you

     he shoots at the dustbin duct and makes it explode he 
     enlarges the hole by axe leon throws in the duct his 
     overcoat his sacks content and his violin grenades 
     weapons etc mathilda then throws in her teddy bear and 
     polaroid

     in the corridor sand bags are becoming a wall armored 
     shields and cops multiply  a cop gets in position with a 
     rocketlauncher and shoots the door explodes and smoke floods 
     the interior

     leon helps mathilda to get into the duct shes half in when 
     she seems to realize something

                               mathilda
               but leon youll never get in it 
               its nearly too small for me

                               leonsmiling

     mathilda starts crying

                               mathilda
               i love you too my darling

     he pushes her she disappears in the duct

     leon pushes his back against the hall and dries up his tears  
     he shouts terrifyingly  in the corridor three first line 
     cops progress with gas masks they decide to get in through 
     the destroyed door

     mathilda gets in the trash bin she carefully looks out 
     nobody around  she gets out and recovers some weapons

     apartment
     a wounded cop mask on his face gets out of the apartment 
     and out of the smoke cloud



               hes therefore protected and taken over 
               by another cop  he accompanies him a 
               little farther

     a boss
               get downstairs guy get down

     he slaps him on his shoulder the wounded cop obeys and gets 
     to the lower floor hes someway surprised when he realizes 
     the stairs are literally full of cops everywhere

     the wounded cop passes by his colleagues and gets down  cops 
     everywhere sandbags it looks like a trench warfare he 
     didnt yet pull his mask off  one makes him sit on a bench 
     and starts pulling off his mask  a doctor comes in and checks 
     out cops arm he pulls off his mask its leon

                               doctor
               its deep youd better get down to the 
               ambulance theyll care you properly  a 
               cop chief doesnt recognize leon

                               chief
               3rd district  a mess up there isnt 
               it

     leon nods yes

                               doctor
               let him breathe five minutes
                         to leon
               would you like me to take you down

     leon shakes his head no

                               leon
               let me put my mask on i breathe better 
               with it

                               doctor

               minutes ill get to check you ok

                               leon
               ok

     the chief gets away everything seems to work properly 
     theres just one thing leon didnt notice its stansfields 
     right hand climbing upstairs who identifies him and gets 
     back down mathilda got out

     she observes from a corner the movements in the street 
     police cars and ambulances all around

     in the apartment
     a cops checking out the apartment he pushes kitchens door 
     and a grenade falls to his feet  the explosion shakes the 
     whole corridor cops crowd it  below leon exploits the 
     moment to stand up and discreetly walk downstairs floor after 
     floor without problems

     slow motion

     behind him unheard and unseen stansfield follows him  
     stansfield rises his arm a gun at hand the gun aims at 
     leons back of the neck



     leon advances and can see just the light filled exit synonym 
     of freedom  but his vision gradually gets paler and the image 
     tilts without noise  the image is now completely inclined 
     and gets paler and paler overexposed image then suddenly 
     black

     leons died without even realizing it  mathilda is still 
     observing  stansfields right hand gets out of the building 
     and lifts an arm to the sky he wants everyones attention

                               right hand
               its alright we got him  its over

     some cops clap others whistle mathilda leans on the wall 
     and cries  stansfield is in the corridor near leon officers 
     are congratulating him

                               chief
               shit never seen anything like this 
               before

                               another
               he almost fucked me furthermore

                               stansfield
               he killed richmond my boss two days 
               ago and rinaldi too  weve been on 
               him for months

     a chief slaps on his shoulder but hes embittered he lost 
     many men too

                               chief
               nice shot

     slow motion

     mathilda appears she wears leons large overcoat a silenced 
     gun at hand her face is harsh and immobile like never before 
     in front of buildings entry two cops look at her stunned 
     this will be their last expression

     she gets in the corridor at the end stansfield laughs 
     together with his colleagues  mathilda advances until the 
     white sheet on the ground she crouches down lifts one end 
     leons got blood everywhere but his expression is sweet and 
     relaxed mathilda caresses his cheeks

     a man tips on stansfields back the group turns and sees the 
     little girl crouched near the corpse  mathilda kisses leons 
     mouth and stands up she leaves her gun on the floor

     she looks at stansfield straight in his eyes with a big 
     smile  stansfield doesnt understand mathilda pulls her hand 
     out of a pocket and launches something to him  stansfield 
     catches the object its a metal ring  stansfield understands 
     lesser and lesser

     mathilda opens her overcoat inside a dozen of grenades 
     everywhere one lacks its ring

     stansfield understands everything

     complete general absolute explosion

     the shockwave shakes everyone in the street  still in slow 
     motion thousands of debris fall on the street  a rain which 
     is even sadder than usual

     the end
