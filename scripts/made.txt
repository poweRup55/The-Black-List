               hall one is bobby the other is ricky they are drawn 
               together to start the bout by a bell and a hand gesture as 
               the referee backs away immediately the two fighters unload 
               a relentless barrage of power punches neither man is holding 
               back and the punches all find purchase in the swelling faces 
               of their opponent the crowd rises to its feet in appreciation 
               of this rare level of competition in the lower strata of the 
               heavyweight division

               industrial complex bobby walks past the many businesses 
               that share the structure in tandem

               men working in an auto body shop go about their business 
               but discreetly watch as the unfamiliar man passes bobby 
               carries himself with the proper amount of ambivalence he 
               then passes a loading dock which also has a secretive stench

               finally he arrives at a steel door above which is mounted 
               a video camera several generations past its prime

               a steel sign reads simply m and m contracting

               bobby is watching and thinking as brooklyn goes by horrace 
               seems distant

               ext icarus tavern  red hook  brooklyn  day

               the limo passes the corner and settles in front of the time 
               worn icarus tavern

               a young irish man stands out front smoking a fag the place 
               is open but the neon open sign is off

               int limousine  in front of the icarus  continuous

               they pop the doors

               case of cash the guy at the door watches them enter and 
               snuffs out his smoke

               int icarus tavern  red hook  continuous

               they enter the old world gin mill its dark theres a long 
               aged wooden bar and oak booths the floor boards are faded 
               and bowed a middleaged bartender reads the post by the 
               oversized beer taps he looks up over his reading glasses 
               without expression two young irish toughs stand up from a 
               booth and lead the men into the back room there is a silent 
               tension no sign of ricky

               int back room  icarus tavern  continuous

               even darker they slowly walk in sending cautious looks to 
               every corner a simple round table sits in the center of 
               this sparse dining room three rogues sit around it all 
               facing the door tom the welshman sits with his back to 
               the door they all have pints before them a muted 
               conversation ends as tom follows their stares over his 
               shoulder to see bobby and horrace enter silence for a beat 
               then

                                     welshman
                         here they are then

                                     horrace
                              falsely relaxed
                         hows it going

                                     welshman

                                     horrace
                         no thanks man we got to head out

                                     welshman

                         thats alright man its a little 
                         early for me to drink

               this draws an uncomfortably bass chuckle from the seven dark 
               characters now surrounding them

                                     welshman
                         nonsense well have three half pints 
                         of lager

               pat them down for guns

                                     welshman

                         couldnt make it heres the money

               horrace places the case on the table its weight makes a 
               loud thunk as it hits the hardwood he pops the catch and 
               lifts the lid wow thats a lot of money the toughs lose 
               their poker faces as their knees weaken from the sight of 
               it even bobby has to swallow as the devil blows on his nape 
               tom fingers the stacks

                                     horrace
                              anxious
                         give me your marker and well be on 
                         our way

               tom begins to write out a receipt

                                     welshman
                         i cant yet vouch for the amount 
                         unless you want me to sit here and 
                         count

                                     horrace

                         you took delivery

               then in what takes only a matter of seconds bobby has a 
               lockblade to his throat and horrace takes a truncheon to the 
               gut flooring him

                                     horrace

               the head of a tough with two beers ricky sips the third 
               lager

               the thug removes the blade from bobbys neck his eyes narrow 
               as he looks at the gun he notices something

                                     thug
                         thats a starter pistol

                         see the red plug in the barrel

               the toughs begin to relax and converge

                                     ricky
                              nervous

                         over 

               but the moment proves enough of a distraction for bobby to 
               unload a damaging combination to his captor he may not have 
               what it takes to cut it as a professional boxer but these 
               untrained goons are way outclassed he drops one like a lead 
               weight its about to get ugly as weapons are raised then
