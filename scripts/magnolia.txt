                      fighting and all of the violence was far 
                      too much for sydney barringer and knowing

                      three days prior for a set of window washers
                      that would have broken his fall and saved

     he removes his revolver from his holster and starts to move
     slowly down the hall to the back bedroom

                      of my motherfuckin bedroom

     kurring moves into the bedroom now and sees that the closet is
     closed and probably the only place for someone to be hiding

     floor of the closet  hed dead and hes been covered in dirty
     laundry  he has a gag around his mouth

     hold on jim for a moment he panics a little and swings his revolver
     towards marcie

                      really new that id never seen before 
                      fuckin hell id be in the money  because

                      reality they are all the same 
                      each and every one of them  and once you learn

                      for you  they will send a nurse someone 
                      who can take care of all of that for you  

                                linda

                      yeah

                                dr landon 
                      if youre happy with phil taking care
                      of him and helping you thats fine 
                      but contact hospice to arrange for the body  

                                linda 
                       you dont understand its more pain 
                      than before and the fucking morphine pills
                      arent working hes  past two days its 
                      like he cant really swallow them and i dont 
                      know if theyre going down  i cant see inside
                      his mouth anymore  im up all night staring
                      at him and i dont think the pills are going
                      down and he moans and he hurts  

                                dr landon 
                      we can fix that because i can give
                      you  are you listening 

                                linda 
                      im listening  im getting better 

                                dr landon 
                      do you wanna sit down 

                                linda 
                      i need to sit down

                                dr landon 
                      ok linda  earl is not gonna make it
                      hes dying he is  he is dying very
                      very rapidly  

     she breaks a bit more

                                dr landon 
                      now the thing here is making that experience 
                      as painless and easy as possible for him 
                      you understand  now you need to get in touch 
                      with hospice care because they can take care of
                      all those practical things that youre asking 
                      me about  they are who you call when he dies 

     he writes a number on his bussiness card hands it over as they speak

                                dr landon 
                      this is the number for hospice
                      ok now as far as the morphine pills go
                      there is something else to consider that
                      can take the pain away that he is in
                      there is a very strong and very potent solution
                      of liquid morphineits a little bottle
                      with an eye dropper and its easy to get in
                      his mouth and drop on his tounge and 
                      it will certainly diminish the pain that
                      he is in but you have to realize that
                      once you give it to him there really 
                      is no coming back i mean it will certainly
                      cure his pain but he will float in and 
                      out of consciousness even worse than he
                      is now linda  i mean any sign of the 
                      recognizable earl will pretty much go away  

                                linda 
                       how the fuck can i say anything 
                      to that  i dont know what to say to that  

                                dr landon 
                      the job here is to make him as comfortable 
                      as possible  right now  our job is to just
                      try and make it as painless as possible
                      right  you understand

                      your name change  they had no official

                                frank 
                      oh yeah  no no no  they wouldnt  

                                gwen
                      they wouldnt

                                frank 
                      no no no  certainly not  i wasnt
                      officialy enrolled thats right
                      was that unclear 

                                gwen
                      kind of

                                frank
                      i wouldnt want that to be misunderstood
                      my enrollment was totally unoffical because
                      i was sadly unable to afford tuition up 
                      there  but there were three wonderful men
                      who were kind enough to let me sit in on
                      their classes and theyre names are 
                      macready horn and langtree among others
                      i was completely independent financially
                      and like i said one sad sack a shit 
                      so what were looking at here is a true
                      rags to riches story and i think thats 
                      what most people respond to in seduce
                      and at the end of the day hey  it may not 
                      even be about picking up chicks and sticking your
                      cock in it  its about finding what you can be
                      in this world  defining it  controling it and 
                      saying i will take what is mine  you just happen 
                      to get a blow job out of it then heywhatthefuck
                      whynot  hehehe

                      out of the way before we enjoy our 
                      coffee i never like to talk shop over coffee
                      im not gonna write you up or anything
                      im not gonna give you a citation here  
                      but the real problem we have is that there
                      are people around here people that 
                      work from their homes people tryin to get
                      some work done and if youre listenin to 
                      your music that loud  theyre incovenienced
                      by that  if you had a job youd probably
                      understand but i see you like listenin 
                      to your music and thats fine youre just 
                      gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume
                      maybe memorize what number you see on the
                      dial and just always put it to that  
                      if its the middle of the day  thats 
                      what i do  just put it on two and a half 
                      and thats a good listening level alright 
                      i see you like listenin to your music loud
                      but hey forget about the neighbors you
                      end up damaging your own ears ok

                      have to go to the laws of intestacy 
                      which is  as if someone died without a will

                                kligman 
                      the money would go to frank  the court 
                      would put the money in the hands of a relative  

                                linda
