               wilkins and barnes one white one black slowly walk past 
               the pm check

               the procedure is routine done without emotion as it is 
               done three times a day the black guard calls out the 
               prisoners name the prisoner answers with his number then 
               steps into his cell whereupon the white guard slams the 
               door shut and locks it

               two experienced prisoners who have been watching malcolm 
               during the scene they whisper surreptitiously without moving 
               their bodies and barely moving their

               lips one of the prisoners is pete a huge barrel of a man 
               a lifer  beaten by the system and a lifetime of 
               incarceration the other is bembry a man of no great 
               physicality but who possesses immediately the gift of 
               leadership it is clear that pete and others look up to him 
               with great respect

                                     pete

                         i see him

               bembrys language is very unhip he speaks carefully he 
               respects words and he respects himself something which sets 
               him apart from all the other prisoners

               malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades 
               over his broken body he lets it run and run but it cannot 
               really touch his problems on a nearby bench are his clothes 
               his towel and the makings for a conk lye vaseline comb 
               etc

               he turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by 
               someone its bembry standing nearby malcolm turns away 
               trying to find solace in the water he wants no part of the 
               world or anyone just to be left alone

                                     bembry
                         i know how you feel like you want

               he puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to malcolms 
               things

               malcolm eyes him like a snake  but the punishment has 
               reduced him to deep insecurity and his belligerence is more 
               cautious than angry

                                     malcolm

               and empties the contents of the matchbox into it and drinks

               like him he eyes him closely as he slips into his clothes

                                     malcolm
                         what in the hell are you talking 
                         about

               he begins to conk his hair but is paying attention to what 
               bembry is saying

                                     bembry

               malcolm looks over piqued

                                     bembry
                         nobody can bust out like bogart does 
                         it in the movies because even if 
                         you get out you are still in prison

               malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now

                                     malcolm
                         you aint lying

                         man wants you to do look at you

               these last words are spoken sharply with disgust malcolm 
               turns his hands massaging the conk into his hair

                                     bembry
                         putting all that poison in your hair

                                     malcolm

                                     malcolm

                         with my head all nappy looking like

                         like what you are what makes you 
                         ashamed of being black

                                     malcolm
                         i aint said im ashamed

               he turns the water on to wash out the conk  which has begun 
               to burn

               bembry restrains him holding his arm

                                     malcolm
                         leggo i got to wash it out

                         then

               but it is burning now

                                     malcolm
                         man you better get off me

               he wrenches away from bembry and puts his head in the water

                                     bembry
                         sure burn yourself pain yourself 
                         put all that poison into your hair 
                         into your body  trying to be white

                                     malcolm
                         man i dont want to hear all that

                                     bembry

                         just another one of them cats 
                         strutting down the avenue in your

                         you like a monkey and the white 
                         man sees you and he laughs he laughs 
                         because he knows you aint white

               malcolm is drying his hair finishing his conk but some of 
               what bembry has said disturbs him

                                     malcolm
                         who are you

               malcolm is completely humiliated bembry sees this and stops 
               the barrage

                                     bembry
                         the question is who are you you 
                         are in the darkness but its not

                         fix i thought you were smart

               and he is gone malcolm stands looking after him a long 
               thoughtful moment he is pulling the comb through his hair

               int prison license shop  day

               finishes license plates bembry is on the stamping machines

               of someone taking communion with bembry the minister and 
               malcolm the communicant

               their voices are little more than whispers

                                     bembry

                         a muslim must be strikingly upright 
                         outstanding so those in the darkness 
                         can see the power of the light

                         was brutalizing us 100 years ago

                         from resisting the bloodhounds or

                         muhammad is telling the white man 
                         get this powder keg out of your house 
                         let the black people in this country 
                         separate from him while theres still 
                         time and if the black man is allowed 
                         to separate and go on onto some land 
                         of his own where he can solve his 
                         problems then there wont be any

                         politics and nonviolence in the 
                         past i thought the thoughts spoke

                         muhammad that day is over from now

                         my own thoughts internal differences 
                         within the nation of islam forced me 
                         out of it i did not leave of my own 
                         free will but now that it has 
                         happened i intend to make the most 
                         of it now that i have more 
                         independence of action i intend to 
                         use a more flexible approach toward 
                         working with others to get a solution 
                         to this problem i do not pretend to 
                         be a divine man but i do believe in 
                         divine guidance divine power and 
                         in the fulfillment of divine prophecy 
                         i am not educated nor am i an expert 
                         in any particular field but i am 
                         sincere and my sincerity is my 
                         credentials im not out to fight 
                         other negro leaders or organizations 
                         we must find a common solution to a 
                         common problem i am going to organize

                         indictments of all white people and 
                         these generalizations have caused 
                         injuries to some white folks who did 
                         not deserve them because of the 
                         spiritual rebirth which i was blessed

                         i no longer subscribe to sweeping

                         be careful not to sentence anyone 
                         who has not been proven guilty im

                         malcolm you said on your trip abroad 
                         you sensed a feeling of great 
                         brotherhood

                                     malcolm
                         as i recall i pointed out that while 
                         i was in mecca making the pilgrimage 
                         i spoke about the brotherhood that 
                         existed at all levels among all 
                         people all colors who had accepted 
                         the religion of islam i pointed out 
                         that what it had done islam for 
                         those people despite their complexion 
                         differences that it would probably 
                         do america well to study the religion 
                         of islam and perhaps it could drive 
                         some of the racism from this society 
                         muslims look upon themselves as human 
                         beings as part of the human family 
                         and therefore look upon all other 
                         segments of the human family as part 
                         of that same family today my friends

                         the united nations at this point and 
                         ask that charges be brought against

                         yes as i pointed out that during my 
                         trip that nations african nations 
                         asian latin nations look very

                         saying nothing about the racist 
                         practices that are manifested everyday 
                         against negroes in this society i 
                         would be not a man if i didnt do 
                         so i wouldnt be a man

                         certainly we will work with any 
                         groups organizations or leaders in

                                     malcolm
                         no not particularly but i do think 
                         that you will and black people in 
                         america as they strive to throw off 
                         the shackles of mental colonialism 
                         will also probably reflect an effort 
                         to throw off the shackles of cultural 
                         colonialism and then theyll begin 
                         to reflect desires of their own with 
                         standards of their own

                         one of your more controversial remarks 
                         was a call for black people to get 
                         rifles and form rifle clubs sometime 
                         back do you still favor that for

                                     malcolm
                         i dont see why that should be 
                         controversial i think that if white 
                         people found themselves victim of 
                         the same kind of brutality that black 
                         people in this country face and 
                         they saw that the government was 
                         either unwilling or unable to protect 
                         them that the intelligence on the 
                         part of the whites would make them 
                         get some rifles and protect 
                         themselves

                         went away have you put up your guns
