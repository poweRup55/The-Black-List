ext coastal road  night

open on a highway road in a remote coastal town  we see car headlights 
approach
and we see its a convertible with the top down an old 60s sportscar beatup but
cool  

the driver is jim trudell he winds his way down the road
hes in good shape and carries the look of a man who has seen and done much in his
32 years  

the road is desolate except for a lone roadhouse bar up in the distance  jim sees
it and heads toward it  

										cut to
ext roadhouse bar  night

as jim approaches it we see the lot littered with bikers and harleys  regulars

jim slows down and pulls up into the driveway  

we see two large men lurch and weener stagger out the front door  they are very
drunk and looking for trouble

jim gets out of his car and coolly surveys the rowdy bar  

lurch stops and looks ahead  he sees jim approach the front door  he slaps weener
on the arm  
				lurch
		how much you give me to fuck with 
		this guy

 				weener
		how about nothin

				lurch
		youre on

jim approaches the front door  lurch greets him gregariously  

				lurch
		a hearty good evening to ya theres a 
		50 dollar cover charge tonight

jim nods realizing theyre drunk  he heads toward the front door but lurch
stands in front of him blocking his access
		
jim smiles weakly at the idiot simply wanting to get by

				jim
		funny

				lurch
		didnt you hear what i said

jim goes to head in but lurch stops him by jamming his hand into jims chest 
lurch smiles at him  

				lurch
		fifty bucks

weener muffles a laugh  jim smiles and calmly moves lurchs hand away  

				jim
		yeah i remember when i had my 
		first beer  goodnight guys

lurch grabs jim by the arm and yanks him back outsidehe shoves his palm into
jims chest againhardknocking jim backwards

				lurch
		you should watch your attitude
		around here

in a flash jim grabs the manss hand twisting the wrist backwards sending lurch
to his knees

 				jim
		thanks for the advice

										cut to
int bar  night

the bar is smoky loud and crowded  he winds his way through the unruly crowd to
the bar 

he sees a skeletal leatherfaced bartender pouring whiskies and beers  
he is at
the other end of the bar serving a customer

jim scans the bar  pool players biker music a rowdy crowd

then suddenly something catches jims eye  he tracks it across the room

we see a sexy woman enterthe head of every local patron turns in her direction
shes clearly out of place in this establishment as she heads through the crowd
arrives at a  payphone and makes a call 

jim eyes her as the bartender approaches him she hangs up apparently frustrated
she seems apprehensive about something

				bartender

				jim
		you know the nearest place to stay
		around here

				bartender
			shrugs
		south of here i dunno

				jim
		you know about how far down

				bartender
			    irritated
		what do i look like a travel
		agent  now you want to order or
		what

jim reacts to the noninformation he just received  hed just as soon leave but
he sees the woman make her way toward the bar not really noticing jim

jim gestures to the tap  

				jim
		give me a beer

the bartender pours the shot and plunks down the beer  

				bartender
		three

jim pays and the bartender goes to the cash register

the woman waits for the bartender and looks over at jim then scans the room
before looking up at the tv behind the bar

jim takes this opportunity to inconspicuously glance at the woman  she takes note
of jim  she is very sexy a mysterious air about her

she looks forward at the tv  

the bartender looks over the girl as he approaches her



				bartender
		what will it be darlin

				woman

				bartender
			   stonefaced
		we dont have  stoli   and
		i just ran out of tonic

she looks at him  

				woman
		how about a glass of water  or are
		you out of glasses

the bartender smirks and gets her some water  jim and the woman exchange looks  

				jim
		its that kinda service thatll
		keep me comin here

the woman smiles faintly and looks ahead preoccupied

				lurchos
		hey  hot dog

the woman turns around to see the group surrounding them  weener lurch and 
three
big mean bikers  lurch stares at jim  the others ogle the woman  

the bartender scowls at the two men  

				bartender
		i told you two to get outta here

lurch stares down the bartender with hostile eyes

				lurch
		make us ya old fart

the bartender grabs a sawedoff bat under the bar but one of the bikers slams the
bartenders hand to the counter  

lurch then directs his attention to jim and the woman

				lurch
		hot dog thinks he owns the place

jim shakes his head to himself as if he knows whats gonna happen  its routine
to him

the woman senses real trouble but turns away and plays it cool 
				lurch
		whats your name sweet thing 
			gestures to jim
 		are you with chickenshit here  huh

weener cackles along with the three other goons surrounding them  jim keeps his
cool

				lurch
		huh

lurch staggers then gains his footing

				weener
		i think shes ignoring you lurch

				lurch
		excuse me but im talking to you
		are you ignoring me

then finally the woman slowly turns and looks lurch up and down
				woman
		now why would i want to ignore
		a fat drunken slob like you  

lurchs buddies go oooooohhh and laugh at this affront but lurch is not amused

				lurch
		you know i ought to teach you
		some manners

lurch grabs the woman by the arm and yanks her close to him

jim moves yanking lurchs hand off the girl and staring him down  

				jim
		thats it  shows over

lurch swings  jim deflects the punch and smashes lurch across the face  

lurch crashes to the ground  

lurch staggers up and whips out a switchblade people back up  

the woman looks at jim fearing the worst  

lurch takes a furious drunken swing at jim  

jim ducks and pow  grabs lurchs wrist  

jim slams the blade down into the felt of a pool table before delivering a
combination that sends lurch spinning and crashing into a table of drinks  

biker 1 swings his mallet fist at jims face but jim slaps it to a stop twists it
hard  tendons snap as jim flips him on his ass  

weener lunges and grabs jim around the waist sending them to the ground  

jim flips weener off of him and rolls to his feet  as weener staggers up and jim
lands a devastating roundhouse kick to the skull which drops him  

biker 2 approaches from behind but jim backhands his face  
biker 3 connects with jim across the jaw  jim lashes into him with a 
combination
that shatters his nose  

lurch springs to life brandishing a pool cue  people clear 

lurch charges jim swinging the cue furiously  we hear it whipping through the air
 

jim waits for the right time before grabbing the cue and wrenching it out of
lurchs hands  

weener approaches from behind and jim juts the back of the cue into his ribs  we
hear a bone crack  jim smashes  him to the ground turning around just as biker 2
charges  

jim stabs the back of the cue into the bikers face and a lightning fast kick sends
him colliding into the barstools  

lurch makes a final charge and wham jim shatters the pool cue over lurchs 
skull
ending the melee

jim holds the broken cue looking for anyone else who wants to start up  no one
does

then jim looks toward the woman  she stares hard at him  

he surveys the destruction  throws the pool cue to the ground  

the bartender runs around the bar

jim strikes back hard deflecting the blows and returning a lightning fast
combination that stuns marvosa  

meanwhile stephanie grabs for marvosas 45  

marvosa grabs a garbage can and hurls it at jim  

jim deflects it as marvosa pulls out a switchblade
