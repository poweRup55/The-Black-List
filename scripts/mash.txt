               ext landing area outside 4077th mash – day

               our attention is concentrated on a sign reading this is 
               where it is – parallel 38 below these words arrows point 
               to north korea in one direction south korea in opposite 
               one two air rescue helicopters are coming in low from the 
               north descending to a point just outside the entrance to 
               the hospital admitting ward

               transferring our attention to the helicopters our gaze goes 
               from the first sign to a second one on which all we can 
               read at first are the very large letters mash moving 
               closer to the helicopters as they hit the ground we can 
               make out the rest of the sign above the four large letters 
               it says 4077th and then we see there is the remainder of 
               a word following each of the large letters but in much 
               smaller print so that mash becomes mobile army surgical 
               hospital the helicopters land and enlisted men of the us 
               army medical corps carry two wounded soldiers from each into 
               the admitting ward

               lieutenant colonel henry blake a permanent member of the 
               medical corps and commanding officer of the 4077th watches 
               grimly as the wounded are borne from the helicopters into 
               his hospital corporal radar oreilly with a long thin 
               neck large ears and a knack for anticipating his colonels 
               wishes moves up close behind him

               he interrupts himself frightened by the intense expression 
               on radars face the corporals head is turning back and 
               forth like an actual radar receiver monitoring the northern 
               horizon where the valley of a river meanders between 
               mountainous ridges

                         oreilly what is it
                              appalled at the 
                              thought
                         there arent more choppers coming

                                     henry

                         handle now get on the phone right 
                         away and

                         general hammond in seoul for you 
                         you think hell finally break down 
                         and give us two more surgeons

               the distant sound of more helicopters becomes faintly audible 
               to the normal human ear and a moment later one appears over 
               a ridge

               and are heading toward them hawkeye goes into action quickly 
               starting the jeep engine

               the jeep starts off at its maximum takeoff speed and 
               accelerates dangerously as it careens out of the hospital 
               grounds

                                                                time lapse

               hawkeye and duke are driving the jeep along the muddy road – 
               they come upon a sign which fills a large part of the screen 
               last chance before peking a short distance behind the 
               sign it is now revealed are three parked us army trucks 
               in front of which parades a group of korean prostitutes from 
               fourteen to fortyfive

               despite the autumn weather their costumes mixed american 
               mail order and korean are chosen for seductive appeal rather 
               than warmth

                         must be the famous curb service whore

               they now have a fairly clear view of a gi and a korean female 
               lying in tight formation in the bed on one of the trucks 
               their activity only partially concealed by a blanket

               hawkeye stops the jeep as they come to a place in the road 
               where they can get a downward look at their future home the 
               river valley in which the 4077th mash is situated is almost 
               surrounded by mountains the components of the post are spread 
               out in a rough horseshoe with a large compound of level ground 
               in the middle at the closed end of the horseshoe is the 
               main hospital building made of wood with a tin roof marked 
               by a large red cross everything else is canvas to the left 
               of the main building are strung out the admitting ward 
               laboratory dental clinic mess hall px showers tent barber 
               tent and the enlisted mens tents on the right side are the 
               postop ward officers tents nurses tents korean domestics 
               tents and finally the officers club in the fg from 
               duke and hawkeyes angle are four helicopters belonging to 
               the 5th air rescue squadron and the signs we have already 
               seen marking the post and the 38th parallel

                                     hawkeye
                         well there it is jesus

                                     duke
                         the spot we picked to spend the 
                         winter maybe we ought to look a 
                         little harder

               int mash mess hall – day

               as hawkeye and duke enter the large tent has two floor levels 
               separated by a railing into a section for officers and one 
               for enlisted men the two groups being much closer to 
               numerical equality here than in an ordinary military 
               installation there is a further voluntary piece of 
               segregation within the officers section the men – medical 
               officers plus a couple of administrative officers and a 
               helicopter pilot – are at one long rectangular table the 
               nurses ranging in rank from second lieutenant to captain 
               at another

               hawkeye starts to lead the way to an empty table in the 
               officers section but duke calls his attention to the 
               outstanding feature of the nurses table lieutenant dish 
               24 blonde and clearly even in her winter fatigues the 
               sexiest looking nurse in military history

                                     duke
                         what do you think of that piece of 
                         scenery yankee boy

                                     hawkeye
                         finest kind well sit where we can 
                         get the best view

               accordingly they select seats close to the nurses and facing 
               the lieutenant some personnel are on duty in the hospital 
               during this lunch period but beside dish two of the 
               following three nurses with whom we will become acquainted 
               are present here

               knocko who is black a captain in her thirties solidly 
               built very strong and very competent in her job leslie 
               also a captain not more than thirty bright attractive 
               cheerful the kind of girl that brings out the latent male 
               matrimonial instinct but who strangely is treated as 
               inviolate by the by the sexstarved men of the post and 
               lieutenant scorch who cant match dish or leslie by physical 
               standards but has the asset of instant availability

               a korean boy not yet of military age in green fatigue pants 
               and an offwhite coat appears promptly and heaps duke and 
               hawkeyes plates with food duke is hungry enough to turn 
               his whole attention to the meal but hawkeye is unable to 
               keep his eyes off lieutenant dish while eating thus neither 
               of them is aware of the attention they are getting from the 
               male officers group which includes henry a couple of 
               medical captains named murrhardt and bandini dago red 
               officially father john patrick mulcahy redhaired catholic 
               chaplain of the area and the painless pole captain walter 
               zaldowski dental officer both in their thirties and 
               captain ugly john black an australian anesthesiologist

               there is also curiosity about the newcomers from the unlisted 
               mens section where we see among others radar vollmer 
               henrys overweight sargeant major corporal judson young 
               black and fresh from mississippi private boone who looks 
               too young and nervous to be in any mans army and pfc 
               seidman whose first trip out of new york has taken him 
               halfway around the world

               henry who alone has reason to be personally affronted by

               important part there is a rumble of artillery in the 
               distance

               to the canvas then as they approach it they become aware 
               of a youthful korean voice reading in heavily accented 
               english words that have no meaning for the speaker

               hawkeye grabs it expertly at the tape with his left hand 
               duke puts his left hand above that and duke is left with 
               his right hand waving in the air with nothing to grab

               there are three operations going on at once here all 
               personnel wear white caps and masks and it is hard to identify 
               individuals except that at close range we can distinguish 
               hawkeye by his glasses and duke by his eyes and his build 
               they are working together with great efficiency and an 
               instinctive collaboration that seems to require no verbal 
               exchange what we see them do without necessarily recognizing 
               the portion of anatomy involved is to cut out a section of 
               bowel damaged by a shell fragment and start sewing the 
               divided ends together

               hawkeye and duke are working together on the last stages of 
               a leg amputation this time there is no doubt about the 
               surgical process we are watching we see the almost severed 
               leg and the process of controlling bleeding then the limb 
               is actually separated from its stump and handed by duke to a 
               corpsman hawkeye speaks to the nurse standing behind him

               watching her dip the pack into a warm solution and wring it 
               out he recognizes despite cap and mask that it is 
               lieutenant dish his eyes linger on hers for a brief moment

                                                                time lapse

               lieutenant dish comes out of the operating room tears in 
               her eyes trying to control her sobs and moves just outside 
               the circle of light from the fixture over the entrance there 
               no longer under observation she lets herself cry hawkeye 
               comes out the door registers surprise at the sight of her 
               just as if he hadnt followed her out he moves to her side 
               and puts a comforting arm around her

               she looks up just long enough to see who it is then buries 
               her head on his shoulder as his other arm goes around her

               she doesnt move her head from the way he has arranged it 
               and her lips are very close to his he kisses her and it 
               turns out from the ardent way she responds thats what she 
               wanted him to do

               hojon goes out duke and hawkeye settle back to enjoy their 
               drinks but they both come bolt upright when they see frank 
               drop to his knees by his cot and begin to intone the lords 
               prayer

               ext mash compound – dusk

               hawkeye and lieutenant dish are walking close together in an 
               otherwise deserted area

                                     hawkeye
                         cold

               he puts an arm around her without waiting for an answer she 
               smiles at him fondly

                                     lieutenant dish

               he kisses her and they cling together standing outside a 
               tent identified by a sign officers club

                                     lieutenant dish
                         oh hawkeye i dont think i could 
                         stick it out these next few weeks

               hawkeye opens the door of the officers club looks in

                                     hawkeye
                         nobody here

               he steps aside to let her precede him in there is nothing 
               inside except a pool table she hesitates he takes her in 
               his arms again this time pressing his hands against the 
               seat of her fatigue pants

                                     lieutenant dish

                         captain pierces

               hawkeye lets go of her and they try to look like innocent 
               strollers

                                     hawkeye
                         hi hojon how they goin

                                                          brief time lapse

               ext the swamp – dusk

               the wooden front of the tent has a new sign identifying it 
               as the swamp

               int the swamp – dusk

               first we see hawkeye sitting on his cot looking across the 
               tent at the newcomer attached to the canvas wall behind him 
               is a photograph of his wife and two sons aged four and two 
               next we turn our attention to duke on the adjoining cot 
               formerly franks he also has a family picture on display 
               his wife twoyearold daughter and an infant then we get 
               our first glimpse of trapper john their new tentmate about 
               30 tall and very thin his head pretty well hidden inside 
               the hood of a parka he is using cellophane tape to install 
               one of the popular nude photos of the day such as the one 
               of marilyn monroe that circulated so widely in the early 
               1950s

               silently taking in everything that is done or said

               finished with his decorating effort trapper reaches into 
               the depths of his parka to produce a can of beer he digs 
               into the other side finds an opener and opens the beer 
               then his head goes back inside the parka along with the can 
               as he takes a swig from it

                         hojon

               hojon goes to the table and takes a few ice cubes from a 
               hospital icebag puts them into the pitcher along with gin 
               and a dash of vermouth

                                     trapper

                         country

               hojon pours three waterglasses full of martini and starts 
               to distribute them

                                     hawkeye

               he reaches into his parka comes up with a bottle of olives 
               takes one out and puts it into the martini hojon serves 
               him then as hawkeye and duke gape at him he offers them 
               the bottle

                                                                time lapse

               int operating room – day

               there are two operations going on one of them being a simple 
               procedure requiring one surgeon and one nurse the other by 
               contrast is a very special event trapper is operating 
               assisted by another surgeon a couple of nurses a corpsman 
               and the anesthesiologist ugly john black beside these actual 
               participants almost all the nurses and doctors from both 
               shifts including duke hawkeye with lieutenant dish frank 
               and henry are in a circle around the operating table as 
               spectators

               trappers job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery or 
               some other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart and 
               involving a large chest incision we see enough of the process 
               to observe that it is gory and deep inside a critical area 
               but necessarily it is the reactions of the people watching 
               especially duke and hawkeye that tell us how tricky an 
               operation it is and how expertly trapper is handling it

               the sequence is silent except for incidental operating room 
               noises

               even trappers occasional terse instructions to his assistants 
               and his brief exchange with ugly john are spoken too low for 
               us to hear

               there are four stages to the action

               1 the beginning of the operation before an attentive 
               audience drawn by their interest in the new man and by the 
               fact that this is a surgical procedure they have never dared 
               to attempt

               2 limited approval and professional respect for the assurance 
               with which trapper plots his incision and starts working his 
               way to his destination

               3 mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached the 
               suspense reaches its crest during the few moments when trapper 
               is doing the actual mending job to which all the preliminaries 
               have led the faces of his colleagues express anxiety and 
               hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do and 
               accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to survive 
               henry not certain of his own judgment looks to duke for 
               confirmation and duke nods to indicate he thinks trapper 
               has the situation under control

               4 the tension breaks as trapper finishes the job to his 
               satisfaction and begins along with his assistant surgeon 
               to close up henrys smile of relief is unsure and only 
               tentative until he catches hawkeyes signal that the job has 
               been done to perfection

                                                                time lapse

               ext mash compound – day

               trapper hawkeye and duke emerge from the hospital in 
               fatigues some enlisted men are tossing a football around 
               one of them makes a wild throw and the ball rolls to a stop 
               at trappers feet he stops to look at it and the other two 
               halt with him then very slowly trapper leans over and picks 
               up the ball waving hawkeye downfield

               hawkeye complies unquestioningly and when he is about thirty 
               yards away trapper whips a perfect pass into his arms 
               hawkeye just stands where he is holding the ball oblivious 
               of the enlisted men who want it back as trapper and duke 
               continue toward him

               revelation jolts him with apocalyptic force

                         like that a man could just live on 
                         his reputation

               the enlisted men increasingly concerned about their football 
               are muttering mutinously to each other hawkeye is too carried 
               away about trappers identity to notice this till trapper 
               calls it to his attention

               hawkeye looks at the football and at the enlisted men and 
               finally getting the point throws it back to them

               which an army truck full of gis has just pulled up while 
               hawkeye and duke explain whats going on to trapper and the 
               three of them move in for a closer look we see the visiting 
               gis drop one by one from the rear of the truck pay their 
               admission fees and take their places in the line leading up 
               to the strategically placed peep hole in the rear corner of

                         just a card game

               the priest couldnt have reported a more ominous symptom

               carrying a heavy box approach the tent

               touches of elegance gathered from all over the post – to 
               resemble a luxurious bedroom on the home front lying in bed 
               the pool table between clean inviting sheets is painless 
               the boys have undressed him as we can see by his bare

               she doesnt notice hawkeye has given her the sheet and made

               drops the sheet

               the tent flap drops into place continuing the movement of

               there is the sound of a helicopter overhead hawkeye emerges 
               from the tent to look at it verifying that it is coming 
               from the peaceful south rather than the embattled north 
               then he sees lieutenant dish coming out of her tent wearing 
               her army uniform and followed by one of the enlisted men 
               carrying her bags hawkeye waves goodbye but dish doesnt 
               see him her face seen up close has a serene faraway look 
               neither happy nor unhappy but enriched by experience

               hawkeye is not distressed by her failure to acknowledge him 
               he understands its a question of preoccupation and not a 
               deliberate snub he starts across the compound to the mess 
               hall noting that the helicopter is descending to land on 
               the far side of the hospital

               others in the greeting party are out of the habit of saluting 
               and have to be reminded by a stern look from their commanding 
               officer

               as henry and hot lips followed by the others head for the 
               hospital entrance lieutenant dish appears with the enlisted 
               man behind her

               she gets into the helicopter and he lifts her bags in after

                         captain ive been observing the 
                         nurses on your shift but naturally 
                         your own opinion is more informed 
                         than mine

                                     hawkeye
                         im glad you feel that way major

                         doctors nurses enlisted men and 
                         i feel responsible for my whole team

                         with them

                         major burns is far from satisfied

                                     hawkeye
                         that dont surprise me if youre a 
                         good observer you must have observed 
                         by now that frank burns is a jerk

                                     hot lips
                         on the contrary ive observed hes 
                         not only a good technical surgeon 
                         hes a good military surgeon and 
                         that includes how a man dresses and 
                         how he bears himself and his sense 
                         of what it means to be an officer in 
                         the united states army

                                     hawkeye
                         and his track record that dont 
                         count look honey when you watch 
                         the two shifts try to notice which 
                         one does the most work with the least 
                         fuss

                                     hot lips
                         ive noticed that both nurses and 
                         enlisted men address you as hawkeye

                                     hawkeye
                         its my name maybe that sounds silly

                                     hot lips
                         that kind of familiarity is 
                         inconsistent with maximum efficiency 
                         in a military organization

                                     hawkeye

                         corps

               clear picture of the kind of female she is she responds to 
               the kiss fervently pressing her lips and body against his 
               but the moment she decides to end it she switches right back

               finished saying it she suddenly realizes there is something

               the locale is established by the presence of military 
               personnel in uniform and the fact that a korean army doctor 
               with the aid of one assistant is examining in quick 
               succession a long line of naked young korean boys hojons 
               turn comes up and we see how perfunctory the process is a 
               brief overall scrutiny for visible defects a blood pressure 
               reading and the application of a stethoscope to a few key 
               spots hojon looks healthy and the doctor is startled by 
               the unexpected reaction he gets on applying the stethoscope 
               to the boys heart he turns to check the blood pressure 
               figure which his assistant is about to record on the form he 
               has taken from hojon

               apparently the pressure is just as outofline as the 
               heartbeat and the doctor feels hojon is ineligible for 
               military service

                         is much too fast and his blood 
                         pressure is dangerously high

                              abruptly to assistant

                              as hawkeye turns and 
                              sees them
                         i have been making examination of 
                         this young man to find if he will be 
                         soldier in our army

                                     hawkeye
                         yes i know hi hojon how did it 
                         go

                         i dont liking it at all what i 
                         hear when i listen to the heart and 
                         such a blood pressure for so young a 
                         boys is frightening

                                     hawkeye
                         im sorry to hear that you think 
                         hes unfit for military service

                         at first is no doubt but then i am 
                         seeing on his paper he work in 
                         american hospital and i think there 
                         are so many drugs in such a places 
                         he could take some by mistake

                                     hawkeye
                         why would he do that

                         who is knowing but the drug i have 
                         find in his urine is solving all 
                         mysteries by tomorrow will be gone 
                         his fast heart and high blood 
                         pressure so i think maybe you will 
                         like to tell him goodbye okay

               he gives hawkeye a warm smile and leaves the two of them 
               alone its clear from hawkeyes expression that he has no 
               choice but to admit defeat

               small missiles propelled with considerable force strike the 
               canvas but it is only when they roll back to the ground 
               that we can identify them as golf balls a closer look at 
               the ground area reveals a dozen other balls scattered around 
               and then we see two korean houseboys appear from protected 
               places on the sides of the tent looking carefully to make 
               sure there are no more balls coming and proceed to gather 
               up those on the ground during this action there is the sound 
               of a helicopter landing near the hospital

               extreme stage in the view we now get of hawkeye and trapper

               dirty tshirt of some unlikely color trapper a sport shirt 
               that looks as if he had picked it up in hawaii on the way 
               over and worn it ever since both are unshaven

               each has a wellequipped golf bag into which he now replaces 
               the iron club he has been using for the mediumrange shots 
               they have been practicing taking out drivers they set tees 
               in the ground and as the houseboys run up with the balls 
               trapper indicates they will be shooting down the longest 
               dimension of the field after addressing the balls with a 
               few practice swings they deliver expert drives that are not 
               only in the 250yard range but fairly straight in the intended 
               direction

                         or not without some practice

               int army car – day

               there is silence between sergeant gorman and his passengers 
               as the military hospital comes into view but something else 
               comes into view in the distance at the same time the 
               unmistakable contours of a golf course

                                     trapper

               they are coming to a stop in front of the hospital

                                                          brief time lapse

               int 25th station hospital – day

               a pretty wac sits behind a reception desk doing a job so 
               utterly routine she doesnt even look up from her magazine 
               when hawkeye puts a question to her

                                     hawkeye
                         wheres the congressmans son at 
                         honey

                                     pretty wac
                         ward six

               but then she does glimpse enough of their costumes to take a 
               full look and her reaction indicates clearly that she is 
               not prepared for unkempt unmilitarylooking men carrying 
               golf bags

                                     pretty wac
                         hey you cant go in there who are 
                         you

                         my favorite caddie

                                     pretty wac
                         well you cant go in no till you 
                         tell me your business and i check 
                         with colonel merrills office

                                     hawkeye
                              relenting
                         well if you must know

               but trapper has meanwhile made a feint toward the door to 
               which the pretty wac responds by rising and interposing 
               herself in his path

                                     trapper
                              to hawkeye
                         hold it if this soldier enforces 
                         her own orders im ready to take 
                         her on anxious single combat

               he moves toward the girl who holds her ground staunchly 
               till they are almost in contact then she takes a step back 
               and continues to take one step backwards for each one of his 
               in her direction when they get close to the door her 
               resistance collapses entirely and she scurries back to her 
               seat at the desk where she grabs the phone as trapper and 
               hawkeye march through the door

                                     pretty wac
                              into phone

               int 25th station hospital – day

               all personnel american and japanese who like the koreans 
               at mash do the menial work react in surprise to the sight 
               of trapper and hawkeye making their way around a few corners 
               till they find ward six

                                                          brief time lapse

               int ward six – day

               two golf bags are propped against the foot of the 
               congressmans sons bed trapper listens closely to the boys 
               chest while hawkeye bends down to his ear to reassure him a 
               ward nurse hovers near him not actually cooperating with 
               them but not defying them either

                                     hawkeye
                              to congressmans son
                         dont worry son thats captain 
                         mcintyre and hes the best chest 
                         surgeon in the far east and maybe in 
                         the whole us army hell fix you 
                         up fine your daddy saw to that

                                     trapper
                         just like we thought its a routine 
                         problem nurse whos in charge of 
                         operating room preparations

               by the time he has begun his question to her the ward nurse 
               has spotted someone approaching of whom she is in obvious 
               dread and it is at this figure that she points by way of 
               answer a firece looking nurse corps captain

                                     ward nurse
                         shshshe is

               anticipating that a major confrontation is about to take 
               place trapper and hawkeye decide to keep it away from their 
               patients beside accordingly they pick up their golf bags 
               and go to meet the advancing captain

                                     nurse corps captain
                         what are you hoodlums doing in this 
                         hospital

               int 25th station hospital operating room – day

               captain eb me lay marston is the anesthesiologist at the 
               25th

               wearing gown cap and mask he is busily at work checking 
               the congressmans son to make sure he is properly 
               anesthetized at that moment the doors open and in come 
               trapper and hawkeye also wearing or outfits as are the two 
               nurses who stand by waiting for them trapper looks 
               questioningly at me lay who answers with a nod that all is 
               ready

                                                                time lapse

               int 25th station hospital operating room – day

               the atmosphere in the or is tense hawkeye is maintaining 
               proper traction on the clamp that holds the lung in place 
               while trapper concentrates on removing the fragment

                                     trapper
                         got it

                                     colonel merrill
                         i demand an explanation

               colonel merrill commanding officer of the hospital has 
               stormed through the or swinging doors in full military uniform 
               without any antiseptic precautions

                                     hawkeye

                         infected ill tell the congressman

               to everyones astonishment including the colonels it works 
               he turns around and walks out without another word most 
               affected of all by hawkeyes audacity is me lay who reacts 
               with a sharp look in hawkeyes direction and then by picking 
               up his anesthesia chart and writing in the space labeled 
               first assistant the name hawkeye pierce

                                     trapper

                         clamdiggers back home

               both surgeons stop working in their surprise hawkeye looks 
               at the anesthesia chart and sees where me lay has written 
               his name then he takes a closer look at me lay himself or 
               what shows of him between his cap and his mask

                                     hawkeye
                              to trapper

               hawkeye and trapper come out of the dressing room after the 
               corporal and follow him down a corridor then they realize 
               to their surprise that there are two other soldiers following 
               them who have been stationed outside the dressing door their 
               invitation from the colonel is getting to seem less casual 
               every moment

               int colonel merrills outer office – day

               a second lieutenant and a sergeant seated on opposite sides

               trapper and hawkeye enter the door closing behind them and 
               look around it is a long time since they have seen 
               surroundings like these with western upholstered furniture 
               pictures on the walls and high quality walltowall carpeting 
               it is this last feature that attracts hawkeyes attention 
               he squats down to feel its texture and with a look invites 
               trapper to do the same trapper is also impressed with the 
               smoothness of the surface and without having to exchange a 
               word about it they each find a putter and a golf ball and 
               start lining up targets for their brief sorely missed putting 
               practice

                         not enough to be a pro

               he moves to another case duke continues to examine the 
               private with particular attention to the right side of the 
               head the more he observes the more alarmed he becomes

                                     duke

               knocko finishes saving and cleaning the right temporal area 
               of the unconscious privates head and duke wastes no time 
               making an incision down to the bone

                                     duke

                         so here goes

               he pounds the chisel into the privates skull and keeps at 
               it till he cracks his way through blood flows out in a 
               torrent duke pulls his tools away and just watches very 
               quickly he is rewarded by the sight of a torrent diminishing 
               to a dribble

               he stuffs gelfoam down into the bleeding site puts in a 
               rubber drain and starts to sew the skin back together with 
               silk sutures

               the private is moaning and stirring restlessly on the table 
               as duke finishes closing the incision and knocko takes the 
               patients pulse

                                     knocko

                         is how delicate any kind of brain 
                         surgery is so i certainly wouldnt 
                         like it if there was somebody going 
                         around saying all i did was crack 
                         him on the head with a hammer and 
                         chisel

               int operating room – day

               the pfc has been transferred to an operating table without 
               hawkeye losing his finger pressure on the artery the clothes 
               have been cut off him and ugly john has both blood and 
               anesthetic going into him the latter through an intratracheal 
               tube hawkeye has a scalpel in his left hand and with it he 
               enlarges the wound around his right index finger then he 
               tries to slide a kelly clamp down his finger into the wound 
               to clamp the artery but he cant manage it lefthanded

               he looks desperately around the or only to observe that every 
               surgeon and nurse is fully engaged including henry and hot 
               lips ugly john is having a hard time fulfilling his dual 
               function as it is and cant possibly take on another hawkeye 
               tried again with the clamp and fails and then to his great 
               relief there appears within in his peripheral vision as he 
               concentrates his attention on the pfcs neck a male figure 
               gowned capped masked and gloved it doesnt matter to 
               hawkeye which of his colleagues it is he just tells him 
               what assistance he needs from him

                                     hawkeye
                         grab this kelly ride it down my 
                         fingers and well have this mother 
                         under control

               the newcomer though hawkeye doesnt realize it is dago 
               red

               following instructions he takes the clamp and inserts it in 
               the wound

                                     dago red
                         what do i do with it hawk this is a 
                         little out of my line

                                     hawkeye
                         didnt recognize you red when you 
                         get the clamp all the way down open 
                         it as wide as you can and see if you 
                         can close it on the artery

               dagor red obeys these orders cautiously when he widens the 
               clamp and starts to close it again he has the satisfying 
               sensation of feeling something substantial and seizes it

               tank on a high platform in back of the tent duke and hawkeye 
               are working under cover of darkness to loosen each of the 
               stakes that secures the tent to the ground around it

               the swamp is at the end of the officers row nearest the 
               nurses tents so they have a good view of the women as they 
               emerge from their quarters dressed in bathrobes and carrying 
               towels shower caps and bars of soap the first two to appear 
               are knocko and lieutenant scorch next from her own private 
               tent comes hot lips

                         bit interested

               she continues on across the compound and enters the shower 
               tent

               knocko and lieutenant scorch come over to the swamp while 
               hawkeye goes inside to find the pictures then two more nurses 
               emerge from a tent and head for the showers trapper gets up 
               and saunters over to intercept them

               the door of the tent is closed behind hot lips and after a 
               moment there is the sound of water being turned on then our 
               attention is drawn to the peak of the tent to which a thin 
               scarcely visible strand of wire has been attached the wire 
               is drawn taut and runs across the peak of the barbershop 
               tent next door and down the far side of it to where duke 
               sits on the ground operating a sort of windlass upon which 
               the wire is wound he turns the crank with a quick burst of 
               energy

               back at the shower tent the force of the wire pulls the canvas 
               tight the loosened stakes come out of the ground and the 
               whole tent is whisked right off its center pole revealing 
               hot lips nude under the shower

               duke abandons his machine and moves to where he can get the 
               crucial view of hot lips the he calls across the compound 
               to hawkeye

                         patient or are you going to play 
                         poker

               englishman pulls in the pot

                                     hawkeye
                              to the general
                         im going to play poker until three 
                         am or until the patient is ready 
                         for surgery however if youd like 
                         to operate on him yourself right 
                         now be my guest i get the same

                                     hawkeye
                         theres nothing to talk about 
                         general you take the case yourself 
                         or join me at three oclock either 
                         way youre liable to learn something

               the general is far from pleased with the disrespect accorded 
               him but as the poker players start a new hand he decides 
               against making an issue on terms selected by hawkeye instead 
               he turns around and goes out

                                                                time lapse

                         general at onethirty when i checked 
                         him last this guy had had less than 
                         a pint of blood and hed lost two 
                         or three his pulse then was 120 and 
                         his blood pressure was about 90 
                         now at three oclock hes had three 
                         pints of blood his pulse is 80 and 
                         his pressure 120 his collapsed lung 
                         has been expanded and hes had a 
                         gram of terramycin intravenously we 
                         can operate on him safely and we 
                         should do it quickly but we dont 
                         have to do it frantically or 
                         carelessly

                                                                time lapse

               int operating room – night

               hawkeye has been doing the repair work in the patients belly 
               with general hammond functioning as a largely nonparticipating 
               assistant

               the incision is still open with sections of bowel on which 
               repairs have been done still exposed

                                     hawkeye
                         now general im going to sandbag 
                         you do you think were ready to get 
                         out of this belly

                                     general hammond
                         obviously you dont think so and i 
                         dont know why

                                     hawkeye
                         well dad we havent found any holes 
                         in the large bowel theyve all been 
                         in the small bowel but the smell is 
                         different i caught a whiff of large 
                         bowel but it aint staring us in 
                         the face right

                                     general hammond
                         right

                                     hawkeye
                         so if it aint staring us in the 
                         face its got to be retroperitoneal 
                         and that along with the look of the 
                         wounds makes me figure hes got a 
                         hole in his sigmoid colon that we 
                         wont find unless we look for it

               he has been working all the time he has been talking and 
               now after a little more manipulation within the incision 
               is able to indicate the perforation he has hypothecated

                                     hawkeye
                         and there it is

                                     general hammond
                         im impressed pierce naturally 
                         the kind of job i have i dont get 
                         much chance to keep up with what 
                         goes on in the or

                                     hawkeye
                         neither does henry blake but ill 
                         tell you what makes him the best 
                         co youve got in any of your 
                         hospitals he leaves all the medical 
                         decisions to the men who do the day
                         today work and understand what 
                         meatball surgery is

                                                                time lapse

               int the swamp – day

               the following day general hammond is having a drink with 
               hawkeye trapper and duke hojon keeps the glasses full

                                     trapper
                         it certainly isnt henrys fault hot 
                         lips houlihan doesnt like her name

                                     duke

                         shes so square shes even against 
                         our having a football team

               this stirs the generals curiosity but duke speaks before 
               he has a chance to ask his question

                                     duke

                         talk stage

                                     general hammond

                                     general hammond

                         to make about henry

                         with henry

                         thanks for the drink boys

               after the general has left the other two swampmen look at 
               hawkeye uncomprehendingly

                                     duke
                         where the hell we going to get us a 
                         football team

                                     hawkeye
                         all three of us played for our 
                         schools and there are at least four 
                         other guys

                                     trapper
                         but hes got five times the manpower 
                         to draw on

                                     hawkeye
                         we can balance that by getting 
                         ourselves a ringer henry has to say 
                         he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a 
                         specific request for dr oliver harmon

                                     hawkeye
                         on account he got caught in the doctor 
                         draft he was a surgical resident 
                         playing semipro ball weekends when 
                         the eagles signed him

                         you do

                         month over here at the 72nd evac in 
                         taegu most of the colored guys know 
                         who he is but theyre not talking 
                         because he asked them not to

                                     trapper
                         so what makes you think hell play

                         and still have enough profit to send

                                     trapper
                         might make kind of a social issue 
                         not having any other negro officer

                                     hawkeye

               it is november the mash team in uniform comes out of the 
               quonset hut assigned to it as dressing quarters already on 
               the bench toward which the players head are a few supporters 
               including dago red knocko and leslie radar is also there 
               serving as water boy

               spearchucker has a blanket wrapped over his head and held 
               together at the chin to eliminate the chance of his being 
               recognized as he looks over their opponents who now file 
               out of their quonset hut

               the first notable thing about them is that they number twenty
               five as opposed to a total of fifteen in uniform for the 
               mash team

               second is the even more discouraging fact that two of them 
               one black and one white are enormous bigger than 
               spearchucker the uniforms are orange and black

                         played halfback with the rams

                         if you start the game instead of 
                         waiting you mean

                         no lets stick to that strategy 
                         till we see whether you boys can do 
                         two things the first is get that 
                         halfback out of the game he had one 
                         year with the rams before the army 
                         got him but he didnt play too often 
                         because hes one of those hot dogs

                                     duke
                         what

                                     spearchucker
                         when he sees a little running room 
                         he likes to make a show you know 
                         stutter steps and crossovers and 
                         all that jazz also he never learned 
                         to button up when he gets hit so if 
                         you two can get a good shot at him 
                         once you can hurt him

                         but wed have to break his leg or 
                         something to keep him out of the 
                         game for good

               duke accordingly kicks the ball about thirty yards and angled 
               to his left but the player who takes it on the thirtyyard 
               line simply runs to his left and back a little toward his 
               own goal line in order to hand it to the ram halfback as he 
               charges downfield from his safety position he sidesteps 
               straightarms or otherwise eludes all eleven of the mash 
               players and runs unimpeded for a touchdown a few moments 
               later he kicks the ball over the bar for the point after 
               touchdown

                         sure you just blindfold him first 
                         and tie him to a stake

               duke is the one to receive the kickoff which he takes on 
               the ten

               he runs it back about twenty yards dodging several enemy 
               tacklers then sees the black tackle from cleveland bearing 
               down on him duke runs back and forth sideways a few times 
               not gaining any ground but making the other man move

                                     duke
                         hawkeye

               he throws a lateral pass to hawkeye toward whom both tackles 
               from cleveland now run hawkeye leads them almost from one 
               side of the field to the other then reverses direction 
               keeping them on the move till he sees a chance to throw a 
               lateral to trapper

                         those big hogs

               trapper returns the ball to duke who manages to make a couple 
               of yards forward and a lot more sideways before the ram 
               halfback cuts him down from the rear the mash team goes 
               into its first huddle

                                     trapper
                              to huddle
                         okay dont give them a chance to 
                         get their breath hawkeye wide to 
                         the right

               they are near the sideline to their left playing a winged t 
               formation trapper takes the ball from vollmer the center 
               runs back as if to pass but really gives it to hawkeye at 
               left half as hawkeye goes by him in a wide sweep that takes 
               him all the way to the right sideline with the two cleveland 
               tackles in pursuit

               hawkeye then cuts in quick and tries to get by them but one 
               of them brings him down for a gain of no more than two yards

               on the next play trapper really goes back to pass but his 
               blockers are of no use against the pro tackles whom he sees 
               descending on him trapper starts running straight back for 
               a while then makes a dash to the right followed by a dash 
               to the left he is almost tackled again and his only route 
               of escape is back toward his own goal line

                                     spearchucker
                              from the sideline
                         throw it throw it

               faced with a loss of about twentyfive yards trapper spots 
               hawkeye in the area of the line of scrimmage and whips the 
               ball to him

               hawkeye catches it but there are tacklers all around him and 
               he goes down almost immediately for no gain on the play 
               moving faster than they have to in order not to give the 
               opposition any rest the team huddles

                                     trapper
                              to huddle
                         wide to the left duke youre the 
                         pacesetter this time

               they go into action again this time trapper taking the 
               ball from vollmer gives it to duke who makes a feint at an 
               offtackle play then turns back and into a wide end run 
               instead duke is still a good ball carrier by college 
               standards and he has little trouble shaking off the amateurs 
               who try to tackle him and is thus able to make it a running 
               duel with the professionals when they finally nab him he 
               is no more than two or three yards ahead of the scrimmage 
               line but the extackles from cleveland are visibly panting 
               and wishing they hadnt allowed all that extra poundage to 
               accumulate on the fourth down of course they have to punt 
               duke goes back to receive the ball from vollmer at center

                                     hawkeye
                         dont try to get it far down kick 
                         it up high so we can get there and 
                         surround that sonofabitch

                                     duke
                         yeah if i can

               he does a good job of it the kick is high enough so there 
               are several red jerseys around the ram halfback when he gets 
               under it

               he raises his right arm for a fair catch the wouldbe mash 
               tacklers including hawkeye and trapper are frustrated they 
               array themselves defensively while their opponents have a 
               huddle and line up to take the offense

                                     hawkeye
                              to duke and trapper
                         lets get him this time i dont 
                         think theyve got anyone else who 
                         can carry the ball

               as hawkeye anticipated the opposing quarterback slips the 
               ball to the ram halfback who starts to go wide of the tackle 
               sees hawkeye untouched by blockers closing in from the 
               outside and makes his beautiful crossover to cut back in 
               at the same time he is hit at the knees by hawkeye and high 
               by duke and there are quite a few other mash players in the 
               immediate vicinity trapper and ugly john in the forefront 
               so that a lot of weight is piled up on top of the flashy 
               halfback

               a close look at ugly john reveals him to be reaching inside 
               his jersey and under a shoulder pad from which he extracts 
               a hypodermic needle with the skill of an expert 
               anesthesiologist he pulls up the sleeve of the tackled and 
               stunned halfback and plunges the needle into his arm

               the referee meanwhile is indignantly pulling at the mash 
               players on top of the pile and orally expressing his 
               disapproval

                                     referee
                         get off the guy hes tackled you 
                         dont all need to jump on

               the mash players quickly remove themselves duke and hawkeye 
               are the last to get up remaining on the ground is the former 
               halfback for the rams still firmly clutching the ball but 
               looking as if he needed to get a lot of air into his lungs 
               his captain the white pro tackle takes one look at him and 
               speaks to the referee

               the referee blows his whistle to stop the clock the captain 
               waves for assistance from the sidelines and the trainer and 
               water boy come running in radar also appears from the 
               opposite sideline with water for his team ugly john takes 
               advantage of his presence to slip the hypodermic he has been 
               concealing in his hand into radars pocket

               meanwhile there is agreement in the opposition camp that the 
               ram halfback should go out of the game for a while to rest 
               up a couple of his teammates assist him to the bench the 
               mash players observe this

               its a long kick but it doesnt go toward the center of the 
               goal line where spearchucker is waiting for it but to duke 
               who runs toward spearchucker and tosses him an easy lateral

               the two pro tackles from the browns run down the field so as 
               to converge on spearchucker around the mash twentyfive but 
               the other mash players divide themselves into equal units of 
               five to do nothing but take out the two tackles the other 
               opposing players are no problem for spearchucker who runs 
               around or right through them and crosses their goal line 
               for a touchdown the ball is brought out for the extra point 
               which duke scores with a place kick before the teams 
               reassemble for the next kickoff the captain of the 325th

                         statue of liberty doesnt work 
                         theyll go into the double wing with

               resume action the 325th evac quarterback drops back as if 
               to pass his left end starts to his right and the whole 
               mash eleven starts to their left only ugly john finds himself 
               temporarily buried under a 265pound tackle the other ten 
               men in red meet the enemy left end after he takes the ball 
               off the quarterbacks hand and they bring him down for a 
               loss the opposing team goes into another huddle but their 
               strategy remains as radar overheard it when the left halfback 
               starts to his right the mash players start to their right 
               and after the right halfback takes over possession and tries 
               to turn in he finds himself hopelessly outnumbered 
               spearchucker hits him first with a tackle so fierce it throws 
               him back five yards and induces him to fumble the ball a 
               pile of half a dozen mash players pounces on it causing 
               some damage to each other

                         everybody to the right of center 
                         except hawkeye who drops back a 
                         yard just before the snap at the 
                         same time duke moves to the right 
                         side of the line
                              to vollmer
                         that makes you eligible but all you 
                         have to do is take the ball right 
                         back from trapper between your legs 
                         and hide it under your belly trapper

                         you start walking not running to 
                         their goal line remember that dont 
                         run come on we just got time

               they break out of the huddle and line up as directed with 
               all the linemen except hawkeye on vollmers right their 
               opponents have trouble adjusting to this and are even more 
               confused when just as trapper bends down to take the ball 
               from vollmer hawkeye steps back into the backfield and duke 
               squeezes into the already crowded right line returning the 
               ball to vollmer trapper turns his back fakes a pitchout to 
               spearchucker who is racing toward the line and continues 
               backward holding himself as if he still had the ball and 
               were fading for a long pass so successfully does he create 
               this impression that the two tackles from cleveland seeing 
               clearly that spearchucker hasnt received the ball descend 
               on trapper with their last burst of energy two other orange
               andblack linemen also fall on top of him meanwhile vollmer 
               holding his arms crossed under his stomach to further hide 
               the ball and looking as if her were suffering from a painful 
               blow beneath the belt starts walking down the field at an 
               angle toward his own sideline making the opposition think 
               he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his injury

               spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty looks 
               back to where trappers tacklers are beginning to remove 
               themselves but also notes out of the corner of his eye that 
               only the opposing safety man is anywhere near vollmer and 
               that he isnt paying much attention to him

               from the bench a frantic henry looks indignantly at the sight 
               of his center and sergeant major coming off the field

                                     henry
                         whats going on what the hell are 
                         you doing

               he opens his arms enough for henry to see the pigskin cradled 
               there

                                     henry
                         then run for gods sake run

               vollmer begins to run straight toward the goal line which 
               has the unfortunate effect of alerting the safety man to 
               what is happening

               he races across the field to cut vollmer off spearchucker 
               starts into motion at the same instant and gets down there 
               so fast that just as the safety man is tackling vollmer in a 
               way that would throw him out of bounds on the twoyard line 
               spearchucker hurls himself against the safety man with a 
               strong and wellaimed block that sends both men across the

               a covered army truck pulls up with the victorious football 
               team breaking the normal rule for hospital zones by singing 
               a boisterous old drinking song several of them have bottles 
               in their hands as they descend to the ground hawkeye and 
               duke are among the first and the noisiest until they notice 
               lapham the new surgeon we saw the first time during the 
               deluge standing under the light at the hospital entrance 
               there is something in his expression that makes them break 
               off their singing abruptly trapper and spearchucker jumping 
               down after them react the same way and their sudden silence 
               affects the others so that in a matter of seconds the singing 
               has died out entirely hawkeye and duke run toward the 
               hospital entrance trapper and spearchucker a little behind 
               them

                         its a massive one

               the xray is passed on to hawkeye duke and spearchucker in

                         much easier for the thrombosis to 
                         occur

               hojon opens his eyes slowly reacting to the pressure of 
               all the doctors

               dukes words are intentionally ambiguous and when hojon 
               looks from one doctor to another to find the real meaning of 
               them they all try not to reveal it but he knows

               sergeant is beginning to wonder if there is something peculiar 
               about the names he is calling for added protection hawkeye 
               and duke have replaced their medical corps insignia with the 
               simple cross of the chaplains corps
