	flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder  it is sharp

	ignores it

	parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the
	pain comes again  he reaches for his shoulder tries to
	massage the pain it does not subside  parrish stands
	trying to shake it off but it refuses to go away some
	thing is unmistakably wrong  now a sound which he has
	come to recognize makes itself heard

	source of the sound it comes from no particular direction
	yet surrounds him  suddenly parrishs symptoms sharply
	intensify he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a
	corner of the desk holds on with one hand with the other
	clutches at his shoulder and arm the pain has violently
	seized the upper part of his body  he breaks out in a sweat
	his pallor now waxen as the voice repeats itself

			     voice vo contd
		yes

	parrish grips the edge of the desk the pain assaulting him
	on the one hand the voice coming at him from the outer
	each aberration feeds on the other he is beside himself
	consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a
	hallucination but which he is certain is not  parrish is
	possessed  he angles his face in every direction arbi
	trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly unconsciously
	enrage responds to the voice

			     parrish
		yes what

			     voice

	now he turns and walks on

	on susan

	in the opposite direction his back to her  she turns the
	corner and continues on

	on the young man

	approaching the corner he looks back for susan yet again
	but she is gone still turned he steps off into the street
	and a hospital supplies truck speeding down the curb lane
	hits him broadside a horrific impact the thud echoes as

	int hallway outside library parrish townhouse  night

	parrish moves deliberately down the hall slows as he nears
	the doorway to the library  the door is open  he hesitates
	before he crosses the threshold taking in as much as his
	eye can see now tentatively he enters

	int library parrish townhouse  night

	a beautiful classic room areas of dim warm light club
	chairs books reaching to the ceiling a rolling library
	ladder a weathered dictionary on a stand a model boat
	carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from
	the reading area by a sevenfoot high partition of obscured
	glass

	parrish poised in the doorway looks around nothing in
	sight

			     parrish
		hello

	silence

			     parrish contd
		anyone here

	no response

			     parrish contd
		i said is anyone here

			     voice vo
		quiet down

	parrish is startled he shrinks backward for a moment his
	eyes searching the room for the voice the timbre and pitch
	of which is exactly what he has heard before  there is the
	sense that someone is there but parrish cannot see him and
	he does not dare look

			     parrish
			quietly
		where are you

			     voice vo
		im here

	now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured
	glass the section of the room most distant from parrish 
	there is a shape  something is there

			     parrish
		what is this a joke right  some
		kind of elaborate practical joke
		at my 40th reunion we delivered a
		casket to the class presidents
		hotel room and 

			     voice
		quiet

	parrish falls silent something in the sound and tone of the
	voice muting him  he takes a step backwards

			     voice contd
		where are you going

			     parrish
		i  i  uh 

	the shape moves makes itself more visible  although still
	diffused by the glass the shape has definition a person a
	man his features are not yet distinguishable but he is 
	there all right

			     voice
		the great bill parrish at a loss for
		words  the man from whose lips fall
		rapture and passion and obses
		sionall those admonitions about
		being deliberately happy what
		there is no sense living your life
		without all the sparks and
		energy you give off the rosy advice
		you dispense in round pearshaped
		tones 

			     parrish
		what the hell is this  who are you

			     voice
		just think of millenniums multiplied
		by aeons compounded by infinity
		ive been around that long but its
		only recently that your affairs here
		have piqued my interest  call it
		boredom the natural curiosity of
		me the most lasting and significant
		element in existence has come to see

	parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing

			     parrish
		about what

			     voice
		i want to have a look around before
		i take you

			     parrish
		take me  where

			     voice

			     voice
		yes is the answer to your ques
		tion

			     parrish
		what question

			     voice
		bill  come on  the question  the
		question youve been asking yourself
		with increased regularity at odd
		moments panting through the extra
		game of handball when you ran for
		the plane in delhi when you sat up
		in bed last night and hit the floor
		in the office this morning  the
		question that is in the back of your
		throat choking the blood to your
		brain ringing in the ears over and
		over as you put it to yourself 

			     parrish
		the question 

			     voice
			urging
		yes bill  the question

	after a moment

			     parrish
		am i going to die

	the figure who is the voice takes a step forward now no
	longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light re
	vealing himself to be the young man seen previously in the
	coffee shop but there is a change he seems odd off
	center not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful

			     young man
		yes

	a moment parrish beside himself  he cannot bring himself
	to speak finally

			     parrish
		am i dreaming this
			another moment
		are you a dream

			     young man
		i am not a dream

			     parrish
		youre coming to take me  what is
		that  who the hell are you

	the young man steps closer to parrish his face is inches
	from a shaking sweating parrishs face the young man
	daring parrish to identify him

			     parrish
		you are 

			     young man
		  	urging again
		yes 

	parrish turns away  but the young man spectacularly is in
	front of him again

			     young man contd
			gently
		who am i

			     parrish
		death

	parrish is shocked stunned terrified at the word by what
	he has comprehended  he surveys the young man who at this
	moment actually seems bewildered by his effect

			     parrish contd
		youre death

			     young man
		yes

			     parrish
		death

			     young man
		thats me

			     parrish

			     young man
		the jacket and the pair of pants
		came with the body i took  let me

			     young man

			     parrish
		i do
			a moment

		you should hope quite a while

			     parrish
		and then 

	the young man nods gently

			     parrish contd
		its its over

	a long silence  parrish and the young man take each other in
	the sense that now they understand each other  a sound at the
	door

			     luisa os
		mr parrish

	parrish does not hear her for the moment luisa steps inside
	the library

			     luisa contd
		will the gentleman be staying for
		dinner sir

	parrish ignores her at first finally he looks at luisa then
	at the young man then once more at both of them as if to
	verify the young mans presence has been acknowledged by
	luisa  the young man interjects

			     young man
			to luisa
		yes
			a polite afterthought
		thank you

	luisa nods perfunctorily and exits  parrish is frozen 
	dumbfounded

			     young man contd
			to parrish
		where is dinner

	parrish does not answer at first

			     parrish
		this is crazy  youre not going to

	parrish is frightened by the response

			     young man contd
		good  now lead the way

	parrish hesitates then obediently leads the young man out
	of the library down a long hallway and across the foyer

			     parrish
		excuse me  could i say something

			     young man
		of course

			     parrish

	ed  finally allison breaks the ice

			     allison contd
			to the young man

		put it to a vote

	smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from
	the board at drews news

			     parrish
			emptily
		thank you drew

	parrish takes a moment draws himself up to say something
	official then stops himself what follows is spontaneous
	reflective deeply felt

			     parrish contd
		umm  i did enjoy  or rather i
		was interested in meeting john yes
		terday  impressive i suppose
		but it did get me to thinking  i
		started in this business because
		this is what i wanted to do  i knew
		i wasnt going to write the great
		american novel but i also knew
		there was more to life than buying
		something for a dollar and selling
		it for two  i wanted to give the
		news to the world and i wanted to
		give it unvarnished  the more we
		all know about each other the
		greater the chance we will survive
		sure i want to make a profit you
		cant exist without one but john
		bontecou is all profit  if we give
		him license to absorb parrish
		communications and he has his eye
		on a few others after us well be
		appointing him to the position he
		craves  gatekeeper  in order to
		reach the world you will have to go
		through john bontecou  and not only
		will you have to pay him to do this
		far more expensive youll have to
		agree with him  reporting the news
		is a privilege and a responsibility
		and it is not exploitable  parrish
		communications has earned this priv
		ilege john bontecou wants to buy
		it  as your chairman i urge you to
		agree this company is not for sale

	a silence everybody shifts the board is in shock drew is
	trying to maintain his balance

			     drew
			carefully
		sounds like youre not leaving
		much room for discussion

			     parrish
			to the board
		sorry  i know it looks like im
		reversing my field

			     drew
		thats your privilege bill  but
		given our needs given the absolute
		necessity for growth given the fu
		ture the truth is joining john
		bontecou is every bit as certain as 
		death and taxes

	joe interjects

			     joe
		death and taxes

	after a moment

			     drew
		yes

			     joe
		death and taxes

	another moment

			     drew
		yes

			     joe
		what an odd pairing

			     drew
		its just a saying mr black

			     joe
		of whom

			     drew
		it doesnt matter

			     joe
		then why did you bring it up

	drew regards joe

			     drew
		youre not familiar with the phrase
		in this world nothing is certain
		but death and taxes

			     parrish
		i am now

			     drew
		glad i could be of some help

	the board is provoked and mystified by joe and even more by
	his presence they cast meaningful glances at parrish drew
	coolly grasps the irritation of the members  parrish breaks
	the silence

			     parrish
		shall we adjourn

			     drew
		but the matters still on the table
		bill 

	edward sloane a contemporary of parrishs has been warily
	silent but extremely observant  protective of parrish and
	sensing his burgeoning difficulty he interrupts

			sloane
		why dont we let it rest for the
		moment  give it some air

			     parrish
		well said eddie  mr black shall
		we

	joe rises

			     joe
			to drew
		those cookies were excellent

	he exits with parrish the door closes behind them  a babble

			     drew
		i was hired you told me to help
		bring parrish communications into
		the 21st century  this merger is
		the vehicle 

	joe interrupts

			     joe
		perhaps a merger is a way to bring
		bills company into the 21st cen
		tury  and perhaps it isnt  and
		perhaps cheating on your french
		philosophers exam at the groton
		school was an expedient way to get
		your diploma and perhaps it wasnt
		be that as it may drew a question
		can often be argued both ways

	drew is stunned

			     parrish
		joe cut it out  and you too drew

			     drew
			to parrish
		i thought this was practically a 
		done deal 

			     parrish

	stairs susan watches him disappear

	she turns back into the salon just as allison and quince are
	exiting goodbyes all around  susan is left alone now 
	with parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar

	coffee and halfeaten pastries  the board of parrish
	communications is gathered absent are parrish and quince
	felicia drews secretary takes notes

			     drew
		i know youre all as uncomfor
		table as i am to be meeting without
		bill but i got a call last night
		from john bontecou  not only is he
		still interested he is sweetening
		his offer
			a moment
		although it pains me to say it in
		my opinion bill parrish dealt with
		us peremptorily in dismissing any
		deal with bontecou  therefore im
		sorry to say that if we are to exam
		ine this new offer responsibly as
		the board of directors of parrish
		communications we must do so with
		out its chairman
			another moment
		oh yes there is one additional
		element bontecou is so anxious to
		get us he said hed take parrish
		communications with our chairman or
		without

	the board falls silent  sloane a peer of parrishs
	fidgets  drew milks the moment

			     drew contd
		its no surprise if i suggest to you
		that the bill parrish we know is not
		the bill parrish you saw yesterday
		you heard that speech  some strange
		emotional rationale to buttress a 
		kneejerk rejection of a legitimate
		offer  does it not strike you that
		something is possibly affecting this
		mans judgement  more specifically
		 his judgement to make a critical
		business decision

	silence the board clocking drews argument

			     drew contd
		its not pleasant to say the follow
		ing but i would be remiss in this
		crisis if i did not  when we pre
		sent bill with the improved bontecou
		offer and if he refuses to let us
		consider it  once more makes an
		adamant or emotional rejection  we
		will have no choice but to seek an
		alternative

			     sloane
		and what would that be

			     drew
		bills birthday is the day after
		tomorrow  there is a provisory by
		law in our charter  per the discre
		tion of the board corporate off
		icers can be retired at age sixty
		five

			     sloane
		youre taking this too far drew

			     drew

	drew leans over to felicia speaks quietly and she leaves
	the room

			     drew contd
		how did this all come about  crisis
		 bill parrish crisis  his com
		pany crisis for us  it came about
		with the arrival on the scene of 
		mr joe black  mr joe who  joe
		black  he attends our board meet
		int he sleeps at bills house re
		sides in his office  never leaves
		his side  and in my opinion is
		always in his ear  telling him what
		to do and bill is listening  who is
		joe black  what is his relationship
		to bill parrish  and most important
		what is behind his influence on our
		chairman

			     sloane
		youre building this thing up too
		much drew  hes had advisors be
		fore  nobody tells bill what to do

	the door opens and felicia enters followed by quince sur
	prised at seeing a convened board but still he is all smiles

		bills rejection of bontecous offer
		 and make an appropriate presenta
		tion to him as to how we think the
		company might proceed  wont you
		share with our board the information
		you gave me last night

	quince hesitates then realizes what drew has on his mind
	he nods confidently to drew then turns importantly to the
	board

			     quince
		well im happy to tell you ive got
		good news  as i was telling drew
		ive been making a little hay while
		the bontecou sun was shining  two
		possibly three new and boiling hot
		prospects for merger

		how did bill react to the leads
		youve developed

			     quince
		he was interested

			     drew
			prompting
		 but he was concerned about the
		timing

			     quince
		the timing  yes  he says its up
		to joe

			     drew
		its up to joe

			     quince
		thats what he said

	quince having dispensed his information looks proudly

	ship

	int salon parrish townhouse  night

	after dinner parrish allison and susan are gathered to

	no response from parrish

			     drew contd

		company but that you are relying on
		him to make them for you

	quince flinches at these words his hands clasped in front
	of him his knuckles white as parrish regards drew but still
	does not answer

			     drew contd
		the lack of response bill is not
		appropriate  we are your board we
		have a right to know how you are

	int foyer parrish townhouse  day

	parrish enters joe right behind him coyle takes their coats
	disappears  parrish hesitates for a moment shrugs as if he
	has a thought he doesnt want to share then heads upstairs
	with joe  he is trudging a bit joe senses his mood

			     joe
		im sorry bill 

			     parrish
		thats okay

			     joe
		whats okay

			     parrish

			     joe
		fish

			     parrish
		never mind  im tired  im going

			     parrish contd
		are you hungry  coyle will have
		luisa fix you something to eat

			     joe
		im not hungry

			     parrish
		then i cant help you

	parrish turns into his bedroom closing the door gently
	behind him  joe continues down the hall enters the guest
	wing

	int guest suite parrish townhouse  day

	midday sunlight streams into the sitting room joe passes
	through to his bedroom sits tentatively on the bed feels
	the edge of the silk spread touches the pillow then rises
	again crosses back to the sitting room

	susan appears in the doorway joe suddenly senses her turns
	around

			     susan
		youre here

			     joe
		i am

	he stands they regard each other for the moment

			     joe contd
		may i take your coat

	she doesnt answer starts to take off the coat herself joe
	comes around her to help susan senses him breathing in the
	scent at the back of her neck

			     susan
		i just thought id drop by scrounge
		a little lunch i was in the neigh
		borhood 

			     joe
		how beautiful

	he starts to hang susans coat up

			     susan
		just throw it on the chair

	joe holds her coat carefully on the chair  an awkward 
	moment the two of them shifting from foottofoot

			     susan contd
		when i called they said that you
		and daddy had just left the office

			     joe
		hes taking a nap

			     susan
		he must be tired  this bontecou
		thing 

			     joe
		yes hes tired  i believe so

	a moment

			     joe contd
		you must be hungry

	susan sits on the couch

			     susan
		no not anymore  are you

	joe hears the question but doesnt answer sits down on the
	couch beside her

			     susan contd
		after a moment
		are you cold

			     joe
		no

			     susan
		maybe its the draft through the
		door

	she gets up closes the door sits back down again next to
	joe  a warm awkward silence they move closer to each
	other now they fall into a foreplay which susan recognizes
	as such joe on the other hand participates hungrily but
	has no knowledge where it is leading  his movements are
	instinctive the smell of her hair the shape of her fin
	gers odd things about her seem to interest him  this
	excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
	very sense of that stirs her their reactions to each other
	are intuitive and spontaneous even though joe has no know
	ledge of how to make love to a woman ironically his actions
	are such that they never beg the question  has he done it
	before

	strange territory for joe not to be in control and exert
	ing his power but his inventions and responses in lovemak
	ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
	susan builds  joe has found himself in an unexplored land
	of feeling and passion he loves what is happening and yet
	at the same time is terrified by it  he feels himself being
	lured by some power he has not only never been aware of but
	is deeply dangerous to partake of he knows what he is doing
	is putting who he is at great risk yet he goes right on
	the powerful contradiction is transmitted to susan and in
	the end there is the knowledge they have together made a
	journey they both have been swept away in a stream of events
	they have created and they dont care about the consequences

	spent they lie in silence  finally susan speaks

			     susan
		its so wonderful to make love to
		you  its like making love to some
		one who has never made love before

	joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has
	said but to tell her more even the truth about himself
	he weighs then resists the impulse

			     joe
		thank you

	her head nestles underneath his arm she has a sense of his
	comforting her without knowing that he is doing so

			     susan
		did you like making love to me

			     joe
		i loved it

			     susan
		more than you love peanut butter

			     joe
		yes

	she laughs at the earnestness with which he answers

	joe seems to drift away now they lie together as one but for
	the first time she feels separate from him sensing him gone
	to some distant distant land

			     susan
		where are you going

			     joe
		nowhere  imhere

			     susan
		for how long

			     joe
		oh i hope a long long time

	a moment

			     susan
		me too

	another moment

			     joe
		what do we do now

	she smiles

			     susan
		it will come to us

	int foyer parrish townhouse later  day

	joe and susan are at the front door he has helped her
	on with her coat she turns around they kiss  the kiss
	lingers susan breaks away reaches for the door looks back
	longingly at joe and then she is gone joe closing the door
	softly after her

	he turns back into the foyer looks up parrish is on the
	balcony it is clear he has observed joe and susan

			     joe

	parrishs jaw sets

	joe steps in

			     joe
			to quince
		tell drew that bill acknowledges

		he has merely moved upstairs in his
		own company and the executive
		continuity is unbroken  tonights
		the night to do it  hell introduce
		drew to his press friends as well as
		some of his close acquaintances from
		washington and drew can tell them
		that everythings sailing along just
		fine

	parrish is impressed by joes acumen a look of grudging
	admiration  he nods to joe summarizes

			     parrish
			to quince
		all in all what bill wants to do is
		build the golden bridge to drew with
		no hard feelings

			     quince
		you think drew will go for it

			     parrish
		quince ive got confidence in you

		what the hell do you care

			     joe
		i was just asking bill

			     parrish
		you want to know ill tell you
		youre looking at a man who tonight
		is not about to walk through the
		valley of the shadow of death hes
		galloping into it  and the same time
		the business he built with his own
		hands and his own head is being
		commandeered by a couple of cheap
		pirates  and oh yes i almost
		forgot my daughters fallen in
		love with death

	another moment

			     joe
		 and im in love with your
		daughter

			     parrish
		say again

		youre what

			     joe
		i think you heard me bill

			     parrish
		youre not taking susan anywhere
		and what the hell does that mean
		anyway

			     parrish contd
		i thought we had a deal

			     joe
		im sorry bill 

			     parrish
		susan is my daughter she has a
		wonderful life ahead of her and
		youre going to deprive her of
		it and youre telling me youre
		sorry  well im sorry apology
		not accepted

			     joe
		i love her bill  she is all that
		i ever wanted and ive never wanted
		for anything because ive never
		wanted anything before if you can
		understand

			     parrish
		how perfect for you  to take 
		whatever you want because it
		pleases you  its not love 

			     joe
		then what is it

			     parrish
		some aimless infatuation in which
		for the moment you feel like in
		dulging  its missing everything
		that matters

			     joe
		which is what

			     parrish
		trust responsibility taking the
		weight for your choices and feel
		ings and spending the rest of your
		life living up to them  and above
		all not hurting the object of your
		love

			     joe
		so thats what love is

			     parrish
		multiply it by infinity and take it
		to the death of forever and you will
		still have barely a glimpse of what
		i am talking about

			     joe
		those were my words bill

			     parrish
		well theyre mine now

	joe is silent for a moment cogitating

			     joe
		susan wants to come  she says shes
		in love with me

			     parrish
		with you  who is you  did you
		tell her who you are

			     joe
		no

			     parrish
		does she know where shes going

	joe doesnt answer

		for that poor sonofabitch whose body
		you took and everything else since
		has been aftermath  you say you love
		her but you dont know what love is
		she loves you but she doesnt know
		who you are  you make a deal youre
		breaking it  the bottom line is
		joe youre conducting a great
		romance under false pretenses

			     joe
		i dont like what youre saying

			     parrish
		i dont expect you to

			     joe
		are you threatening me

			     parrish
		i certainly hope so  i loved susan
		from the moment she was born and i
		love her now and every minute in
		between and what i dream of is a
		man who will discover her and she
		will discover a man who will love
		her who is worthy of her who is of
		this world of this time and has the
		grace and compassion and fortitude
		to walk beside her as she makes her
		way through this beautiful thing
		called life

	parrish is beginning to reach joe

			     joe
		are you telling me i cant be

	a pause parrishs posture changes

			     parrish
		why did you come in here and tell
		me joe  you are the biggest shot
		of all you dont have to ask my
		permission but thats what youre
		doing  you know why  because youve
		somewhere somehow developed into a

		going to do  how can this be love
		she doesnt know who you are  why
		dont you tell her  try it out on

			     joe
		youre the poison drew  youve
		operated behindthescenes to suborn
		the trust of a man who has stamped
		you with his imprimatur of class and
		elegance and stature  ive seen all
		kinds and degrees of deception in my
		time but bill parrish has been on
		the receiving end of machinations so
		machiavellian that it has rarely
		been my experience to encounter  and
		yet he has combatted them stoically
		and selflessly without revealing my
		identity  had he violated the vow
		of secrecy he took his task would
		have been far easier he could have
		turned defeat into victory but he
		is too honorable a man to have done
		that  and now i must release him
		from that vow  because of me he
		has lost his work his company his
		reputation  and now hes going to
		tell you who i am

	parrish is struck dumb  he looks at joe pleadingly shaking
	his head imperceptibly but joe nods to him blithely  and

	they drift into silence

			     susan
		no regrets

	a long silence susan smiles

			     parrish
		its a good feeling isnt it

	silence again

			     susan
		everybodys saying goodbye

	they regard each other a long pause they have reached an
	understanding

			     parrish
		im still here
			a moment
		would you like to dance with me
		susan

			     susan
		oh yes 

	he starts to lead her to the floor immediately stops

			     parrish
		if you dont mind dancing with an
		old fogey like me

			     susan
		oh dad youre not old  youll
		never be old

	he takes her in his arms and they dance away

	another angle

	on a distant fringe of the party a grass terrace that still
	commands a view of the dance floor is joe  his eyes are on
	parrish and susan he watches them admiringly yet ruefully
	a waiter passes catches sight of joe stops

			     waiter
		can i get you anything sir

	joe regards the waiter for a moment

			     joe
		do you have any peanut butter

	the waiter hesitates

			     waiter
		i dont think so sir

			     joe
		thank you anyway

	the waiter moves off  joes attention returns to parrish and
	susan the dance number ends a boom

	another angle

	on the dance floor

			     parrish
		what was that

			     susan
		the fireworks are about to start

	parrish looks up sees joe up on the terrace waiting

			     susan contd
			to parrish
		shall we

			     parrish
		you go ahead honey im going to
		catch my breath

	suddenly he hugs her holds her very close  she looks at
	him he smiles nods but doesnt release her until she
	smiles back  now she heads out with the crowd for the
	fireworks  when parrish senses she is on her way he turns
	and heads up towards joe

	joe rises to meet parrish as he approaches

			     joe
		happy birthday bill

			     parrish
		thank you

	they watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks
	joes gaze lingers

			     parrish contd
		did you say goodbye

			     joe
		not exactly

			     parrish
		i guess you have your reasons

			     joe
		yes

	silence

			     parrish
		now that we have a moment would you
		mind if i expressed my gratitude for
		what you did for susan

	joe waits

			     parrish contd
		i never heard her speak of any man
		as she spoke of you  it was always
		what i wanted for her  but what
		happens to her now

			     joe
		i wouldnt worry about it bill
		these things have a way of working
		out

	joe regards parrish waits until he has a sense that parrish
	has accepted what joe has said then joe continues

			     joe contd
		and would you mind if i expressed my
		gratitude

	parrish waits

			     joe contd
		for you  for the time youve given
		me  for the person you are

	a moment

			     parrish
		dont blow smoke up my ass youll
		ruin my autopsy

	joe barely manages a smile now looks back longingly at the
	crowd below searching

			     parrish contd
		its hard to let go isnt it

			     joe
		yes

			     parrish
		thats life  what can i tell you

	a silence an understanding there is another more to say
	joe looks inquiringly at parrish as if to say shall we
	parrish nods and joe turns with him  they set off now away
	from the party up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
	the river

	another angle

	down below the party guests faces are lit by the initial
	fireworks display  among them is susan but her interest
	isnt there  not something pulls her attention an over
	powering feeling that compels her to turn and see at a
	distance parrish and joe walking away up the meadow  some
	thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
	her she turns back to the party dazed tracing on the
	fireworks

	another angle

	up the hill parrishs step slows joe slowing with him

			     parrish
		im getting a little dizzy i can
		feel my heart pumping 

	but parrish doesnt wait for a response just continues on
	up the meadow towards the rise of the hill joe in step
	with him

			     parrish contd
		should i be afraid

	joe stops parrish stops with him

			     joe
		not a man like you

	parrish smiles faintly takes a deep breath he strides
	out again joe right with him  in tandem they continue
	on and disappear over the crest of the hill  a barrage
	of fireworks lights up the sky

	another angle

	down below susan in a pained reflex again turns and looks
	up towards the hill  there is nobody there  she hesitates
	now glides away from the party her step quickens as she
	walks up towards the hill

	susan halts in the distance a figure is approaching from
	over the crest of the hill where joe and parrish disappeared
	he is heading straight for her she tries to make him out
	seems to recognize him starts to walk towards him as if 
	pulled by a magnet  now she stops again  it is a man he
	keeps coming and now that he is close and recognizes him

			     susan
		joe

	he smiles quizzically hasnt quite heard her stands right
	in front of her loose smiling disoriented and yet so
	appealing  they are riveted on each other uneasy and yet
	close

			     susan contd
		youre here

	he is trying to get his bearings

			     joe
		 you bet

	something about him makes susan slightly tentative

			     susan
		where did you go

	joe shrugs scratches his head endearingly uncertain of
	time and place

			     joe
		i dont know  yknow i dont know
		 its all blurred up and hazy  and
		would yknow what i mean if i said i
		dont think its worth figuring out

	some realization is dawning on susan it renders her
	lightheaded

			     joe contd
		but now im back

	susan regards joe intently searching his face for an
	answer

			     susan
			gently
		thats it

			     joe
		well i dont know what else to say
		its a helluva party 

			     susan
		you think so

			     joe
		yeahand youre the prettier
		thing here

	susan blinks a long silence she touches the sleeve of his
	jacket now her hand traces the outline of his face she
	regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
	with the last moments fades away

	susan slowly realizes this is the young man  she is shaken
	a sudden intake of breath

			     young man
		hey you all right

	his hand politely touches her elbow courteously lending her
	support

			     susan
		the coffee shop 

	the young man nods pleased with her recognition

			     young man
		i asked you if i said something
		wrong and you said it was so right
		it scared you

	susan holds herself very still

			     young man contd
		and forgive me for saying this 
		but then you said  and its been
		with me ever since 

			     susan
		what has 

	he hesitates

			     young man
		you said you liked me

			     susan
		no 

			     young man
		ydidnt

	a moment

			     susan
		i said i liked you so much

	she falls silent now overcome by the last moments
	revelations  the young man senses her discomfort which
	is on the edge of pain

			     young man
		hey everythings going great 
		dont ythink

	she doesnt answer for a moment

			     young man contd
		dont you feel that way

			     susan
		we know so little about each
		other

			     young man
		but weve got time

	she searches the young mans eyes his face is open
	completely vulnerable waiting for her response  a long
	silence the words come out haltingly

			     susan
		i wish you couldve known my
		father

	another moment

			     young man
		me too

	susan signs the young man smiles gently they are 
	completely intent on each other

			     susan
		what do we do now

	a long silence

			     young man
		it will come to us

	susan smiles the fireworks finale goes off the music comes
	up from below the night fills with light  the young man
	searches susans face now takes her hand  and together
	they start back towards the party

			     the end
