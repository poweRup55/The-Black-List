               neighbors look on with sympathy the office boy now goes 
               through the same procedure with several other people all 
               watch him terror written in their eyes

               remains poised with his brush waiting for the door to

                         below is a letter which reached 
                         my desk this morning its a 
                         commentary on what we laughingly 
                         call the civilized world dear 
                         miss mitchell four years ago i 
                         was fired out of my job since 
                         then i havent been able to get 
                         another one at first i was sore 
                         at the state administration because 
                         its on account of the slimy 
                         politics here we have all this 
                         unemployment but in looking around 
                         it seems the whole worlds going 
                         to pot so in protest im going to 
                         commit suicide by jumping off the 
                         city hall roof signed a disgusted 
                         american citizen john doe

               joe pauses to absorb this

                                     joe
                              continues reading
                         editors note    if you ask 
                         this column the wrong people are 
                         jumping off roofs

               joe glances up toward ann in mild protest

                                     joe
                         hey ann this is the old fakeroo 
                         isnt it

               full shot ann has just about accumulated all her things 
               joe stares at her knowing its a fake

                                     ann
                         never mind that joe go ahead

               joe shrugs shakes his head and exits ann stuffs her 
               things under her arm and also goes

               int outer office

               med shot voices ad lib—awfully sorry youre not going 
               goodbye laughing

               ann comes out suddenly she stops gets another idea 
               picks up a book from a desk and reaches back to heave it

               med shot at connells office door the signpainter has 
               just finished connells name and as he leans back pleased 
               wiping his brushes the book flies in the painter lifts 
               his head slowly his wrath too great to find utterance

                                                           dissolve to

               ears cocked frightened by the harrowing tale camera 
               retreats before him—as he slowly walks nearer to beany and 
               the colonel meantime we continue to hear the colonels

                         dents—and traffic tickets and

                         you gotta have money to pay for 
                         all those things—so you go after 
                         what the other fellers got—
                              with finality
                         and there you are—youre a heelot

               a hit for his eyes shoot skyward and he quickly 
               turns—watching the progress of the ball as it is flung to

               position—nods to his catcher—raises his hands in the air 
               takes a peek toward first base—and suddenly wheels around 
               facing camera and whips the ball toward first base 
               almost immediately his face lights up

                         live in a big house with an iron 
                         fence around it and they always 
                         keep their blinds drawn and we 
                         always figured that he was just an 
                         old miser that sat back counting 
                         his money so why bother about 
                         inviting him until grimes the 
                         milkman spoke up and he said say 
                         youve got the delaneys all wrong  
                         and then he tells us about how 
                         they cancelled their milk last 
                         week and how when he found a 
                         note in the bottle he got kinda 
                         curious like and he sorta peeked 
                         in under the blinds and found the 
                         house empty if you ask me he 
                         says theyre starving

               he demonstrates by slapping his knees first with one hand 
               and then with the other suddenly he becomes aware of beany 
               and stops embarrassed

               they sit silently for a moment we hear the strains of

                              after a pause

                              in an effort to 
                              disillusion him
                         look john—what were handing them 
                         are platitudes things theyve

                         times too but—there you are 
                         maybe theyre like me just 
                         beginning to get an idea what those 
                         things mean

               ann is deeply concerned she watches him helplessly

                                     john
                              continuing
                         you know i never thought much 
                         about people before they were 
                         always just somebody to fill up 
                         the bleachers the only time i 
                         worried about them was if they—is 
                         when they didnt come in to see me 
                         pitch you know lately ive been 
                         watching them while i talked to 
                         them i could see something in 
                         their faces i could feel that 
                         they were hungry for something do 
                         you know what i mean

               ann nods

                                     john
                         maybe thats why they came maybe 
                         they were just lonely and wanted 
                         somebody to say hello to i know 
                         how they feel ive been lonely 
                         and hungry for something practically 
                         all my life

               ann forces a smile the moment threatens to become 
               awkward—until they are saved by the pilots voice
