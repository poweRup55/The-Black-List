a polaroid photograph clasped between finger and thumb a
crude crime scene flash picture of a mans body lying on a
decaying wooden floor a bloody mess where his head should
be

the image in the photo starts to fade as we super titles the
hand holding the photo suddenly fans it in a rapid flapping
motion then holds it still the image fades more and again
the picture is fanned

as titles end the image fades to nothing the hand holding
the photo flaps it again then places it at the front of a
polaroid camera

the camera sucks the blank picture up then the flash bursts

the polaroid camera is lowered revealing the sweaty heavy
breathing face of leonard mid30s there are droplets of
blood across his face leonard stares satisfied at
something on the ground in front of him there is wet blood
on his blue shirt and beige suit his hand opens and catches
a handgun which leaps up into his grasp

still staring he crouches down and pulls a body off the
floor by the wet hair of its bloody head he slowly inserts
the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth
should be

leonard flinches a deafening roar as wet red leaps off his
face and suit and head with a spasm reassembles itself
into the face of teddy 40s moustache and we

		facts not memories thats how you
		investigate i know its what i used to
		do memory can change the shape of a room
		or the color of a car its an
		interpretation not a record memories
		can be changed or distorted and theyre
		irrelevant if you have the facts

		you really want to find this guy

				leonard

memento mori
by
jonathan nolan


what like a bullet can undeceive
				herman melville

your wife always used to say youd be late for your own funeral
remember that her little joke because you were such a slobalways
late always forgetting stuff even before the incident

right about now youre probably wondering if you were late for hers

you were there you can be sure of that thats what the pictures
forthe one tacked to the wall by the door its not customary to take
pictures at a funeral but somebody your doctors i guess knew you
wouldnt remember they had it blown up nice and big and stuck it
right there next to the door so you couldnt help but see it every
time you got up to find out where she was

the guy in the picture the one with the flowers thats you and what
are you doing youre reading the headstone trying to figure out
whos funeral youre at same as youre reading it now trying to
figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door but why
bother reading something that you wont remember

shes gone gone for good and you must be hurting right now hearing
the news believe me i know how you feel youre probably a wreck
but give it five minutes maybe ten maybe you can even go a whole
half hour before you forget

but you will forgeti guarantee it a few more minutes and youll be
heading for the door looking for her all over again breaking down
when you find the picture how many times do you have to hear the news
before some other part of your body other than that busted brain of
yours starts to remember

neverending grief neverending anger useless without direction
maybe you cant understand whats happened cant say i really
understand either backwards amnesia thats what the sign says crs
disease your guess is as good as mine

maybe you cant understand what happened to you but you do remember
what happened to her dont you the doctors dont want to talk about
it they wont answer my questions they dont think its right for a
man in your condition to hear about those things but you remember
enough dont you you remember his face

this is why im writing to you futile maybe i dont know how many
times youll have to read this before you listen to me i dont even
know how long youve been locked up in this room already neither do
you but your advantage in forgetting is that youll forget to write
yourself off as a lost cause

sooner or later youll want to do something about it and when you do
youll just have to trust me because im the only one who can help
you



earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles
interrupted by a handprinted sign taped right above his head large
enough for him to read from the bed an alarm clock is ringing
somewhere he reads the sign blinksreads it again then takes a look
at the room

its a white room overwhelmingly white from the walls and the
curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread the alarm
clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white
curtains at this point earl probably notices that he is lying on top
of his white comforter he is already wearing a dressing gown and
slippers

he lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again it says
in crude block capitals this is your room this is a room in a
hospital this is where you live now

earl rises and takes a look around the room is large for a
hospitalempty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three
directions two doors and a window the view isnt very helpful
eithera close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece
of turf that terminates in a sliver of twolane blacktop the trees
except for the evergreens are bareearly spring or late fall one or
the other

every inch of the desk is covered with postit notes legal pads
neatly printed lists psychological textbooks framed pictures on top
of the mess is a halfcompleted crossword puzzle the alarm clock is
riding a pile of folded newspapers earl slaps the snooze button and
takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing
gown he pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light he rifles
the papers on the desk looks quickly through the drawers eventually
he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the
window another sign is taped just above the box it says in loud
yellow letters cigarette check for lit ones first stupid

earl laughs at the sign lights his cigarette and takes a long draw
taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf
paper headed your schedule

it charts off the hours every hour in blocks 1000 pm to 800
am is labeled go back to sleep earl consults the alarm clock 815
given the light outside it must be morning he checks his watch
1030 he presses the watch to his ear and listens he gives the watch
a wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock

according to the schedule the entire block from 800 to 830 has been
labeled brush your teeth earl laughs again and walks over to the
bathroom

the bathroom window is open as he flaps his arms to keep warm he
notices the ashtray on the windowsill a cigarette is perched on the
ashtray burning steadily through a long finger of ash he frowns
extinguishes the old butt and replaces it with the new one

the toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste
the tap is of the pushbutton varietya dose of water with each nudge
earl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth
while he opens the medicine cabinet the shelves are stocked with
singleserving packages of vitamins aspirin antidiuretics the
mouthwash is also singleserving about a shotglassworth of blue
liquid in a sealed plastic bottle only the toothpaste is
regularsized earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it
with the mouthwash as he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste
he notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and
the steel backing of the medicine cabinet he spits the frothy blue
fluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down
he closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at his reflection in the
mirror

who needs half an hour to brush their teeth

the paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the
precision of a sixthgraders love note earl unfolds it and smooths
it against the mirror it reads

if you can still read this then youre a fucking coward

earl stares blankly at the paper then reads it again he turns it
over on the back it reads

ps after youve read this hide it again

earl reads both sides again then folds the note back down to its
original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste

maybe then he notices the scar it begins just beneath the ear jagged
and thick and disappears abruptly into his hairline earl turns his
head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scars
progress he traces it with a fingertip then looks back down at the
cigarette burning in the ashtray a thought seizes him and he spins
out of the bathroom

he is caught at the door to his room one hand on the knob two
pictures are taped to the wall by the door earls attention is caught
first by the mri a shiny black frame for four windows into someones
skull in marker the picture is labeled your brain earl stares at
it concentric circles in different colors he can make out the big
orbs of his eyes and behind these the twin lobes of his brain
smooth wrinkles circles semicircles but right there in the middle
of his head circled in marker tunneled in from the back of his neck
like a maggot into an apricot is something different deformed
broken but unmistakable a dark smudge the shape of a flower right
there in the middle of his brain

he bends to look at the other picture it is a photograph of a man
holding flowers standing over a fresh grave the man is bent over
reading the headstone for a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors
or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity the one man bent over
looking at the smaller man bent over reading the headstone earl
looks at the picture for a long time maybe he begins to cry maybe he
just stares silently at the picture eventually he makes his way back
to the bed flops down seals his eyes shut tries to sleep

the cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom a circuit in the
alarm clock counts down from ten and it starts ringing again

earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles
interrupted by a handprinted sign taped right above his head large
enough for him to read from the bed



you cant have a normal life anymore you must know that how can you
have a girlfriend if you cant remember her name cant have kids not
unless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesnt recognize them
sure as hell cant hold down a job not too many professions out there
that value forgetfulness prostitution maybe politics of course

no your life is over youre a dead manthe only thing the doctors
are hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies
and theyll probably never let you go home wherever that would be

so the question is not to be or not to be because you arent the
question is whether you want to do something about it whether revenge
matters to you

it does to most people for a few weeks they plot they scheme they
take measures to get even but the passage of time is all it takes to
erode that initial impulse time is theft isnt that what they say
and time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue
conveniently cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain
distance time steals your nerve

if time and fear arent enough to dissuade people from their revenge
then theres always authority softly shaking its head and saying we
understand but youre the better man for letting it go for rising
above it for not sinking to their level and besides says authority
if you try anything stupid well lock you up in a little room

but they already put you in a little room didnt they only they
dont really lock it or even guard it too carefully because youre a
cripple a corpse a vegetable who probably wouldnt remember to eat
or take a shit if someone wasnt there to remind you

and as for the passage of time well that doesnt really apply to you
anymore does it just the same ten minutes over and over again so
how can you forgive if you cant remember to forget

you probably were the type to let it go werent you before but
youre not the man you used to be not even half youre a fraction
youre the tenminute man

of course weakness is strong its the primary impulse youd
probably prefer to sit in your little room and cry live in your
finite collection of memories carefully polishing each one half a
life set behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of
exotic insects youd like to live behind that glass wouldnt you
preserved in aspic

youd like to but you cant can you you cant because of the last
addition to your collection the last thing you remember his face
his face and your wife looking to you for help

and maybe this is where you can retire to when its over your little
collection they can lock you back up in another little room and you
can live the rest of your life in the past but only if youve got a
little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him

you know im right you know theres a lot of work to do it may seem
impossible but im sure if we all do our part well figure something
out but you dont have much time youve only got about ten minutes
in fact then it starts all over again so do something with the time
youve got



earl opens his eyes and blinks into the darkness the alarm clock is
ringing it says 320 and the moonlight streaming through the window
means it must be  he early morning earl fumbles for the lamp almost
knocking it over in the process incandescent light fills the room
painting the metal furniture yellow the walls yellow the bedspread
too he lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles
above him interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling he
reads the sign two maybe three times then blinks at the room around
him

it is a bare room institutional maybe there is a desk over by the
window the desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock earl
probably notices at this point that he is fully clothed he even has
his shoes on under the sheets he extracts himself from the bed and
crosses to the desk nothing in the room would suggest that anyone
lived there or ever had except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here
and there to the wall no pictures no books nothing through the
window he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass

earl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at
the two keys taped to the back of his hand he picks at the tape while
he searches through the empty drawers in the left pocket of his
jacket he finds a roll of hundreddollar bills and a letter sealed in
an envelope he checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom
bits of tape cigarette butts nothing else

earl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and
moves back toward the bed he lies back down and stares up at the
ceiling and the sign taped to it the sign reads get up get out
right now these people are trying to kill you

earl closes his eyes



they tried to teach you to make lists in grade school remember back
when your day planner was the back of your hand and if your
assignments came off in the shower well then they didnt get done
no direction they said no discipline so they tried to get you to
write it all down somewhere more permanent

of course your gradeschool teachers would be laughing their pants
wet if they could see you now because youve become the exact product
of their organizational lessons because you cant even take a piss
without consulting one of your lists

they were right lists are the only way out of this mess

heres the truth people even regular people are never just any one
person with one set of attributes its not that simple were all at
the mercy of the limbic system clouds of electricity drifting through
the brain every man is broken into twentyfourhour fractions and
then again within those twentyfour hours its a daily pantomime one
man yielding control to the next a backstage crowded with old hacks
clamoring for their turn in the spotlight every week every day the
angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man and in turn to the
sex addict the introvert the conversationalist every man is a mob
a chain gang of idiots

this is the tragedy of life because for a few minutes of every day
every man becomes a genius moments of clarity insight whatever you
want to call them the clouds part the planets get in a neat little
line and everything becomes obvious i should quit smoking maybe or
heres how i could make a fast million or such and such is the key to
eternal happiness thats the miserable truth for a few moments the
secrets of the universe are opened to us life is a cheap parlor
trick

but then the genius the savant has to hand over the controls to the
next guy down the pike most likely the guy who just wants to eat
potato chips and insight and brilliance and salvation are all
entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic

the only way out of this mess of course is to take steps to ensure
that you control the idiots that you become to take your chain gang
hand in hand and lead them the best way to do this is with a list

its like a letter you write to yourself a master plan drafted by
the guy who can see the light made with steps simple enough for the
rest of the idiots to understand follow steps one through one
hundred repeat as necessary

your problem is a little more acute maybe but fundamentally the same
thing

its like that computer thing the chinese room you remember that
one guy sits in a little room laying down cards with letters written
on them in a language he doesnt understand laying them down one
letter at a time in a sequence according to someone elses
instructions the cards are supposed to spell out a joke in chinese
the guy doesnt speak chinese of course he just follows his
instructions

there are some obvious differences in your situation of course you
broke out of the room they had you in so the whole enterprise has to
be portable and the guy giving the instructionsthats you too just
an earlier version of you and the joke youre telling well its got
a punch line i just dont think anyones going to find it very funny

so thats the idea all you have to do is follow your instructions
like climbing a ladder or descending a staircase one step at a time
right down the list simple

and the secret of course to any list is to keep it in a place where
youre bound to see it



he can hear the buzzing through his eyelids insistent he reaches out
for the alarm clock but he cant move his arm

earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him the man
looks up at him annoyed then resumes his work earl looks around
him too dark for a doctors office

then the pain floods his brain blocking out the other questions he
squirms gain trying to yank his forearm away  the one that feels
like its burning the arm doesnt move but the man shoots him
another scowl earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top
of the mans head

the noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the mans handa
gun with a needle where the barrel should be the needle is digging
into the fleshy underside of earls forearm leaving a trail of puffy
letters behind it

earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view to read the
letters on his arm but he cant he lies back and stares at the
ceiling

eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise wipes earls forearm
with a piece of gauze and wanders over to the back to dig up a
pamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection maybe later
hell tell his wife about this guy and his little note maybe his wife
will convince him to call the police

earl looks down at the arm the letters are rising up from the skin
weeping a little they run from just behind the strap of earls watch
all the way to the inside of his elbow earl blinks at the message and
reads it again it says in careful little capitals i raped and
killed your wife



its your birthday today so i got you a little present i would have
just bought you a beer but who knows where that would have ended

so instead i got you a bell i think i may have had to pawn your
watch to buy it but what the hell did you need a watch for anyway

youre probably asking yourself why a bell in fact im guessing
youre going to be asking yourself that question every time you find
it in your pocket too many of these letters now too many for you to
dig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little
question

its a joke actually a practical joke but think of it this way im
not really laughing at you so much as with you

id like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and
wonder why do i have this bell a little part of you a little piece
of your broken brain will remember and laugh like im laughing now

besides you do know the answer it was something you learned before
so if you think about it youll know

back in the old days people were obsessed with the fear of being
buried alive you remember now medical science not being quite what
it is today it wasnt uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a
casket so rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing
tubes little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone
woke up when they werent supposed to they wouldnt run out of
oxygen now they must have tested this out and realized that you
could shout yourself hoarse through the tube but it was too narrow to
carry much noise not enough to attract attention at least so a
string was run up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone
if a dead person came back to life all he had to do was ring his
little bell till someone came and dug him up again

im laughing now picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fastfood
restaurant reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and
wondering to yourself where it came from why you have it maybe
youll even ring it

happy birthday buddy

i dont know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem so i
dont know whether to congratulate you or me a bit of a lifestyle
change admittedly but an elegant solution nonetheless

look to yourself for the answer

that sounds like something out of a hallmark card i dont know when
you thought it up but my hats off to you not that you know what the
hell im talking about but honestly a real brainstorm after all
everybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are youre
no different



the little mechanical voice pauses then repeats itself it says the
time is 800 am this is a courtesy call earl opens his eyes and
replaces the receiver the phone is perched on a cheap veneer
headboard that stretches behind the bed curves to meet the corner
and ends at the minibar the tv is still on blobs of flesh color
nattering away at each other earl lies back down and is surprised to
see himself older now tanned the hair pulling away from his head
like solar flares the mirror on the ceiling is cracked the silver
fading increases earl continues to stare at himself astonished by
what he sees he is fully dressed but the clothes are old threadbare
in places

earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch but its
gone he looks down from the mirror to his arm it is bare and the
skin has changed to an even tan as if he never owned a watch in the
first place the skin is even in color except for the solid black
arrow on the inside of earls wrist pointing up his shirtsleeve he
stares at the arrow for a moment perhaps he doesnt try to rub it off
anymore he rolls up his sleeve

the arrow points to a sentence tattooed along earls inner arm earl
reads the sentence once maybe twice another arrow picks up at the
beginning of the sentence points farther up earls arm disappearing
under the rolledup shirtsleeve he unbuttons his shirt

looking down on his chest he can make out the shapes but cannot bring
them into focus so he looks up at the mirror above him

the arrow leads up earls arm crosses at the shoulder and descends
onto his upper torso terminating at a picture of a mans face that
occupies most of his chest the face is that of a large man balding
with a mustache and a goatee it is a particular face but like a
police sketch it has a certain unreal quality

the rest of his upper torso is covered in words phrases bits of
information and instructions all of them written backward on earl
forward in the mirror

eventuallyearl sits up buttons his shirt and crosses to the desk he takes out
a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer sits and begins
to write


							  
i dont know where youll be when you read this im not even sure if
youll bother to read this i guess you dont need to

its a shame really that you and i will never meet but like the
song says by the time you read this note ill be gone

were so close now thats the way it feels so many pieces put
together spelled out i guess its just a matter of time until you
find him

who knows what weve done to get here must be a hell of a story if
only you could remember any of it i guess its better that you cant

i had a thought just now maybe youll find it useful

everybody is waiting for the end to come but what if it already
passed us by what if the final joke of judgment day was that it had
already come and gone and we were none the wiser apocalypse arrives
quietly the chosen are herded off to heaven and the rest of us the
ones who failed the test  just keep on going oblivious dead
already  wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping
score still optimistic about the future

i guess if thats true then it doesnt matter what you do no
expectations if you cant find him then it doesnt matter because
nothing matters and if you do find him then you can kill him without
worrying about the consequences because there are no consequences

thats what im thinking about right now in this scrappy little room
framed pictures of ships on the wall i dont know obviously but if
i had to guess id say were somewhere up the coast if youre
wondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right i
dont know what to tell you i guess we must have been driving for a
while and no i dont know what happened to your watch

and all these keys i have no idea not a one that i recognize car
keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks what have
we been up to

i wonder if hell feel stupid when you find him tracked down by the
tenminute man  assassinated by a vegetable

ill be gone in a moment ill put down the pen close my eyes and
then you can read this through if you want

i just wanted you to know that im proud of you no one who matters is
left to say it no one left is going to want to

earls eyes are wide open staring through the window of the car
smiling eyes smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across
the street the crowd gathering around the body in the doorway the
body emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain



a stocky guy facedown eyes open balding head goatee in death as
in police sketches faces tend to look the same this is definitely
somebody in particular but really it could be anybody

earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb
the car whos to say maybe its a police cruiser maybe its just a
taxi

as the car is swallowed into traffic earls eyes continue to shine
out into the night watching the body until it disappears into a
circle of concerned pedestrians he chuckles to himself as the car
continues to make distance between him and the growing crowd

earls smile fades a little something has occurred to him he begins
to pat down his pockets leisurely at first like a man looking for
his keys then a little more desperately maybe his progress is
impeded by a set of handcuffs he begins to empty the contents of his
pockets out onto the seat next to him some money a bunch of keys
scraps of paper

a round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl
seat  earl is frantic now he hammers at the plastic divider between
him and the driver begging the man for a pen perhaps the cabbie
doesnt speak much english perhaps the cop isnt in the habit of
talking to suspects either way the divider between the man in front
and the man behind remains closed a pen is not forthcoming

the car hits a pothole and earl blinks at his reflection in the
rearview mirror he is calm now the driver makes another corner and
the metal lump slides back over to rest against earls leg with a
little jingle he picks it up and looks at it  curious now it is a
little bell a little metal bell inscribed on it are his name and a
set of dates he recognizes the first one the year in which he was
born but the second date means nothing to him nothing at all

as he turns the bell over in his hands he notices the empty space on
his wrist where his watch used to sit there is a little arrow there
pointing up his arm earl looks at the arrow then begins to roll up
his sleeve



youd be late for your own funeral shed say remember the more i
think about it the more trite that seems what kind of idiot after
all is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story

and how would i know if i were late  anyway i dont have a watch
anymore i dont know what we did with it

what the hell do you need a watch for  anyway it was an antique
deadweight tugging at your wrist symbol of the old you the you that
believed in time

no scratch that its not so much that youve lost your faith in time
as that time has lost its faith in you and who needs it  anyway who
wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future in
the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something
powerful living in the next moment in which they feel nothing
crawling down the hands of the clock away from the people who did
unspeakable things to them believing the lie that time will heal all
woundswhich is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us

but youre different youre more perfect  time is three things for
most people but for you for us just one a singularity one moment
this moment like youre the center of the clock the axis on which
the hands turn time moves about you but never moves you it has lost
its ability to affect you what is it they say that time is theft
but not for you close your eyes and you can start all over again
conjure up that necessary emotion fresh as roses

time is an absurdity an abstraction the only thing that matters is
this moment this moment a million times over you have to trust me
if this moment is repeated enough if you keep tryingand you have to
keep tryingeventually you will come across the next item on your
list
