               the perp veers to the left and seemingly oblivious to the 
               fact that its a thirtyfoot drop he hurdles the guard rail 
               and drops to fortyfirst street below

               edwards is surprised by this maneuver but doesnt waste a 
               second he too hurdles the guard rail and lands on

               filled with japanese tourists and it seems like every single 
               one of them has a video camera

               jumps into the back

               ext fifth avenue  night

               the perp meanwhile is running at top speed when edwards 
               glides into frame leaning off the back of the truck

                         ass too

               edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him when the perp 
               blinks nothing unusual about that but then another set of 
               translucent milky white eyelids underneath his regular 
               eyelids blinks also

               seen reacting quickly edwards bats it out of the perps 
               hand

               a lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate new 
               york farm country several lights are on and through a window 
               we can see the silhouette of a man sitting at the kitchen 
               table the silhouette of a woman hovering over him bringing 
               things to him

               the man edgar waves his arms ranting

                                     edgar os

                         know what you call this

               in the sky above its one of those brilliant star fields 
               but something strange is happening with one of those stars  
               its getting bigger

                                     edgar os

                         it is poison isnt it

               no that star isnt getting bigger its moving toward us 
               fast it goes from a pinpoint to a dime to a nickel to a 
               quarter and works its way into fruit metaphors

                                     edgar os
                         i swear to god i would not be 
                         surprised if it was the way you

                         hit too much  or aint been hit 
                         enough i cant make up my mind

               okay were way past watermelon now that thing is huge and 
               its starting to glow hot red as it enters the earths 
               atmosphere headed straight toward us coming here to 
               beatrice and edgars place

               the blazing fireball barrels through the sky snaps off a 
               couple trees 

                                     edgar os
                         youre useless beatrice the only 
                         thing that pulls its weight around 
                         here is my goddamn truck

                and slams right through a pickup truck parked in the 
               driveway a concussive blast follows then a geyser of smoke 
               and flame erupts

                                     edgar os
                         stay here

               the silhouette of edgar leaps to its feet races to the door 
               and throws it open edgar is everything his voice led us to 
               expect  a nasty bugeyed redneck carrying a twelvegauge 
               shotgun his mouth agape he walks across the yard and stares 
               at the hulking shell that was his truck

               the skeleton of the truck is still there but theres a huge 
               smoldering hole in it a hole that goes at least ten feet 
               down into the ground

                                     edgar
                         figures

               he walks to the truck and touches the door handle hot using 
               his shirt tail he opens the door and peers down into the 
               hole

               in the hole he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few 
               blinking lights

               embedded into the ground is indeed a spaceship maybe eight 
               feet across

               beatrice calls from behind him standing in the doorway 
               fearfully

                                     beatrice
                         what is it edgar

                                     edgar
                              turns to her
                         get your big butt back in that house

               beatrice does as shes told closing the door behind her 
               edgar turns back to the smoldering rock raising his shotgun 
               in defense an otherworldly voice comes from deep in the 
               hole

                                     voice os
                         place projectile weapon on ground

               edgar staggers back a step terrified but then he regains 
               himself raises the weapon and steps forward pointing it 
               menacingly down into the hole

                                     edgar
                         you can have my gun when you pry it 
                         from my cold dead fingers

               there is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer 
               finally it responds in a voice and cadence remarkably 
               similar to edgars

                                     voice os
                         your proposal is acceptable

               a long hairy pincer flashes out of the hole grabs edgar by 
               the head and pulls him down into the hole

               from deep in the hole we hear a terrible ripping sound 
               like a bedsheet being torn in half there are some disgusting 
               gushy sounds then a moment later something flies out of 
               the hole and flops onto the ground next to the truck

               its edgar well sort of his body parts still hang together  
               face arms legs even clothes  but everything inside has 
               been removed and now he just lies there flat and empty 
               like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom

               the shotgun flies out and lands beside him

                                                                    cut to

               int farmhouse  kitchen  night

               beatrice sits at the kitchen table terrified still wiping 
               away tears from edgars diatribe the door opens and edgar 
               comes back into the kitchen seemingly fleshed out again 
               leaving the door hanging open behind him he carries the 
               shotgun

               she looks up at him anxious but his face is a blank

                                     beatrice
                         what on earth was it

               he looks at her strangely when he speaks his voice is 
               different than before more refined

                                     edgar
                         sugar

               pause she looks out the window at the smoking truck

                                     beatrice
                         ive never seen sugar do that

                                     edgar
                         give me sugar

               puzzled beatrice gets up goes to the cabinet and grabs a 
               bag of sugar

               she holds it out to him

                                     edgar
                         in water

               frightened she takes a glass of water from the table she 
               dumps some of the sugar into it

                                     edgar
                         more

               she puts more till the glass is brimming she stirs it 
               quickly with a knife and hands it to him her hand trembling

               edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp beatrice stares 
               at edgar no idea what to think she notices something odd 
               about the skin on his neck

                                     beatrice
                         edgar your skin its  its  
                         just hanging off your bones

               edgar drops the glass and looks in a window to catch his 
               reflection he reaches up 

                and twists his whole face as if adjusting a ski mask 
               then tucks the skin of his neck back into his shirt collar 
               he looks at her

                                     edgar

               left by the spaceship

               the nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit wavers 
               keeps moving and finally crunches to the ground outside the 
               pit

               edgar climbs out of the pit breathing heavily he dusts 
               himself off and continues pushing the ship along the ground 
               off into the darkness

               enormous blades of a tunnel vent air intake there is an

               the rentacop kind reading a comic book on a folding metal 
               chair halfway across

               edwards walks across the room his footsteps echoing the

               open silently behind him edwards waits unaware

               from behind him somebody clears their throat edwards turns 
               around and finds himself standing in

               this back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as 
               the entryway

               standing at the front of the room is zed a wirehaired career 
               gman an old school bureaucrat wearing the exact same kind 
               of suit kay had on last night six other hot recruits sit in

               the recruits scribble away at the written test its a thick 
               document 

               reasoning skills general knowledge diagrams the recruits 
               seem to be really powering through it filling in answer 
               after answer

               but no desks have been provided for them and theyre all 
               still in their chairs writing uncomfortably on their thighs 
               or knees

               edwards is really struggling he writes two words on one 
               answer then decides to erase it the lack of a writing 
               surface is driving him crazy his pencil even tears through 
               the page

               he looks up in the middle of the tile floor there is an 
               unused table

               edwards gets up goes to it grabs hold 

                and drags it screeching deafeningly back to his chair 
               everybody looks up wincing at the horrible sound that fills 
               the room

               edwards sits back down now writing on the table thats 
               better

               zed raises an eyebrow he stares at edwards then looks up 
               toward a smoked glass window behind the dark glass a figure 
               stands staring unemotional

                                                                    cut to

               seven weapons rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise 
               empty triangular room the seven recruits stand in front of 
               the table

               theres an odd moment  where everyone sort of looks around 
               at each other at the blank walls

                                     edwards

                         well yeah i know but

               and then suddenly 

               the two far walls pull apart the whole room pulsates and 
               the air is suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of 
               stroboscopic images both human and alien everywhere is 
               color light and movement  a holographic mass of strange 
               shapes and characters moving simultaneously

               the recruits lunge for the weapons snapping them up and 
               taking aim six shots are fired at once and then a second 
               later a seventh shot is fired everyone sort of looks at 
               edwards who puts his gun down last

               theres an awkward silence then the door opens light pours 
               in and zed with it even the highly competitive cadets cant 
               help but feel some sympathy as zed walks straight to edwards

                                     zed
                         the hell happened

                         hesitated sir

               zed looks into the gallery most obvious in the frozen tableau 
               of creatures is a lunging snarling beast which has three 
               bullet holes in its chest next to it is a massively deformed 
               humanoid creature with a large hook for a head which also 
               has three holes in it in the back corner of the gallery 
               there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eightyearold 
               girl

                                     zed
                         may i ask why you felt little tiffany

                                     edwards
                         she was the only one who actually 
                         seemed dangerous at the time

                                     zed
                         and how did you come to that 
                         conclusion

                                     edwards
                         hookhead guy you explain to me how 
                         he can think with a hook for a head 
                         answer its not his head his head 
                         is that buttugly beanbag thing 
                         over there cause if you look at

                         tissues in his hand no threat there 
                         and anyhow the girls books were 
                         way too advanced for an eightyear
                         olds and besides from where im 
                         looking she was the only one who 
                         appeared to have a motive and i 
                         dont appreciate your jumping down

               his beloved cat he heads into leshkos a russian diner

               a moment later the orkin van pulls to a stop across the

               rosenberg comes into the tiny restaurant squinting in the 
               relative darkness at a table in the middle he sees a man 
               eating alone  an enormous dignified yet profoundly strange
               looking man in his mid fifties

               rosenberg walks carefully over to the table but does not 
               sit down the man an arquillian and if were eagleeyed 
               we recognize him as the alien on a diplomatic mission from 
               passport control rises from his chair he steps forward to 
               face rosenberg who sets the ornate box on the table

               immediately rosenbergs cat jumps on top of it

               rosenberg and the arquillian stare at each other for a long 
               moment 

                and then embrace each other the embrace has an odd formal 
               quality to it like mafiosi coming to a sitdown they hold 
               on long and hard and both seemed choked with emotion

               finally they break apart and take their seats they speak 
               in a bizarre alien tongue which is subtitled rosenberg

               midsection of the waiter carrying it he carries the tray 
               along the counter toward a pair of swinging doors that lead 
               out into the restaurant

               the doors swing in as another waiter sweeps into the kitchen 
               and our waiter heads out into the dining area as the doors 
               swing closed behind him they reveal storage shelves crammed 
               with bags of rice cans of stewed tomatoes 

                and a dead waiter literally folded in half and stuffed 
               in among the shelves

               they clink glasses and drink just as the waiter arrives 
               still we see only his arms and midsection as he sets the 
               tray on a stand and lifts the plates of pirogi he carries 
               them to the table and sets them down

               rosenberg setting his glass down next to the plate catches 
               a glimpse of the waiters hand 

                just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the 
               waiters sleeve and scurries across the table the glass 
               slips out of rosenbergs hand dumping wine all over the 
               table

               he looks up slowly and sees the waiters face

               out of edgars sleeves and scurry across the table rosenberg

               suddenly a long stinger whips out from under the back of 
               edgars apron and zips under the table first rosenberg and 
               then the arquillian lurch forward their chairs their faces 
               contorting in pain

               they both pitch forward their faces slogging into fresh 
               pirogi

               the stinger snaps out from under the table and whips back 
               under edgars apron he moves quickly searching their 
               pockets but he doesnt find what hes looking for the cat 
               still perched on top of the ornate box hisses at him

               edgar reaches out and bats the cat away with one vicious 
               swipe of his hand the animal howls and flies across the 
               room landing in a womans lunch

               the woman screams now other diners attention is drawn to 
               edgars table where two obviously dead men are being robbed 
               by a waiter there are shouts of outrage a few men rise out 
               of their seats

               edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it but finds 
               it locked with the furor rising around him he shoves the 
               box under one arm and bolts for the door

               as he goes

               jay and laurel cross the room to where rosenbergs corpse 
               lies out on another gurney

                                     laurel

                         full laparotomy i started with the 
                         lesser curvature of the stomach  
                         though if you want we could begin 
                         at the gastroesophageal junction

                                     jay
                         i think uh we should start at the 
                         same place you did

                                     laurel
                         all right

               jay hears a meow and looks down rosenbergs cat is rubbing 
               up against his leg

                         bodies

               she snaps one of her rubber gloves and reaches down out of 
               frame sinking her hands into the body as she moves things 
               aside just by the look on jays face one can imagine how 
               disgusting it is

               laurel digs in up to her elbows jay winces she pulls one 
               bloody glove out to wipe a strand of hair out of her face 
               he looks at her 

                and she winks at him hes surprised she laughs

                                     laurel

                         wont mind

               jay is reluctant so she rolls her eyes and helps him taking 
               him by the hand and guiding him into the thick of the corpse

                                     laurel

                         well of course they are what im 
                         pointing out is that there are no 
                         pieces of them left so theyre 
                         intact wherever they are that we 
                         can be sure of

                                     laurel

                         strangest feeling of deja vu

                         you the same thing

               laurel looks at him sideways skeptical but also intrigued 
               she whispers to him confiding in him

                                     laurel
                         okay you wanna know what i really

                         like hes already under enough stress
                              then
                         this body is not really a body but 
                         its actually some sort of transport 
                         unit for something else altogether 
                         the question is what

               jay just looks at her intrigued

                                     laurel

                         no no not at all

               after a particularly gross gushy sound he looks away toward 
               her shes staring at him

               laurel leans over and lowers her voice just for him

                                     laurel

                         no

               from the other side of the room kay clears his throat

                         excuse me

               he walks across the morgue to kay who is still examining 
               the arquillian

               but jay never takes his eyes off laurel

                                     kay

                         not to sound too dumb

               across the morgue laurel is still examining rosenberg now 
               bent down next to his head carefully studying his left ear 
               she notices something strange turns and calls over her 
               shoulder to jay

                                     laurel
                         dr white

               jay in conversation with kay does not respond to what is 
               not his name

                                     laurel

                         dr white
                              still louder
                         dr white

               he still doesnt answer

                                     laurel
                              shouting

               jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her

                                     laurel
                         look at this

               jay leans down there is strange stitching around the base 
               of rosenbergs ear

                                     jay
                         what is that

               he reaches out touches the ear then he actually turns it 
               with a soft click 

                it pulls away from the head like a latch

               jay and laurel look at each other astonished jay pulls 
               again and rosenbergs entire face pushes out with a 
               mechanical hum then hinges open the whole face rotating 
               out away from the rest of the artificial skull

               a tiny little green man sits inside rosenbergs head

               though not quite dead the tiny little green man is gravely 
               wounded he staggers up out of a small control room inside 
               rosenbergs head with gearshifts and viewing screens all 
               around the inside of the skull

                                     laurel
                         far  freaking  out

               from inside throaty wails of frustration can be heard two 
               passersby hear the racket and hesitate wondering if they 
               should get involved

               but an inhuman growl rattles the whole van and they wise up 
               hurrying on their way

               int orkin van  new york alley  night

               inside the van the ornate rosewood box is now battered and 
               scarred its various locks holding tight against edgars 
               repeated attempts to claw his way into it crammed into the 
               back of the van along with his spaceship edgar wedges a 
               screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the 
               rest of the box and smacks it with his right fist nothing 
               doing

               he bellows in rage and hurls the box against the side of the 
               van where it finally cracks a hinge edgar snaps it up 
               pries the rest of the hinge off with the screwdriver and 
               wrenches the top off the box

               inside there are dozens of precious glittering diamonds 
               which he promptly tosses aside as worthless but the rest of 
               the box is empty

               jay follows kay out glancing back to see the huge gun turrets 
               on the arquillian battle cruiser hum and whir as they swing 
               around into position pointed down at the unwitting planet 
               below

               shop collapses in a shower of glass edgar reaches in and 
               fumbles with the locks undoing them one by one he gets 
               them all and steps inside out the window behind him we can 
               see his orkin van double parked in the street in front

               all the gems and jewels are under glass counters edgar starts 
               smashing the glass grabbing great handfuls of jewels and 
               tossing them aside

               outside a new york city tow truck pulls up to the front of 
               the orkin van and starts to hitch up

               edgar in his rage starts to smash anything breakable even 
               the framed pictures on the walls he stops at one particular 
               picture staring intently at it its a glamour shot of 
               rosenbergs cat provocatively posed on a satin pillow there 
               are a half dozen more pictures of the cat some posed with 
               rosenberg some by itself this animal was important to 
               rosenberg

               from outside the roar of an engine distracts edgar he turns 
               around in time to see the orkin van lurch as the tow lifts 
               its front wheels off the ground

               ext gem and jewelry store  day

               edgar rushes outside as the tow truck driver gets the van up 
               on the hoist

                                     edgar

                         and make sure you tell them that at 
                         the impound

               edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out 
               his twelve gauge he points it at the tow truck driver the 
               tow truck driver looks at him with disdain and pulling back 
               his shirt reveals a meanlooking gun

                         i got worse

               he keeps hitching up the van two pedestrians walk past the 
               dispute very fast ignoring the debate headed right for 
               the shop we go with them and realize that its 

                jay and kay they stop at the smashed door of the jewelry 
               shop and exchange a glance kay pulls a very menacinglooking 
               weapon nods and they step inside

               they look around and see the recent demolition caused by

               empty bowl and a bag of cat food next to a scrumptious 
               pillow there are several photos of a cat on the wall

               there is also a pile of bejeweled cat collars jay picks up 
               one of the collars inspects it closely shaking his head

                                     jay
                         this guy had a serious crush on his 
                         cat

               jays attention is broken by something through the window 
               outside lumbering straight for the store is edgar

               jay thinks for a moment  where does he know that face

               suddenly edgar raises his arms pointing both the farmers 
               rifle and the drivers shotgun before edgar can shoot jay 
               yells

                         kay get down

               and then jay fires shattering the storefront window and 
               blowing up a car on the street the blast hurls him up and 
               back a good ten feet slamming him into the wall with 
               tremendous force edgar turns and rushes away down the street 
               as jay picks himself up

                                     jay

                         redneck from the picture thats 
                         him

               jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after 
               edgar

                                     kay

               edgar doesnt bother sticking around to continue his fight 
               he jumps behind the wheel of the tow truck starts it up 
               and hits the gas the engine roars

               jay sprints after him firing his noisy cricket he is thrown 
               back into some pedestrians while his shot

               hits the rigging between the orkin van and the town truck 
               separating the two jay pulls himself up and sprints after 
               the tow truck but it accelerates too quickly

               edgar is just about to turn the corner when jay leaps onto a 
               parked car to try and get some height as jay prepares to 
               shoot edgar disappears around the corner and a hugh truck 
               backs into his line of fire

               jay fires the truck explodes and jay flies backwards 
               hurtling through the air and crashing through the window of 
               a car his rear end right in the woman drivers face

               when jay looks up kay is standing before him he yanks jay

               she pets the cat as she does the cats collar shines in 
               the light

               laurel turns the name tag to face her

               close on a precious jewel and the word orion

               circular icon of a strange and beautiful metal the center 
               is some sort of hardened translucent material light green 
               in color

               laurel rolls her eyes she seems irritated with him but it 
               doesnt go with what shes saying

                                     laurel

               kay comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor he 
               checks his watch then leans against the counter and pulls 
               out a pack of cigarettes

               waiting

               int morgue  day

               jay is thoroughly enjoying himself but laurel seems to be 
               going crazy

                                     laurel
                         i have something i need to show you

               she looks down pointedly in the direction of her waist

                                     jay
                         now slow down you dont have to hit 
                         the gas like that

               she leans in and lowers her voice

                                     laurel
                         you dont understand you really 
                         need to see this

                         things okay

               int morgue  corridor  day

               kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side 
               he raises it to his cigarette but as it draws close the 
               match goes out with a sharp

               sizzle

               kay furrows his brow odd

               int morgue  day

               laurel is at the end of her rope

                                     laurel
                         look stud i dont know how many

               she points sharply at the examination table directly in 
               front of her

                                     laurel
                          that you have to help me with

               jays smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out 
               he starts to reach for his gun

               int morgue  corridor  day

               kay raises another lit match to his cigarette but as this 
               one gets close

               a big glob of goo drops from the ceiling and onto the match 
               dousing the flame

               kay looks up sharply

               above him tony the counter guy is stuck to one high corner 
               of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous dripping fluid 
               hes dead a frozen look of terror on his face and the can 
               of raid still clutched in his hand

               from inside the morgue laurel screams

               int morgue  day

               kay races into the morgue just as the examination table 
               explodes into the air revealing edgar who was hiding beneath 
               it

               now everything happens at once jay leaps back and draws the 
               noisy cricket kay pulls out his series four deatomizer 
               and edgar holds his shotgun under laurels chin using her 
               body to shield his own

                                     kay

               orion the cat suddenly attacks leaping off the top of the 
               cabinet and landing on edgar hissing and scratching and 
               clawing for all shes worth

               edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off the cat squirms in 
               his arm the icon jangling edgar grabs the icon holds onto 
               it and flings the cat away across the morgue the icon 
               comes free remaining in his hand

               he drops it into his mouth and swallows he shoves the gun 
               hard against laurels cheek

                                     edgar

                         fly

               edgar cranks one of laurels arms behind her back hard and 
               she cries out in pain

                                     edgar
                         would you care to see the fly get

                                     edgar
                         put the weapons down

                         never gonna happen insect

               edgar backs away with laurel further into the morgue toward 
               a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft 
               jay and kay advance slowly cornering him

                                     jay
                         its okay laurel

                                     laurel

                                     jay

                                     edgar
                         dont bet on it meat sack

               and with that he turns leaps 

                and crashes right through the window into the air shaft

               ext morgue side street  dusk

               edgar still clutching laurel explodes up over a railing

               nobody looks twice as edgar dragging laurel with his arm 
               over her mouth races toward the nearby busy manhattan 
               street

               int morgue  air shaft  dusk

               jay and kay duck into the air shaft and look up  too far 
               to climb and the walls are smooth anyway

                                     kay
                         damn it

               they turn and run out of the morgue

               ext the nearby busy manhattan street  dusk

               edgar with laurel runs right in front of a cab which 
               screeches to a halt inches from them the cabbie sticks his 
               head out and yells something in an unknown language and 
               keeps yelling as 

               edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the cabbie 
               out the door cigarette and wooden seatbeads and all

               the cab driver is still yelling as edgar leaps in pushing 
               laurel in before him leaving her behind the wheel

               he removes a postcard  the one he took from the display on 
               the newsstand

                                     edgar
                         take me here

                                     laurel
                         what

               edgar just cranks the car into gear  opening his mouth and 
               swallowing the icon  and in so doing revealing a triple 
               row of serrated bugteeth he slams his foot on the gas pedal

               laurels head snaps back as the car rocks forward she has 
               no choice but to grab the wheel and start steering as 

               the car screeches out into traffic swerving wildly as laurel 
               is forced to make a 90degree turn the car fishtails wildly 
               swiping an oncoming car as it straightens and heads into the 
               traffic

               the furious cab driver runs off after it still yelling as 
               he disappears around the corner

               a second later kay and jay rush out into the street the 
               cab is nowhere to be seen jay runs into the street noticing 
               the wooden beads the ripped pinescented green deodorizer 
               and the stillburning cigarette

                                     jay
                         theyre in a cab

               and jay starts running down the street where dozens of cabs 
               are waiting at the intersection hes running from cab to 
               cab pounding on windows scaring the living shit out of 
               people 

                                     jay
                         hey laurel hey

                but laurel and edgar are nowhere to be found up ahead 
               the light turns green and the tide of taxis wash away leaving 
               jay on the street he turns as a car screeches up behind 
               him its headlights shining in his eyes as it gets closer 
               jay sees its kay in the ltd

               them with contained fury

                                     edgar

                         be carrying

                                     edgar
                         you milksuckers you dont matter 
                         in a few seconds you wont even be

                         move away from the vehicle and put 
                         your hands on your head

               he pumps the gun for emphasis

                                     edgar
                         put my hands on my head

               edgar stares at him then flexes his arms still encased in 
               flesh his giant pincers rip free of the rotting skin

               he extends both pincers to the sides and my god his reach 
               must be twelve feet across

               now the skin and clothes on edgars legs begins to crack and 
               shred they burst apart revealing two hideous doubledover 
               insect legs the bug raises himself aloft on his legs

               he sucks in a deep breath of air and now the rest of the 
               edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs the torso 
               explodes in great rendering of cloth and skin and finally 
               edgars head simply bursts apart spattering against the 
               walls edgar now reveals himself as he really is a hairy 
               buglike exoskeleton a scaly tail with a long stinger a 
               head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a small nose and 
               two horselike feet with three toes each

               he raises his pincers in the air resting them on his head 
               the galaxy hangs on a chain around his neck

                                     bug
                         like this

               kay and jay pump their guns and aim at the bug

               suddenly the bug spits and a huge slimy wad of goo shoots 
               from him and engulfs both shotguns the bug snorts it back 
               tearing them from jay and kays grasp then swallowing them

               jay and kay have only a second to react before 

               the bug swipes at them with the back of his clawed hand 
               like someone brushing aside a gnat  and sends them flying 
               fifteen feet in the air

               ext laurels tree  night

               she flinches as she sees them hit the ground she starts to 
               climb the tree

                         planned

               they look up to see the bug moving for the second tower  
               and the second flying saucer kay gets to his feet

                         with a newspaper

               the bug turns toward kay kay steps up to him the small 
               human facing off against the giant alien hug

               ext laurels tree  night

               she quietly makes it to the ground  hurries off to the 
               darkness of the woods

               ext worlds fair  on kay and the bug  night

               kay has himself in the bugs face its dripping fangs inches 
               from kays face

                         page to me you slimy gutsucking 
                         intestinal parasite eat me

               the bug reacts  cranks open its massive jaws with a 
               deafening hiss lunges forward and sucks kay into his mouth

               the bug straightens up to its full height and throws his 
               head back kay slides down the bugs throat bending it 
               sideways as he kicks and screams his way down into its 
               abdomen

               jay looks on in stunned horror

               as the bug turns to jay and stretches to its full height and 
               lets loose a hideous screaming howl of triumph

               ext woods  night

               laurel is still watching

               ext worlds fair  on jay and the bug  night

               jay watches as the bug continues its howl of triumph he 
               feels totally defeated but

               he can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the bugs 
               stomach

               close on bugs stomach through the leathery pouch of the 
               bugs stomach we can just make out the distended outline of 
               the two atomizers and just a few inches from it a human 
               hand is reaching toward the gun kay

               int bug  night

               kay swimming in the bugs intestinal fluid tries to make 
               his way to the gun holding his breath eyes stinging

               ext worlds fair  night

               jay knows what he has to do he picks up a goodsized chunk 
               of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at 
               the bug

                                     jay
                         hey come over here and try that

               the concrete thunks off the bugs shell  he doesnt seem 
               to notice just keeps moving

               jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the bug

                                     jay
                         stop right there or ill start 
                         wailing on your waxy pointed ass

               jay starts pounding on the bug with the metal pole

               int bug  night

               kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun  
               the pounding on the outside distracts him and he turns  
               the gun shifts away

               ext worlds fair  night

               the bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of jays hands 
               he swings at jay  jay dodges the blow and falls to the 
               grass

               the bug slices down with razorsharp claws at jay 

                jay rolls out of the way just as the meanlooking claws 
               dig into the grass

               jay rolls right underneath the bugs legs his hand falls on 
               something in the grass  another piece of debris a sharp 
               metal spike gleaming like a dagger he grabs the metal spike 
               and looks up at the bugs apparently vulnerable underbelly 
               right above him

               he grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust 
               the spike up into the bugs gut when the bug bends its 
               head down between its legs

               bugs pov of jay there upsidedown from this perspective 
               lurking between the bugs legs

               ext worlds fair  night

               the bug opens its jaws and snaps at jay  who propels himself 
               backward out of harms way

               the bug starts climbing the tower jay howls in frustration

                                     jay
                         what are you afraid of me come on 
                         stand and fight like an arthropod

               in frustration jay screams and throws himself on the bug 
               hanging onto its back trying to drag it down

                                     jay
                         you want a piece of this huh maybe

                         this is new york city youre just 
                         another tourist here

               the bug flicks him off with his tail  sending him sailing 
               twenty feet through the air

               jay crashes into the dumpster landing on a heap in front of 
               the garbage

               but scratched and beatup jay still doesnt quit  he 
               stands to yell at the bug extending his arm at the creature

                                     jay

               his sleeve he flicks it off

               looks down at the ground sees another roach looks over 
               to the dumpster behind him there are more of them a 
               whole mob in fact fifty or sixty of the critters climbing 
               out of a rusted hole in the dumpster

               jay has one last desperate idea he kicks at the dumpster  
               part of the side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and 
               crumbles to pieces

               tens of thousands of roaches pouring forth from the dumpster 
               crawling like a black glittering river away from the 
               garbage

               jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of 
               insects

               around pointing up straight at the bugs head

               the front of the bugs thorax explodes in a shower of bug 
               juice all over jay

               the icon drops to the ground rolls over to jays feet and 
               clatters to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor

               city block

               from up in the clouds

               manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and 
               suburban sprawl

               from the stratosphere

               the east coast of the united states is just part of a much

               from the middle of the milky way

               our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star 
               field

               from outside our galaxy

               the milky way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other 
               creamy spirals

               from the outer reaches of the universe

               there seems to be an edge to what we see a curved border 
               that seems to close in on things around the perimeters until 
               everything that exists seems to be contained in one tiny 
               ball 

                which is actually a marble resting on a strangelooking 
               patch of red dirt

               an alien hand reaches down and flicks the marble sending it 
               skittering and bouncing across the dirt where it clicks 
               into a dozen other big blue balls just like it

               fade out
