                         point the gun away from debbie

                                     earl
                         debbies brains are going to be 
                         splattered all over the floor if i 
                         dont see a car in five minutes

               roper takes a long look at earl the guy is a hair trigger

                                     roper
                         alright but lets be clear about 
                         one thing if you kill someone i 
                         cant help you the swat guys will 
                         take you out

               earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside reflects 
               for a moment on the reality of the situation

                                     earl
                         what are my chances of getting out 
                         of here

               roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying

                                     roper
                         not bad last month a guy robbed a 
                         bank in daly city

               roper crouches down smiles at the blurryeyed guard

                                     roper
                         how ya doin

               the guard groans hes not doing very well roper peels back 
               the bloody handkerchief takes a look winces

                                     roper
                              to earl
                         cops gave him a car and he lost 
                         them on the freeway

               earl is encouraged by that

                                     earl
                         really

                                     roper
                         absolutely bank robbers are generally 
                         your smartest criminals

               roper looks directly into earls eyes

                                     roper
                         he didnt kill anybody though

               roper bends over the guard

                                     roper
                         this is gonna hurt

               he grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him 
               across the floor the guard moans piteously

                                     earl
                         hey leave him alone what are you 
                         doing

               roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door

                                     roper
                         its part of my negotiators oath 
                         if theres an injured party and i 
                         can help them im duty bound by my 
                         oath to do that you can shoot me if 
                         you want but the next negotiator in 
                         here is going to tell you the same 
                         thing

               earl is unsure what to do but he guesses an oath is an oath 
               he lets roper drag the guard to the door

                                     roper
                         ill be right back earl point that 
                         gun away from debbie

               earl compliantly moves the gun away from the tellers head 
               then rethinks and jerks it back against her temple

               ext bank  day

               roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on 
               the sidewalk two swat officers rush up to give aid one of 
               them is jennings

                                     roper
                              whispering to jennings
                         give me your gun

               note the method of disarming earl is still to be determined 
               jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to 
               him roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband 
               under his shirt and vest

                                     roper
                         i havent had to shoot anyone in 
                         three years

                                     jennings
                         why not keep the streak alive

                                     roper
                         because this strungout junkie is 
                         too stupid to get out of this without 
                         killing somebody

               int bank  day

               earl watches roper through the window he can only see ropers 
               back hes getting very agitated

                                     earl
                              yelling
                         hey what the fuck are you doing out 
                         there

               the two cops hustle off with the wounded guard and roper 
               calmly walks back into the bank stops about five paces from 
               earl

                                     roper

                         as show of good faith

               start rolling down her cheeks shes being tremendously brave

                                     roper
                         give me debbie

               earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her 
               head

                                     earl

               earl thinks about it his gun hand twitching he points at 
               two of the female employees cowering against the counter

               the two women dont need any extra encouragement they jump 
               up and rush out the front door

               roper turns around and walks toward the front door he stops 
               and looks over his shoulder

                                     roper
                         oh theres one last thing

               focused on the reflection of earl in the front window of the 
               bank

                                     roper

               roper grabs his jacket and walks off leaving mccall to ponder 
               the problem mccall looks over at another cop who has been 
               observing the cop shrugs his shoulders he hasnt got a

               roper bends over like an old man

                                     roper

               roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief

                         then he didnt say 742 he must have 
                         said 724 or something because this 
                         cant be right

               baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to roper who 
               is crossing to the truck

                                     roper

               if pulled from a trance he rises and moves to the door

                                     korda

               apartment for what reason we dont know maybe to make 
               sure theres nothing incriminating around he opens the door

               low

                         where did you find an old recording 
                         like that

                                     korda

                         i was in there looking for some robert 
                         johnson
                              searching for the 
                              name
                         memories memory lane or 
                         something

                                     baffert
                         ive got to stop in there mr 
                         korda do you know frank antonucci

                                     korda
                         you mean frank who owns the bakery 
                         down the street

               baffert smiles

                                     baffert
                         no this is a different frank this 
                         is a man who deals in jewelry stolen 
                         jewelry usually you wouldnt know 
                         anybody like that

               korda drifts to the other side of the room takes a look out 
               his front window

               his pov

               nobody there just the truck

                                     korda
                         i certainly wouldnt

               he says it as if the very idea disturbs him he turns away 
               from the window baffert feigns a coughing spell

                                     baffert
                         could i please have a little water

                                     korda
                              the perfect host
                         of course

               korda heads toward the kitchen area baffert uses this as an 
               opportunity to drift around the room do a little snooping

                                     baffert
                         the reason im asking you is because 
                         we arrested him with some stolen 
                         jewelry it was traced to the robbery 
                         of a store down on polk street he 
                         said he was fencing it for you

               baffert notices something in the trash can

               his pov

               several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels they have 
               jewelers markings on them indicating gem weight and grade

               int kitchen

               korda pouring the water notices bafferts discovery but 
               his face betrays nothing

                                     korda
                              calmly
                         theres obviously some mistake i 
                         have a cousin who has had runins 
                         with the law

               korda reenters the room with the glass of water

                                     korda
                         perhaps for his own reasons he 
                         entangled me in this situation

                                     baffert
                         this cousin of yours whats his 
                         name

                                     korda
                              forthrightly
                         clarence teal

               they look at each other a beat korda is still holding the 
               water

                                     korda
                         your cough seems to be better

               a real repressed tension here someones about to get hurt 
               baffert takes the glass of water

                                     baffert
                         thank you

               he takes a sip korda watches him like a cobra baffert puts 
               the glass down on the table

                                     baffert
                         well im on my way to the game i 
                         appreciate your cooperation mr 
                         korda

               korda smiles baffert walks to the door opens it to leave

                                     korda
                         lieutenant

               baffert turns back around

                                     korda
                         do you believe that story about robert 
                         johnson that he made a deal with 
                         the devil at the crossroads

               baffert muses along with korda

                                     baffert
                         could be

               baffert moves off down the hall and korda closes his door

               int hallway  night

               baffert gets into the elevator

               int elevator  night

               baffert takes out his cell phone dials

                                     baffert
                              as the elevator 
                              descends

                         a jewelry store theres visible 
                         evidence on the premises glassine 
                         envelopes with jewelers markings 
                         were seen in the trash can

               the elevator hits the first floor

                                     baffert
                         i believe a full search of the 
                         premises will turn up some stolen 
                         property

               the elevator opens

               korda is standing there with a knife

               baffert has no time to react

               the knife hand slashes forward stabbing the chest and 
               slashing across the throat

               ext building  night

               korda calmly exits the building as roper crosses the street 
               returning from the payphone neither of the men take any 
               particular notices of each other a woman carrying her 
               groceries enters the building

               roper gets to the truck a scream from inside the building

               int building  night

               baffert is laying in the open elevator knife wounds to his 
               neck and chest roper rushes over to him it doesnt look 
               good

               the woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first 
               flight of stairs frozen roper pulls out his gun and rushes 
               by her up the stairs

                                     roper

               tears start to come to clarences eyes

               clarence sincerely feels bad its kind of touching in a 
               twisted way korda moves over to the window to keep from 
               striking clarence again he looks off across the bay

                                     korda

               clarence watches korda warily things are beginning to add 
               up in his head

                                     clarence
                         did you kill him mike

               korda turns to clarence with a penetrated stare that answers 
               the question clarence is shaken by that he starts to whimper 
               again

                                     clarence
                         im sorry mike im really sorry

               korda moves to him and we think hes going to bash him around 
               again but surprisingly he hugs clarences head against 
               his chest

                                     korda

                         young sprout of a hostage negotiator 
                         under my tutelage

               a beat and then mccall realizes that this comment is a major 
               acknowledgement of acceptance from roper roper misses his 
               shot picks up his beer glass

                         is all the name calling necessary

               roper reenters the training area

                                     roper

                                     roper

                         negotiator youve got to learn to 
                         lie

                                     mccall

               roper gives him an amused smile

                         you know the ten commandments

                                     mccall

                                     roper

                                     mccall
                         thou shall have no other god before 
                         me

               thats not the answer roper wanted

                                     roper
                         okay forget that whats the main

                         right

                         save lives

               mccall cant argue with that one roper turns and heads back 
               to the side door

                                     roper

               mccall is surprised by the command but closes them roper 
               turns him away from the hostage scene

                                     roper

                         very good youve got good eyes 
                         thats important

               int conference room  day

               roper and mccall are sitting in the dark watching a video 
               tape its grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting 
               goods store a negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a 
               ten year old girl hostage the negotiator holds his hands 
               out imploringly carefully moves toward the gunman the 
               negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl the gunman 
               grabs the negotiator around the neck holds the gun to his 
               head the little girl runs out of the picture to safety

               roper remains dead silent during all this mccall looks over 
               at him the blue light flickers over ropers motionless face

                                     mccall
                         was that your partner

               roper nods

                                     mccall

                                     roper
                              quietly
                         because he knew the little girl had 
                         zero chance of survival and his 
                         chances would be a little better 
                         we had a plan but swat opened up 
                         too early he got caught in the 
                         crossfire
                              a sad beat

                         use the eyes to keep the connection 
                         it almost like hypnosis thats the 
                         most important thing create a 
                         connection youre always on their 
                         side

               mccall watches him for a beat then turns his attention back 
               on the screen

               ext golden gate racetrack  day

               roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye mccall seems 
               totally disinterested

                                     roper

               roper ignores that

                                     roper

                                     roper
                         i understand you completely

               korda disappears back behind the door

               roper trudges back in things are more active now logistical 
               officers are making flow charts photos of the hostages are 
               being posted on a bulletin board roper approaches solis 
               mccall and the swat captain who are anxiously waiting for 
               his report

                                     roper
                              flatly
                         were going to have to take this guy 
                         out

               that draws a long silence thats something roper rarely 
               says

                                     solis
                         cant we wear him down

               roper hands solis the handkerchief with the ear in it solis 
               eyes it with dismay

                                     roper
                         i believe theres at least one 
                         fatality in there already the fire 
                         alarm was probably set off by gunfire 
                         i believe hes working alone both 
                         from his conversation and the fact 
                         that he wouldnt come out beyond the 
                         doorway he was holding a gun on the 
                         hostages while he was talking to me 
                         his demeanor is calm and controlled 
                         thats what really scares me the 
                         other bad news is that he also 
                         indicated a familiarity with our 
                         techniques
                              a beat
                         so do you want to go in or wait for 
                         him to come out

               mccall calmly offers his opinion

                                     mccall
                         let him come out too many unknowns 
                         in there

               solis nods thatll be the plan

                                     mccall
                         when we drive up the car make sure 
                         its at an angle about three feet 
                         from the curb
                              to swat captain
                         put our best man highground twenty 
                         degree down angle

               the swat captain motions and turns to one of his underlings

                         have anderson prep it and notify us 
                         when hes on line

               the underling hurries off to take care of it solis looks at 
               roper dejectedly

                                     solis

               the jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is korda 
               his face is sweaty hair matted angle widens to show five 
               very scared hostages a jeweler middleaged balding the 
               male manager goodlooking thirties three piece suit two 
               salesgirls nicely dressed late twenties a female customer

               the wall there are two fatalities lying on the floor the 
               guard and one of the jewelers

               korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler 
               and motions to the dead bodies

                                     korda
                         drag them behind the counter

               the two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the 
               grim task the two salesgirls watch korda fearfully the 
               older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of 
               reality her eyes are a bit far away

               korda moves over to the remaining display cases that havent 
               been looted with the barrel of his gun he smashes the glass 
               reaches in and picks out the jewelry he dumps it in an open 
               satchel already halffilled with packets of raw gemstones 
               and gold chains suddenly the older woman customer gets to 
               her feet she seems fairly outofit maybe in shock she 
               starts walking toward the front door frowning with 
               dissatisfaction

                                     woman customer

               korda rushes around the display case

                                     korda
                         come here hag

               he grabs a handful of the womans coiffed gray hair and drags 
               her away from the door she shrieks the manager takes a 
               step toward korda

                                     manager
                         leave her alone

               korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her 
               unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager

                                     korda
                         youre a brave one arent you

               the manager glares at him hes about kordas size he thinks 
               about making a run at him

                                     salesgirl 2
                              pleading
                         sit down doug

               a long beat the manager sits back down on the floor with 
               the other hostages salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old 
               woman korda looks down at her

                                     korda

               korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of 
               the gems

               the cable car

               grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line roper 
               grabs mccalls gun off the seat and leaps out of the caddy 
               to pursue korda people approach to ogle the two vehicles in 
               astonishment

               int garage  day

               roper moves up an interior stairway gun in ready position 
               he knows korda is somewhere in the parking structure he 
               glides up the stairway to the third level checks back over 
               the rail no one around then a sound from inside the 
               garage footsteps maybe

               roper carefully opens the door swings in with his gun

               int third level  garage

               lots of cars but no one in sight roper moves quickly to 
               the protection of a row of cars he crouches down scans 
               beneath the cars no sign of korda

               roper searches between two rows comes up beside a van 
               thinks he hears something stirring inside whirls a gun toward 
               the window

               a dog lunges at the camera snarling baring teeth 
               roper moves on

               new angle

               as a bmw crawls through the parking structure roper steps 
               into the foreground right into its path gun visible the 
               bmw rolls to a stop roper approaches with caution

               roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 
               year old blonde roper takes a check out of the backseat

                                     roper
                         sorry go

               inside the car

               the woman rolls up the window and hits the gas she drives 
               off

               int garage

               roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final 
               scan he has the discouraging feeling that korda might 
               have escaped

               he heads toward the exit suddenly a screech of tires 
               roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him he drives 
               and fires bullets shatter the windshield

               the car continues toward roper he has to roll out of the 
               path of the car the car swerves past roper tries to make 
               it down the ramp roper fires again taking out the rear 
               window and a rear tire the car slides along the guard rail 
               and continues down to the next level roper runs after it

               garage  2nd level

               as the car reaches the next level korda loses control and 
               piles into a parked car

               korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel 
               of jewels dazed he staggers away from the wreck

               roper moves to him with a face grim as death he strips the 
               satchel from kordas hand and slams him against the open car 
               door korda goes to his knees roper holds the barrel of his 
               gun right up between kordas eyes

                                     roper
                         give me one reason why i shouldnt 
                         kill you right here

               korda stares back at roper defiantly he knows a cop wont 
               kill him in cold blood

               what he doesnt know is that roper doesnt give a shit about 
               those rules at this moment

                                     roper
                         you know sam baffert was a friend of 
                         mine he had a wife and he had a 
                         daughter

               korda stares past the barrel of the gun

                                     korda
                         i dont give a shit about you or 
                         your fucking friends

               and that makes roper even angrier but he keeps it all 
               inside his expression is as cold as a san francisco night

               he yanks back hard on kordas hair pushes the gun tighter 
               against kordas forehead hes on the verge of executing 
               this guy

                                     korda
                         you cant kill me like this

                                     roper
                         what if you and me got into a 
                         struggle and my gun went off

               in a flash roper points the gun upward and fires off a shot

                                     roper
                         could i kill you then
                              beat beat
                         could i kill you then

               roper jams the gun back under kordas chin a pull of the 
               trigger would send a bullet straight up through kordas skull 
               and now korda is fully convinced he squeezes his eyes closed 
               face straining so hard he looks like hes going to burst 
               out of his skin

               moving across garage into position

               long long beat roper eases up and korda smiles just when 
               we feel the scene is over roper turns back quickly and kicks 
               korda in the stomach then grabs korda by the hair pulls 
               his head back and shoves the gun in his face

                                     roper
                         we do this shit by the book but you 
                         aint gonna be smiling

               away as mccall moves in to put the cuffs on korda

                         yourself

               mccall squeezes his eyes closed he can still see that vet 
               falling to his death roper can see mccalls pain

                                     roper
                         ive lost three one of them was my 
                         partner i think about them every 
                         time i go into a situation

                         theres a million people in this 
                         city with all kinds of twisted shit 
                         going on in their heads and the 
                         bitch of this job is that we expect 
                         to go out every day and do the 
                         impossible  to somehow control all 
                         this craziness and we cant

                         nobodys faulting you for this 
                         mccall my advice is you let yourself 
                         off the hook

               mccall hears him but is still undecided

                                     mccall

               shoulder

               as the cart rolls into the room tilt up to see

               korda

               pushing the cart he stops a guard guard 3 stands with 
               his back to korda hes on the phone

                                     korda

                         down here by five its not my problem

               as the guard continues korda hangs several garment bags 
               zipped and tagged onto an electric trolley  similar to 
               the kind used by drycleaners to move clothing

                                     korda

               on the door sliding shut

               on the guards back  close

               bags moving on the trolley boom down to find kordas feet 
               just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the 
               bags

               angle on korda

               hanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then 
               down through an opening in the floor and into

               as it loops around a large room carrying him toward the 
               back wall the metal ridges of the trolley cut into his 
               fingers drawing blood then he drops down and quietly 
               rummages through other bags of clothing he tries on a pair 
               of pants but they come up to his ankles he looks like hes 
               about to go wading as he rips them off and reaches for 
               another pair

                                                                    cut to

               korda appears around a corner dressed in street clothes 
               holding a clipboard  moving steadily toward camera

               kordas pov  down the hallway

               a female civilian employee heading in his direction as they 
               pass he nods and she nods back then korda passes through a

               the door closes behind him and locks with the loud snap of 
               metal

               slowly with deliberate steps he moves down the corridor 
               toward the door at the other end past the first guard guard 
               3  enclosed in bullet proof glass

               tracking  kordas feet

               step by step the voices of prisoners muffled behind thick 
               glass

               close on kordas face

               trying to stay cool his heart pounding then

                                     a voice os
                         hey

               korda freezes then slowly turns to find a prison guard 
               1 moving toward him

               the guard pov  moving closer and closer to korda

                                     korda
                         yeah

               the guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand

                                     jail guard 1
                         you dropped your card

               korda takes the card given to him by the bail bondsman

               roper sprints towards the building racing alongside it 
               catching a glimpse of korda just as he disappears around the

               area and ropers pickup a moment later roper emerges from 
               the machine shop just in time to see korda round the corner 
               of the next building

               the truck pulling out just as roper runs into view

               with the truck accelerating towards him he raises and fires

               leaps sliding forward on the hood almost falling as he 
               grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper 
               blades for support his weapon flying from his hand

               korda

               speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways whipping 
               from side to side trying to shake roper off roper hanging 
               on for dear life

                                     roper

                              continuing

                         worth of glass

               korda reaches in grabbing a handful of the costume jewelry 
               he cant believe it its all fake

                                     korda
                         you fuck

               korda goes crazy slamming the truck into the side of a 
               building trying to throw roper but roper hangs on

               korda then caroms off the sides of buildings left right 
               sparks flying then smashes into boxes crates anything he 
               can see stacked alongside the road way but roper stays put 
               clinging on with all hes got swinging from side to side to 
               avoid the obstacles

               then korda sees ahead a huge pile of boxes wood framing 
               pallets trash stacked at the side of a building he hammers 
               the pedal driving the right side of the truck into the 
               pile boxes wood paper debris flying everywhere through 
               the open fron window as well korda shielding his eyes with 
               his arm as objects fly around in a mad flurry inside the 
               cab

               roper

               in the maelstrom lets go his grip grabbing the upper frame 
               of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck rolls 
               over the top of the cab landing in the bed of the truck 
               along with boxes lumber and trash

               korda

               clears his eyes looking up roper is gone he laughs 
               hysterically he knocked him off

               roper in the bed of the truck

               leaning out the passengers side sees they are approaching 
               the dry dock area

               in the bed of the truck along with the boxes suitcases and 
               other objects he sees several long 2x4s grabbing a board 
               he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift 
               movement stands swinging to the drivers side driving the 
               2x4 through the side window through the steering wheel 
               past the dash and catching the tip of the accelerator pedal 
               pinning it to the floor

               as roper releases the board it wedges inside the door frame 
               locking the wheel and the accelerator the engine screaming 
               wide open korda reacts in panic

               roper clings to the cab looking over the top the dry dock 
               looming towards them he prepares to jump

               korda

               suddenly sees the approaching dry dock he jams on the brakes 
               but its not enough the truck racing towards the edge

               in slow motion the truck

               vaults over the edge of the dry dock as roper runs down the 
               bed leaping off the tail gate arms windmilling as he goes 
               airborne

               the truck plummets towards the bottom

               roper

               lands in a huge pile of cargo nets and cardboard boxes piled 
               near the edge of the dry dock

               korda

               screams in wideeyed terror as

               the truck

               hits the bottom of the dock exploding into flames

                                                               dissolve to
