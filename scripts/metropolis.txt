fade in

ext  manhattan  middle of the night

freezing wind shutters through the shadows  relentless
darkness  no sign of life save for 

the sound of determined footsteps


int  high rise apartment building  lobby  continuous

the doorman at his post flipping through a magazine rap
music pounding from his radio

glass suddenly shatters as a gloved hand punches through
the window reaching in unlocking the front door

two men in dark suits blur inside  the doorman rushes to
stop them only 

dex the taller of the two men slams the barrel of his
gun into the doormans throat

                         dex
          life can be an illusion
                  low and deadly
          sometimes we see what isnt there
          and sometimes we dont see what is
          there

the doorman wide eyed with terror nods his consent
dex removes the gun

doorman plants himself in the chair eyes glued to his
magazine making it clear he doesnt see the men as they
stroll into 


int  elevator  continuous

old fashioned steel box struggling its way up the shaft
fluorescent yellow light stabbing through the grating


int  hallway  moment later

dex slaps a small plastic strip on an apartment door as
both men turn away shielding their eyes

a blinding flash of light as the door is blown apart


int  apartment  continuous

the men rush inside and straight into 


int  bedroom

candles flicker on the dresser  a syringe on the bedside
table next to a sleeping figure curled up under the
sheets

both men starting to pull guns but 

                         dex
          this ones personal

dexs partner shrugs holsters his weapon and steps back
through the doorway watching as 

dex spins and fires

not the traditional booming gunfire but rather the
strange sound of electronic hissing as laserfire rips the
person to shreds

dex finally stops firing and moves to the bed to verify
the kill only on close inspection he sees its not a
person

hes just blown the hell out of a mannequin

dex smiles blows out the candle and heads out of the
room

                                            cut to

int  church  dusk

a lone priest lights the sacrament candles the sound of
his breathing reverberating through the empty church

he suddenly stops snaps his head around 

a man in a wheelchair stares at him from the doorway

the man is christoph  dark robes shroud his shriveled
decaying body but his eyes still burn with life

                         christoph
                  raspy voice which
                   labors to be heard
          may i trouble you with a confession

even in the flickering halflight of the candles the
priest can see that christoph is dying

                         priest
          never a trouble

the large statue of jesus over the alter staring down as
the priest leads christoph into 


int  confessional booth

christophs voice is weak knowing each word could be the
last

                         christoph
          forgive me father for i have
          coveted

                         priest
          what have you coveted

                         christoph
                  anguished whisper
          life

a small smile of compassion escapes across the priests
lips

                         priest
          god gave us all the need for life
          and when the end begins to near we
          all crave more time  no sin

                         christoph
                  hesitantly
          but theres what i would do for more
          time

                         priest
          what would you do 

a sharp hissing sound 

the laser burns through the confessional wall and straight
through the priests chest

face frozen in a listening pose as the body crumples to
death

christoph slowly lowers his weapon with a look of genuine
contrition


ext  manhattan  hells kitchen  continuous

its the near future and the neighborhood is covered with
graffiti scrawled in machine code and billboards
projecting holographs advertising malt liquor and
pleasuredipped cigarettes

a slickblack jet copter drops silently from the sky


int  warehouse  continuous

pieces of advanced computer technology lie scattered about
the large work table  a small kitchen and bedroom in the
back

speakers pour in one of handels aching melodies

the music suddenly pierced by the shriek of a giant bird
of prey diving across the room


ext  street  continuous

a tight knot of bodyguards disgorge from the copter
tense eyes sweeping the street they finally give the all
clear signal

halden a charismatic bull of a man emerges from the
copter  he moves with the confidence of someone who knows
he cant be touched


int  warehouse  continuous

the sound of handels concert mixes with the sound of
claws tearing apart flesh

tanner sits in the middle of the room  he is early
forties athletic build and a face that holds too many
memories

his insomniacstained eyes studying the holographic chess
board as the knight mounted on the bird of prey slaughters
a pawn

                         disembodied voice os
          visitors

tanner snaps his attention to 


int  wall size monitor

halden and his men head toward the warehouse


int  warehouse

tanners eyes harden at the sight of halden  a long beat
then he finally shakes his head in resigned disgust

                         tanner
          permit entry

the sound of dead bolts automatically sliding open

moments later

the bodyguards stand motionless in the corner doing their
best to look like furniture

halden moves through the holographic chess board his eyes
on tanner

                         halden
          a legend fell tonight

his stare now ripping into tanner

                         halden
          the unrunnable maze  impossible to
          get through
                  thick smile
          well some kid just danced it like
          it was some six bit video game

tanner doesnt blink  his voice matteroffact

                         tanner
          he had keys

                         halden
          of course the legend would like to
          think that  but no one has keys
                  fierce
          your maze was run


ext  warehouse  moment later

halden and his men escort tanner to the waiting copter

                                            cut to

int  vacant city street  that night

christoph stands naked in the middle of the vacant street
staring down at himself in reverent awe

it is as if hes been reborn  his body no longer
decrepit but rather pulsing with an almost inhuman
vitality

he heads down the street the walk becoming a run then a
sprint his head back mouth open tasting the wind

                                            cut to

ext  manhattan skyline  continuous

a jetcopter screams across the night sky while inside 


int  jetcopter  continuous

tanner studies the holographic image of the maze projected
in front of him

a constantly shifting sea of lines swirling furiously in
random directions

a small blue square rockets into the maze  sound of
laughter as the square dodges feints spinning its way
down into 

the center of the maze  a pattern so intricate it seems
to be a solid wall of light with no way through 

only the square suddenly shoots up twisting somehow
finding the smallest of fissures and blurring through

the square is gone  only the laughter remains

                         halden
          he had fun ripping your maze thats
          good
                  tight smile
          now that its obsolete for security
          purposes maybe we can turn it into
          an amusement ride

tanner silently snaps off the hologram as the jetcopter
banks sharply for a landing onto 

                                            cut to

a towering black monolith which seems to burst straight up
through the heavens


int  vsi corporate buildings  continuous

halden leads tanner down the long hall

dex who has traded his dark assassins suit for a vsi
standard issue gray pinstripe stands waiting for them

he keeps his eyes on halden as if tanner wasnt even
there

                         dex
          we just tracked the runner to the
          hotel district

halden nods as all three of them head into 


int  control room

long rows of programming consoles manned by engineers
wearing wireless telecom headsets

dex directs haldens attention to one of the highdef
monitors lining the walls  the monitor showing 


int  savoy hotel room

rock music pounds the room as silver confetti drops from
the ceiling

a kid sixteen at most watches excitedly from the bed as
the two playmates barbiedoll bodies slowdance a
striptease


int  control room

dex finally acknowledges tanners presence

                         dex
          still going through puberty and he
          shreds your maze
                  hard
          thats gotta hurt

tanner remains silent  eyes locked on the monitor as
halden turns to emma vsis senior security engineer

                         halden
          get some internal police there
          tell them to run a perimeter

                         tanner
          but have them wait for me till they
          move in on him

halden turns shooting him a surprised look  but tanner
ignores it as he heads for the door

dex goes to stop him but something in tanners eyes makes
him think twice about it

a frozen beat then halden snaps a silent command to dex
to let tanner go

int  interface room  moments later

rows and rows of unconscious bodies strapped to interface
seats the room looks like a warehouse full of people in
comas

tanner climbs into an interface seat as a technician
wheels up his medicart and starts preparing an iv

                         tanner
          shouldnt be in that long

the technician shrugs returns the iv to his cart and
starts hooking tanner to a biomonitor

dex strides into the room staring down at tanner

                         dex
          been a while since youve been
          inside
                  off tanners
                   silence
          going to look up old friends

tanner meets dexs stare  a deadly exchange

                         dex
                  grins
          you know she asks about you all the
          time 

tanner plunges his finger into the connect box his eyes
thrusting back in his head body going slack

intensity


ext  the savoy

a group of internal cops wearing telecoms and night city
police uniforms stand huddled in the shadows across from
the savoy

the sergeant greets tanner with a curt nod

down his chest pulling at his belt as

a cop tries to grab him only the kid grabs a chair and
smashes it hard into the cops face dropping him hard to
the floor

twitching as the pain sears through his consciousness 


int  night city  hotel room  continuous

he looks around groggily at the sea of motionless people
plugged into the system  place feels like a morgue

a technician wheels up his medicart

                         emma
          all the infrastructure gets dumped
          then everyones ripped out into the
          net

tanner nods then turns his attention to the technician

                         tanner
          adrenaline  140 ccs

                         medical technician
                  filling the syringe
          man likes his juice

                         tanner
          and once im through bring me down
          fast with dexaline

                         medical technician
                  under his breath
          if you get through

emma shoots him a hard look  technician shrugs calls it
as he sees it

tanner rolls up his sleeve as he climbs into the interface
seat

                         tanner
          lets do it 

the technician sticks the needle into tanners arm

only a beat before the adrenaline hits tanners system
his body shaking eyes rolling back in his head

the technician eyes the biomonitor waiting until tanner
is peaking before plunging tanners finger into the
connectbox


int  the net  blackness

slice of color racing toward us  hyperfast

tanner hurtling toward it  explosion of light  blinding
intensity

tanner rips through the maze navigating at dizzying speed
through the interlocking patterns

dodging and twisting through the blur of obstacles

under it all a sound  almost a voice  female  too
feint to hear  calling out tanner

dropping down  into the mazes heart  lines slamming at
him  no way to beat it only hes 

spinning between the lines  always changing  too fast to
see  making it down into 

the center of the maze

an intricate pattern so dense it looks like a solid
impenetrable wall of light 

the wall collapsing in on tanner  no escape 

he rockets straight into it  inevitable death 

only he screams straight up twisting spinning hurtling
through the tinniest of fractures and out the other side
into 

nothingness  empty blackness

then the muffled sound of breathing  dull thud of a
heartbeat followed by music  louder and louder  a hard
driving samba

a thick mist covering fluttering images

there are people here  too many of them  screaming  a
hideous sound


int  night city  marde gras square

tanner materializing in the midst of the pulsing street
party

ornate costumes  vivid colors  crush of celebrants
gyrating to the music

the access card materializes on the ground next to him

tanner picks up the card his eyes blinking fighting for
clarity

but the adrenaline pounding his vision  everything
distorted  grotesque

a face cuts through the chaos  angelic beauty  katie 

tanner stares at her  she sees him face breaking into a
smile

int  night city  penthouse  living room  continuous

gena wearing the black dress stumbles out of the bedroom
and around the living room in growing confusion

christoph sits on the couch calmly watching her

she finally turns to him

          its all here

                         christoph
                  proud
          yes

she shakes her head stunned

          but its everything  everything
          ive seen  everything ive
          wanted
                  barely audible
          only i know about all of this 

her eyes suddenly frozen at the photos on the mantle

theyre her photos  baby picture  high school
graduation  wedding photo

she is beginning to tremble

the doorbell rings

several digital waiters and waitresses head out of the
kitchen carrying silver trays of hor doeuvres and
champagne

christoph stands kissing gena on the cheek

                         christoph
          the guests are here

                         gena

          guests

                         christoph
          just like you always wanted

a digital jazz band materializes in the corner

                         christoph
          get out of south dakota and move to
          new york where you can throw
          cocktail parties in your park avenue
          apartment

shes trying to process all of this but its too
overwhelming  the only words she can manage are 

                         gena
          but this is impossible

                         christoph
          thats the grace of this world
                  smiles
          nothings impossible

the doorbell rings again  he motions to her bare feet

                         christoph
          better get some shoes on

he turns to answer the door

                  amazed
          he made it  sonofabitch actually
          ran it

emmas eyes involuntarily flick down to her watch

                         emma
          just under five hours left before it
          crashes

haldens face is impassive revealing nothing

int  night city  marde gras square  continuous

tanner is still fighting his way to katie  shes
laughing urging him on

the dexaline starting to clear his consciousness

hes finally able to focus  the street  buildings  and
katie  only its not katie

just someone that looks a little like her  the woman
laughing with her companion

tanner stands frozen in the middle of the street  he
looks out of place  haunted eyes in the midst of wild
celebration

he quickly turns and heads out of the square

                                            cut to

int  the terrace  hallway

about a dozen welldressed guests stand waiting outside
they all hold invitations

the door opens and christoph greets them with a warm
smile

                         christoph
          please come on in

as they head into the apartment the elevator arrives in
the hall bringing more people

christoph ushers in this new group then slips into the
elevator


int  apartment  continuous

gena still stands barefooted in the middle of the room

the band starts up pouring sultry jazz throughout the
room

more and more people are filtering inside  gena stands
there rigid a sense of growing panic in her eyes

she can feel people beginning to stare at her

someone pops open a champagne bottle  sound of laughter

more guests arrive  a man in the corner smiles at her
beckoning her over

she backs away from him moving unsteadily through the
party and out the door

                                            cut to

ext  the terrace  roof top garden  continuous

gena remains asleep on the brass bed

the sound of distant jazz music fills the air waking her
up

as her eyes open she sees christoph heading silently
toward her  he motions for her to close her eyes

                         christoph
          its okay go back to sleep

but something about his voice sets her on edge

                         gena
          whats happening

                         christoph
                  soothing
          nothing go back to sleep

but she sees the glint of steel in his hand  the laser he
has hidden down by his side

she bolts upright 

                         gena
          what the hells going on

he looks uncomfortable this isnt a confrontation he was
expecting  finally

                         christoph
          its time to wake up

                         gena
          wake up

                         christoph
          from the dream

she doesnt know what the hell hes talking about and she
doesnt want to know  she flies off the bed only 

he moves with blurring speed grabbing her throwing her
back onto the bed  shes pleading now

                         gena
          dont fucking do this  ive got a
          son  im all hes got  so dont
          you dare fucking do this 

hissing of a laser

burns a hole right between her eyes

a blood trickle smearing the mattress

christophs face is a study in anguish

the jazz music still bathing the roof  he whips around

gena stands across the roof staring at him  the digitized
gena the one who is barefooted and wearing the black
dress

she is shaking her face white as a ghost

                         christoph
          its okay

                         digital gena
                  barely audible
          okay

                         christoph
                  reassuring
          its all been transferred

she doesnt understand  he moves to her his voice
impassioned

                         christoph
          genetic codes  consciousness
          unconsciousness  every single
          dream  every kiss real or
          imagined  the shadows of her soul
          its all in you

she stares at him her voice trembling

                         digital gena
          why

                         christoph
          to live forever

his face burns with compassion as he explains

                         christoph
          people pluginto this world but
          remain linked to their flesh and
          blood body  such an encumbrance
                  beat
          even if their bodies are kept on
          machines nourished by ivs the
          laws of nature eventually will be
          respected  the body grows old and
          dies  then theyre gone from both
          worlds

somewhere deep inside she is beginning to understand
but it brings her no comfort

christoph heads for the elevator motioning for her to
follow  but she doesnt

                         digital gena
          she said i have a son

                         christoph
          no she said she had a son
                  quiet
          in a dream she once called life

she stares at him

                         digital gena
          how come i cant remember

                         christoph
          because i took it out of your
          memory

                         digital gena
                  beat
          why 

                         christoph
                  spins on her
           because therell be no remorse
          not in my world

a private darkness in his eyes as he turns and disappears
into the elevator leaving her alone on the roof

the sound of partying echoing through the night

                                            cut to

ext  night city  street

tanner moves down the crowded street passing 


ext  the gates

a growing mob of angry people bottlenecked out front

                         hostess
          the gates are temporarily closed for
          routine maintenance  but they will
          reopen soon 

                         older man
           been saying that for an hour
          now

                         hostess
          it wont be much longer

          but i need to get back now  ive
          got to pick my kids up from school

the hostess keeps smiling its all shes programmed to
do

                         hostess
          to help make the short wait more
          enjoyable drinks are on the house
          across the street at dantes tavern

but there are no takers  everyone keeping their place in
line as these people need to get home

tanner cuts through the crowd his eyes burning with
determination

                                            cut to

ext  night city  tivoli park

tanner moves pass the carnival and is about to turn the
corner but stops as he catches a glimpse of a familiar
building

the terrace is right across the street

the building is dark except for the flashing lights from
the top floor

tanner stares up at the lights


int  the terrace  lobby

the marbled lobby is like a museum  priceless paintings
and tapestries fill the walls

tanner heads through the lobby and into 


int  outdoor glass elevator

he pushes the button for the penthouse

the elevator glides effortlessly up the side of the
building

the colored lights of night city swirling through the
glass


int  the terrace  penthouse

tanner slowly steps inside  hes tensed not really
knowing what to expect

the party is in fullswing  someone offers tanner
champagne but he declines

he looks around the room his eyes stopping on the mantle

he picks up one of the photos of gena 

                         older woman
          you looking for her

tanner looks up at the woman

                         older woman
          she went up

                         tanner
          up

                         older woman
                  points
          to the roof


ext  the terrace  roof

tanner moves slowly across the roof the candles throwing
flickering images across his face

he stops at the brass bed  it is empty save for the blood
stain

                         genas voice os
          you work for them dont you

tanner spins  the digital gena sits in the corner  she
tries to force a smile

                         digital gena
          that would explain your little
          disappearing act in the bar

he takes a slow cautious step toward her

                         tanner
          what happened here 

                         digital gena
           he works for them too doesnt
          he

                         tanner
                  beat
          who

                         digital gena
          the sonofabitch who did this

she pierces her arm with a broach pin  she doesnt bleed

                         digital gena
                  quiet shame
          im not real am i

he stares at her doesnt know the answer to that one

she meets his stare terrified of the answer

                         digital gena
          and i cant go back can i

tanner wishes he could lie  but cant

                         tanner
          thats right

she absorbs this in steely silence  longest of beats

                         digital gena
          he failed

she stares at him trying to keep back the emotions

                         digital gena
          im making a sandwich  just like my
          mom would  its raining outside
          the sandwich isnt for me  its for
          him  and that makes me feel
          something
                  barely audible
          no words for it  but ill never
          forget

her eyes are wet  her voice coming out in a tortured
whisper

                         digital gena
          all the memories around him are
          still there

he watches her tormented by the fact that he cant find
anything comforting to say

she turns her eyes out into the night giving him silent
permission to leave


ext  the terrace  moments later

the elevator deposits tanner down on the street as the
tivolis fireworks show starts overhead

colored explosions raining down as tanner disappears into
the night


int  deadend alley  a little later

tanner heads into the alley  a holographic map of night
city shimmers in front of him

                         disembodied friendly voice os
          you are here
                  red x glows on the
                   map
          to reach the club district simply
          turn around and head 

tanner reaches through the holograph sliding his access
card into the slot on the wall

the map disappears as the wall opens


int  darkness

tanners voice calls out

                         tanners voice os
          lights

the lights flicker on as tanner races down the tunnel
sprinting around the bend and into 


int  digital employee storage center

the long rows of storage racks are empty the reserve
employees no longer there

tanner stares uneasily at the barren racks as he makes his
way through the room and down the stairs into 


int  hallway

tanner slides his access card into the door  it opens for
him revealing 


int  nexus center

the place is buzzing with activity

dex supervises an army of digital employees as they move
across the catwalks rewiring the program panels with
cables

tanner silently slips into the room and up the 


int  stairs

tanner makes his way up around the corner suddenly coming
face to face with a waiter 

only unlike the usual polite cheerfulness programmed into
night citys waiters this guy has been given a hard
glaring face

the waiter pulls his laser 

tanner hurls himself forward knocking both of them to the
floor

its tanner who manages to come up with the gun

the waiter squeezing tanners throat with savage force as
tanner fires again and again

the waiter twitching then falling motionless  his body
sliced with holes but not bleeding

tanner pockets the gun and heads up the stairs 


int  catwalk

the catwalk is crawling with digital employees all of
them armed


int  stairs

tanner takes a deep breath then walks right out onto 


int  catwalk

tanner walks briskly eyes down on the steel grating
assuming the attitude of someone who belongs there

he opens a program panel typing commands into the
keyboard

                         synthetic voice from program
          food and service program subsix
          access codes required

tanner pulls out his access card and slides it into the
panel

a clicking sound as data glitters across the screen

tanner steals a quick look around

dex is heading out onto the catwalk  he has his back
turned to tanner and hasnt seen him yet

tanner spins back to the program data still whipping
across the screen  tanner silently urges it on faster
and faster

and finally it buzzes 

                         synthetic voice
          access granted
                  beat

                         tanner
           waiter

dex is now turning in tanners direction

                         synthetic voice
          standard modern upscale 

                         tanner
           standard

                         synthetic voice
          scanning body type

tanner turns to the wall trying to keep his face hidden
as dex approaches

long frozen beat

dex is almost right on top of him 

the program buzzes 

tanner is now wearing a waiters uniform

dexs hand slams down on the back of tanners shoulder 

tanner tenses hand reaching for his laser only 

dex twists tanners head so its looking up at the open
program panel

                         dex
          keep this one shut were not wiring
          it

tanner nods keeping his back turned to him

dex moves on continuing with his inspection  tanner
pulls the access card from the program and heads back to
the 


int  stairs

tanner still in a waiters uniform heads up to the 


int  fifth floor catwalk

he moves to another program panel and opens it typing
into the keyboard

                         synthetic voice
          core program  access codes
          required

tanner starts to slide in the access card but freezes

still heartbeat  tanner whirls to the side

christoph is a hairs breath away  perfectly still  calm
smile of someone whos been standing there a while

                         christoph
          an honor  the legend visits

tanners hand dives for his laser

                         christoph
          mistake 

tanner is fast  but christophs a blur  beyond human
speed

snaps the laser from tanners hand and flings it
harmlessly down the catwalk

christoph turns regarding tanner with genuine respect

                         christoph
          maker of the perfect maze
          impossible to run  so many try
          none succeed  yet youre here
                  impressed
          you succeeded

tanner stares at him trying to understand

                         tanner
          the patterns were moved around but
          they werent changed

                         christoph
          true  but why

he lets the question hang there then takes a step toward
tanner

                         christoph
          halden sent men to kill me in my
          sleep but simple illusions won out
                  beat
          so he now sends the legend to finish
          the deed

                         tanner
          no

                         christoph
          then what

tanner is silent  christophs eyes burn into him

                         christoph
          eject the system

christoph steps even closer  tanner can feel his breath

                         christoph
          but what would happen to me  i have
          no body to return to

                         tanner
          not my problem

                         christoph
          so wrong 

he moves so fast impossible for tanner to react

picks up tanner and hurls him down the catwalk

tanner crashes hard into the steel grating  searing pain
as he fights for a breath

he sees his laser not that far away

tanner lunges one fluid motion grabs the laser spins
and fires 

only christoph is no longer there

tanners shot burning through a wall

christoph is now on the other side of tanner  foot
blurring down pinning tanners gun hand to the ground

                         christoph
          i will not die  not again
                  intense
          one of the perks of divinity

tanner stares at him

                         tanner
          divinity

                         christoph
          yes

                         tanner
          you are not a god

                         christoph
          in here i am

no bravado in how he says it  merely a statement of fact

                         christoph
          god creates man man creates
          technology technology creates god
                  beat
          end into beginning

                         tanner
          in a computer program

                         christoph
          the new world

                         tanner
          its not real

                         christoph
          not real

his foot suddenly smashing into tanners gut

                         christoph
          the pain is real

rips a steel pole from the railing and slams it into
tanner

                         christoph
          deliciously real

he pulls tanner to his feet

                         christoph
          and if i kill you

dangles tanner over the railing  hell of a drop

                         christoph
          your body could live up there  but
          on a machine  no mind  no dreams
                  hisses
          so tell me this isnt real

silence  pain spasms through tanner

                         womans voice os
          enough

a frozen beat  then christoph pulls tanner back up to the
catwalk

katie is there

tanner stares at her  she starts to say something but
christoph stops her cold with a look then turns to
tanner

                         christoph
          such a kind man your employer
                  beat
          allowing you to fall in love with a
          program

katie can no longer look at tanner her eyes down on the
grating

                         christoph
          but she wasnt a designed program
          not this angel
                  reverently
          we digitized her from flesh and
          blood

his eyes flick from katie to tanner

                         christoph
          i was going to tell you but halden
          wouldnt allow it  his nature
          demands no lose ends
                  quietly
          so the flesh and blood katie was
          killed

tanners face is a mask revealing nothing  christoph
locks eyes with him

                         christoph
          yet she lives on in here mind body
          and soul

his stare now ripping into tanner 

                         christoph
          so you of all people should know
          this world is just as real if not
          more than the nightmare you call
          the real world
                  disgust
          people praying to gods who dont
          listen  violence and decay  no
          rhyme or reason  to be young and
          told you are dying  nothing can be
          done  promise of life gone  that
          will never happen here

tanner meets his stare

                         tanner
          you were the one who was dying

                         christoph
                  a whisper
          yes

tanners eyes burn with rage

                         tanner
          you sealed off the system  when it
          crashes everyone dies with you

                         christoph
          yes but only in the dream they call
          life

                         tanner
          dream

                         christoph
          and all dreams no matter how
          appealing must eventually end

tanner stares at him as if looking at insanity

christoph smiles eerie calm as he turns to close the open
program panel

tanner dives with savage speed grabbing the laser from
the ground

the nexus center erupts with the sound of people pulling
guns 
                         katie
          tanner 

hundreds of lasers being trained on tanner 

tanner grabs christoph using him as a shield the laser
jammed into christophs back

only christoph fades away  just like that

tanner standing exposed on the catwalk

the sound of lasers firing

tanner racing for cover


int  ground floor

christoph materializes next to dex watching up above
as 


int  fifth floor catwalk

lasers carve the air around tanner

hissing and popping as chunks of metal disintegrate

tanner dives across the catwalk throwing himself down
into the relative safety of 


int  stairwell

tanner pulls his laser as he races down the stairs


int  ground floor

christoph grabs dexs gun and calmly fires into a program
panel

the panel sparks circuitry destroyed causing 


int  stairwell

the stairs to flicker then disappear  tanner falling
through empty space 


int  ground floor

tanner crashes hard to the ground with an explosion of
pain

he comes up limping as laser fire slams all around him he
hurls himself through the door and out into 


int  hallway

he tries to run but his leg buckles sending him sprawling
to the floor  he picks himself up clawing his way up the
stairs 


int  hallway

tanner is forcing himself to limprun down the hallway
pushing himself as fast as he can

behind him he can hear the footsteps of dex and the men
quickly gaining on him

                                            cut to

int  the terrace  roof  continuous

the party has migrated to the roof

the digital gena stands silently in the corner staring
out at the people  they all seem so happy

she grabs a glass of wine from a passing waiter

she moves out into the center of the roof drinking the
wine and swaying to the jazz music

several of the single men trying to establish eye contact
with her

she begins to smile  its the kind of smile that could
turn to tears at any moment

a dreamy look on her face as she walks across the party
and straight off the roof

falling through the night


ext  night city  sidewalk

her bloodless body laying twisted on the ground

the soft breeze tugging at her coat opening it enough to
see the photo nestled against her chest

its a photo of gena as a small child  the saddest of
smiles

                                            cut to

ext  deadend alley

tanner heads out through the alley and into the 


ext  street

his eyes searching for a place to hide  sees the dance
club across the street

tanner limps for the club as dex and his men come
screaming out of the alley in hot pursuit


int  hades dance club

strobe lights slash the darkness

swirling sea of people

loud angry music

hard to make out faces in the flashes of illumination

tanner tries to lose himself in the anonymity of the
crowd

christoph has joined dex and the men as they slice through
the club eyes darting back and forth

tanner angles for the rear exit

a slamdancer crashes into him sending him sprawling to
the floor

christoph cutting across the club toward tanner

tanner tries to stand but cant his leg no longer able to
hold his weight

he sees christoph heading toward him

tanner trying to scramble out of the way

christophs eyes are scanning the faces around him and it
appears he doesnt see tanner down on the floor

the song ends people stop dancing

tanner finds a table and holes up under it 


int  under the table

tanner allows himself a deep breath

a sudden explosion of sound

tanner spins laser pointed

but its just the next song starting  tanner exhales

the table is no longer there

christoph has ripped it off the ground and flung it out
onto the dance floor

tanner swings the laser around

                         christoph
                  shakes his head
          haldens little killer who 

tanner fires

the shot slams through christophs face but does
absolutely no damage

                         christoph
          cant kill a god

tanner fires again  and again

the shots hit christoph but dont hurt him

christoph reaches down pulling tanner to his feet

dex and the rest of the men crowd around guns drawn

christoph kisses tanner on the check then steps away

tanner looking for a place to run to but hes surrounded

dex and the men firing 

music drowning out all sound

strobe lights carving quick bursts of images

laser fire slamming through tanner 

hit from all sides  again and again 

his eyes straining to hold on to life

muzzle flashes  more shots  tanners body twisting

music screaming down from the heavens

lasers ripping through his body

eyes finally going blank as he crumples to the floor

christoph motions to dex

                         christoph
          his access card

dex bends down for it but suddenly freezes 

theres no blood

not one single drop

dex whips his eyes up to christoph in stunned
realization 

                         dex
          sonofabitch digitized himself

but christophs no longer there 

                                            cut to

int  night city  nexus center  continuous

the real tanner stands on the catwalk plugging his access
card into the core program panel

data swirls across the screen  several long beats

                         disembodied voice from program
          access approved

tanner begins punching in the eject command

codes streaking down the screen

he suddenly stops grabs his laser and whirls

a person in the shadows

tanner is about to shoot when the person steps forward

its katie  standing very still  watching him

his gun aimed at her

                         katie
          you have to do this

he slowly lowers the weapon

                         katie
          someone you have to get back to

                         tanner
          no

she nods her eyes aching  she steps toward him
struggling for the words

                         katie
          i asked christoph to take it out of
          my memory

data smearing down the program screen reflected off her
face

                         katie
          but he wouldnt

her voice is suddenly very small and vulnerable

                         katie
          so every single time i close my eyes
          its there  all of it

searching his face  afraid of the answer

                         katie
          you

long beat  the words crawling from his throat

                         tanner
          i remember

she slowly reaches out  touching his face  so familiar

                         katie
          isnt it better than whatever you
          have waiting for you up there

he doesnt answer his body suddenly shaking  a tortured
silence

her lips reaching for his

christoph materializing on the catwalk 

rushing for tanner  speed of a demon 

tanner no longer thinking merely reacting spinning and
slamming in the last of the eject command 

                         christoph
          no 

but its too late

the godawful noise quickly getting louder and louder

the sound of the end

the walls disappearing

katies eyes locked on tanner trying hard to be brave
but it finds a way out of her mouth

                         katie
          what happens to me 

he wishes he knew


ext  night city  streets

the moon and stars fade away

then the buildings  only the people left

the light screaming for them  everyone it touches
blasted into emptiness

there is no escape from the light it finds everybody


int  nexus center  continuous

the light explodes through

it touches christoph first ripping him into darkness

then katie

then tanner 


int  the net  darkness

for a still heartbeat katies face is visible 

before it smears into the silent blackness of the net
as 

tanner is hurled into the darkness spinning toward the
blink of cold colors

                                            cut to

ext  manhattan  gloomy afternoon

the rain hasnt let up  blanketing the city in wet
darkness


int  interface room  continuous

tanners eyes fighting open

the room is full of shadows  very eerie

the sound of rain slamming against windows

tanner forces himself to sit

the shadows come into focus

they are empty interface chairs  tanner is alone  he
reaches down ejecting the minidisk from the chair


ext  hallway  moments later

tanner uses the wall for balance as he pushes himself down
the hallway


int  elevator  moments later

he hits the button for the top floor  his eyes starting
to clear as the rage burns through the fog


int  haldens office  continuous

the room is dark

halden is behind his desk staring out the window at the
storm

the faintest of sounds  halden doesnt look surprised

tanner is in the doorway  dead silence

haldens face erupts in one continual grin

                         halden
          there was never a doubt buddy

tanner steps into the office slamming shut the door
behind him

halden keeps that grin plastered on his lips

                         halden
          tanner comes through

tanner heads straight for him  smell of violence

still smiling haldens on his feet  a laser trained on
tanner

                         halden
          i just need the disk back then we
          can put this whole thing behind
          us 

tanner rips away the weapon with savage speed then grabs
halden by the windpipe and slams him back against the
wall

                         tanner
          she was real

halden trying to say something but all that comes out is
some awful garbled noise

                         tanner
          you sonofabitch

haldens face turning weird shades of red  then touches
of blue  eyes going slack

tanner finally lets go  halden collapses hacking for
air  a while to suck in enough to get out words

                         halden
          what did he tell you

                         tanner
          the truth

                         halden
                  shakes his head
          not his style

                         tanner
          katie was digitized

halden nods  tanner stares down at him

                         tanner
          then you had her killed

                         halden
          why would i do that

                         tanner
          to hide the evidence

halden climbs to his feet struggling to regain some
semblance of authority

                         halden
          we drugged her  so she wouldnt
          remember

                         tanner
          try harder

                         halden
          there was no need to kill her

                         tanner
          then where is she

                         halden
          come on tanner think this through

tanner levels the laser on him

                         halden
          she has no memory of it  she wont
          know who you are

tanners face tightens

                         tanner
          last time i ask  where is she

halden stares at tanner  tanner will pull the trigger
halden blurts 

                         halden
          an interface attendant

                         tanner
          where

                         halden
          times square

tanner nods then fires the laser again and again into 

the window  blows out the glass  tanner hurls the gun
out into the storm


ext  hallway

tanner hurries for the elevator  halden charging after
him

                         halden
          one last piece of business

tanner doesnt stop  elevator doors opening

                         halden
          need the disk back

                         tanner

                         halden

                         tanner
                  holds up the disk
          if shes alive you get it back

he zips the disk into his jacket pocket as he steps
into 


int  elevator

tanner jabs at the button  the doors sliding shut

last thing tanner sees is haldens smiling face

                         halden
          dont forget tanner
                  amused
          she wont know who the hell you
          are

around him

ext  vsi corporate headquarters  moments later

a solid sheet of rain drenching the world


ext  times square  that day

the rain seems even worse pounding the neonstrobed hell
hole

its a mob scene outside of the vsi interface center
aftermath of the system being ejected

tanner slices through the crowd fighting his way inside


int  vsi interface station

a small handful of overwhelmed vsi employees passing out
credit vouchers to a crush of angry customers

tanner moves through the crowd searching but not
finding

working his way to the center looking everywhere and
finally 

katie

in the back corner  managing to keep a professional calm
as she hands out vouchers

tanner is so close now he could touch her  she turns to
him  waiting for something  then finally

                         katie
          im sorry sir we need your debit
          card before we can issue a
          credit 

                         tanner
                  quiet intensity
           katie

his eyes burning into hers  she looks at him confused

                         katie
          do i know you

long beat  truth tearing at him  finally

                         tanner
          lance stanworth  his fathers
          station wagon and sixteen yearold
          promises

she tenses studying his face

                         katie
          you went to my highschool

                         tanner
          no

                         katie
          then how do you know about 

                         tanner
           you told me

                         katie
          what are you talking about

the patrons thrusting debit cards in her face  he
practically has to yell to be heard

                         tanner
          your mother told you your father
          died in a car crash
                  beat
          wasnt until you left for college
          that your uncle finally told you the
          truth

shes staring at him  no longer noticing anyone else

                         tanner
          most nights you wake up crying
          never knowing why

                         katie
          who are you

he motions toward the back  away from the people


int  back of the building  moments later

katie and tanner stand alone in the open doorway
outside the storm smothers the empty alley

                         tanner
          we worked together on the inside
          you were on my programming team

she stares at him like hes crazy

                         katie
          ive never been inside

he looks at her

                         katie
          my synapses wouldnt connect  they
          say it happens with some people

a still silence as hes suddenly not sure he should tell
her

                         katie
          what

he eyes the ground  rivulets of light reflected off the
black water

her voice pounds into him  needs to know

                         katie
          tell me 

he grabs her arm pulling her out into 


int  back alley  continuous

dark storm battering them as he leads her into 


int  kinkos  continuous

antiseptic light drips down onto the newest
telecommunications toys  salaried men and women crowd the
terminals

tanner leads katie to the back  old fashioned color xerox
machine in the corner  he grabs a price list

                         tanner
          they took you

slams the paper into the machine  punches the button
machine kicks out the xerox

                         tanner
          and made a copy

holds up the two pieces of paper side by side

                         tanner
          identical  ones you  ones
          digital

                         katie
          thats not possible  no one can do
          that

                         tanner
          corporation can

this hangs there  katie fighting back believing

                         tanner
          thats why they told you you cant
          go inside
                  beat
          they cant have you running into
          her

                         katie
          her

he holds up the xerox

                         tanner
          you

katie stares at it trembling barely holding on

                                            cut to

int  bar  moment later

tanner and katie in the back  shes still struggling to
understand

                         katie
          you said we were on the same
          programming team

                         tanner
          yes

                         katie
                  shakes her head
          but i dont know anything about
          programming

                         tanner
          once they digitized you they added
          it

she stares at him

                         katie
          why

                         tanner
          it was a test

                         katie
          for what

tanners face darkens  working hard to stay emotionless

                         tanner
          to see how long it would take for me
          to realize

                         katie
          realize

                         tanner
                  quiet
          you werent real

shes still staring at him

                         katie
          and how long did it take you

his voice is suddenly very small

                         tanner
          they had to tell me

hes suddenly no longer looking at her  but her eyes
remain frozen on him  starting to get it

                         katie
          it was more than work wasnt it

a long beat before he finally forces himself to meet her
stare

                         katie
          and it meant something

                         tanner
                  barely audible
          yes

she nods her eyes aching

                         katie
          i dont know what thats like

hes looking at her  like hes done so many times  then
he kisses her

she pulls away  shaking trying to say something but it
wont come out so she kisses him back

a terrified connection

                                            cut to

int  tanners warehouse loft  a little later

muted light sifts through the windows

the door slides open  tanner and katie silently enter

her mouth on his as she tugs at his jacket  it falls to
the floor

                         katie
          candles  get candles

she waits as he heads into 


int  kitchen  continuous

tears apart the cupboards  finds several mismatched
candles  grabs matches returning to 


int  hallway  continuous

its empty  his coat has been picked up and neatly hung
on the hook  he moves into 


int  bedroom  continuous

katies sitting on the bed staring at him with trembling
eyes

                         katie
          pretend im her  were inside
                  quietly
          show me what it was like

sound of rain slamming into the window  he lights the
candles throwing wicked shadows across the room

he turns to the bed looking down at her

flicker of emotion  so much held back

falls down on top of her  both fully clothed  his mouth
tracing the lines of her neck  her breaths coming faster

his hands roaming her body  raw passion

she flips him over climbing on top  kissing him
hungry  but suddenly stopping

staring at him in troubled silence

                         tanner
          what

                         katie
          way you kiss me

sound of the rain drilling the metal walls

                         katie
          like youve done it so many times

he stares up at her not sure how to answer

her voice wrapped in darkness

                         katie
          i wasnt with you

                         tanner
          i know

                         katie
          but you were with me

                         tanner
          not you  a copy

                         katie
          whats the difference

the rain drumming against the windows

a jetcopter screams by overhead

hes like a statue watching her

something burns deep in her eyes

moves her mouth down to his

hes not breathing  just staring at her

she kisses him  he erupts 

throws her off of him 

blurring into 


int  kitchen

claws through the drawer for a knife


int  bedroom

he returns to the bed  she sees the knife in his hands

                         katie
          what the hells going on 

he grabs her arm  her eyes now locked on his

                         katie
          you sure you want to do this

he raises the knife

                         katie
          because this time can be different
                  pleads
          this time we can stay together 

the blade flashes down piercing her flesh

no blood  not one single drop  she suddenly wont look
at him


int  hallway

he rushes to his jacket unzips the pocket reaches
inside  its empty  no disk

whirls around  katie staring at him from the bedroom

                         katie
          im sorry

                         tanner
          sorry

                         katie
          there was no other choice

he comes at her  eyes wild  deadly

                         tanner
          none of this was real

her voice now trembling

                         katie
          i do love you

she flickers  tears staining her eyes

                         katie
                  soft
          more than i should

then shes no longer there

tanner is standing alone in the middle of the room

eyes pounding with rage

he spins punching through the window

hand bloodied keeps punching harder and harder until
theres no more glass left

but the rain doesnt come into the room  stopped by some
invisible barrier

a primal scream ripping from his throat

taste of the beast

he attacks the walls clawing them down into darkness

                         christophs voice os
          i couldnt let you eject the system

tanner whirls  christoph stands across the room

                         christoph
          because ive seen the world you
          would have returned them to

he steps toward tanner voice ripped with anguish

                         christoph
          and i have too much compassion for
          that

tanner slams his stare into him

                         tanner
          but this world doesnt last

christoph calmly meets tanners stare

                         christoph
          what if it could

the question hangs there as the walls dissolve into
nothingness plunging them into 


ext  pitch blackness

jazz music pierces the darkness

then a flicker of light expanding out to 


ext  the terrace  roof  continuous

the party is gone  tanner and christoph stand alone on
the roof the lights of night city spread out before them

                         christoph
          what if we take it out onto the net

the question hangs there  tanner shakes his head
couldnt have heard it right

                         christoph
          unlimited energy out there  enough
          to run this world for all
          eternity 

                         tanner
           but youll never be able to get
          it through the maze

                         christoph
          me  of course not
                  smiles
          thats why youre here

he locks eyes with tanner

                         christoph
          your maze  you designed it  you
          can lead us through it

terrified understanding beginning to flash through
tanners eyes

                         christoph
          he comes to deliver them from a land
          of affliction and bring them to a
          good land a land flowing with milk
          and honey

there is a sense of almost relief in christophs eyes
the secret finally told

                         christoph
          with the energy from the net we can
          program this world anyway we want
                  beams
          redwood forests  oceans
          mountains 

                         tanner
           two million people pluggedin
          here

                         christoph
          yes

tanner is horrified at putting it together

                         tanner
          you cant let them go

christoph says nothing  tanners eyes bore into him

                         tanner
          until youre on the net where the
          corporation cant touch you you
          cant open the system  theyll
          eject it if you do

                         christoph
          one would assume so

the fireworks show starts up over the carnival down below

tanner doesnt seem to notice his eyes frozen on
christoph

                         tanner
          but once the system touches the net
          all links are severed
                  beat
          everybody dies

                         christoph
          only up there in the dream they
          called life

                         tanner
          and down here 

christoph holds up the access card

                         christoph
           thanks to you we can reconfigure
          the system to free up enough power
          to digitize everybody who is
          pluggedin  every last soul
                  intense
          and bring them to a better world

tanners eyes glow with fury

                         tanner
          and if i refuse

christoph calmly meets tanners stare

                         christoph
          then the system crashes
                  matteroffact
          and you have let two million people
          die

he fades away  leaving tanner standing alone on the roof


ext  night city  street  continuous

the streets are crowded with people heading in and out of
bars

the fireworks from the carnival raining down overhead

nobody noticing the small clouds creeping in over the
horizon


ext  the terrace  roof  continuous

tanner stares out at the slowly approaching clouds

tormented realization tearing at his face


ext  glass elevator  moments later

tanner rides the elevator down the side of the building

he watches through the window as more clouds drift
overhead

the elevator glides to a stop depositing tanner out
onto 


ext  street  continuous

he heads out into the middle of the street

huge explosions tear apart the darkness as the fireworks
boom across the sky

in the quick bursts of light tanner can see the clouds are
getting darker and darker

the air filled with the screams of people riding the
digital roller coaster

the first drops of rain beginning to swirl lazily to the
ground

people stopping what theyre doing and staring up into the
sky  stunned that its actually raining

tanner instinctively pushing through the crowd yelling 

                         tanner
          get inside  get back inside

but no one paying him any attention

the rain coming down harder now

more and more people pouring out onto the streets as word
begins to circulate that its raining


int  nexus center  continuous

dex and christoph stand silently in front of a program
panel watching the monitor across the room which shows 


ext  night city  streets  continuous

tanner is still fighting his way through the crowd

up above the fireworks explode in the rain creating
prisms of flickering color

tanner suddenly freezes  sees 

katie across the street  she is watching him  tears in
her eyes

and then it happens

a horrific sound roars across the sky

hard to tell if its thunder or laughter as 

the clouds unleash their rage

the storm ripping apart the night  rain as thick as
steel

knocking people to their knees  struggling to stand

and it keeps coming  slamming down harder and harder
threatening to wash the whole damn city away


int  nexus center  continuous

christoph pulls his eyes away from the monitor

a long beat then he silently nods to dex who punches the
commands into the program panel

christoph keeps his stare away from the monitor not
wanting to watch as 


ext  night city  streets  continuous

the savage rain storm continues as a small burst of fire
falls from the sky

the flames swirl through the rain

tanner like the crowds all around him is pinned to the
ground by the crush of water

the balls of flames burn right through him 

his body convulsing on the ground in anguished pain 

he is probably screaming but it would be in vain as the
storm drowns out all noise 

                                            cut to

ext  chicago street  dawn

a peaceful street in the downtown area dominated by vsis
chicago public interface center


int  chicago interface center  continuous

rows and rows of people strapped unconscious to interface
seats

an alarm pierces the room

a medical technician rushes to the sound sweeping a
curtain around the person  takes one look down at the
person and 

                         medical technician
                  yelling
          i need help here

the bulking man in the interface seat is in the throes of
violent spasms his eyes thrust dangerously back in his
head

then mercifully its over  he flatlines

                                            cut to

ext  night city  street  continuous

tanner struggles to his feet the rain crashing down on
him

he fights his way over to katie 

flames now falling from every square inch of sky

a solid blanket of death floating down onto the city

tanner locks eyes with katie screaming as loud as he
can 

                         tanner
          christoph as god

it is impossible to tell if she can hear him over the
howling tempest

but there is the slightest shift in her face  some
tortured realization

tanner turns back into the street

the flames drifting down through the rain  only
heartbeats away from hitting the people

tanner stares straight up into the heavens screaming 

                         tanner
          enough  they will not die 


int  nexus  continuous

relief spills through christophs face as he turns to the
program panel and throws in the commands for 


ext  night city  streets

the flames disappear  just like that

then the storm stops

a silent stillness

the crowds in the street still shaking not yet willing to
believe its really over

the first glint of light as the night fades

for the first time ever the sun rises over the night
city  dawn in the new world

tanner and katie flicker then fade away


int  nexus center  continuous

tanner and katie materialize on the 

fifth floor catwalk

they are flanked by christoph and dex along with an army
of armed digital employees

katie silently stares at tanner  something being
communicated

christoph smiles at tanner

                         christoph
          and moses said who am i that i
          should lead them to the promise
          land

tanner turns and stares at him in steely silence

                         christoph
          nine minutes before the system
          crashes

tanners eyes reflexively spin down the catwalk toward the
core program

christoph holds up the access card 

                         christoph
          you dont have access to it  you
          cant eject
                  dead serious
          so the only way everybody lives is
          out on the net

tanner catches a quick glimpse of katie as she slips
through the guards and down the stairs

dex motions to the program panel in front of tanner

                         dex
          this program interface will get you
          into the maze

the longest beat  then tanner nods

fourth floor catwalk

katie rushes to a program panel and throws it open
punching in commands  data whips across the screen

fifth floor catwalk

christoph hands the access card to dex who in turn slides
it into the program panel in front of tanner

several long beats then the program buzzes

                         disembodied voice from program
          access approved

dex pulls out the card as tanner calls out 

                         tanner
          now 

his hands rocket out with blurring speed  one hand
grabbing the card as the other grasps onto the program
panel 

fourth floor catwalk

katie slams in the last of the commands 

fifth floor catwalk

the catwalk flickers then disappears

christoph dex and the digital employees plunging down
through thin air

tanner hanging onto the panel 

fourth floor catwalk

katie punches in more commands and now 

fifth floor catwalk

the catwalk reappears

ground floor

christoph dex and the men crash hard to the ground

fifth floor catwalk

tanner races down the catwalk to a program panel  he
throws in the access card

ground floor

christoph is the first one to his feet  his eyes spin up
to tanner on the catwalk

                         christoph
                  bellows
          kill him 

the army of digital guards springing to their feet lasers
drawn

fifth floor catwalk

tanner slams in the last of the commands causing 

a laser cannon to materialize next to him

stairs

the guards charging for tanner  theres too many of them
hell never kill them all

fifth floor catwalk

tanner aims the cannon down onto the second floor and
fires 

a program explodes  the program that controls the
waiters

the guards who are reprogrammed waiters disappear

tanner fires into another program

the guards who are reprogrammed busboys disappear

tanner keeps firing  destroying the employee programs


int  stairs

the last of the guards flicker then are gone

dex is the only one left on the stairs as he races up to
the catwalk


int  ground floor

christoph stares up as tanner rips open the core program
and throws in the access card

fifth floor catwalk

data whips across the screen reflecting off tanners
face

tanner suddenly spins

dex is up on the catwalk laser trained on tanner

tanner reaches for his gun but he is too late

the hissing of a laser

small neat hole burned through dexs forehead

he crumples to the ground bloodless face frozen in death

tanner whirls around  katie stands behind him laser in
hand  she is staring at dexs body  first time she has
killed

a buzzing breaks the silence 

                         disembodied voice from program
          access approved 

ground floor

christoph yells up at tanner 

                         christoph
          one thing you need to know
                  beat
          there is no katie out there
                  intense
          halden really did have her killed
                  explains
          thats why the digital one is
          allowed to stay in here 

catwalk

christophs warning echoing around tanner and katie

she slowly lowers the gun her eyes shaking as she looks
up at tanner

an anguished silence broken by christophs yelling 

                         christophs voice os
          you hear me tanner  she only
          lives in here

katie stares at tanner struggling for the words but they
wont come

so she leans over and kisses him  both of their bodies
trembling

                         katie
                  tortured whisper
          im already dead

her eyes wet she kisses him again knowing it will be the
last time

he forces himself to turn back to the program panel
slamming in the eject sequence

christoph materializes on the catwalk 

                         christoph
          no 

he hurls tanner away from the program panel  only hes
too late 

that godawful noise  louder and louder

christophs face wracked with realization  last thing he
will do is turn to tanner 

                         christoph
          life is too precious 

the nexus centers walls fade away 


ext  night city  streets  continuous

the buildings are all gone

the light sweeps down for the people 


int  nexus center  continuous

katies eyes locked on tanner

the light explodes through ripping them all into
nothingness 


int  the net  darkness

tanner is thrown out into the darkness spinning
helplessly through the blackness

the faintest of light  growing brighter and brighter
as 

                                            cut to

int  vsi corporate headquarters  interface room

tanners eyes flutter open struggling for focus

several blurry shapes  tanner pushes himself to sit

the shapes are people  haldens bodyguards  one of them
grabs the disk from the chairs interface

                         tanner
          i need to see halden 

                         womans voice os
           im sorry

tanner turns  it is emma  she looks tortured by what she
must do

                         emma
          hes not taking visitors

she motions to the bodyguards who hustle tanner to his
feet and out the door


ext  street  moments later

the rain has slowed to a drizzle  a mud gray day

emma wishes she didnt have to be the one who had to do
this

                         emma
          fco regulations require all
          system providers to test their
          emergency eject sequence at least
          once a year
                  quietly
          our records will show thats exactly
          what transpired

before tanner can respond she disappears back inside

the sidewalks crowded people brushing against tanner
but he stands there not moving staring up at the top of
the building

                                            cut to

int  vsi building  haldens office  moments later

halden sits behind his desk staring out the window

emma heads inside laying the disk on the desk

haldens eyes remain silently out the window

emma leaves shutting the door behind her

halden looks down at the disk  smallest flicker of guilt

                                            cut to

ext  hells kitchen  warehouse  that day

a beatup taxi drops tanner out front


int  tanners loft  continuous

the place is dark  tanner hits the switch

the monitor snaps alive bathing the room in eerie blue
light

                         tanner
          display program received from
          uplink

clicking sound as the program drips down the screen

                         tanner
          program name

                         synthetic voice

tanner nods making himself a drink

tanner settles into a chair taking a hit of his drink

                         tanner
          uplink resurrection program

tanner sits there in the darkness listening to the
machines talking to each other

                         synthetic voice
                  buzzes
          uplink received

he nods a flutter of satisfaction

a noise from the bedroom  sounds like a womans voice
calling out for him

he downs the drink grabbing his gun and moving into 


int  bedroom

it is empty  the noise is just the wind howling against
the window

he stares at the bed  several long beats  he doesnt
move

                                            cut to

int  vsi times square  interface center  that day

the aftermath of the system being ejected

vsi interface attendants passing out credit vouchers as
fast as they can to the crush of complaining customers

tanner squeezes his way inside

his eyes spinning to the back toward katie but shes not
there

he moves through the crowd trying to find her  finally
makes his way to the front desk

                         tanner
          im looking for katie hall

the security guard at the desk looks at him like hes
crazy

                         security guard
          you expect me to find someone in
          this crowd 

                         tanner
           not a customer  an employee

                         security guard
                  shakes his head
          no katie works here

                         tanner
          are you sure

                         security guard
          ive been here since we opened
          never been a katie

long beat  realization ripping through tanner

he stands there frozen for several dark moments  then
finally turns and heads out the door

almost outside when he hears the voice

he spins

katie

in the back passing out vouchers  but then the crowd
shifts blocking his view

he cuts a path to her his eyes tense was he imagining
her

but hes now standing right next to her  can feel her
breath

                         katie
          can i please have your debit card

hes staring at her  fierce intensity

                         katie
          sir your debit 

he looks down at her name tag  it reads katherine  he
nods of course

                         tanner
          they changed your name

                         katherine
          who did

he stares at her needs to know  he reaches out with
lightning speed and plucks off her name tag

before she can react he grabs her arm nicking it with
the pin from the name tag

she spins yelling to the security guard 

                         katherine
          frank 

the security guard frank hurries over

tanner watches her arm  thin ribbon of blood rising to
the cut  flicker of relief shudders through him

he stares her straight in the eye 

                         tanner
          you grew up in vermont

she stays silent not wanting to say anything thatll set
this guy off

                         tanner
          when you were six your father went
          out to buy a newspaper and never
          came back
                  beat
          your mother lied told you he was
          killed in a car accident 

frank is there now wrenching tanners hands back
twisting them behind his back

tanner doesnt resist his eyes locked on katherine 

                         tanner
          you have trouble remembering your
          dreams
                  beat
          but theres one you always have

shes staring at him

                         tanner
          a babys crying  but no one comes
          to help it  so it keeps crying
          all night long 

frank cuffs tanner then drags him away

tanners eyes struggling for katies face but its
swallowed up by the crowd


ext  back alley  continuous

tanner is uncuffed and hurled out into the alley

the sound of the door slamming shut behind him dead bolts
sliding into place

a jetcopter screams by overhead

an old man face stained with illness lays on a bed of
newspaper next to tanner

sounds of the real world filtering down the alley  a
family arguing  groups of friends laughing  someone
screaming

tanner slowly turns around

katherine is in the doorway watching him

sunlight pierces through the clouds

she tries to keep her voice from trembling

                         katherine
          who are you

tanner stares at her does something he hasnt done in a
long time  he smiles

                                            fade out

                         the end
