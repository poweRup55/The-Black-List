               mirror already quite drunk oblivious to the assorted types 
               hiding from daylight in the barnlike saloon waiting for 
               night to fall

               childsize old man of twentyone  hopefully nursing an 
               empty beer glass contemplating the money on the bar in front

               ratso spits as jackie leans on the bar next to joe  a 
               feminine young person heavily madeup hair teased wearing 
               earrings and a lacetrimmed blouse over shocking pink levis

               leaving joe alone repeating cherry neverlin as he starts 
               along the corridor looking for 901

               confidently hearing a few bars of his love theme as he stuffs 
               a fresh stick of gum in his mouth then the door is thrown 
               open by odaniel  for an instant appearing to wear a diamond

               vegetable stand  elbowing his way through the ladies 
               testing fruit picking up vegetables and putting them back  
               till the greengrocer spots him

               joe lies on his cot watching ratso struggle to penetrate 
               the fibrous husk of a coconut experimenting with a variety 
               of rusty tools in an old cigar box

               joe standing selfconsciously aware of the covert glances 
               of the other mourners automatically reaching up to remove 
               his hat remembering when ratso elbows him in the ribs

               joe scowling tightlipped embarrassed by the tip that 
               is thrust in his hand

               int lunch counter  evening

               a weary santa claus in a rented beard and overlarge costume 
               warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup joe and 
               ratso are arguing farther down the counter

                                     joe

               macalbertson enter the lunch counter inspecting the customers 
               one by one both wear black turtlenecks and jeans dressed

               joe studies the black card frowning at first suddenly

               they are disappearing around the corner joe hands the card 
               to ratso

               joe sees a young man washing cups behind the counter joe 
               shakes his head wonderingly turning to study himself in

               ext loft building  night

               snow swirls in the aureole of a street light as joe and ratso 
               run heads lowered turning into

               int loft building  night

               a drab entrance hall dimly lit  signs identifying 
               various commercial tenants  a pinkonblack placard reading 
               macalbertson two flights up joe has started up before he 
               notices ratso leaning on the bannister at the foot of the 
               stairs struggling to catch his breath his face and hair 
               are wet with perspiration his lips lavenderblue

               in swift flashes  intercut  joe reads the panic in ratsos 
               eyes so intense that joe shares it unable to speak or offer 
               reassurance

                                     joe
                         better dry your hair some you 
                         sweating all over the goddam place

               joe pulls out his shirttail grabs ratso by the neck and 
               rubs his head dry

                                     joe
                         you got a comb

                                     ratso

                                     joe
                         few dozen cooties wont kill me 
                         dont guess

               joe hands ratso his own comb ratso swipes at his tangled 
               hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb he hands the 
               comb back tugs at his hair with his fingers pats it in 
               place then looks back into joes eyes

                                     ratso
                         okay i look okay

               in a moment of silence distant sounds can be heard  a 
               siren the grinding teeth of a garbage truck the twang of 
               an electric guitar upstairs at the party  then ratso makes 
               a quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs 
               pulling himself on the bannister

               int macalbertsons loft  night

               a bank of lights blinds joe and ratso as they enter  
               electronic rock blasts their ears  a bearded cameraman on 
               a stepladder photographs them as they stand confused  
               facing a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up showing 
               the murder of a hippie known as groovy  inhuge black 
               letters love was groovy  groovy is dead joe shouts over 
               the amplified music

                                     joe
                         better get a hold of someone and 
                         tell them im here

               ratso points to his ear  he cant hear  following joe 
               across the room the huge loft is crowded with a random 
               selection gathered to serve as dress extras in an underground 
               film the party is the scene the macalbertsons merely supply 
               the ingredients and allow it to happen with cameras 
               strategically placed to record the happening

               hansel with tape recorder gretel with handheld camera 
               rifting through the crowd  catching words and images in a 
               detached whimsical fashion gretel turns her camera on joe 
               and ratso as they approach

                                     joe
                         well i made it this here is ratso 
                         rizzo and i

                                     ratso
                         rico rico rizzo

               gretel smiles without recognition hansel gestures vaguely

                                     hansel
                         do you need anything i mean theres 
                         beer and so forth whatever your 
                         thing is

               the twins move away together pausing to confer with the 
               operator of a tripod camera  focused on an emaciated flower 
               girl with long hair and dirty feet stretched in a 
               sarcophagus clutching a dead daffodil her eyes glazed 
               scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head  love

                                     ratso
                         if you want the word on that brother 
                         and sister act ill give you the 
                         word that hansels a fag and gretels 
                         got the hots for herself so who 
                         cares right load up on the salami

               ratso heads for the refreshment table joe starts after him 
               but pauses intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a 
               light show is in progress  surreal images of naked bodies 
               projected against abstract currents of color and strobe 
               light

               a bored fat lady in a muumuu squatted like a buddha at 
               a low table rolling joints for the guests she lights a 
               joint and offers it to joe as he wanders in to watch the 
               show joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what it is

                                     joe
                         sheeit this is one helluva party

               glancing around at the others imitating their techniques 
               the quick inhaler who follows with sharp gulps of air 

               the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale  the stylist 
               who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils  
               joe puffing himself slightly dizzy starting to laugh at the 
               silent flick effect of the strobe light  the action around 
               him slowing almost imperceptibly overcranked  a veil of 
               smoke hanging over the fat womans face transforming her 
               into a laughing witch  a similar veil around joes head 
               relaxing the selfconscious tension of his face spontaneously 
               curious about the play of light on his hand grinning at

               a serious young technician handling the light show 
               scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh

               joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back 
               to the crowded loft fascinated to see

               a crew with cameras and lights on the balcony at one end 
               of the loft photographing the scene below

               a darkhaired lady by the name of shirley  chic in the 
               style of a gangsters moll  drinking beer from the bottle 
               predatory eyes searching the crowd

               ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the buffet 
               table glancing nervously over his shoulder unaware of gretel 
               and her handheld camera photographing ratso as he steals 
               turning away casually disinterested

               joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black 
               girl  the lights swinging around them  faces swimming

               shirley in fleeting closeup gone in an instant 
               reappearing

               int macalbertson bathroom  night

               her face in the mirror smiling in a dark provocative way  
               joe standing at the bathroom door forgetting to be 
               embarrassed as shirley turns away from the mirror 
               unhurriedly running her fingers through her hair boldly 
               meeting joes eyes

                                     shirley
                         i can tell cant you

                                     joe

                                     shirley
                         whatll we do leave now or what 
                         your place or mine oh god the second 
                         i looked at you i knew did you

               joe grins watching shirleys lips move unable to keep her 
               in sync startled to hear ratsos voice

                                     ratsos voice
                         shes hooked

               int macalbertsons loft  night

               joe realizes he is back at the party ratso whispering 
               hoarsely

                                     ratso
                         id say she was good for ten bucks 
                         but ill ask for twenty

               but joe is watching with terrible fascination as hansel and 
               gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus

                                     shirleys voice
                         did you know we were going to make 
                         it

               joe glances down to see himself flanked by ratso and shirley

                                     ratso
                         you really want to do business

                                     shirley
                         whos he oh god dont tell me you 
                         two are a couple  

               the flower girl hypnotically dazed accepts a broom dipped 
               in black paint and smears a huge x across love joe laughs

                                     hansels voice
                         why are you laughing joe

               hansel holds a microphone toward joe who shrugs grinning 
               at ratso and shirley gretels camera moves down joes body

                                     hansel
                         are you for real joe

                                     joe
                         well i aint a freal cowboy but 
                         im one hell of a stud

               shirley glances at ratso who nods whispering in her ear

                                     ratso
                         a very expensive stud and i happen 
                         to be his manager

               the scene  from joes viewpoint  becomes increasingly 
               confusing and fragmented dialogue and image moving in and 
               out of focus cameras and lights surrounding him keeping 
               the center of attention in his own blown mind

               shirleys eyes unnaturally bright inspecting his body

               lingering on his thighs moistening her lips

                                     shirley
                         its too much  to come face to 
                         face with a walking talking sex 
                         fantasy  to buy a mans  god

               the tall black girl dancing in strobe light starting to 
               remove her clothes  gretel following her with a camera

                                     shirleys voice
                         i cant wait to tell my man monday 
                         i should be taking notes look at my 
                         arm

               ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb 
               whistling between his teeth sharply hailing a cab the cab 
               slows to a stop then the driver sees ratso shifts into 
               gear and drives on ratso bites his thumb after the cab 
               rests for a moment on the lamp post then starts painfully 
               inching his way along the deserted street

               int shirleys bedroom  night

               joe lies on his back staring fixedly at a fragile mobile 
               hanging from the ceiling stirring listlessly

                                     shirleys voice
                         that happens dont worry about it

               shirley leans on one elbow looking at joe sympathetically 
               fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh still 
               avoiding shirleys eyes joe finds a cigarette on the side 
               table searches for matches

                                     joe

               joe finds the matches lights up and lies back staring at 
               the mobile as he smokes still not looking at shirley

                                     joe

               spread out on the sheet consisting of nine dice lettered on 
               all sides the object being to build as many words as 
               possible scrabble fashion while a sand timer counts the 
               seconds shirley watches joes efforts to think with 
               sympathetic amusement the only word joe has composed so far 
               is man

               shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across joes 
               chest as she leans over to study the game breathing softly 
               into his ear as she speaks

                                     shirley

               disarranging the sheet talon nails lightly brushing his 
               thigh

                                     joe

               but the end of his sentence is swallowed by shirley taking

               front concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical

               joes elbows pinning her shoulders

               her eyes bright accepting the challenge

               his tight smile revealing clenched teeth

               her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm

               her talonnails clawing the air

               her toes walking up his calf

               her legs suddenly locking around his knees

               her free hand grabbing his hair

               her shoulder rising as she forces his head back

               her lips pressing down on his

               his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh

               her eyes popping teeth clamping his ear lobe

               his hand catching her ankle

               her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams

               her foot appearing upside down beside her face

               her talonnails furrowing flesh drawing blood

               his head rearing back roaring

               both rolling to the floor out of view

               her feet suddenly flying up into view

               her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket

               her other hand wildly exploring joes back

               her ankles locking spasmodically

               her eyes and mouth wide gaping

               the blanket suddenly ripping free flying into the air as 
               her arm flings itself around joe

               the bedclothes spilling down around them muffling her 
               ascending shrieks

               joe slaps a bill on the counter admiring a fine new cowboy 
               shirt in the mirror wriggling new white socks into his boots 
               suddenly remembering he goes to the sock rack and buys two 
               pairs one large and one small gradually dominating joes 
               love theme recurs continuing over

               ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair  wearing the 
               stolen sheepskin coat  wrapped in blankets his teeth 
               chattering in spite of the sweat on his forehead joe stops 
               abruptly his mood shattered by ratsos alarming condition 
               they simply stare at each other for a moment then joe turns 
               away to see soup heating on the sterno stove joe tosses one 
               of his paper bags onto ratsos lap

                                     joe

               ratso opens the paper bag trying to control his shivering 
               pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear he sees 
               joe watching him for a reaction the best ratso can do is a 
               slight shake of his head

                                     joe
                         they wrong

               joe hands ratso the soup ratso seems steadied by the warmth 
               in his hands he nods sipping the soup

               joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl 
               away while he waits hearing a phone ring then the phone is 
               answered by a womans voice

                                     joe

               like a bad little boy joe backhands him angrily trying to 
               duck the blow towny stumbles and slips to the floor but 
               grabs the table in his arms watching joe out of the corner 
               of his eyes whimpering joe grabs his hair turning his

                         i deserved that i know i did

               but he clutches the table wildly his mothers picture falls 
               unnoticed joe stands in panic sickened unable to fulfill 
               the role towny has assigned him

               hitting towny towny shrieks  eyes rolling back as he falls 
               limp  loosing his grip on the table leaning on the bed 
               laughing and crying hysterically joe has to step over him 
               to reach the wallet in the drawer he takes all the money  
               probably twice what he needs  desperate to get out of the

               ratso begins to laugh with joe as if it were the funniest 
               thing theyd ever heard then ratsos face pales as he starts 
               to choke and cough joe pats him on the back

               joe and ratso have moved to the seat farthest back wider 
               than the others joe blocks the view of the other passengers 
               as he helps ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a 
               florida shirt in the middle of the operation ratso dozes 
               off joe shakes his head scowling annoyed but continues 
               lifting ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist 
               ratso awakens as joe zips the fly

                                     ratso
                         hey what the hell you doing

               hot a group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the 
               bus as it passes

               int greyhound bus  day

               ratsos eyes squint in a dazed halfsleep joe leans across 
               to pull down the shade he hesitates a moment watching

               past his reflection a group of young men on their way to 
               work carrying lunch pails dressed exactly as joe is now 
               dressed

               then joe lowers the blind and seats himself ratso nods 
               slightly his voice practically inaudible

                                     ratso

               joe glances at ratso but there is no response 
               surreptitiously joe takes out a cigarette turns his face 
               away from ratso and lights it hiding it cupped in his hand 
               as he smokes

               own joe turns checking the blanket around ratso noticing 
               that ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff awkward position 
               joe leans over to straighten ratsos head blocking our view 
               for a moment then joe leans back frowning thoughtful we 
               still do not see ratsos face joe rises slowly starting 
               forward in the bus
