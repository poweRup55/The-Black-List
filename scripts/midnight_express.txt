               behind her we see the other american passengers beginning 
               to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped 
               conversations expletives including

                                     passengers

               plane starts back down the ramp but a flow of upcoming 
               passengers slows her descent

               billy is led roughly by two soldiers parallel to the plane 
               his hands on his head he manages a glance at susan a 
               slight but strong movement of the head and eyes no dont

               susan understands it looks helplessly hesitates lost 
               between two worlds a silent shaping of a puzzled mouth

               vip room airport lounge  the scene moves very fast 
               indicating a sense of chaos  much smoke  many phone calls 
               half a dozen turkish police officers are bizarrely seated 
               in a row of fold up chairs next to a desk chattering among 
               themselves ad lib lighting their turkish cigarettes 
               they hardly pay attention as

               move to billy scared sweating  backlit by the huge 
               windows overlooking the airstrip in background we see 
               the 707 pan american plane beginning to circle towards the 
               runway  guards have stripped him down to his bare chest 
               and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at 
               once then rip the tape off  billy winces

               another angle the room billys luggage is being tossed  
               clothes fly through the air a sweatshirt marquette

               to the floor another package is ripped open and a set of 
               turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor very 
               fast

               billy watches bewildered he is stripped of the last plaque 
               in of the confusion is that each time another police officer

               his navel follow the plaque clattering onto the pile of 
               forty plaques

               move back quickly to the officer with notebook at the desk  
               part of the confusion is that each time we see another 
               police officer we see he has another face

                                     first officer

                              writes it down

               a loud sound off

               the door flies open and another officer strides in  
               paunchy moustached the room is suddenly silent as we 
               track him in followed by a grinning civilian flunky with 
               a big portable photo instrument and bulb

               the first officer jumps up from the desk makes an 
               obsequious salute to the second officer who arrogantly 
               acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the 
               desk the first officer moves to the first foldup chair 
               in the row pushing the police officer in that chair further 
               down this officer in turn shoves the next man down it 
               goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the 
               last man in the row stands up against the wall but this 
               is all in the background as

                                     second officer

                         hayes

               sharp sound off of film being ripped from camera he darts 
               a look at

               policeman stretching the undeveloped film out  another 
               loud sound off interrupting this

               the door flies open again and a third officer strides in 
               obviously the most important yet because the second officer 
               jumps up from the desk and all the others immediately 
               move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moments 
               hesitation but the third officer strides right up to billy 
               waves to the second officer  the cameraman in background 
               bubbles with enthusiasm sliding into position billy is 
               puzzled  whats going on  his arm is grabbed and he is 
               swivelled around

               billy in the middle flanked by second and third officer 
               grinning like big game hunters their arms on his shoulders 
               the first officer sticking a bunch of hashish plaques 
               into billys hands runs out of frame billy looks from 
               side to side the second officer pats him hard on the back 
               of the head meaning look at camera billy glances at 
               him sees the grin on both the officers faces thinking 
               this is the necessary expression he grins at the camera

               cameraman disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece

                                     cameraman
                         no hes smiling make him look 
                         miserable

               second officer slugs billy in the stomach with a quick 
               backhanded fist billy groans sinks to his knees the 
               plaques fall on the floor

                                     first officer

               he growls grabbing billys arm and hauling him up 
               gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his 
               arms the two officers put their arms back on billys 
               shoulders billy in pain makes the proper expression of 
               misery

               to the window huddled over feeling woozy and near 
               vomiting  he glimpses the plane but it is anticlimatic 
               now as he stares down at his boots then remembers 
               something surprised

               another angle  room the turkish officers talk ad lib 
               among themselves congratulating slapping shoulders 
               pointing to the hashish plaques etc  

               in center background we see billy submissively lifting 
               his arm for permission to speak

               third officer nods approaches followed by others

               billy slowly partly out of pain pulls off one of his 
               boots bangs it on the heel and two more plaques clatter 
               to the floor

               turkish mouths drop open

               billy finishes the process with the other boot an awkward 
               silence off

               ahead

               billy is now completely bald sound sharp over

                                                                    cut

               a cell door sliding open billy steps in bewildered

                                     ziat voice off
                         git

               the cell is dark almost black an overpowering stench a 
               small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy 
               mattress billy turns looking back at the man staring at 
               him from the door

               ziat is quickly summing up billys character this is his 
               crafthe is a prisoner and trustee sinister man whose one 
               motivation in life is the accumulation of money in the 
               pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish scar 
               running the width of his throat various other facial scars 
               and one blind milky white eye hes stocky and strong 
               about five ten with bushy eyebrows brown cigarette teeth 
               big dirty nails repulsively in need of a bath whats 
               surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old 
               looks and behaves like sixty the personification of the 
               denaturalization of a man time body mind  all of them 
               warped

               billy not yet attuned to his nature only repulsed is 
               still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture 
               enunciating very clearly hoping he will understand

                                     billy
                         cold very cold can i get blanket  
                         blanket
                              makes a gesture of 
                              a blanket wrapped 
                              around him

               ziat smiles showing his stained teeth and starts to slide 
               shut the cell door on its roller

                                     ziat

               a cobra smile flashes as the cell door bangs shut

                                     ziat
                              through the bars

                         gedjalergood night

               goes

               billy walks around the cell hugging himself for warmth

                                     voice off
                         pssst

               billy stops goes to the edge of the cell

               a bony bare arm motions from the bars of the cell next to 
               his  we never see the face but hear a thick italian accent 
               hoarse and cracked

                                     voice off
                         whispering 
                         your cell no key  open  
                         blanket three cell down you get 
                         me one take

               extends a stick with a big nail pounded into the end 
               twisted over to form a hook

               billy takes it hesitates

                                     voice off
                         ziat go for night  go

               billy cautiously slides the cell door open amazed that 
               its been left open  nothing makes any sense to him in 
               this labyrinth

               another angle  billy steps out into a walkway a bare 
               bulb overhead casts light he glides past the three cells 
               seemingly empty  finds the cell with blankets sheets 
               towels and various supplies stacked inside  but its 
               locked  he slips the stick in between the bars and 
               stretching hooks the first blanket

               billy asleep with the blankets pulled up to his chin  
               suddenly dirty hands reach into frame and rip the blanket 
               off widen to

                                     ziat
                              tugging the sheet 
                              growls
                         brackbrack 

               then slaps at billy billy ducks away encouraged ziat 
               steps up closer to him sticks his fingers in his chest 
               screaming

                                     ziat
                         you goddamn you give me sheet  
                         give me 

               and feints as if to hit billy again billy reacts to defend 
               himself pushing ziat off and jumping out of the bunk  

               ziat enraged by the shove comes back at billy screaming 
               arms flailing like a bear to pummel him but billy not 
               understanding the turkish bluster in his mannerisms meets 
               him with a sharp right fist into the front of his face  

               ziat staggers back startled into silence he has misjudged 
               this kid

               billy waits ready for the fight in the defensive position 
               the guy is bigger than himself  ziat however now feels 
               the blood from his mouth and nose and freaks out running 
               out of the cell screaming at the top of his lungs as if 
               hes dying

                                                                    cut

               billy is blindfolded stumbling down stone steps pushed by 
               a guard into a dungeonlike basement room the punishment 
               cells

                                                                    cut

               the guard removes the blindfold billy adjusting to the 
               light stares around the cell is spartan with a series 
               of pulleys and primitive bondage devices hanging from the 
               cobwebbed ceilinga door opens and

               hamidou steps in lowering his head to get through the 
               doorchief of the guards a clean uniform  four stripes 
               the only guard to carry a holstered gun very frightening 
               man he is about six two two forty and muscular and 
               moves lightly like a fighter on his feet  his skull is 
               bulletshaped and completely shaven like billys enhancing 
               this effect he has no eyebrows and his pale blue eyes 
               suggesting a trace of indoeuropean stock in his ancestry 
               are set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes giving 
               nothing away his nose is a beak of skin his neck broad 
               his mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his 
               feet between anger and amusement he approaches billy 
               looks into his eyes drawing out the moment for himself 
               enjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others

               billy meets his eyes respectfully then realizing this is 
               perhaps not the thing do to looks away but fascinated 
               by the mans features beyond his selfcontrol he looks 
               back  

               hamidou amused by eye actions smiles thinly the sort of 
               smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm

                                     hamidou
                              to one of the guards
                         name

                                     guard
                              checking a clipboard
                         vilyum hiyes

                                     hamidou
                              looking at billy 
                              repeating it
                         vilyum hiyes   

               and slowly his hand moves up to caress the edge of his 
               hairless upper lip an erotic gesture in turkey

                                     hamidou
                         vilyum hiyes

               its in my memory locked  he slowly extends his right 
               arm stiff out to his side

               billy watches fascinated

               hamidou lets the arm linger then

               smashes billy across the face with an open palm billy 
               shoots back and smashes against the wall just from the 
               force of one blow  stunned

               hamidou advances taking a wooden club faluka stick about 
               feet three long and three inches wide from a guard

               billy scared emphasizing the words trying to make himself 
               understood

                                     billy
                         it was cold cold i get blanket  
                         blanket cold

               thwack

               billys leg buckles where the faluka stick has just smashed 
               him behind the kneecap he screams going down

               billy looks up from the floor

               hamidou with his club in hand

                                     hamidou
                              in some sort of 
                              english smiles
                         no do no do

               raises the club

               billy tries to block it with his hand and the club smashes 
               his thumb  scream

                                                              sharp cut

               billy is hoisted upsidedown in his underpants only with 
               thick rope tied about his ankles the legs spread  onto a 
               pulley suspended from the ceiling he is yanked upwards 
               then lowered slightly his head and backs of shoulders 
               banging against the stone floor

               the pulley is locked into place  loud sound

               billy has this surprised look on his face still through 
               the tears  whats happening 
                

               hamidou motions the guards out of the room ad lib  turns 
               back to billy raises his club

               brings it down force on the soles of billys bare feet  
               scream  he cocks the club again

               billy twists to avoid the blow

               club catches him on the anklebone

               billy screams louder than ever as we hear the sound of 
               wood on bone  whimpering sounds follow

               billy looking through teary eyes sure now that he is going 
               to be killed the club  off  smacks sole skin with the 
               same force as the first blow no let up

                                                                    cut

               billy still in the same position vomits all over himself

               hamidou spins the pulley to a new position bringing

               billy into a steeper more vertical position  he is on 
               the verge of fainting blearyeyed looking as

               hamidou moves around in between his legs doing something 
               indistinct with the stick between his legs then dropping 
               the stick then with this bizarrely excited expression on 
               his hairless face he begins to undo his own pants but 
               for billy it all blurs out to

               japanese silk screen depicting a fat jovial buddhist monk 
               fishing placidly by a stream then moves to soap carvings 
               of chess pieces then a bedsheet hung as a curtain with 
               astrological symbols paint on it  sound off of a blaring

               guards are on the walls the only guards are unarmed 
               inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the 
               prisoners with whom they intermingle they have raggedy 
               olive green uniforms and worn boots they make 1 a month 
               augmented by bribes  on one side of the yard is a 2story 
               rogus cellblock with barred windows from which billy and 
               his two companions have just emerged  on the other side 
               of the yard is another 2story kogus the childrens kogus

               the courtyard is colorful almost like a bazaar about 8o 
               people in it  groups of exotically dressed africans 
               afghans arabs malaysians europeans and predominantly 
               turks pacing back and forth talking in little circles 
               hawking wares trading illegal currencies

               screaming turkish street urchins 1014 years old share 
               the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising 
               viciousness continually hitting each other and cursing a 
               bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game

               other aspects of the prison which should become evident 
               1 noise  continuous loud radios turkish music 
               screaming shouting  2 cats  all kinds some of them 
               pets some stray tolerated because they kill the rats 3 
               the prisoners all wear their own clothing the foreigners 
               preferring jeans clipclops sneakers sweat suits 4 
               the heads of only the new prisoners are shaved then allowed 
               to grow back 5 many prisoners have physical disabilities 
               carbuncles on the back from wet mattresses boils on the 
               lymph glands around the neck buttocks underarms 
               sometimes so painful the victim walks with his arms up in 
               the air  arthritic in the knees hips ankles fungus on 
               the feet  many limp

               another angle  the prisoners glance at billy as he walks 
               noting the beating he has taken and sizing him up then 
               going on with their business

               he works a gas stove the kids push and punch each other

               ziat leaves the stove in the hands of an assistant and 
               moves down the window to a particularly gaudy afghani a 
               fierce hawkfaced old man with a chunk of his ear missing 
               he wears a colorful flowing robe various scarves turban 
               trinkets rings baggy pants and pointed curved shoes 
               and makes emphatic violent gestures at ziat with his 
               mutilated three fingers  ziat seems to speak something of 
               his language and bargains back

               billy says nothing to them about the ziat incident sizing 
               him up for himself

               the afghani having concluded the deal with ziat reaches 
               deep into his layers of clothing around his crotch and 
               pulls out several scrofulous 10 bills which discreetly 
               takes in exchange for a thick wad of turkish currency his

               billy jerks up from his bunk as he the hears a loud 
               piercing screech off echoing through the kogus  then 
               silence

                                                                    cut

               ziat industrious as always is preparing his tea on the 
               three burners of the small bottled gas stove in the 
               kitchen first floor kogus needless to say the area is 
               filthy with scraps all over the floor cats and two large 
               wooden eating tables occupied by some prisoners the kitchen 
               opens up in background into a washing room with sink it 
               is early morning  muslim chanting off

               three turkish prisoners walk in talking ad lib followed

               ziat calmly pours the tea for the table paying max no 
               attention an excellent actor prominently seated however 
               is a guard 

               max quietly glares at ziat and the guard but says nothing 
               he has been in prison long enough to know how to hold it 
               in

               another angle

               max  silently walks over and gently picks up the corpse 
               in his arms starts to walk out

                         the new american ambassador here 
                         is following your case very closely  
                         he says there is progress but 
                         there is another route that is 
                         quite possible
                              lowers his voice 
                              and leans close
                         for the proper amount of money 
                         it is possible i can convince 
                         certain officials to lose track of 
                         your papers before the high court

                         the lower court in istanbul you 
                         would not exist and you could be 
                         in greece by the time the turkish 
                         courts discovered a stupid clerical 
                         mistakebut i have to act before 
                         the official sentence is handed 
                         down and for that i must pay 
                         certain officials in advance

               billy closes his eyes as yesils voice drones on explaining 
               the details the cast the simplicity of it  fading out

                         more and more but your father 
                         wants to do everything he can and 
                         he is borrowing all he can on the 
                         mortgage of the house  money seems 
                         to be the only way out of there 
                         except of course the other way

               as he translates the judge unable to control his emotion

               three old gleaning women swathed in black like three fates 
               turn from their sweeping as billy is led out courtroom 
               number six down a long stone corridor dust floats through 
               long slanting shafts of yellowish light like a striped 
               leotard dream  billy walks his eyes straight ahead

               bell sings it strumming sloppily but with feeling on his 
               guitar  billy lies his back up on his bunk nearby  
               max stoned sits at the base of the bunk it is night 
               the song falters but max now joins in improvising

               several turks are partying it up down at the other end of 
               the second floor kogus playing a sas  turkish type 
               guitar counterpointed by a little drum the music is 
               stridently turkish and one of the men does a bellydance 
               in underpants with two lemons masquerading as breasts under 
               his shirt the loud twanging of bells guitar can be heard 
               off interrupting them they are annoyed

               bell leading max into the next stanza

                                     song over max and bell

                         hey knock off that shit music

               two turks from the party walk up waving at bells guitar  
               annoyed

                                     turk
                         were playing the sas

                                     bell
                              understanding their

                         put your sas in your cunt

               the two turks tense the mood changing

               bell gets even angrier puts the guitar aside ready to 
               spring

                                     bell

               pants for his shiv

               another angle billy is moving fast between the two turks 
               and bell a new authority in his voice and controlled 
               anger in his face

                                     billy

               billy with maxs little screwdriver and a metal spoon 
               digs hard at the cracks around a dark stone in the sink 
               room first floor kogus  with him is max working on the 
               same stone they are sweating shirtless looking back 
               over their shoulders at

               bell guarding the stairs

               billy works the stucco out jiggling with the stone about 
               a nine inch circumference using his fingers and 
               screwdriver  painful work

                                     billys voice

                         time to find out that its got to 
                         stop somewhere ive learned

                         is only one way out of here the 
                         midnight express

               billy kicks with his sneakers at the stone as silently as 
               possible a loud noise  crumbling dust stucco

               bell at the stairs freezes fearful then silence  he 
               runs over

               max bell billy

                                     max
                              in a whisper
                         were undermining the other stones

               bell studies it pointing to the stone above left the one 
               that has been loosened

                                     bell
                         we gotta take a chance and do that 
                         one next  
                              pointing
                         then pull out this one 
                              pointing to the 
                              one directly left 
                              of the loosened  
                              stone excited

                         loose nit up its soft real soft

               billy has his head pressed close to the loosened stone  
               suddenly

                                     billy
                         its there

                                     billy
                         listen

               another angle  all three press their ears to the stone  
               a silence the faintest whisper of wind and dripping water   
               indicating a shaft of some nature bell looks back at billy

                                     bell
                         i told you i told you you cock
                         suckers  you didnt believe me

               billy smiles max reaches over and grabs bells face between 
               his hands kisses him violently

                                     max

               max now on guard at the stairs looks over at

               bell and billy  with fresh paste putting the finishing 
               touches on the edges of the stone which has been replaced 
               in its original position bells half naked torso reveals 
               a pair of dice with lucky sevens tattooed on his shoulder

                                                                    cut

               the replaced stone on close inspection it is apparent 
               that the stucco around it doesnt match the other stones 
               one bit but as we pull back to see ziat washing his tea 
               cups in the sink during the day this irregularity is lost 
               in the greater mosaic of the wall structure at least ziat 
               doesnt notice as

               billy nervously comes into the sink area watching him 
               and calls to him

                                     billy
                              using turkish

                         money

               billy followed by ziat into the kitchen casts a look of 
               relief at

               bell and max who wait at a table with empty tea cups 
               

                                                                    cut

               a horde of cockroaches stream out from a crack in the stone 
               as billy and max dig scrape jiggle the third stone both 
               covered with sweat working with confidence now

               a dark empty shaft on the other side dripping water  two 
               stones removed

               bell runs over

                         get off our tits

               bell turns to go suddenly a loud crumbling noise and

               a fourth stone starts to go  but brakes itself

               billy max bell all framed in a posture of fear  not 
               daring to move

               second story kogus remains silent

               are clear

               max and billy all three of them look

               the three a half stone space easily big enough for them 
               to squeeze through billy shines a candle in the shaft 
               off

               the three look at each other the same thought eager eyes  
               the train whistles by in the night off

                                     bell

               billy in a sweat slips a tense moment  then he catches 
               himself  off  the train whistle can be heard echoing 
               into the shaftmixed suddenly with loud talking off arguing 
               in turkish  billy freezes signals upwards with a sharp 
               hiss of breath

                                     voice 1 off
                         what do you mean you forgot hell

                         you were supposed to be here at 
                         nine oclock

               billy identifying the relative location of the voices 
               eases downwards coming to a grill looks in at

               a basement room with furnace two turkish guards throw the 
               prison rubbish in the furnace still arguing ad lib

               billy signals upwards

               reverse angle from inside the basement of billy slipping 
               past the grill his face sharply illuminated by the flame 
               of the furnace

               off the walls around the grill we can see the giant 
               silhouettes of the two guards still arguing

               billy comes to the base of the shaft a puddle of scummy 
               water  unstraps the candle a current of wind he peers 
               around

               pov  a winding narrow catacomb with beehive burial 
               places on both sides

               billy sniffing the stench unrolls a ball of thread ties 
               it to a marker and heads in

                                                                    cut

               billy bell and max are in the catacomb a scratchy hideous 
               sound and

               bats fly out squealing from the ceiling

               the boys hit the ground as batwings flap over them 
               colliding against each other knocking off walls 
               screeching then diminishing in sound fewer and fewer 
               then gone

                                     max
                              looking up scared

               a huge spider scatters off as billys candle illuminates

               another endless walkway  billy comes to a stop  
               frustrated

               another maze of walkways the three stop exhausted faces 
               blackened  billy in utter rage and frustration starts 
               kicking the wall

               the shaft billy leads the climbers up

               max reaches a new foothold stops getting his breath  
               looks down at bell heavy breathing off  urging him on

                         tries to figure this one out

               billy cant go on starts to giggle at the thought

                                     billy
                              between giggles

                         tried it

               another angle  the three of them spaced along the shaft 
               are all giggling hysterically echoing hold on them

                                                                    cut

               billy comes through the hole in the stones in the sink 
               area  it is still night  he looks around  silence max 
               follows through the hole

                                                                    cut

               billy and max work fractically to seal up the stones

               bell exhausted is at the stairs guarding distant early 
               morning sounds of prison waking up  we feel they will be 
               spotted this time but

                                                                    cut

               billy slumps into his bunk as the first rays of light come 
               up in the sky and the chant from the mosque commences  he 
               immediately sinks into sleep

               close on old tea leaves being washed in the sink  a milky 
               white eye follows into view  ziat is preparing his early 
               morning tea his good eye now moving to something beyond 
               the tea leaves curious he straightens throwing the 
               withered bunch of leaves the sink

               ziat approaches the irregular stucco paste around the 
               replaced stones runs his fingers along the ridges noticing 
               the paste is fresh

               billy snoring from fatigue  bell wakes him quickly

                                     bell
                         billy wake up  they found it

               off there is a lot of shouting downstairs

                                     billy
                         who

               billy standing in a group of prisoners with bell and max 
               he has a look of total despair on his face as he watches  

               the sink  prisoners are everywhere jabbering excitedly 
               among themselves  ziat is conferring with hamidou as guards 
               rip out the last stone revealing the hole leading to the 
               shaft

               billys gaze shifts to ziat fixing all his hatred on him

               ziat grinning moves away and his falaka stick cocked 
               like a sergeant major  moves among the prisoners

                                     hamidou
                         shut up 

               they all fall immediately silent  hamidou continues his 
               walk among them bypassing

               max who shifts his gaze onto

               billy  hamidou approaches his eyes moving over billy 
               with contempt and shifting him aside with the stick to 
               him billy is the same passive prisoner as before he moves 
               on shifting others aside and then stops at

               bell  hamidou swings his stick up slowly and taps him 
               lightly on the chest bell realizes and is afraid

                                     hamidou
                         no do  no do  i tell you i see 
                         you again finish

               he punctuates this last with a theatrical tap on the chest 
               and he gestures to the guards

                                     hamidou
                         take him

               guards grab him hurry him out the kogus behind hamidou

               billy holds himself rigid trying not to break bells 
               protests continue off

               max unable to contain his anger strides right up to ziat 
               collars him livid

                                     max

                         ziats just doing his job

               ziat glances from billy back to max fixing on him as billy 
               walks him away

                                                                    cut

               max twisting out of the grip of a guard and grabbing the 
               glass from his smashed spectacles he cuts deep into his 
               wrist  guards grab him a loud laugh off carrying over

               billy turning on his bunk to see

               ziat joking with two guards as he enters the second story 
               the guards back down the stairs

               billy already in movement

               ziat in his suit collecting suitcase from his bunk 
               preparing to leave

               into a bunk

               billy fists clenched yells a string of turkish curse 
               words at him

                                     billy

               lunges

               ziat is bulky throws the smaller billy off and scrambles 
               past a bunk

               billy is up and after him jumps back as a shiv cuts the 
               air in front of him his side is cut

               ziat holding the shiv feints cursing billy in turkish

               billy skips back takes a mattress off the bed and runs it 
               right into knocking him and the whole bunk over

               the two scramble around billy tackling him into another 
               bunk which also goes over chairs break

               ziat butts his head into billys jaw

               billy staggers back from the blow and ziat jumps him biting 
               into his ear

               ziat getting a better hold now bites into billys nose

               billy slams ziat in the nose hard with the palm of his 
               hand  ziat relinquishes his hold grabbing at his broken 
               bleeding nose

               billy beats him around the head but though the blood now 
               flows and teeth are broken is like a clumsy bear hard to 
               kill

               ziat scrambles away on his knees under another bunk now 
               screaming as loud as he can

                                     ziat
                         help me  guards  help me

               several prisoners watching from further down the second 
               story kogus now move in sync turning on their radios loud 
               as possible drowning out the cries for help others 
               watching the stairs

               billy takes the bunk and throws it over revealing ziat 
               cowering in pure terror he grabs ziat by the hair hauls 
               him up and

               launches his knee into his face

               ziat thuds onto the floor

               billy stomps him in the gut hard

               ziat screams unnaturally shrill

               billy driven by supernatural anger now jumps on him and 
               clamps his mouth right on ziats open scream

               a struggling kiss ensues

               billy pulls back his mouth filled with blood spitting 
               out

               an unidentified piece of flesh which bits the ground with 
               an odd slow motion grace

               ziat  close in terror throat cords rippling eyes bulging 
               with disbelief body quivering mouth open and screaming 
               but it is a silent scream and the mouth is a dark hole 
               filled with blood and without a tongue

               billy without a moments mercy crashes his fist into 
               ziats face

               ziat his strength now broken collapses on his back

               billy crashes his fist again into the hated face he is 
               grabbed now by a guard but

               another angle  billy shakes the guard off then as another 
               guard runs up billy slams him aside and obsessed lunges 
               back down on ziat and

               both hands clamped together high in the air delivers a 
               final blow to ziats face the bones shatter pause his 
               ogre unconscious beneath him billy now in slow motion 
               extends his arms in the air  in the fighters victory 
               gesture and his eyes glow with the fever in them and 
               with his mouth and face bloodied he looks like a savage 
               no longer billy hayes

                                                              sharp cut

               billy bound in a thick leather belt a kiyis which screws 
               tightly around the waist and cinches the hands together 
               is being hauled in continuing slow motion through a huge 
               door somewhere in one of the cavernous corridors of the 
               prisonthe door is approximately nine feet by six feet 
               strong and wooden with a circular iron handle which one of 
               the guards now pulls open a glimpse of darkness within

               the door closes superimpose

                                     a year later 

               max barely recognizable in a torn sheet and with a 
               blackened face comes rushing into a crowded room screaming 
               louder than any other inmate marks on his face he is 
               enraged blood dripping from scratch attendants in white 
               smocks chase him over the beds max is yelling in turkish

                                     max
                         please will you listen to me  
                         will someone please listen to me  
                         just listen to me

                                     attendants
                         hamidou get hamidou get the 
                         kiyisl

               the attendants wrestle with him but he throws them off 
               tearing around the room mindlessly in the process we see 
               that not much attention is paid him because everybody else 
               is crazy  there are 50 other lunatics yelling at each 
               other in fights over sheets blankets beds cigarettes 
               jumping screaming pushing shoving some babbling to 
               themselves rocking crying chanting singing  several 
               of them the craziest are stark naked some wrapped in 
               torn blackened sheets patrol the room like quick ferrets 
               sharp eyes open for anything they can steal others move 
               in meaningless blankeyed silence the walls are filthy 
               black and join the ceilings in arches rather than angles 
               giving the look of an old dungeon fifty beds are lined up 
               right next to each other so that you walk right into your 
               bed  a constant nerveracking noise 
                
               hamidou bursts into the room the angry look in his eyes 
               spelling real trouble for max move with him as he sweep 
               sin on max and picks him up with one move and smashes him 
               against the wall max hardly notices

               another angle  hamidou takes the leather kiyis from an 
               attendant moves in on max and starts clamping it around 
               him

               an attendant walks through the room with an apron containing 
               several large pockets bulging with red green blue white 
               pills which he distributes by the handful 
               

                                     attendant
                              crying out
                         hop hop  hop  full moon  hop  
                         hop  hop

               the lunatics gobble them up as if they were candy in some 
               of the clustered areas nine lunatics occupy as little as 
               three beds

               max is tightly bound now by hamidou but his body arches 
               against the bindings his neck straining his teeth snapping 
               at the air  hamidou grabs him with one hand by the leather 
               waist hauls him high up in the air and 
                
               throws max halfways across the room max smashing heavily 
               against some beds continuing to scream off as

               the attendant with the pillsnow bypasses billy on one of 
               the beds

                                     attendant
                         hop  hop  full moon  take your 
                         pills

               billy gobbles them up he has changed lines in his face

               no smile no sense of humor a brooding silence about him 
               a straight ahead look he pays no attention to max off he 
               is in grubby white pyjamas and shower sandals rolls back 
               onto hi bed with its filthy torn sheet totally ignoring 
               the surrounding commotion and

               another angle  turning onto his shoulder billy suddenly 
               finds himself face to face with a dark saddened visage 
               the man is very young and stark naked but for an old black 
               rag wrapped around his head and clutched under his chin 
               his eyes are yellow the voice pleading

                                     young man
                         cigare
                              pause same tone 
                              holds out his palm
                         cigare cigare

               billy shakes his head sharply too sharply and barks 
               irritable

                                     billy
                         go away 

               turns on his other shoulder trying to sleep

                                     young man off
                         cigare cigare

               young man in a surprisingly meek tone

                                     young man
                         sil vous plait monsieur sil 
                         vous plait

               billy really aggravated now springs up from the bed and 
               in the quirky way the mad and the eccentric adopt walks 
               determinedly away from the young man looking back to shake 
               his head bizarrely at him one more time

               another angle

               billy walking down the aisle bypasses max int he kiyis 
               rolling on the floor still screaming in turkish

                                     max
                         will you listen to me please listen 
                         to me  

               several lunatics are gathered around tormenting him one 
               of them yanking on his penis as if it were made of rubber 
               another is playing with his ass a third one also in a 
               leather kiyis is leaning over max jabbering and drooling 
               into his face

               max more enraged by this than the other bodily offences 
               lunges up sharply and bites the mans face screams etc

               billy paying no attention except for a brief disinterested 
               glance keeps going into

               a second room  more  lunatics a screaming old man is 
               chasing after another old man who has stolen his tespe 
               beads waving them back at the first old man who howls 
               with rage frantic to have his beads back the second old 
               man throws the beads to a third old man who hops across 
               the beds with the first old man chasing him billy 
               intersects

                                     old man
                              pleading
                         allah  allah  yok  yok  yok  
                         brack

                
               a little nervous man stares into a broken pocket mirror 
               fingering the large round carbuncle under his eye trying 
               to rub it away with little grimaces and flurries of nervous 
               motion

               two attendants in smocks indifferently finish eating on a 
               newspaper spread across one of the beds they shake out 
               the paper

               chicken bones orange peels hitting the floor a flurry of 
               movement as the lunatics scuffle like rats over the left
               overs ad lib curses yells

               an old man obscenely gestures to billy from his bed

                                     old man
                         hey american  fik  fick  come  
                         fik  fik

               his blackened teeth leer

               billy seemingly immune to all of this in some private 
               island of his own madness walks in his determined way 
               past a partition to

               a circular stone staircase leading downwards the stones 
               damp dark slippery billy continues with the same straight
               ahead determination to

               a loner level at last billys expression changes to almost 
               childish relief for here at last is the refuge he seeks 
               the relative comfort and silence of the wheel  

               it is a grim squat pillar dominating the room and bearing 
               the weight of the ceiling and around it some sixty lunatics 
               trudge slowly near silently in counterclockwise flow 
               it is a hypnotic shuffle and billy blends right in sliding 
               easily into the sluggish mindless river his eyes hanging 
               loosely on the floor watching

               the soothing rhythm of feet shuffling at a comforting pace  
               these are the spokes of the wheel

                                                                    cut

               two tiny bare lightbulbs give faint eerie illumination 
               to the chamber one one side a potbellied stove flickers 
               etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange 
               glow

               some lunatics not walking hover around the stove  others 
               are jammed onto a low lshaped wooden platform that runs 
               the length of two walls of these men are naked covered 
               with open running sores over their knees elbows buttocks  
               but they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd they 
               are the lowest order of madmen they have no minds left 
               they are the damned

               billy walks among them expressionless a tall thin 
               cadaverous turk with a grizzled beard now shuffles up 
               alongside billy looks at him walks with him is about 
               fifty his pyjamas relatively clean looking more sane 
               than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his 
               wet hair is matted down on his head and big clumps of it 
               have been pulled out he speaks with a cultured english 
               accent

                                     ahmet
                         youre an american

               billy is interrupted but keeps his eyes on the ground  
               ahmet doesnt wait for an answer

                                     ahmet
                         ah yes america  my name is ahmet  
                         i studied philosophy at harvard 
                         for many many years but actually 
                         oxford is my real alma  mata    
                         ive also studied in vienna now i 
                         study here

               billy doesnt notice shuffles along

                                     ahmet
                         they put me here they say i 
                         raped a little boy i have been 
                         here very long time they will 
                         never let me go

               billy pays no attention keeps shuffling on  glances at 
               him smiles

                                     ahmet
                         they wont let you go either

               the smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep 
               inside billy because billy glances briefly at this lunatic 
               who is smiling billy looks back at his feet

                                     ahmet
                         no theyll never let you go  
                         they tell you they let you go but 
                         you stay you never go from here

               billy plods on grins and tries to explain the situation 
               like a father lecturing a child

                                     ahmet
                         you see we all come from a factory 
                         sometimes the factory makes bad 
                         machines that dont work they put 
                         them here the bad machines dont 
                         know theyre bad machines but the 
                         people at the factory know they 
                         know one of the machines that 
                         doesnt work

               they walk on  ahmets expression changes

                                     ahmet
                              polite

                         today  i say good night to you

               he wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we 
               follow him out of the circle he drops to his hands and 
               knees and with a sense of dignity crawls into the filthy 
               blackness under the lshaped wooden platform disappearing 
               like a cockroach

               billy plods on

                                                                    cut

               an old whitebearded madman the hoja grandiose in his 
               rags leads muslim prayer in the first room some of his 
               followers have prayer mats others a scrap of sheet or 
               newspaper their tones discordant still pushing and shoving 
               at each other during the prayer

               two spastics cant follow the routine of kneeling and 
               bending they tangle up absurdly and fall to the floor in 
               a ball of arms and legs

               a falaka stick pokes billy wake sound of the chanting fills 
               room it is evidently impossible to distinguish night from 
               day because there are no windows

               attendants poke the lunatics awake with their clubs

                                     attendants
                         head count  head count 

                                                                    cut

               a mass of lunatics in the room all at once  attendants 
               take a redundant and comic head count the place sounds 
               like a yadi yadi room the noise fearsome

               another angle

                                     attendant 1
                         sixty two sixty three sixty 
                         four

                                     attendant 2
                         seventy four seventy five seventy 
                         six get back there you    
                         seventy five seventy six

               attendants poke around underneath a bed and pull out a 
               very old trembling vegetable

               other attendants wrap an old dead lunatic with no teeth 
               and foam on his open lips into a dirty sheet and haul him 
               away

               billy amid the lunatics  we move closer and closer to 
               him the head count regressing the room has become a 
               torture cell  the noise louder louder closing in on 
               billy

                                                                    cut

               billy is led down a corridor by hamidou into

               a visiting room  cabins are lined up like narrow wooden 
               phone booths

                                     hamidou
                         kabin onyedi

               billy plods without interest to the specified cabin closes 
               the door sits in the chair no one is there he waits 
               indifferent to any sense of time dirty two glass panes 
               separate visitor and prisoner booths bars are between the 
               panes  an erratic microphone is the method of 
               communication giving a weird and distant aspect to the 
               voice

               hamidou opens a small peephole in the cabin door looks 
               in unseen as

               tee visitor door opens and susan tentatively walks in 
               holding a large photo album it takes several moments for 
               her to react and then her face shows the shock

               billy stares at her his face rabid decaying if he 
               remembers her even he doesnt register it because she is 
               a shock to him as well reality the outside world all at 
               once his mind is spinning unbalanced unable to grasp 
               it

                                     susan off
                         oh my god

               susan 

                                     susan
                         billy what have they done to 
                         youmy god

               the microphone makes her voice jarring gagged she looks 
               silently  no sobbing no big sad looks just shock  shock 
               of recognition shock of time gone by

               billy looking at her his eyes moving down to

               billy pov  susan her neck her breasts straining 
               against the thin shirt

               susan fingers the photo album nervously speaking slow and 
               distinct not sure she is communicating

                                     susan
                         billy your family is fine

               billy is still staring at her breasts he hasnt seen a 
               woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes 
               into his eyes he moves suddenly pressing up against the 
               glass rabid  and in turkish

                                     billy

               his voice is savage demanding

               susan understands startled looks around

                                     susan
                         billy  youll just make yourself

                         take it off take it off
                              suddenly in a very 
                              soft voice
                         sil vous plait

               a strange look in his eye

               susan slowly scared begins to unbutton her shirt

               hamidou looks on silently does nothing

               billy follows every movement with wildeyed lust

               susan leans up close to the window  with both hands on 
               the front of her blouse she slowly draws it apart

               billy going wild against the window his hand down in his 
               pyjamas

               her breasts spring free quivering full and ripe with a 
               deep cleavage and hard dark nipples they hang full and 
               loose  full screen

               billys eyes  full screen

               billy beats on the window working his mouth soundlessly

               susan is shattered scared of billys sanity

                                     susan
                         oh billy billy i wish i could

               tears fear

               billy tightens dramatically and comes right in his pants 
               slumps against the window

               susan realizes he has come surprised

               billy looks at her furtive animal shame and suddenly he 
               starts to cry a flood of feelings locked up too long come 
               pouring out he murmurs some words turkish sounds 
               sputtering out in his throat then

                                     billy
                         s susan

               softly working his mouth finding it hard to speak

               susan yearning tears sprinkling her eyes

                                     susan
                         yes billy

               billy straining not out of physical weakness but an 
               emotional one sputters eyes closed

                                     billy
                         i love you

               it sounds pathetic lost

               susan is worked up to the limit tries to hug him through 
               the window

                                     susan
                         oh billy billy  dont give up

               strength holding it up for him to see through the 
               glassthen remembering herself looks around the room to 
               make sure theyre alone and in a contained voice

                                     susan
                         billy your father gave me this 
                         for you  theres pictures of your 
                         mom and dadrobpeg

               billy looks at it listlessly

               his pvo  susan holding the album open to pictures of 
               his mother and father in front of the house rob on a 
               bicycle peg in her cheerleading outfit

                                     susan

                         of your old mr franklin  remember 
                         him from the bank

               a certain tone slips into her voice

                                     susan
                         hes over in greece now he bought 
                         a ticket

               billy looks from the album to susan possibly there is a 
               gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint 
               an attendant bangs on susans door off

                                     voice
                         visiting is over

               susan quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden 
               weapon

                                     susan
                         ill give it to them for you

               she buttons her blouse but her eyes are worried on billy

                                     susan
                         you were right billy dont count 
                         on them you hear dont count on 
                         anybody but yourself 
                         

               the attendant now swings open her door annoyed

                                     attendant
                         lets go

               susan stands about to go then suddenly leans up close to 
               the bars hard and practical

                                     susan
                              quickly

               pause silence she closes her eyes in pain she doesnt 
               think she has reached him she turns to go resigned

               billy looking at her behind him hamidou opens the door  
               a calm and cunning look on his face glancing with billy 
               towards

               a brief glimpse of susan looking back the album under her 
               arm the door closes

                                                                    cut

               billy with the same deadened expression as before comes 
               down the stairs towards the wheel it is early morning and 
               the walkers havent started yet billy looks at the pillar 
               a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes then he 
               starts walking but in a clockwise motion opposite the 
               normal pattern in the same methodical manner as before

               another angle

               billy on the inner track passes two lunatics who are 
               walking counterclockwise they glare at him motion for 
               him to turn around billy just keeps walking

               billy intersects several more lunatics going counter
               clockwise they motion for him to turn

                                     lunatic
                              grunting
                         gower 

               tries to block billys way but billy shakes his head 
               brushes by him  determined  
               

               ahmet slides up next to billy in his rags

                                     ahmet

                         other way its good  
                         

               more lunatics join the flow gesturing or grunting at billy

               billy stops turns looks at the rest of them slogging in 
               the usual direction looks as if he sees them and he 
               walks out of the wheel towards the stairs

               ahmet curious about his unusual behavior follows billy  

                                     ahmet
                         why you go  why dont you walk 
                         the wheel with us
                              suspiciously leaning 
                              forward suddenly 
                              realizing the answer
                         the bad machine doesnt know hes 
                         a bad machine you still dont 
                         believe it you still dont believe 
                         youre a bad machine

               another angle

               billy stops and turns to look at ahmet at the base of the 
               stairs billy carries on up the stairs

                                     ahmet
                              shakes his head
                         to know oneself is to know god my 
                         friend the factory knows  thats 
                         why they put you here youll see  
                         youll find out later on youll 
                         know

               billy stops and turns to look at ahmet  his eyes glint 
               with special knowledge and he takes ahmet into his 
               confidence using the latters tone of voice

                                     billy
                         i already know i know that youre 
                         a bad machine  thats why the 
                         factory keeps you here
                              lowers s voice
                         you know how i know  i know because 
                         im from the factory i make the 
                         machines im here to spy on you

               eyes narrow surprise fear he shuffles away

               billy looks at him and turns up the stairs

                                                                    cut

               billy in his bed the usual uproar the attendant comes by 
               with the pills offers a handful to billy

                                     attendant
                         hop  hop  take

               he takes them puts a few into his mouth swallows  
               reflective unsure  a radio playing off blares suddenly 
               with the us armed forces station  janis joplin singing 
               take another piece of my heat now baby then its switched 
               back to a turkish station loud billy rises

               billy enters the toilet with the photo album tightly 
               clutched under his arm a dark stone room very shadowy 
               piles of waste on the floor a vacanteyed barefoot lunatic 
               shuffles past billy who goes to one of the four partitioned 
               holes cut into the floor

               another angle  billy squats over it and with his filthy 
               long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the 
               album susan gave him flickering shadows he looks up 
               absently

               three lunatic faces stare in at him through wooden slats 
               tongues hanging out and drooling  playing with themselves  
               off

               billy makes a lunatic face and scream kicking at the 
               partition

                                     billy
                         aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 

               the lunatics petrified scatter off but one lunatic skids 
               in a puddle of urine and crashes onto the tile howling

               billy slits open the binder to reveal ten hundred dollar 
               bills with pictures of mr franklin neatly inserted

               another angle

               billy has no particular expression on his face  reflective 
               staring at the money he looks up

               a large silhouette is moving towards him

               billy just watches transfixed not trying to hide the 
               money

               hamidou comes into a faint light looking down at him 
               glances at the money shakes his head gently

                                     hamidou
                         no do  no do 

               reaches for and

               another angle  hamidou takes the money from billy like 
               candy from a baby then takes him by the ear and slowly 
               lifts him up  billy is like a vegetable in his hands

                                     hamidou
                              in his broken 
                              english
                         i tell you i see gain
                              into turkish
                         i take you down to bath and your 
                         feet be big likebreasts
                              a gesture

               hamidou leads billy roughly out of the lunatic room pulling 
               him by the ear

               hamidou still pulling billy by the ear guides him through 
               the guard quarters

               hamidou leads him up a narrow winding flight of stairs

                                     hamido
                         first you make mistake with ziat 
                         now you make mistake with money  
                         youre not a new prisoner vilyum 
                         hiyes

               the tone of his voice indicates a severe reckoning this 
               time

               hamidou pulls billy by the ear into a large echoing bath

               billy looking bent over by the ear  a hint of awareness 
               of new surroundings

               another angle  the bath is deserted spooky with greenish 
               yellow fish light flittering down from holes in ceiling 
               around damp mossy arches steam rises off a bath  benches 
               buckets of water  hamidou swings billy around until he is 
               facing him 

               hamidou makes an elaborate gesture of putting aside his 
               falaka stick and holstered gun he will use his hands

                                     hamidou
                              shakes his head
                         youve been in prison too long 
                         vilyum hiyes

               he takes that stiff arm all the way back to its full arc 
               and whacks billy up against the wall

               billy bounces back off the wall the print of hamidous 
               fingers is imbedded like a flaring white rainbow in the 
               redness of his left cheek slam   a backhanded whack 
                
               billy bounces right back from the wall steadies him

                                     hamidou
                         you go crazy here vilyum hiyes 
                         many people go crazy here best 
                         thing for crazy people is this

               the blow in slow motion comes sailing into

               billy and we see the brief boxers distortion of all his 
               face as he flies upwards and back into

               the bench smashing it echo like jarring fx

               billy is held up by the pajamas steadied the turkish 
               words seem far away incomprehensible

                                     hamidou off
                         vilyum hiyes you die here hi
                         yes

               whack  another blow but

               hamidou this time holds onto the pajamas using billy like 
               a punching bag

               whack  a reverse blow

               hamidou increasingly excited 

                                     hamidou
                         babba sikijam  i fuck your mother 
                         i fuck your sister

               whack  another blow in slow motion

                                     hamidou
                         i fuck your father i fuck your 
                         brother

               rip  a loud sound as hamidou moves with a blur of speed 
               and shreds billys pajamas with his hands

               billy naked totally passive semiconscious hamidou 
               suddenly shifts position and snaps billy into a strenuous 
               wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor he 
               loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back

               hamidou  sweat pouring off his face excited

                                     hamidou
                         and i fuck your grandmother and 
                         i fuck your pretty girlfriend 
                         and i fuck you hiyes

               a bizarre otherworldly scene this man is dredging billy 
               through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam the 
               sweat and an ethnic identification with a turkish steam 
               bath as a bedroom he loosens his hold abruptly rises 
               moves off as

               billy holds himself on his knees head sunk on his chest 
               gasping for breath about to vomit pause he looks up 
               horrified at 

               hamidou pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor  
               ssssssssss  the awakened steam coils like a snake into 
               every cranny of the little room

               blurred visuals  hamidou stripping his shirt off a huge 
               muscular flash of chest

               a belt being snapped open

               billy waiting

               a figure moving through the steam closer

               billy backing away from it

               steam  a glint of a face coming through  hamidou  his 
               eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun 
               cutting haze then disappear again

               billy pulls back a pause silence cat and mouse  then 
               very suddenly

               a hand reaches out of the steam and grabs billy by the 
               hair  a grunt off

               billy his eyes moving fast

               a flash of a huge darkened penis fully erect cutting 
               forward into the steam like a from drill detached from 
               the rest of the body

               a sound  grotesque and so sudden after the silence it 
               jars the senses a blurred visual then  
                
               billy launching forward in slow motion desperation 
               distorting his features and 
                
               steam  then billys head slams through it in slow motion 
               and

               smashes the penis with its skull a horrifying gasp

               blurred visuals  steam  hamidou staggering close  
               surprise pain

               billy moving

               a foot coming up fast through the steam connecting again 
               with the genitals another scream

               a body hitting the tiles

               billy groping for the falaka stick raises it 
                
               a struggle  two bodies thrashing one of them screaming 
               now in pain a definitive sound then a thwack another 
               thwack  the steam seems to clear and

               billy is on top of the gigantic hamidou smashing him with 
               the falaka stick with all his might 
                
               hamidou is in contortions his nose busted and bleeding

               his hand gripping billy by the neck forcing him back and 
               strangling him at the same time billy is red in the face 
               such is the force of this creature but continues to beat 
               him harder harder  his expression filled with a life 
               energy seeded in hatred that he thought he had lost  
               again again 

                                     billy
                         babba sikijam hamidu  i fuck your 
                         mother i fuck your daughter i 
                         fuck your sons i fuck your wife

               the band slips from his throat then springs up desperately 
               again and clenches billys whole face with one gigantic 
               palm clawing to get in then just as quickly slips away  
               billy beats on  again again

               blood flows fast in agitated swirls into the little pool

                                                                    cut

               billy opens a door gently moves across an empty corridor 
               dressed in and gun in intense hamidous holster large 
               uniform with his he looks shaken weak falaka stick dizzy 
               but

                                     voice off
                         how about a shoe shine friend

               billy starts clenches the falaka stick ready to spring 
               spins

               a little shoeshine boy is his case down the corridor

               billy has not seen a child in a long time get words out 
               then manages surprised  cant get the words out then 
               manages

                                     billy
                         no 

               the kid shrugs moves on looking at billy strangely

               billy goes up a flight of stairs  ahead voices passing  
               he stops goes on

               billy goes through an empty guard quarters

               billy is in another corridor approaches

               a small portal daylight at its edges  locked

               billy tense tries it it swings open on

               daylight

               billy squints  adjusting to the harsh sensation

               an istanbul street  traffic sounds  two guards 
               approaching the portal in the distance drinking soda pop

               billy steps back straightens his clothes steps out briskly 
               and at such an angle that  

               the two guards dont notice him in the traffic  as they 
               enter the open portal

               long shot  billy walking down the street looking back 
               almost bewildered not quiet believing this 

                                                                    cut

               the clerk looks puzzled

               billy is on the other side of the grill  a illfitting 
               new western style suit a hat over his dyed black hair 
               totally paranoid he hasnt slept in three days and the 
               bruises from the hamidou beating now show clearly black 
               and blue on his face his eyes are alert darting around 
               his speech clipped and to the point

                                     billy

               billy moves off a small provincial railroad depot  day  
               he looks at the

               empty tracks  no midnight express

                                                                    cut

               billy tenser than ever uses the occasion of buying a 
               newspaper at an outdoor stand to study

               the main square of the village edirne  day soldiers 
               and police are abundant chattering bustling amid tanks 
               and halftracks  mountains can be seen in the far distance

               billy camouflages his face as best he can in the newspaper 
               hurriyet studying

               cabdrivers in the main square  most of them are older 
               grizzled looking standing next to their old battered dusty 
               cabs talking with stray soldiers billys eyes settle on a 
               younger driver with longish hair possibly an ally

               billy glances down at his newspaper as a soldier intersects 
               and his expression goes stony as he sees

               full color drawing first page of a ridiculously fierce 
               heavymuscled barechested man beating a facsimile of hamidou 
               into the ground  next to it a blurry badly reproduced 
               photograph of billy with a superimposed gun in his hand 
               you cant really tell its him

               billy controlling himself crumples up the newspaper into 
               a baton his eyes everywhere  be the darting a crosses 
               square

               another angle  billy intersecting a policeman who glances 
               at him joins the young cabdriver

                                     billy

                         morning but i was late can you 
                         take me there

               driver looks at him neutral

                                     driver
                         you know where they are

                                     billy
                              anxious to get in

                              impatient
                         about ten kilometers

                                     driver

               billy eyes

                         okay

               the driver noticing billys look at the soldiers gets in 
               the cab

               billy climbs into the back seat feeling already he has 
               made a mistake there is something too alert too hard in 
               this young driver

                                                                    cut

                              pause
                         howd you lose your friends

               billy leaning back in his seat casual

                                     billy
                         oh i drank a lot of raka last 
                         night in istanbul got into a fight

               indicates the bruises on his face

               driver looking at him in the rear view mirror his curiosity 
               narrowing

                                     driver
                         how come you speak turkish so good

               billy casually glances out the window

                                     billy
                         did twenty months in prison in 
                         istanbul  hash

               the driver studies billy in the rearview mirror then

                                     driver
                         you want to score some  cheap

               billy looks at him hard somethings wrong with this man

                                     billy
                              curt
                         no

               cutting off further conversation he looks out at

               the mountains of greece  with longing

               billy stares back at

               the driver whose eyes now move away from the rearview 
               mirror under the pressure of the stare  sound off loud 
               machinery

               billy turning  in rear window we see a turkish halftrack 
               pulling alongside the cab soldiers waving their arms for 
               the cabdriver to get out of the way

               another angle  the halftrack pulls level the cabdriver 
               slows down with a curse

               billy  beads of sweat trickle his brow 

               the personnel carrier disinterested pulls past

               billy breathes heavily with nervous relief

                                                                    cut

               the cab pulls up to the end of a dirt road

               billy has his map out studying it

                                     billy

                              ahead suddenly

               his eyes grow big suddenly as he sees the barrel of 
               hamidous revolver right in his cheek

               billy all business very quiet

                                     billy

               billy firing shots off to distract them has climbed over 
               the front seat jams the cab into gear it stalls again 
               he tries and now shoots off

               the cab roars past the roadblock

               the cops and soldier scattered by the shots now scream 
               at each other they run  shots are fired

               billy guns the cab down the road flying

               clouds of dust trail the cab

               the tank starts to roll after it full speed the halftrack 
               follows the men riding it shouting

               billy looks back then looking ahead sees something

               pov  a speck in the far distance another roadblock

               billy decides then  

               the cab swerves right off the road and jumps into the gently 
               rolling field on the border of the road pock marked with 
               hills

               the turks come roaring down the road pointing to the cab

               low angle  the tank makes a flat out stop gears grinding

               the gun turret swings left

               the cab in the far distance at an angle to the tank starts 
               running up an incline

               the tank fires

               pov  shell blasts wide of the cab 

               billy startled looks back guns for the top of the 
               incline

               closer something heavy shrapnel thuds into the rood of 
               the cab

               billy drives all out

               pov  the incline closer closer about to make it 
               then a blast

               tank pov  the cab spinning in the blast of the adjacent 
               shellburst

               billy shaken but unhurt staggers out of the cab looks

               pov  a wheel blasted away fuel pissing out from the 
               shrapnel holes smashed windshield and fender
