                                                           fade in

     the screen

     stygean darkness

     wet clicking sounds a beam of purplish ultraviolet light
     reveals a mosaic of moving forms cockroaches they skitter
     restlessly under the beams intensity series of shots  the
     uv beam passing over various parts of the space pipe webs
     walls girders  all covered with the insects thousands of
     them

     pull back to reveal

     int sewer system

     innards of steel a vast maze of tunnels

     a group of figures advances through the tunnels with handheld
     uv lamps

     the figures are dressed in gray airtight neoprene suits
     their faces hidden by skin tight masks and buglike night
     vision goggles in the dense silence respirator valves hiss
     click at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm

     the scene has a dreamlike choreographed quality

     nightvision pov

     eerie aquatic green  the horde of insects appear to be some
     kind of sealife crawling over the floor of a dead ocean

     the team of figures

     from their midst appears another figure its neoprene suit a
     flat white  female clearly the team leader

     she carries a stainless steel container filled with twenty
     small compartments each bearing a large heavyshelled roach
     with a different barcode on their back

     judas roaches

     she kneels and opens the

     case

     tchk a dozen of the judas roaches are released  they slide
     through into the area

     the nearby roaches

     react instantaneously  in a rustle of tiny legs they begin
     to stream toward the judases

     jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them

     they even crawl over the team leader in an effort to reach
     the judases  the team leader makes no effort to brush them
     off  patient almost godlike she watches the mating

     later

     a manhole has been opened above chains are dropped down and
     attached by a team member to a 100gallon disposal drum

     reveal the floor of the tunnel carpeted with the still forms
     of the roaches now all dead

     the team members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other
     disposal drums

     at their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre
     the barcoded judas roaches

     in a crunch of machinery the first disposal drum is lifted
     by the chains through the manhole to

     ext a city street  day

     midtown manhattan  a cacophony of sound and light

     dirty snow drifts over bryant park emergency lights blink
     everywhere a wall of cars sits on sixth avenue stopped
     dead exhaust fumes hang in the air jaded traffic cops send
     the cars on crosstown detours

     mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near
     dozens of department of public health vehicles angleparked
     in a military phalanx

     a monumental ribcagelike scaffolding has been erected in the
     middle of the street sealing the area with amber plastic

     inside uniformed workers take the disposal drum of roaches
     and toss it into one of a number of huge dumpsters

     the team leader watches from nearby exhauster  her mask is
     off we see her face enthomologist susan wyeth 28

     an arm gently drapes over her shoulder

                          peter os
                how we doing

     she looks over at dr peter tyler 34 bespectacled  a
     headset around his neck a coat emblazoned with the
     department of health logo  he has the look of a man whos
     just fought a long battle and come out victorious

                          susan
                well see

     he offers her a bite of a pay day candybar  susan smiles
     shakes her head  she wearily leans against him

     peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised
     by mechanical arms into the waiting maw of the dump truck

     the screen darkness

     a voice a somber basrelief in the darkness

                stricklers disease crept into manhattan
                like a thief in the night claiming its
                first hundred victims before it was even
                classified

     int hospital  night  floating shot

     we float through a long hospital ward

     past rows of illuminated oxygen tents pulsating softly in
     the dark like cocoons of light

                          anchorman vo
                most were children under ten

     track past tents  bodies of small children inside wrapped
     in white sheets hooked up to ivs or breathing apparatus
     skeletal hands parched lips glazed eyes

     bellows of respirators push in and out labored failing

     image resolves to a video on a screen

     pull back to reveal a number of screens each with a
     different set of images  we are in a news van   a
     technician and director sit watching

     the voice belongs to an anchorman whos now overimposed

                          anchorman
                only after the numbers had reached into
                the thousands were officials able to
                identify the carrier of the deadly
                infection

                          director
                cut to three

     the technician manipulates the controls  on another screen
     we see them cut to stock news footage regular cockroaches
     crawling on garbage

                tell them were ready for a live feed

     ext outside van  city hall  dusk

     the runner exits the news van  other such vehicles parked
     nearby  a crowd of onlookers reporters and a gaggle of
     protesters with handpainted signs

     gliding past them we pick up sound bites

                          reporter 1
                an insect that has proven virtually
                immune to chemical control

                          protester
                susan has always been opposed to
                biological tampering a real advocate
                for ecological causes its not

     move past them to further inside of the perimeter

     int auditorium  city hall

     a news conference in progress  a packed house  tv
     monitors spaced ever 10 seats or so in the audience the
     mayor of new york and various city officials listening to

     peter speaking at the podium with the ease and enthusiasm of
     a public servant still untainted by bureaucracy

     on a tv monitor

     while peter talks a news title appears at the bottom of the
     screen peter tyler deputy director department of health

                          peter
                     wrapping up
                in nature evolution is a long
                leisurely conversation between an
                organism and its environment we
                however did not have the luxury of
                time

     susan is waiting in the wings she observes the audience

     she notices that the entire front row is composed of children
     who have survived stricklers  leg and arm braces facial
     scarring

     he nods at susan who takes the podium adjusting her jacket
     slightly ill at ease in her business suit  she clears her
     throat speaks softly

                          susan
                with the aid of genetic labs throughout
                the country we recombined cockroach dna
                with genetic information from termites
                and mantids we were able to create a
                biological counteragent  a new ally if
                you will

     she places a clear container on the podium for all to see

                          susan
                blattida traditor

     cu container

     one of the judas roaches skitters about in the container

                          susan os
                the judas roach

     cameras flash  murmurs from the audience

                          susan
                the judas is a noncarrier of stricklers
                with a short lifespan and heightened
                pheromone emission

     on the back row she can see some ecological handpainted
     signs being raised in silent protest she stumbles for a
     second then resumes her speech

                          susan
                the female is basically a sexual magnet
                common males travelled miles and fought
                for the right to mate with them

     the audience is rapt

                          susan
                when they did they took away something
                else we added  a hormone passed
                through sexual congress that causes their
                metabolism to go into overdrive  no
                matter what their food intake they
                starved to death in a matter of hours

     now peter takes the mic

                          peter
                weve achieved almost total eradication
                of the roach population  as of today
                the disease has been officially
                contained

     a standing ovation starts and is carried on as we

                                                            cut to

     two mismatched ceramic cups then heads for the bathroom

                          peter
                taking a cab instead of hiring a limo

                                                        fade in to

     ext alphabet city  night

     the williamsburg bridge dimly visible through the rain

     alphabet city streets

     empty warehouses closed businesses traffic lights blinking
     on empty streets everything seems doomed under the heavy
     layer of rain

     superimpose  two years later

     a dilapidated building before us a blazing neon cross made
     of the words jesus saves hangs askew from its facade

     crane to see the rooftop

     wham the door to the interior stairs flies open and a tall
     thin chinese preacher in his sixties lurches out eyes wild
     with terror

     he looks back down the steps

     somethings climbing up fast casting ominous complex
     shadows on the wall

     too many footsteps for it to be just one person

     the man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home

     trembling he backs away as a booming thud makes the door
     shudder raw frenzied pounding and scratching follows
     something inhuman determined to break through

     the metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges

     on the mans white undershirt a blotch of blood starts to
     grow  needles of rain stab his flesh

     he searches wildly for a possible escape

     he reaches the edge of the roof its five floors down to the
     sidewalk

     two of the hinges on the door come loose pulverizing the
     surrounding concrete

     wham  the door to the stairs bulges outward as something
     smashes against it again and again  frenzied scratching

     the man sprints to the other end of the roof there on the
     adjoining building

     the chinese preachers pov

     just one floor below on the building across the alley is a
     suspended painters platform crowded with paint cans under a
     tarp  a twostory old eyewear advertisement from the 40s is
     being painted over

     the chinese preacher

     looks back to the door  bam a tremendous shattering sound
     light spills from inside two bolts fly in the air a hinge
     gives

     he cries out in terror

     the man gauges the distance between buildings can he make
     it

     he takes a few steps back a few more

     panting hard he closes his eyes his chest soaked in blood
     and rain

     the door explodes outward and skids across the slippery roof

     light from inside projects the shadow of wild busy things
     onto the curtain of rain

     weeping with fear the man desperately tries to hurl himself
     to the catwalk

     its too far

     he fallscrash  he hits the platform knocking boards
     loose and sending paint cans onto their sides rolling  he
     bounces slides off the edge barely able to grab onto a
     loose board to save himself from falling

     the rain blasts down  the scaffold creaks  he hits the
     edge upsetting the cans of paint there

     he holds onto the planks with all his might trying to push
     with his feet but they slide on the wet wall

     below

     cans bounce off the pavement white pain blasts all over

     cu hands

     the mans hands slip on the planks tiring

     feet

     the chinese preachers feet bicycle in the air unable to
     find a purchase on the wet brick wall

     the chinese preacher

     is hanging just in front of the painted eye of the forties
     model  he looks up above him sees something

                          chinese preacher
                no  please god no

     a shadow crosses his face as something looms above him
     suddenly there is a crack and the platform tilts completely
     on one end

     hands

     the chinese preachers fingernails dig in then slip on the
     wet wood

     his hands paw the air

     wider

     for a moment his body silhouetted in the rain seems
     suspended in a void then he falls backwards

     the ground

     impact his body cracks the pavement

     small pools of rain form on his dead open eyes

     we crane to reveal

     a window on a building across the street

     chuy a young latino boy he stares out the window at the
     chinese preachers body with no discernable emotion

     he works a small wire sculpture in his hands

     apartment

     its a small onebedroom apartment

     an old man sleeps peacefully on a cot chuys grandfather
     manny gaviola mid 60s white hair haloes his handsome
     benign face

     all around him shoes shoes everywhere you look on the
     table on the chairs on the kitchen counter on the floor

     a small altar is illuminated by votive candles next to it
     standing by the window is

     chuy

     his pov

     we see a blurry vision of the chinese preachers splayed
     figure in a swirl of color

     chuys attention focuses on the preachers shoes

     chuy

                          chuy
                     a whisper
                oxfords 8 12 black

     he looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the
     wire into shape

     the puddle of paint

     around the preacher reflects large shadows moving above
     and across the neon sign

     chuy

     hears a strange sound a rhythmic clicking

     his head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to
     changethere is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in
     his eyes

     across the rooftop

     we are behind whatever it is that has captured chuys
     attention

     ticketytacketytock

     the strange clicking sound grows louder  the figure begins
     moving in some weird preparatory fashion then it steps
     forward and drops out of frame

     chuy

     his eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow
     arc

     chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get
     a better view

     ground level

     the chinese preachers body is now being dragged toward the
     rear of the alley leaving colored paint smears in its wake

     chuy

     we isolate the boys face and on the soundtrack every other
     noise fades away

     chuy reaches for a pair of spoons nearby

     he begins to click them together

     imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago

     the chinese preacher

     is being pulled into a small groundlevel vent the only
     problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through
     this hole

     chuy

     watches still clicking with his spoons

     the chinese preachers body

     is stuck one of his legs is through the hole up to the
     thigh but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing
     against the wall next to the vent impossible

     there is a silent beat and then a series of incredibly
     violent tugs bam bam bam shaking the paintsoaked body
     like a rag doll

     chuy

     his spoons stop his jaw tightens a little as we hear
     terrible cracking and scraping sounds

     the window

     the chinese preachers head and hands disappear into the
     hole bits of clothing paint and blood stick to the edges of

     peter is covered in sweat running at a good clip around the
     central park reservoir a beautiful day dawns behind him the
     windows of the beresford sparkle in the morning sun

     peter outperforms most of the other runners in the track his
     steady rhythm evidence of years of practice keeping his
     stride he runs off the track and past a flock of old nuns

                          peter

     without slowing down peter retakes the path and moves past

     peter finally slows down he checks his pulse and stops at a
     water fountain

     as he drinks he sees a derelict drawing a figure on the
     sidewalk

     the derelict spots peter  he picks up his chalk drifts off

     intrigued peter goes closer to the drawing an arrow points
     to a manhole cover set among the bushes

     peter circles around trying to make sense out of the lines

     then the painted motif finally reveals itself

     graffiti

     a talismanic figure of raw archetypal power a few jagged
     lines form the shape of a man in an overcoat his face is
     little more than a malignant blotch

     an overhead door is opened daylight streams in peter spots
     yang an asian cop talking to a chinese woman lying on a
     stretcher which hasnt been moved yet  she is holloweyed
     near death  her hand weakly hangs on to the cop as if for
     dear life

                          peter
                tell her shes going to be alright
                well take care of her

     peter kneels next to her looking at her and nodding while
     yang translates the woman mutters again tears of fear in
     her eyes  yang shakes his head

                          yang
                shes delirious  keeps saying the dark
                angels are coming for her she says

                probably a gang  chinese people man
                they come up with some wacky stuff

     they pull the stretcher out through the open overhead door
     and into an

     alley

     the stretcher is rolled into a waiting vehicle its lights
     flashing unseen by them on a brick wall nearly buried by
     graffiti is a crude drawing

     it is of the same odd figure peter saw drawn earlier  the
     overcoat man

     int lab  night  montage

     susan and siri both wearing walkman headsets deftly mount
     butterflies and other insects onto display boards for the
     exhibit rain is blowing in through the halfopen window

     their movements are precise and lyrical the colors and
     designs of the insects are beautiful

     we understand how you can get lost in this world  susan
     works steadily a partiallyeaten payday bar and the
     wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner

     a pager goes off in susans lab coat

     she takes off her headset classical music leaks from her
     headphones

     on the pagers lcd screen the message reads late
     tonight pete

     susan puts the pager down goes to close the window

     there is a loud angry buzzing sound

                          susan
                siri
                     louder
                siri

     siri pulls her headset off heavy metal music leaks from her
     headphones

     the buzzing sound again we pan across the various bugs and
     mounting implements till we come to rest

     on the shoebox the boys gave susan something rattles
     wildly inside

                          siri
                the fuck

     susan crosses to the trash bin picks the box out it
     vibrates on her hand then becomes quiet something moves
     inside

     she slowly opens the lid

     the bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded
     newspaper crumbs of bread and some ricekrispies can be
     spotted here and there a kids idea of a comfy critters
     nest she moves her free hand closer

                          susan
                     to siri
                can you

     suddenly and insect big as her hand springs out of the
     shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her minute
     pieces of paper fly through the air

     susan slaps the lid back down

                          susan
                     a scared whisper
                could youhelp me

                                                            cut to

     later

     siri comes over as susan grabs steel tongs and a cork
     dissecting board

                          susan
                im gonna pull it out and i want you to
                pin it down okay

                          siri
                what is it

                          susan
                i have no idea  are you ready

     siri nods pins in hand  susan opens the lid and grabs the
     nymph with the tongs  the creature goes berserk flailing
     its spindly limbs buzzing and croaking a milky substance
     foaming out of its body

                          siri
                oh my god

     susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard

     siri tries to get a hold of it but it twists out of the
     tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand a spider
     trapping a sparrow

                          siri
                shit get it  get it

     snap  it bites her hand between index and forefinger

     susan pins the insect into the corkboard it spins furiously
     like a crazy lp record

     susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs  siri uses more
     pins to secure it down

                          susan
                     noticing siris hand
                it bit you

                          siri
                no shit

     susan

     leans to get a closer look at the nymph deep dark brown
     flat as a pancake one rear leg broken lower tail smashed

     it squirms helplessly now looking pitiful under the harsh
     overhead light

                          susan
                this wing configuration ive
                never

                          siri
                     looking at her injury
                fuck it broke the skin

                          susan
                and theyre not fully developed  this
                things not even an adult

     the nymph continues to hiss and foam struggling against the
     steel pins susan looks closely at the insects belly

                          susan
                my god

                          siri
                what

     susan gestures to look  siri stares down at

     the nymphs torso

     where a set of valves on its underside click in and out

                          susan os
                its breathing

     siri

     shakes her head

                          siri
                thats impossible  insects dont

                          susan
                i know
                     picks up a scalpel
                help me get a sample

     susan touches her scalpel to the nymphs leg

     the nymph clicks nervously

                          susan
                hold on big guy hold on

     she traps the nymph down and cuts the leg off

     a painful agonized buzz echoes around the room

                                                            cut to

     monitor

     susan attaches the insects leg to a samll holder it is
     frozen in a swirl of dry ice

     the brittle leg is then mounted in a laser microtome bit by
     bit the machine executes microscopic wafer cuts siri is
     making slides out of each section

     a series of microphotographic images flash onto the screen
     in the background we hear the highpitched buzz

     we see the lights from the mounting room through a glass
     brick wall

     int mounting room  night

     we see the nymph slowly squirming in the fg then rack focus
     to the rainspattered window

     suddenly the overcoat man is standing on the windowsill

     the window is lifted effortlesly from the outside

     susan

     prepares a blue solution and places two drops on each smear
     slide

     reflected in the glass brick behind her we see the man moving
     across the room

     the overcoat man

     seen only through rippled glass and reflections moves
     through the lab

     his body steams lightly from the rain his movements are
     quirky spastic

     the man observes the imprisoned insects with curiosity

     he comes to the nymph pinned and mutilated on the worktable
     the nymph clicks and chitters excitedly as if communicating
     with the man

     he looks up at the worklight  it seems to bother him

     whump in a blur of motion he smashes the light bulb

     susan

     watches the smear slide  the blue droplets begin to change
     color once in contact with the leg section

                          susan
                hold on a second

     slowly turning a deep green

                          siri
                what

     then three large beetles fly into the room

     siri looks at susan susan gets up hesitant signals for
     siri to stay

     we follow susan into the mounting room

     susans pov

     she walks in barely able to see her hand in front of her
     face

     the window facing the street is wide open rain blowing in

     something crunches under her feet  she bends down looks

     shes stepped on the broken glass of the lightbulb

     the floor is alive with various insects  crawling hopping
     flying away from their displays which have been opened

     the nymph is gone from the board

     she looks under the work table the nymph was on

     we lower as we track back with her  something is folded up
     in the corner of the ceiling behind her camouflaged in the
     shadows clinging impossibly to the wall

     the overcoat man

     he lowers himself with silent grace

     susan whirls

     whoosh a gust of wind a fluttering shadow off the window

     silence

                          siri os
                susan

     susan gasps startled  we shift to see siri at the door

                          susan
                call security

     int laundry room

     peter comes in to find susan sitting in a chair before a
     dryer quietly watching laundry whirl within

                          peter
                     regarding the laundry
                thought it was my week for that

                          susan
                     shrugs
                i needed to think it was either this
                or the weather channel

     peter walks over kisses her  he notices an open book of
     insect morphology on her lap theres a full color
     photograph of an ootheca  an insect eggcase

     int laundry room  later

     peter folds laundry into hisher piles  susan paces

                this thing was the size of my fist
                peter thats off the charts

                          peter
                okay so you lost a great specimen

                          susan
                dont you get it its more than
                that

     peter takes a bedsheet susan helps him fold it

                          susan
                you know why insects dont grow larger
                because they dont have a complex
                respiratory system what i saw did it
                had lungs

     peter walks backward with his end of the sheet  the two
     begin to fold it together

                          susan
                evolution doesnt work that fast
                something pushed that thing to take the
                leap we need to find another specimen

                          peter
                we

     as they fold the sheet they move closer together

                          susan
                i did a ph test on its tarsal pads

     the folding of the sheet has brought them almost face to
     face susan finishes folding herself

                          susan
                theres only two species who match the
                enzymes i found  ones a leafcutter ant

                metaxonycha godmani

                          peter
                so

     susan looks around  just ahead is an empty lot surrounded by
     a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and
     performance artists

     an identical butterfly perches on the edge of a board

     ext empty lot

     susan and peter walk through waisthigh grass of a small
     urban wilderness  dozens of butterflies flutter around them
     from the weeds

                          ricky os
                if you want your money back forget it

     peter and susan look up  the voice comes from a ramshackle
     clubhouse built of wood scraps and cardboard

                          davis os
                we already spent it

     susan walks forward

     long beat  the door to the clubhouse swings open

                                                            cut to

     int subway station  day

     a blur of subway cars goes by with an earpulverizing sound

     at the end of the platform davis untwists a wire around the
     busted lock of a locker room door peter paces nervously
     nearby

                          peter
                here let me

     he starts on it himself meanwhile ricky stares at a
     photograph susan has given to him  a ribbed tortoise
     brown colored eggcase

                          susan
                you sure you didnt see one of these

                          ricky

                          ricky
                     shakes his head
                no way i see one of those id puke

     davis opens the door with a click

     int subway locker room

     a dark abandoned locker room once used for transit workers

     susan and peter walk in with the boys nervous in the off
     limits area

                          davis
                it was in that corner over there

     davis points to a bank of dented metal lockers

                          ricky
                sucker was fast man
                     picks up a pipe

     peter hands ricky some money the boy looksdown at it
     slyly

                youre here

     peter regards the little scam artist dryly

                lets keep it at five and i wont
                condemn your clubhouse

     peter hands him a couple of dollars more the two boys
     take off

     peter removes a penlight from his pocket

     dust covers everything a forest of copper tubing and pipes
     where the sinks used to be

     peter

     inspects the floor its littered with cheap objects
     chipped combs used rubbers soggy newspapers smeared
     heroin syringes

     something shiny catches his eye he picks it up

                          peter
                     quietly
                look a broken tooth

     something rustles nearby

     he notices an old rotting poster on the back wall  it
     seems oddly textured somehow  he walks toward it

     susan

     kneeling pushes aside a dented trash bin behind it there
     is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors

     a subway train rumbles by outside the sound echoes off
     the tile walls

     susan forces the door back she peeks through the opening

     her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror
     she starts pulling something out

     peter

     at the oddly texture wall  he shines the penlight at it

     and is met with a flutter of wings  moths perfectly
     camouflaged against the poster on the wall whiz past him

     peter recoils

                          susan os
                you okay

     he nods

     susan

     turns back to her locker  she withdraws a cheap plastic
     necklace from it  as she removes it it breaks  a coulpe of
     beads fall away

     rolls under the locker

     and bounce  once twice thrice  each time going
     deeper till they comes to a stop

     susan peers where the beads fell

                          susan
                theres something under here

     peter comes over kneels by her susan takes a handful of
     beads and throws them at the base of the locker

     camera tracks to follow one of them it rolls all the way
     under

     a moment later from some interior space the sound of it
     bouncing on cement he shines his light inside

     int hole  peters hand

     very dark a highlight glints off a shelllike surface

     the light barely touches it

     the whole surface backs away

     peter drops the penlight  it gets stuck in a jutting piece
     of concrete

     peter

                          peter
                shit

     peter tries to get his hand in

     deeper

     but he cannot reach the light it is literally inches from
     his fingers

     susan

                          susan
                let me try  my hands are smaller

     she kneels and goes for it

     int hole  susans hand

     her hand reaches for the penlight

     she barely touches it  the penlight spins around  its light
     now illuminates

     the face of a man  unseen by susan  terrifying in its doll
     like simplicity  in the darkness its features seem
     indiscernable inert almost frozen in a perfectly
     symmetrical pattern

     it regards the spiderlike movement of susans fingers

     susans

     face squinches with the effort

                          peter
                honey just leave it

                          susan
                no theres

     int hole  susans hand

     as susans hand moves closer the strange face begins to
     tremble

     a clicking sound

     susans hand is almost there

     susan

     reaches further

     and suddenly a beam of light cuts through the darkness

     their vision resolves the figures of two mta cops stand
     before them  ernest 50 burly and bullnecked and leonard
      african american 45 more formidable than fat

                          leonard
                     wearily
                now dont tell me

     int hole

     susans hand withdraws

                          leonard os

                                                            cut to

     int subway platform  later

     shhshhshh  a felt rag is expertly being pulled across a
     set of pristine black shoes

     reveal leonard sitting like a king in a chair getting his
     shoes shined by manny  he leans back laconically while
     arguing with peter ernest examines the ootheca picture

                          peter
                look i showed you my badge

                around my turf

                supervisor

                          leonard
                please do  hes a lonely guy

     uninterested leonard looks over to susan and chuy

     angle on susan

     she leans against the wall inspects her dirty hand ernest
     gives her his handkerchief

                          chuy os
                gucci  flat pump

     she looks down at chuy who sits nearby holding a pair of
     spoons

                          ernest
                your shoes

     she stares down at her shoes  gucci flat pumps all right
     susan smiles

     just then a subway train pulls up  the doors open
     disgorging passengers chuy flips into action  he starts
     playing his spoons clicking them together slapping them
     against his knee

     susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons
     to imitate the different rhythmical step patterns of the
     various commuters the rolling comical gait of a fat man
     the lithe haughty step of a prim lady

                          susan
                     laughs  to chuy
                thats wonderful  what grade are you in

     chuy doesnt answer

                          ernest
                no school shoesre all chuy knows about

     ernest discreetly points to his forehead

                          manny
                     immediately
                hes special

                          leonard
                he can imitate anything you just watch
                him

                          peter
                     irritably to leonard
                excuse me im talking to you

                          leonard
                no you talkin at me

     leonard hands manny a 500 bill for the shine gets up and
     walks past peter as if he were invisible

                          ernest
                     discreetly to susan
                is there some reward for this

                          susan
                i guess that could be arranged

     ernest smiles pockets the ootheca picture

                          peter
                for chrissakes  you gonna lay a two
                bit bureaucratic territorial number
                on me

                best come back with the proper permits
                and the right attitude

     leonard saunters away with ernest in tow

     peter shakes his head angrily  he takes susan by the arm
     heads off in another direction

     chuy without watching clicks his spoons to the imitation of
     their steps

     int subway stairs  day

     susan and peter walk up the stairs peter still fumes

                          peter
                you give someone a fucking uniform
                and did you hear how he talked to us

                          susan
                i heard how you talked to him

                          peter
                oh so im the bad guy now

     susan spares him an ironic look

                          susan
                he was just doing his job

                          peter
                fine then im the bad guy jesus

     at the top of the stairs theyre completely engulfed by
     sunlight

                          peter
                he wants a permit ill get him a
                permit

                                                            cut to

     int subway tracks  dusk

     a train blurs by

     a flashlight beam over dirty gravel  tilt with the beam to
     see ernest walking his beat past tracks and girders  hulking
     outofservice subway cars surround him he shines his light
     on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls

     a sound catches his attention  a rustling

     he notices something off to a corner walks over to it

     a shiny brown lump in the corner covered in garbage

     he touches the lump with his shoe  it stirs slightly

     he touches it again

     and a pair of legs suddenly lash out kicking at him
     reflexively

     ernest jumps back

     another set of legs emerges

     oddly enough ernest relaxes

                          ernest
                chrissakes

     he grabs the surface of the lump and pulls it  we see that
     it was just a shiny brown tarp

     underneath a group of three homeless people  emaciated
     toothless  sleeping intertwined for warmth in the dim
     light they almost seem like a single organism

                          ernest
                guys cmon

     the homeless people stare back at him mutely  ernest starts
     getting annoyed

                          ernest
                i told you to stick by the maintenance
                area

                          bag lady
                nah its private property now

     ernest looks at her confused

                          skeletal bum
                he eats down there

                          ernest
                who

                          homeless man
                the stickman

                          bag lady
                long john

     the homeless man points  ernest turns his light

     another silhouette of the overcoat man drawn on the wall an
     arrow below it points east

                          ernest
                graffiti artist uh
                     to homeless people
                look guys just get off my beat you
                hear  get moving

     ernest hustles them out  the homeless people glare at him
     pick up their things and head into the gloom

     ernest watches them go  he turns back to the graffiti
     painting of the stickman

                                                       dissolve to

     int subway tunnel  later

     ernest walks deeper into the tunnels dusklight slants in
     weakly from grates above

     he stops as a rumble is heard ahead of him  he ducks into a
     recess in the wall  the rumble grows louder louder

     a subway train curves around the bend up ahead its
     headlights raking the opposite wall to reveal

     a figure crouched over something

     we hear chomping and swallowing sounds

     cu ernest

     squinting to see over his flashlight beam

                          ernest
                hey buddy

     no answer  just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and
     ingested  ernest is revolted

                          ernest
                get off my track

     the crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a
     unusually quick blur of motion  its the overcoat man

     another distant rumble ernests clothes flutter in the puff
     of hot wind that signals an approaching train

     ernest pulls a can of mace from his belt begins to advance

     the overcoat man stands up

     ernest stops in his tracks

     for he sees that the overcoat man is holding a large object
     in his arms something wet and shiny with blood

     a dead dog

     the overcoat man drops the animal  it rolls slowly down his
     chest

     and is briefly caught by another set of arms extending
     from his torso

                          ernest
                sweet jesus

     the overcoat man lets the animal fall to the ground  he
     begins walking toward ernest

     ernest backs away

     the overcoat man leaps on him just as the subway train roars
     past

     crack ernests body is twisted and crunched by powerful
     arms

     through the strobing windows we see ernest enveloped by the
     dark figure then raised above taken away

     track

     the can of mace rolls next to the track as the train clears

     the track is empty again

                                                            cut to

     int exhibition hall  banner

     we pan across the banner  architects of nature

     int exhibition floor

     exhibits under glass set up throughout the room insect
     chambers and vaults of great complexity etc

     an opening night crowd of affluent museum patrons  all
     tuxedoes and painted smiles  some peremptorily peruse the
     displays most just camp out at the buffet table

     peter enters dressed in his worksuit  he scans the
     room sees siri leaning against a wall by the buffet
     table drinking an orange juice  he goes over to her

                          peter
                heya
                     kisses her on the cheek

     siri gestures to the far end of the room  susan stands
     alone sipping a chardonnay by an ant mound exhibit

                          siri
                ant mound

     peter notices siri seems unusually weary she covers one
     of her eyes

                          peter
                you okay

                          siri

                use a good word right now

     she nods for him to go ahead  peter leaves

     siri closes her eyes  she rubs the bandage around the
     insect bite on her hand

     peter

     approaches susan  shes staring through thr glass panes
     of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons  in the
     refraction their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem
     to blend into one another

                          peter
                great crowd

                          susan

     she looks over at the crowd congregated around the
     buffet table

                          susan
                i get the feeling they came more for
                the potroast than the apterids

     revealed quite literally is a world of shit

     large feces scattered everywhere  on the floor hanging
     sausagelike from the ceiling  one can almost taste the
     stench of old ammonia

     its raining like hell manny approaches the abandoned
     flophouse

     he peeks through the boardedup front entrance right there
     on the dusty lobby floor clearer than the larger
     shoeprints

     he discovers a trail of tiny barefoot prints

                          manny

     he kicks experimentally at the planks but theyre far too
     strong

     alley

     manny explores the opposite face of the building looking for
     a way in

     a dog is barking incessantly manny turns

     something moves in the shadows  something long and thin
     haloed  by the rain

     it moves again the streetlight touching it for a fleeting
     moment as it totters around to the rear of the building
     its the overcoat man

     the man hurries past manny sprints after him

     alleys

     manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates

     there is the overcoat man

     cargo workers mill around a group of vegetable trucks
     unloading produce

     the overcoat man attracts no attention keeping his head
     down staying near the shadowed buildings jumping and
     hopping he skitters into an alley

     following

     manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure he
     pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue
     once it takes effect he moves on

     the overcoat man has moved past a chainlink fence how
     its too high

     the old man squeezes through a jagged opening the metal
     fabric cuts his shirt

     on the other side a dead end nowhere to go except
     for

     a sewage grate

     manny lifts it

     sewage pipe

     manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty he
     flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor

     this pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt
     something moves under a wet newspaper a thick mass of long
     legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor

     suddenlythe distant sound of spoons playing

                          manny
                chuy

     manny pulls a rosary from his pocket wraps it around
     his wrist and crosses himself with the razor

     then begins to move down the pipe

     susan examines the polaroids  she pulls out a payday bar

     the crew of repairmen are leaving

                hey lady all power will be down in
                five minutes okay

                          susan
                okay

     she munches on the bar she stops one snapshot has caught
     her attention  the fridge light illuminated this photograph

     susan turns it around and around trying to find
     something different in the lines

     a train roars by

     then she notices it

     the polaroid

     the closed jaws they look like a human face

     susan

     gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room

     a whole row of lamps goes off the rest flickers in and
     out

     then we see now standing on her platform the overcoat man
     he looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon
     lights

     susan tries the locker room door its unlocked

     int locker room  susan

     carefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers

     she kneels to examine the hole in the wall  she nears a
     noise

     the overcoat man is moving toward her

                peter

     overcoat man

     the mans face tips back

     raising the complex glittering insect head from behind
     its masklike front jaws

     its multiparted mouth clicks open

     susan screams

     the thing charges its coat opening to revealsix
     leathery wings fully extended the wingspan blocks the
     whole tunnel they vibrate rapidly

     susan tries to run but the creature  hereafter known
     simply as the mimic  leaps onto her chest

     shes dragged screaming into the hole

     their silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs
     wings and pipes

     peter and josh put the fecal samples into the backpack

     leonard stands at the other end of the area he inspects some
     old scaffolding set up at an opening which leads to

     the remains of an old station

     fifteen feet below

                          leonard
                ive never been this deep this area
                here is the old armory station they
                built it in the 40s ran out of money
                halfway through

     its like grand centrals dead little brother tiled mosaic
     walls columns monumental arches spaces for shops a group
     of abandoned turnofthecentury subway cars on parallel
     tracks

                          leonard
                okay the fat ladys singing time to go

                i want a team in here by six tonight
                hands and knees with toothpicks

     leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding

     a nymph  big as the one seen earlier  emerges from a pile
     of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound

     keeping his eyes fixed on the insect leonard coolly bends
     down picks up a rock

     peter

     putting the last sample boxes into the backpack looks up
     and sees

     leonard

     step onto the scaffolding raising the rock to crush the
     nymph

                          peter
                dont

     smash leonard tosses the rock at the insect crushing it

     peter rushes to the insects corpse on the scaffolding

                          leonard
                did you see the size of that thing

                          peter
                look what you did you stupid sonofa

     a creak from the scaffolding at their combined weight

     leonard grabs peter tries to pull him from the scaffolding

     creeeeaaaaak

     the entire scaffolding gives way

     buckling diagonally

     taking peter and leonard with it

     crash  both peter and leonard are thrown to the ground of
     the station below  the scaffolding falls around them

     josh

     rushes forward

     its been broken in the fall a tangle of plastic and wires

     peter checks the wall for a handhold  but theres only
     smooth tile and dust

     food old newspapers plastic garbage bags  an inch of brown
     water burbles past her bloody head

     something jostles her rocking her back and forth

     her eyelids slowly open

     a huge mimic is perched on her body

     its wingcase is drooped around her like a shroud the
     creature furiously tears at her jacket trying to get at
     susans beeper

     the beeper spills from her pocket along with several pay day
     bars  the mimic crushes the machine instantly then chomps
     up all the candy bars with a single move of its mandibles

     susan watches in terror as the creature steps away

     a sound from an adjacent tunnel  susan looks

     and sees another mimic pulling the remains of a man into
     the darkness

     susan gropes around her in the soggy debris looking for some
     weapon

     susans hand

     her fingers close around a threefoot piece of rusty pipe

     something dark drips on her hand

     susan

     looks up above her a badly decomposing human foot or what
     is left of it  all part of the excarnated corpse of the
     chinese preacher  his gold cross shines boldly in the dark

     susan gasps

     the mimic

     hears the sound  it immediately skitters back to her

     susan

     jerks herself sideways

     and stabs the pipe into the mimics thorax with a wet crrk

     susan heaves herself up pushing the thing onto its back

     the mimic buzzes furiously milky white foam pumping from the
     wound  its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself

     susan runs for the tunnels debris falling from her clothing

     susan

     looks around frantically  she crosses to a metal lid on the
     floor lifts it

     a hole is below dropping off into darkness

     the mimics clanging grows louder

     susan sits herself on the edge of the hole grasping the
     metal lid by handles on its underside

     the mimic rushes into the chamber speeding toward her

     susan jumps into the hole hanging onto the lid

     whang  the lid slams shut over the hole a fraction of a
     second before the creature reaches it

     the mimic touches the lid with its antennae confused

     josh cautiously enters a vaulted area  old pipes have been
     ripped from the walls  water gushes over the steelplated
     walls  he looks around this doesnt seem familiar

     josh freezes as he sees something behind a loose metal plate
     on the wall

     he yanks at the plate it gives a little bit he yanks
     harder the plate falls down on one side hanging
     precariously from a loose bolt

     it reveals a hole packed with dozens and dozens of oothecas

     he leans close to examine them there is a noise in the
     tunnel behind him

     joshs pov  waterfall

     a curtain of water falls over the side of a pipe onto the
     floor  behind it something enormous crawls into view
     multiple legs antennae an elongated body distorted by the
     water and the light of a flare  it stops

     josh

     holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways never taking his
     eyes off the thing josh begins to move away  he sees a
     narrow opening in the wall there seems to be dim light
     coming from something beyond it  he tries to squeeze through
     the opening

     mimic

     the creature is immobile behind the sheet of water as if
     mesmerized by its flow

     pit  josh

     with tremendous effort josh passes through the opening

     he finds himself inside a bowlshaped mud hole  scattered
     around him he sees funny bunny patches that were sewn in the
     sweatshop  he trips on a halfburied sewing machine  he
     looks up

     above him is a grate  hes come to the shower room of the
     sweatshop

     int sweatshop shower room

     empty now except for the rusting sewing machines in a
     corner  we tilt to see josh moving the grate away  he
     jumps no way he can grab onto the slippery tile

     his hands slide

     pit

     josh puts the old sewing machine upright

     outside

     suddenly the bolt hinging the plate gives way and the
     steel plate hits the ground klangg

     the mimic

     leaps into action

     pit  josh

     hears the clicking fairly close  he shines his light back
     down the hole he entered through

     joshs pov  the mimic

     moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed

     josh

                          josh
                oh shit oh shit oh shit

     he stands on top of the sewing machine wobbling reaches for
     the floor above

     sweatshop shower room

     joshs head and one shoulder are in through the hole  his
     arms tremble he makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab
     the power cord of one of the abandoned sewing machines

     the mimic

     rushes through the opening without even slowing down

     josh

     pulls himself up up  wham  the mimic hits the lower part
     of his body blood spraying up through the hole  he screams
     grasps the cord with both hands

     he is brutally yanked down into the hole the sewing machine
     tipping then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges
     violently in the hole

     we track over to reveal one of chuys perfectly
     executed wire sculptures sitting atop another sewing
     machine

                                                            cut to

     int remains of the subway station

     a ring of flares burns in the darkness like an island  peter
     lights another one revealing a space buried in layers of
     dust and time

     cracked mannequin faces stares out from an unopened tailor
     shop  a flower parlor decorated with cobwebs  a yellowed
     newspaper on the floor its headlines reading  german troops
     driven back across rhine

     peter looks up to see leonard approaching from the track

                          peter
                any luck

                          leonard
                welltheres an old service elevator
                half a mile down the tracks  aint gonna
                be much use though  lines are dead

     peter shines his flare up at a thick cord of cables which hum
     ominously with electricity

                          peter
                you said those cablesre still live
                cant we rewire

                          leonard
                oh man there you go again

                          peter
                what

                stations  you just cant rewire that
                shit

     peter approaches him

                          peter
                for chrissakes whats the problem
                you need a memo every time you fart

                          leonard
                all right motherfucker thats it

     he pushes peter violently their eyes lock and meet
     inches away from a fistfight

                          peter
                shh shh

     a sound rushing towards them its echoes increasing by the
     second

     where is it coming from

     peter looks at leonard  leonard unbuttons his holster clip
     places his hand on his 22

     a shadow appears outside the archway

     it steps onto the platform

     leonard frowns

                          leonard
                     tentative
                manny

     the old man stumbles out of the darkness out of breath a
     rusted crowbar in his hand

     leonard walks over to him solicitously

                          leonard
                my god what the hell are you

                          manny
                hurry the woman needs help

     a shadow crosses peters face

                          peter
                woman

                                                            cut to

     int pipe gallery

     outstretched hands in the darkness

     reveal peter leaning across the void with one hand while
     manny and leonard grip his other

     susan below balancing precariously on the crisscrossing
     pipes a mess but still alive  she reaches up to peter

     its too far

                          susan
                     a whisper
                dont

                          peter
                listen to me  were getting you out

     leonard and manny pull peter back into

     int tunnels

     peter undoes his belt

                          peter
                     to manny and leonard
                give me your belts

     they obey peter buckles them together with his he then
     loops one end around a bannister the other around his wrist

                          leonard
                     to manny as he ties them
                     together
                what are you doing down here

                          manny
                chuy he was taken hes down here
                somewhere
                     to peter

                after her

                          peter

                          manny
                just hurry

     peter takes his word for it  he uses the belts to lower
     himself to the nearest pipe

     leonard lights a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery

     peter works his way down the web of pipes seem to recede
     into hades

     the lifeline tightens

     peter gets to the last solid footing lies down on his
     stomach and lets the belts down

                          peter
                im coming sus im coming

     but then he sees something move below her then a hollow
     clang clang clang

                          susan
                no jesus no

                          peter
                     to leonard
                toss the flare down

                          leonard
                i only got

                          peter
                just do it

     leonard lets the flare drop from his hand

     it falls past them ricocheting off the maze of pipes
     spinning down to the pitchblack below

     and for a split second the flame illuminates

     the mimic

     pipe in its thorax nimbly climbing the pipes toward susan
     clang clang clang

     peters

     eyes grow huge

                          peter
                oh jesus

     leonard

     just plain loses it

                          leonard
                what the fuck is that what the fuck is
                that

     susan

     knows all too well whats coming for her

                          susan
                     a desperate appeal
                peter

     throwing caution to the wind peter reaches the belt down

                          peter
                wrap it around your hand

     susan at last gets a grip  peter pulls with both arms

     clang clang clang getting closer

                          peter
                come on

     susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes
     ascending foot by foot

     peter pulls her into his arms

     clang clang clang

     peter bends down

                          peter
                get on my shoulders

     susan steps onto his shoulders  he pushes her up

     and leonard and manny yank her out

     clang clang clang

     peter scrambles up slams the lid back on the hole

                          peter
                lets go

     the four of them run

     hold on the lid

     wham it bursts from the floor rolls away like a coin

     int abandoned platform

     the four humans run down the empty platform  peter spares a
     look back

                          peter
                oh shit

     far down the tunnel

     the mimic has spread its wings and is flying after them

                          manny
                there

     he points to the open door of an ancient subway car

     they sprint for the car get to the door  manny peter
     leonard then susan

     int subway repair car

     tumble inside a repair car crammed with shelves and empty
     crates

                          leonard
                get the goddam door

     leonard and peter both grab its handle slide it shut

     splack  the mimic crashes into it

     klanggg  the door bulges out from the impact almost
     tearing itself off the hinges

     susan jumps back  manny runs to cover her

     the creature is caught half in half out antennae and
     forelegs waving wildly

     the abdomen crashes through a pane of glass

                          peter
                push it push it dont let up

     leonard and peter push harder barely keeping it pinned

     the upper half of the mimic tears itself loose

     white blood spatters everywhere the mimic is now cut in
     half

     the wings flap wildly the abdomen shatters the safety
     windows outer panels

     but the front section is still alive  it scrabbles in
     spraying white blood

     drags itself up on the ceiling then down onto the floor
     and under a row of shelves in a halfcircle around the car
     till it finally comes to a halt

     silence  the only sound is a skittering outside

     susan looks outside the window

     the mimics rear half is still trying to push through the
     door its feet blindly dragging along

     leonard

                          leonard
                what the fuck was that

     peter says nothing leonard grabs him by the shirt

                          leonard
                you better tell me what the hells
                going on here

                          manny
                hey hey take it easy

                          peter
                     to leonard
                we dont know we dont know what it
                is

     leonard releases peter and cocking his gun moves closer
     to the still thing

                          peter
                wait a minute

                          leonard
                fuck you wait a minute im
                going to

     snap  the mimic pounces on him catching his leg in its
     front mandibles

     a sickening crunch as the mimics mouth begins to work the
     leg like a grinderblender

                          leonard
                get it  get it off me

     peter and manny try to pull the thing off as leonard falls
     and writhes on the floor

     bam bam bam the men flinch away as leonard empties his
     guns on it until the things shell finally cracks

     but the thing is still locked onto leonards leg  peter
     tries to work it free from the creatures jaws no good

                          peter
                its muscles are locked

                          leonard
                     hoarse
                oh jesus

                          manny
                wait

     manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat then starts
     smearing the stuff onto the mimics head and jaws

                          leonard
                oh jesus its hitting the bone man get
                it off

     he lights a cigarette lighter goes to touch the flame to the
     flammable stuff

                          peter
                     stopping him
                hey hey hey

                          manny
                is how we make loose the ticks back home

     peter hesitates but lets him go  manny lights the polish

     whooshthe mimics head is engulfed in a halo of flame the
     legs loosen their grip

     peter and manny yank it free from leonard whos passed out
     from the pain  his leg is torn and bloody

                                                            cut to

     int subway repair car  later

     we now see the car is 50s vintage  a poster of mickey
     mantle above an empty worktable

     peter sits before susan  shes trembling understandably
     shaken from her previous experience  blood pours from a cut
     on her forehead

     peter takes a bit of torn cloth puts it to the wound then
     tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place

                          peter
                just keep holding it  can you do that
                for me
                     no reponse
                susan

     susan nods silently  her hand weakly presses the compress

                          manny os
                doctor tyler

     he turns to manny who sits solicitously next to leonard
     his wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages he begins to
     stir

     peter gets up but susans hand is closed tightly around his
     like the jaws of the mimic  he kisses her gently then
     slowly manages to release his hand

     he walks to leonard inspects his wound touches the sole of
     his foot

                          peter
                you feel anything

                          leonard
                yeah i feel like ripping your
                fucking eyes out

                          peter
                leonard listen  i need to see if
                theres any nerve damage before we
                carry you back
                     no response
                look im trying to help you here

                          leonard
                oh you helped me here all right white
                boy  you and your goddam memo you
                needed to prove your point uh

                          peter
                im sorry  but i dont think letting you
                bleed to death is the best apology

     peter touches his foot again leonard finally nods

     manny gazes at the mimic carcass at the end of the car

                          manny
                where the helld that thing come from

     peter looks at susan  she remains silent

                          peter
                     quietly
                a mistake

                          leonard
                mistake  whats that supposed to

                          peter
                it doesnt matter all right  its dead

                          leonard
                how you know that  shit it was runnin
                around with its buttside gone and a
                fucking pipe through its heart

                          susan
                     quietly
                it doesnt have a heart

     peter looks up at her

                          susan
                just inner chambers

                          manny
                but it look like a man it i saw it

                          susan
                no

     she gets up finally moving

                          susan
                thats what it wanted you to see

                                                            cut to

     outside car

     the subway car sits at the end of the platform windows dimly
     glowing in the dark the door opens and manny and peter
     snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car

     inside car  a little later

     the lower half of the insect has been moved into the car
     susan is reassembling it

                          peter
                so youre saying this is like those bugs
                that  that look like twigs or leaves
                or

                          susan
                     shakes her head
                thats camouflage

     susan displays the partlycharred head

                          susan
                this is mimicry they evolve to mimic
                their predators a butterfly can look
                like the eyes of an owl  a catterpillar
                can copy a snake

     susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a selfcontained
     bud shape then pushes back the face mandibles

                          susan
                this has evolved to mimic the most
                dangerous predator its ever had

     she holds it in her hand like yoricks skull the mimics
     head obscenely mirrors her own she inserts it into the
     shoulder cavity

     she stands back

                          susan
                us

     camera cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like
     the overcoat man

                          susan
                mantids can mimic we gave the judas
                that code

                          manny
                     quotes
                and behold he will come that walks as
                a man yet is not a man 

                          susan
                this is our baby peter yours and
                mine arent you proud

     outside of the car  in the tunnels

     we see four shadows move fast scuttling on the walls and
     ceiling

     heading towards the car

     inside the car

     a subway map on the wall  red blue and orange lines
     branching through the boroughs like veins

                          susan
                all thesetheyre like tunnels of an
                insect colony once these things hit a
                certain population density theyll have
                to move out form new colonies

     the realization hits the others

                          susan
                we have to get help down here  burn
                the tunnels before

     shes interrupted by a clicking from the tunnel ahead

     its answered by clicking from the tunnel behind

                          leonard
                get the doors

     a brief glimpse down the car shows too many other doors to
     close in time

                          peter
                is there a switch

                          leonard
                third rail is dead
                     to manny and susan
                get me up  there must be a manual
                override in the booth

     manny and susan help leonard up

                          susan
                     whispering to peter
                the lights

     peter turns off the flashlights

     susan and manny help leonard to the cars control booth

     peter looks

     outside

     where the silhouette of a mimic moves to the rear of the car

     control booth

     leonard opens a box on the sidewall marked manual override

     inside there is a large hexagonal shaped hole

                          leonard
                     starts looking around
                wheres the damn crank

     outside

     the mimic is only yards away

     other shadows emerge from the distant dark

     inside

     manny leaves leonard and susan to look for the lever crank

     he runs to help peter try and shut the doors manually

     but its useless  many of the doors wont budge

                          peter
                     hissing a whisper
                theyre coming

     outside

     the shadows get nearer their clicking louder

     control booth

     susan looks under the dashboard finds a hexagonal shaped
     rod  the lever crank

                          susan
                i got it

     susan gives it to leonard he jams the rod into the hexagonal
     shaped hole  perfect fit

     leonard begins cranking the thing  but its rusty and
     slow

                          susan
                hurry please

     throughout subway car

     the doors begin to swing shut very slowly

     outside  a mimics pov

     sees the moving doors starts heading for them

     control booth

     leonard cant crank fast enough  susan joins in putting her
     hands over leonards  both spin the thing as fast as
     possible

     subway car

     peter and manny each pulling on a door trying to speed up
     the closing process

     shadows are seen approaching now very close

     control booth

     leonard and susan put all their effort into turning the crank
     one more time

                          leonard
                come on you sonofa

     subway car

     a soft click as the doors shut in unison

     silence

     all four are stock still like a submarine crew awaiting the
     blast of depth charges  their eyes dart to the

     windows

     caked with soot irradiated by the distant glow of one of the
     red flares

     thuck something bumps against the door

     a machinegun patter of footsteps on the roof

     the car shakes

     outside

     the dark platform is alive with phantom shapes

     inside

     screeech something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a
     nail over a chalkboard

     thump thump  impacts on the sides

     an obscene symphony of sounds as mimics lay siege to the car

     peter

     a buzz of wings catches his attention  he turns  his face
     is reflected in a security window

     crack  the window splinters destroying peters reflection

     above manny

     claws scratch the ceiling it begins to dent

     below susan and leonard

     large forms clicking underneath looking for a way in

     susan stares at the floor her eyes following the course of
     the clicking

     which leads to leonards wounded bloodstained leg

                          susan
                oh god
                     looks at leonard
                the blood

     klanggg  a mimic leg pierces the ceiling above them

     susan pulls leonard out of the way just in time as

     in the subway car

     klang  klang more legs break through the ceiling

     susan and leonard

     emerge from the control booth leonards arm over susans
     shoulder

                          susan
                his blood its driving them crazy we
                have to mask the odor

                          peter
                how

     but theres not time enough to discuss possible solutions

     leonard pulls off his jacket susan begins wrapping it around
     his wound to mask it manny helps

     peter has upended one shelf jamming it against a broken
     window as a barricade

     despite their efforts the mimics are not thrown off the
     scent

                          peter
                its no use they know were in here

                          susan
                they dont know anything peter they
                just sense theyre hardwired

                          peter
                right hardwired to eat anything thats
                not like them

     the whole car is now shaking and buckling

                          susan
                exac

     she looks over at the severed mimic corpse nearby  a
     realization

                          susan
                     to manny
                give me your razor

     manny looks at her blankly susan just takes the blade

     the whole car is now shaking and buckling

     she runs to the mimics carcass  for a moment she
     hesitates  but the pandemonium leaves her little choice

     she slices into the mimics corpse with the razor

                          peter
                what are you doing

     sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow

     and pulls out two fat amber sacs the size of
     softballs  she slices them open

     orange goo leaks out its stench overpowering

                          leonard
                     covers his nose
                shit

     peter looks up as susan slides one of the sacs over to
     him

                          susan
                rub it on the windows

                          peter
                what

                          susan
                just do it

     holding his breath against the stench he smears the
     crap on the windows the doorframe

     manny

     looks to the roof listening

     and remarkably the sounds of the mimics start
     subsiding

     susan comes over to leonard begins dabbing the goop on
     leonards wound  leonard makes a face at the stink

                          leonard
                what are you putting that crap on me
                for

                          susan
                scent glands  insects use em to
                identify themselves to each other

     she smears the floor area behind leonard the activity winds
     down gradually and finally comes almost to a halt

                                                            cut to

     subway car  later

     leaning against the dirtied window manny creates a streak
     for every mimic he sees

     peter leonard and susan are hard at work leonard has
     created a small model of the station using pocket debris
     and the wall map

                          leonard os
                okay thats us

     mannys lighter represents the subway car

                          leonard
                this track were on goes down into
                the repair area
                     makes an x further down
                the elevators over here leads up to
                the active tunnels

     thump an oily soft abdomen brushes lazily up against
     the glass manny moves away

                          peter
                can we get this car there

                          leonard
                someoned have to go to the
                switchroom pull the coupling lever
                thatll send us left and to the
                elevator

                          susan
                but the power

                          leonard
                hell i might be able to juice the whole
                area if i can get to the power box its
                just a couple of cables

                          manny
                oh how you gonna get there leonard
                hop

                          peter

                manny

                          leonard
                it would take a minute or so
                     beat
                you wont last that long out there

                          susan
                peter you couldnt even fix our tv

     tense silence he points at the glands on the floor

                          peter
                well cover ourselves with this they
                can mimic us  we goddam mimic them

                          susan
                peter

                          peter
                it worked before

                          susan
                     an edge in her voice
                the scent wont last

                          peter
                thats why we should do it now

     susan knows they have no other choice

     later

     susan is stuffing leonards old bloody bandages into the
     thorax of the dead mimic  she ties a flare to its center

                          leonard
                its just a regular old pump switch
                okay right by the track signal
                board

     manny is spreading the mucuslike liquid of the glandsac on
     himself and peter as leonard instructs them

                          leonard
                the lights come up you pull the
                switch

                          manny
                i pull

                          leonard
                you dont do that were on the wrong
                track
                     turns to peter
                you

     the two men look into each others eyes

                          leonard
                you gonna finally get to fuck around
                with the wires  think you can
                handle it

                          peter
                depends  you got a memo

     leonards hard feelings give way to an almost
     imperceptible smile

     using a ballpoint pen he draws a schematic on the back
     of peters hand

                          leonard
                all right then  you gonna find two
                wires  ones green  the others
                blue

     susan

     approaches manny who looks distractedly out the window

                          manny
                hes out there i heard him how can
                he be this things

                          susan

                          manny

                trusted me and i didnt protect
                him his fatheri lost his father
                to the streets and now chuy

                          susan
                well find him well be back and
                find him

     manny doesnt respond

     ready to go

     susan dabs at peters face with the last touches of the
     scent gland substance  she doesnt meet his eyes as she
     speaks

                          susan
                youre going to have to keep it
                really slow  their eyes react to
                sudden movements

     peter barely nods his nerves clearly on edge  he
     instinctively goes to wipe his forehead  susan stops
     him

                          susan
                dont touch it  and for godsakes
                try not to sweat  they can sense
                chemical changes

                          peter
                try not to sweat

     leonard turns to susan and peter

                          leonard
                okay people

     leonards voice comes through like a clarion

                          leonard os
                are we ready for this

     susan has her hand on peters chest peter is taking deep
     breaths trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat  its
     an odd parody of lamaze exercise

                          leonard
                whatever you do dont step on the
                third rail coming back six hundred
                voltsll blow your leg right off

     a final breath  hes about as calm as hes going to get

     he looks at susan a long moment he takes her hand

                          peter
                i was just thinking how i could use a
                pair of pliers and i remembered where
                they are

                          susan
                     overlapping
                thats it thats it breathe easy

     a sad nervous smile appears on peters face

                          peter
                in the tool box under the kitchen
                counter

     susan kisses him softly on the lips

     manny approaches  show time

     susan steps away from peter she looks toward the control
     booth

                          susan
                open it

     leonard

     begins turning the lever crank slowly

     subway doors

     gradually begin to open and stop half way

     the darkness outside is alive with clicking

     peter and manny

     slowly move between the opening of the door and make their
     way to

     int platform

     they step onto the dusty concrete  come to a stop

     susan

     watches nervously for the reaction of the mimics

     outside

     large shadows pass far and near of peter and manny but none
     of the mimics seem to care about them one way or the other

     peter and manny exchange looks a moment of relief  its
     working

     peter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby power
     box

     manny goes left starts to make a longer journey across the
     platform to the switch room

     subway car

     susan moves away from the door goes over the mimic carcass
     filled with the bloody bandages

     platform  by the tracks

     peter makes his way to the edge of the platform whispering
     to himself

     he lowers himself slowly to the track

     platform  near the switchroom

     manny moves toward the door  a large window of dusty glass
     reflects his imageand the distant ones of the mimics

     by the tracks

     peter gets to the track  he turns

     and is met face to face with a mimic

     its antennae move toward his head curious

     its humanmask face plate clicks apart and together

     peter remains stock still  he starts breathing deeply

     subway car

     leonard has now fully opened the doors

     susan

     pulls the tipcase of the flare tied to the dead mimics
     midsection  fsst  the flare sparks alive

     the sudden light draws the attention of several mimics
     outside

     susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of
     the car

     and with a heave throws it onto the front track

     outside

     the other mimics take instant notice

     by peter

     the mimic before him suddenly turns  in a flash of speed
     its gone heading toward

     the dead mimic

     stuffed with the bloody rage the thing sends its fellow
     into a feeding frenzy

     the other mimics begin tearing into it ripping their brother
     to shreds in cannibalistic orgy

     subway car

     susan watches in disgust

                          susan
                choke on it motherfuckers

     leonard turns the lever crank again  the doors begin to
     shut

     peter

     breathes a sigh of relief

     he goes to the powerbox opens it up

     he shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand
     the simple chart tells him what to wire  blue wires to
     the green wires

                          peter
                     to himself
                greenblue

     he looks back up at the powerbox  his face falls

     all the wires are a gross brown their colored plastic
     casings having long ago faded into goo

     int switchroom

     manny enters the space is even more dusty than the rest of
     the station spiderwebs strung over old machinery  white
     doric pillars support the ceiling like skeletal bones  1940s
     style lamps are built into their side

     manny looks around  off to the right right next to the
     rusted track switch board he heads for the coupling switch

     once there he rests and through the murky windows he
     waves back to leonard

     he pulls out his pills box and takes a pill but his hands
     are shaking under enormous tension some of the pills
     scatter on the floor he puts the box away and leans
     against the wall

     a clicking nearby catches his attention echoing from the
     entrance of another room

     it is not the sound of the mimics but rather of metal

     spoons

                          manny
                chuy

     manny follows the sound

     by the track

     peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way
     he wipes off the brown gunk tries to discern any semblance
     of color

     he feels himself start to sweat  he tries to relax
     breathes

     int room behind switchroom

     the space is larger than the switchroom  the walls and
     ceiling have an odd shiny consistency

     manny heads in further locates the levers and waits

     something pale and small emerges from the dark a few feet
     away a face that seems to float in the eerie halflight

     a rustling behind him  manny turns around

                          manny
                     whispering
                nino

     he swings the light onto chuy sitting on the floor before
     the remains of a rusty column  that beautiful emotionless
     smile on his pale face

                          manny
                chuy

     by the powerbox

     peter has made all the necessary connections  he turns now
     to the fusesection

     a red throwswitch is there and two big slots for fuses

     one is still occupied

     the other one empty

                          peter
                dammit

     cu  peters forehead

     beads of sweat begin to form

     subway car

     susan watches the mimics at their feast

     all of a sudden they begin to stop as if losing interest

                          susan
                     horrified
                the scents fading

     susan steps back looks around desperately for a flashlight

                          leonard
                     tense as hell
                whats manny doing i cant see him
                anymore

     room behind switchroom

                          manny
                nino please

     manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture
     of come to me

     in the darkness something that looks like a palm frond
     floats gracefully down from the ceiling making seesaw
     gestures as it falls through the air

     manny shines his flashlight on the floor  its not a palm
     frond

     its a wing

     manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls

     the place is covered with mimics  they are in the middle of
     a vicious mating ritual  the males tear savagely at the
     females wings as they proceed to mount them  a chaotic
     clusterfuck

     manny is sickened

     chuy giggles manny shines his light ahead mannys face
     falls

                          manny
                dios mio

     the white pillar behind chuy is moving

     unfolding

     at last revealing

     an albino mimic  another leap for evolution

     its form is different from the other mimics  sleeker more
     supple almost beautiful  and while its movements are still
     not completely human there is a kind of unearthly grace to
     them that at the very least entrance us

     the thing raises itself to full height dwarfing the tiny
     boy  it stands over him like a king over his court fool

     chuy giggles happily  its all a game to him

     the albino clicks in response  a long leisurely sound as
     if trying to communicate with the boy

     chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them making a
     perfect imitation of the sound

     manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with
     huge expressionless eyes  he turns to chuy

                          manny
                     barely audible
                chuy

                          chuy
                     whispers
                friends

                          manny
                no no chuy no

                          chuy
                friends

     the albino clicks his jaws moving in toward manny

     chuy

     plays his spoons in perfect imitation

     manny

     stands under an archway in a swirl of dust he raises his
     arms like a prophet he lets go of hsi razor and kneels

                          manny
                god has closed his eyes this he cannot
                see

     his vacant eyes fill with tears he prays quietly a strange
     serenity invades him

     the albinos jaws open and charge

     platform

     some mimics advance toward peters direction

     subway car

     susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window
     trying to attract their attention

                          susan
                over here over here goddam you

     by the tracks

     peter breaks the arm off one of his glasses  he jams it at
     the empty fuse  it sparks

     platform

     thump  the electricity comes on

     the lamps on the columns burst into flames from the power
     surge  fire illuminates the station like a greek temple

     by the tracks

     peter climbs up onto the tracks

     sweat staining his forehead

     peter wipes it and removes the scent coating

     the mimics

     clearly react sensing the chemical change like bees
     reacting to honey

     subway car

                          susan
                     to leonard
                the door open the fucking door

     leonard

     looks at the now lit control panels tries to decide which
     button to press he begins to press each one in turn

     peter

     hears the sound of spoons playing

     he turns to see chuy standing by the outside of the switch
     room  the boy smiles a flashlight shines behind him

                          peter
                manny

     but the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human
     the albino steps into view moving eerily like an unstrung
     puppet his claws and jaws are coated in blood chuy joyfully
     announces the arrival like a little drummer boy

     the mimics

     climb over the roof moving toward the rear of the

     subway car  control booth

     susan runs in  slams her hand down on a button

     fsst

     the subway car

     the doors open

                          susan
                peter

     peter hesitates takes a step toward chuy

                          peter
                come on kid

     chuy seeks shelter behind the albinos legs

                          peter
                     horrified
                jesus

     the albino charges toward him

                          susan
                run peter

     peter bolts for the car

     the mimics

     jump and land

     subway car

     just as peter squeezes through one of the doors

     bam thud the doors dent glass cracks

                          susan
                     yelling to leonard
                go

     susan presses the button the doors close again

                          leonard
                the kid

                          peter
                the kids with them

                          leonard
                what do you

                          peter
                go just go

     control booth

     leonard throws the dead mans switch by the control board

     subway car

     jolts into action

     outside

     the train lurches forward

     wheels spark and kick into gear the mimics scramble and re
     assemble quickly ready to attack

     the albino

     changes position and charges towards the car

     the moving car

     reaches a y section  the car moves to the track to the
     right

     inside subway car

     leonards eyes go wide as he sees

                          leonard
                he didnt do it

                          susan
                what

                          leonard
                manny never threw the coupling switch
                were goin the wrong way

     outside car

     it keeps bearing right further away from their destination

     towards an old storage yard in their path  idle cars and
     repair equipment on the tracks

     a crash seems inevitable

     inside the car

     leonard pulls

     the brakes

     but they dont work at all

     from below the car we see the wheels spinning freely
     heading for collision

     inside the car

     susan grabs leonard from the control booth to peter

                          susan
                move back

     they rush back against the opposite door

     storage yard  subway car

     craaashh  the car bashes into a parked section of train in
     a grin of tearing metal

     flips off the track

     and onto its side

     the car skids to a stop  sparks fill the air

     inside subway car

     all three are hurt  leonards leg wound has reopened peter
     has badly damaged his right arm

                          susan
                you all right

     peter nods painfully  susan to leonard

                          leonard
                     simply re his leg
                cant feel it

     peter and susan sling leonards arms over their shoulders
     they raise him up

     outside subway car

     they move unsteadily outside

                          susan
                which way

                          leonard
                across both tracks

                          peter
                shit

     they head off over a concrete island in the direction of the
     correct track

     further back

     the mimics and the albino moving closer

     peter and susan

     try to hurry but its no use given leonards condition

                          leonard
                     quietly
                lemme go

     peter and susan both disregard the order

                          susan
                were no leaving you

                          leonard
                no way we can outrun em together
                move it

     leonard suddenly grabs his police baton from his belt
     clip  he pushes the two away

                          leonard
                now go get the hell off my beat

     leonard turns away from them

     peter goes to get leonard but susan stops him  this mta
     officer is staying put

                          leonard
                come on  come to poppa

     reluctantly the two begin down the tunnel

     leonard

     takes a stand by the third rail baton in hand

     int subway tunnel  further down

     peter and susan run

                          susan
                there

     an open cage elevator on a platform nearby  a sign overhead
     authorized personnel only

     they rush toward it

     int subway tunnels  y section

     leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth

     sounds of the mimics approaching he glances at the third
     rail beside him then down the track

                          leonard
                come here you mealymouthed

     the sound gets louder

                          leonard
                multilegged

     leonard raises his baton in top mta form

                          leonard
                maggotmunchin motherfu

     thud  several mimcs slam onto leonard

     leonard goes down hitting them futilely with his baton

     they begin to tear at his limbs

     leonard rolls

     kicks his good leg out

     and connects with the third rail

     an arc of electricity lights up the darkness consuming
     leonard and the mimics

     int by the cage elevator

     the crackling sound echoes through to peter and susan

     susan hits the elevator button again

                          susan
                i cant tell if its working

     peter has unbarred the gate

     susan

     looks up into the shaft

     the elevator

     coming down but its taking its own sweet time

                          susan
                oh come on come on

                          peter
                jump in

     peter pulls her into the shaft closes the security gate
     behind them

     int shaft

     a skeletal framework on each side  just enough for a
     handhold

     peter steadies susan as she climbs in beside him  she
     balances on the narrow ledge

     peter slams the cage door shut latching it

                          peter
                you go first ill be right below you

                          susan
                your arm you cant

                          peter
                i can  we can do this

     he shows her the first hand and foothold  susan grabs on

     int subway tunnel

     the albino amkes its way forward flanked by two mimics

     it stops

     turns toward the elevator

     int shaft

     susan hauls herself up the framework handhold by
     handhold peter is right below her

     she can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously
     with the effort

                          susan
                were gonna make it

     peter grinds his teeth trying to make the next
     handhold

     wham  something hits the gate below them

     int by the elevator gate

     the mimics are tearing at the metal gate

     the albino remains still watching them work

     peter and susan

     susans arm and legs are shaking now  her breath starts
     catching in her throat with the effort

                          peter
                dont hold your breath  keep it going
                even flow

     susan tried but cant  she tries to pull herself up to the
     next level

                          peter
                cmon

                          susan

                          susan
                peter

     susan pulls herself up

                          susuan
                im really glad im not pregnant

     reverse

     we look down past them as they climb  two of the mimics and
     the albino have gotten into the shaft

     the albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against
     opposite walls

     susan and peter

     susan is crying barely any strength left

     peter does his best to stay in control but in truth is
     barely hanging on himself

     light hits them from the shaft above now sounds of people
     talking and a muffled pa announcement filter down

     mimics

     rushing upward on the shaft wall higher higher

     int elevator shaft

     peters hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next
     floor

     kchunk is heard above them  peter looks up

     now the elevator is coming down

                          peter
                hang onto me

     peter pulls susan up till she can grab it too both of them
     able to get a foothold on the ledge

                          peter
                hang on tight

     he begins to kick on the gate trying to tear it free  susan
     looks back down

     susans pov  shaft

     the mimics rush up closer closer  the albino opens its
     mandibles

     susan and peter

     both kick at the gate it gives peter pulls susan through
     to the

     int subway track

                          peter
                come on

     peter and susan stumble away

     int elevator shaft

     the albino sees the elevator approaching from above

     it gives a few clicks to its minions

     the two other mimics race up the shaft

     toward the elevator

     and wedge themselves in on either side

     they are crushed instantly  but the elevator is stopped just
     above the open gate

     with just enough room for the albino to get through to

     int subway tracks

     susan and peter run  there is light just up the tunnel  we
     hear voices

                          susan
                dont look back

     they go for it  at last they make it to

     int a platform

     susan and peter stumble forward  light streams down from
     overheads susan turns

     susans pov

     the albino spills out onto the track behind them

     sleek streamlined light glancing beautifully off it

     susan and peter

     turn back

     headlights hit them as we hear the roar of a subway train
     heading at them from the other side of the platform

                          susan
                no

                          peter
                we can do it

     they run

     albino

     runs faster than any other mimic

     train

     the express train blows its horn rushing forward

     platform  commuters

     weary latenight commuters stand halfasleep on the tracks
     a sleepyeyed little girl points tugging on her mothers
     hand

                          little girl
                mommy theres people

     peter and susan

                          peter
                     adrenaline pumping
                wecandothis

     motorman

     the driver sees the battered couple

     he reaches for the brake

     susan and peter

     they reach the edge of the platform the horn deafening as
     the train speeds toward them  peter pushes susan up leaps

     int train  conductor

     we rush toward his horrified face

     the albino

     directly ahead

     the train still flying plows into it

     flattening grinding pulverizing

     until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white
     blood

     the motoran leans on the brake his eyes screwed shut in
     primal horror the train squeals to a stop

     on the platform

     susan and peter collapse on the cement floor in each others
     arms  heaving and weeping

     int grand central station  night

     commuters turn to stare as peter and susan move across
     the floor  both bruised and bloodied leaning against
     each other heading for the exit

     some derelicts observe them with curiosity

     a trio of mta cops start towards them

                          peter
                itll be fine it theyre still
                down there well seal the whole
                system go in with whatever it
                takes

     but peters voice evidences a lack of conviction now
     hes trying to convince both susan and himself of
     something he doesnt fully believe

                          peter
                itll be fine we nailed them
                before well do it again

     he hurries to meet the mta cops susan looks up

     susans pov

     commuters move to and fro moving up and down and in and
     out of the illuminated areas of the station

     in the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face  a mimic
     hugging the shadows waiting for its moment

     we pan 180 degrees to the other side of the platform
     there briefly glimpsed is another and another

     we tilt down to the throng below

                          susan
                     barely audible
                theyve come up

     the electrified voice of the train announcer suddenly
     fades up telling of departures and delays

     we raise above susans head

                          train announcer
                the 1116 local to poughkeepsie
                boarding now track 32 the 720
                connecticut local making
                connections to south norwalk

     down angle

     culminating in an overhead view of the main terminal

     the movement continues but from here the people are
     dots their importanec no greater than that of a colony
     of ants

                                                          fade out
