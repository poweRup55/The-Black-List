               bottle of champagne the cigarette is unlit the match is of 
               the kitchen variety the champagne unopened is dom perignon 
               there is only one sound at first a strong wind

               now another sound sharpera sudden burst of typing as we

               pull back to reveal

               paul sheldon typing at a table in his hotel suite its really 
               a cabin thats part of a lodge not an ornate place western 
               themed

               he is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous 
               mountains its afternoon the sky is grey snow is scattered 
               along the ground were out west somewhere the wind grows 
               strongerthere could be a storm

               paul pays no attention to whats going on outside as he 
               continues to type

               hes the hero of what follows fortytwo hes got a good 
               face one with a certain mileage to it we are not in other 
               words looking at a virgin hes been a novelist for eighteen 
               years and for half that time the most recent half a 
               remarkably successful one

               he pauses for a moment intently as if trying to stare a 
               hole in the paper now his fingers fly and theres another 
               burst of typing he studies what hes written then

                                                                    cut to

               the paper as he rolls it out of the machine puts it on the 
               table prints in almost childlike letters these words

                                         the end

                                                                    cut to

               a pile of manuscript at the rear of the table he puts this 
               last page on gets it straight and in order hoists it up 
               folds it to his chest the entire manuscripthundreds of 
               pages

                                                                    cut to

               paul as he holds his book to him he is just for a brief 
               moment moved

                                                                    cut to

               a suitcase across the room paul goes to it opens it and 
               pulls something out from inside a battered red leather 
               briefcase now he takes his manuscript carefully opens the 
               briefcase gently puts the manuscript inside he closes it 
               and the way he handles it he might almost be handling a 
               child now he crosses over opens the champagne pours himself 
               a single glass lights the one cigarette with the lone match
               there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this he inhales 
               deeply makes a toasting gesture then drinks smokes smiles

               hold briefly then

                                                                    cut to

               he throws a suitcase into the trunk of his 65 mustang and 
               holding his leather case he hops into the car and drives 
               away

                                                                    cut to

               on the word tombstone

                                                                    cut to

               pauls tombstonethe upside down car with the blizzard coming 
               galeforce and his motionless body trapped inside the car

               the wind screams pauls eyes flutter then close

               hold

               keep holding as

               suddenly theres a new sound as a crowbar scratches at the 
               door

                nd now the door is ripped open as we

               pull back to reveal

               a bundledup figure gently beginning to pull paul and the 
               case from the car for a moment its hard to tell if its a 
               man or woman

               not to let the cat out of the bag or anything but it is 
               very much a woman her name is annie wilkes and she is close 
               to pauls age she is in many ways a remarkable creature 
               strong selfsufficient passionate in her likes and dislikes 
               loves and hates

                                                                    cut to

               paul and annie as she cradles him in her arms once hes 
               clear of the car she lays him carefully in the snow

                                                                    cut to

               paul and annie close up she slowly brings her mouth down 
               close to his then their lips touch as she forces air inside 
               him

                                     annie
                              their lips touch 
                              again then
                         you hear mebreathe i said 
                         breathe

                                                                    cut to

               paul as he starts to breathe

               in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide but hes in shock 
               the eyes see nothing

                                                                    cut to

               anniethe moment she sees him come to life she goes into 
               action lifting paul in a firemans carry starting the 
               difficult climb back up the steep hill

               as she moves away she and paul are obliterated by the white 
               falling snow

                                                               dissolve to

               the white of what seems like a hospital everything is bled 
               of color its all vague

               we are looking at this from pauls blurred vision

               and throughout this next sequence there are these sounds 
               words really but they make no sense

               no worry

               be fine

               good care you

               im your number one fan

               the first thing we see during this is something all white 
               it takes a moment before we realize its a ceiling

               now a white wall

               an iv bottle is next the medicine dripping down a tube 
               into pauls left arm the other arm is bandaged and in a 
               sling

               annie is standing beside the bed she wears offwhite and 
               seems very much like a nurse a good nurse she has pills in 
               her hands

                                                                    cut to

               paul motionless dead pale he has a little beard now eyes 
               barely open hes shaking with fever

                         where am i

               annie is quickly by his side

               and now the gibberish words make sense

                         take these

               she helps him to swallow as pauls eyes close

                              proudly
                         but what im most proud of is the

                         have done any better

               and now suddenly she flicks off the blankets uncovering his

                         could hear the bones moving so its 
                         best for your legs to remain immobile 
                         and as soon as the roads open ill

                         is still alive

               might shatter him with it crunch his skulland thats just 
               what she seems shes about to doand then she swings it

               voice surprisingly soft

               is a rattle of a key and the sound of the door to his room 
               locking

                                                                    cut to

               paul lies still he looks around the room and listens for 
               sounds all he hears are the sounds of a winter night in the 
               mountains after a few beats he takes a deep breath and 
               then begins his greatest effort of all to force his body 
               out of bed to make it move

               hes still weak from what hes endured but thats not the 
               main thing its the pain any attempt at movement and his 
               legs scream he sags back lies there still a moment slowly 
               he tries to maneuver his body off the bed he rolls over 
               onto his stomach then tries to lower himself onto the floor 
               by moving down head first his good arm hits the floor and 
               he is able to hold himself up but realizing there is no way 
               to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain he girds 
               himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to 
               the floor

               the pain is excruciating after he regains his composure he 
               slowly crawls toward the door

               he reaches up and tries the handle it is in fact locked 
               he awkwardly tries to slam up against the door but it is 
               much too painful and to no avail he crawls back over to the 
               bed realizes theres no way to climb back in then grabs

               the blanket from the bed wraps it around himself and closes 
               his eyes

               a piece of burning paper in midair floating against the 
               gauzy curtain and for a moment it looks like the curtain 
               will catch fire and

                                                                    cut to

               the last of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed 
               onto ittheres hissing and steam and as the steam clears 
               it all looks now like a log in a brackish pond

                                     annie
                         well isnt that an oogy mess

                         say it has something to do with the

               she exits paul takes the two novril stares at them then 
               deliberately tucks them under his mattress

               as paul is finishing the last of his tuna casserole there 
               are two novrils on his tray we hear strains of tv game show 
               theme music these sounds are not surprising paul has heard 
               them before

                                                                    cut to

               stand annie lies in bed with an open bag of cheetos resting 
               on her stomach and a big quartsized plastic bottle of coke 
               on the nightstand as she munches away she is heavily 
               engrossed in her favorite tv show the love connection as

               paul faintly hearing the sounds of the tv he has now finished 
               eating he takes the two novril from under the mattress he 
               then undoes the sheet takes his fork and delicately pokes a 
               hole in the mattress then stuffs all four pills back into 
               the hole

               in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up

               out of the way of the door and every turn of the chairs 
               wheels is an effort for him he works at it and works at it

               he glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair 
               across the study and we

                                                                    cut to

               paul grabbing for it catching it putting it back where it 
               was he continues his slow way across the room and

               out in the hallway on his way toward the kitchen paul 
               notices a door to his right he wheels over and surprisingly 
               it opens however this is not a door to the outside of the  
               house only a storage pantry he looks aroundnothing but 
               canned goods potato chips cereals and large plastic coke 
               containers etc just as he is about to close the door he 
               notices an open cardboard box he opens the flap and sees 
               all kinds of prescription drugs among them are a couple of 
               strips of novril encapsulated in blisters he grabs them and 
               stuffs them into his sweatpants now he closes the pantry 
               door and heads to the kitchen

                                                                    cut to

               the kitchen

               as paul approaches it he starts to wheel his way in but he 
               has trouble

               he backs up slightly wheels forward again

               but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through 
               he pounds his fists on the chair arm staring as we

                                                                    cut to

               the back door its at the far end of the kitchen leading to 
               the outside it seems somehow less formidable than the front 
               door did the windows around the kitchen are barred

                                                                    cut to

               paul staring at the kitchen door

               then without warning he makes his move starting to lower 
               himself out of the chair

               gently to the floor

               only it doesnt work that way its too awkward he doesnt 
               have the strength to maneuver properly

               and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair slams hard 
               against the hard floor

                                                                    cut to

               paul crying out in pain as he lands he lies there for a 
               moment little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now he 
               is hurting

               he closes his eyes gathering strength

               and then slowly very slowly inch by inch he moves his 
               body across the floor toward the kitchen door

                                                                    cut to

               the kitchen door its still a long way away

               paul ignoring his pain his awkwardness making his body 
               move

                                                                    cut to

               paul growing pale but he wont stop and now the door is 
               just ahead of him and with his good arm he reaches out and 
               up and grabs the doorknob

                                                                    cut to

               paul close up the disappointment and anger is plain on his 
               face his arm drops he lies still for a moment panting 
               from his effort then

                                                                    cut to

               paul and his eyes are wide for a moment you can feel his 
               wild excitement as we

               pull back to reveal

               sitting on the counter a set of carving knives sticking out 
               of a slotted wooden block

               they seem to be out of reach but that doesnt stop him he 
               starts to crawl over to the counter

                                                                    cut to

               now at the counter paul tries to pull himself up with his 
               one good arm but even though he is able to chin himself up 
               to the top of the counter he is still unable to reach the 
               knives he makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing 
               to the floor

               as he starts to force his way up againfrom outside there 
               comes a soundthe motor of a car

                         and lay there all night in the ditch 
                         so he never reached the doctor so 
                         there couldnt have been any

                         realized that the reason theyd buried 
                         misery alive was because the bee

               cant find a way to get close enough the wheelchair is too 
               cumbersome he looks around and decides to head back to his 
               room he is faced with the same problem thereso he struggles 
               into bed and lying on his back he rests the knife on his 
               chest and stares up at the ceiling

               paultrying to stay awake after a few beats he hears 
               something its the sound of a car pulling up

               headlights can be seen flashing through the window paul 
               grips the knife and hides it under the covers the sound of 
               a car door opening and closing then footsteps

               as the front door opens paul girds himself for attack the 
               front door closes then a couple of footsteps then silence 
               then the footsteps continue down the hall and up the stairs

               after a beat we hear the television someone is explaining 
               how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate 
               with no money down

               paul allowing himself to relax slips the knife under the 
               mattress as the tv drones on paul lies staring up at the 
               ceiling

               outside the farmhouse night

               we hear a clap of thunder and once again the rain pours down

                                                                    cut to

               close up pauleyes closed there is another loud thunderclap

               he turns his head and another clap of thunder is heard 
               lightning flashes and reveals annie standing over his bed

               before he can react she jabs a needle into his arm pulls 
               it out and starts out of the room

               paul tries to raise himself but the power of the drug causes 
               him to collapse unconscious

                                                                    cut to

               for an instant we dont recognize the voice then we do 
               its liberace talking to his audience on a record going

               to be back with you in paris paul stirs and awakens to 
               discover that he is strapped to his bed he can move his 
               arms but thats it

                         you just need more time eventually 
                         youll come to accept the idea of 
                         being here paul do you know about 
                         the early days at the kimberly diamond

                         the native workers who stole diamonds 
                         dont worry they didnt kill them 
                         that would be like junking a mercedes 
                         just because it had a broken spring
                         no if they caught them they had to 
                         make sure they could go on working 
                         but they also had to make sure they 
                         could never run away the operation 
                         was called hobbling

               and with that she reaches down out of sight and comes up 
               holding a 16inch piece of 4 x 4 wood

                                     paul

               with that she closes the door we stay with buster he stands 
               on the front porch for a beat thinking then starts heading 
               down the porch steps just as he reaches about halfway down 
               we hear a loud crash coming from inside the house

                                                                    cut to

                              weakly
                         here im down here down here

                                                                    cut to

               buster hearing pauls muffled call for help he tracks the 
               sound to the cellar door as paul continues to call out 
               buster looks around sees no one and opens the cellar door 
               the shaft of light from the open door pours down on paul 
               who is still lying on the floor

                                     buster
                         mr sheldon

               but before paul can answer theres the sound of a loud 
               explosion seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through 
               busters chest knocking him out of frame revealing annie 
               smoking shotgun in hand standing at the top of the cellar 
               steps

                                     annie
                         dont feel bad paul it had to 
                         happen ive been waiting for this 
                         sign

               annie walks toward busters body and very casually takes his 
               gun out of its holster

                                     annie
                         ive known for some time why i was 
                         chosen to save you you and i were 
                         meant to be together forever but 
                         now our time in this world must end 
                         but dont worry paul ive already 
                         prepared for what must be done i 
                         put two bullets in my gun one for 
                         you and one for me oh darling it 
                         will be so beautiful

               with that annie turns and exits the cellar

               pauls mind races desperately he looks at the barbecue again 
               next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on 
               it

                                                                    cut to

               the table one of the cans is lighter fluid

                                                                    cut to

               paul he stares at it for a moment an idea hits him

               now paul struggles and crawls over to the table he grabs 
               the lighter fluid in his hands jams it into the rear of his 
               pants and scrambles back to where annie left him

                                                                    cut to

               annie returning with her 38 special and a hypodermic needle 
               she stops at the top of the stairs

                                     annie
                         now dont be afraid i love you

               she starts toward him

                                     paul
                         i know you do i love you too annie
                              this stops her
                         and youre right we are meant to be 
                         together and i know we must die 
                         but it must be so that misery can 
                         live we have the power to give misery 
                         eternal life we must finish the 
                         book

                                     annie
                         but the time is now soon others 
                         will come

                         able to give misery back to the world

               annie stares at paul she could go either way on this then 
               without a word she turns and goes back up the stairs

                                     annie
                         here paul ill fix you something 
                         to eat

               she exits paul hesitates for a moment then realizes he has 
               no choice he starts dragging himself over buster and up the 
               stairs

                                                                    cut to

               paul working typing like a madman totally concentrated on 
               the white paper his lips move but hes not even aware of 
               it

               annie enters quietly holding a few pages
