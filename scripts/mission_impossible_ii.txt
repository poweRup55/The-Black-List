     is being carried by a world weary middle european wearing a black 
     armband  vladimir nekhorvich exits a gleaming building pausing 
     for a moment under a motto clearly visible above his headwhere the future is now  he checks the time

     natural history museum  they are moving in and around an odd
     freeform sculpture

     pov  sculpture and children

     a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children 
     almost like mirrors in a fun house

     wipes his eyes a horn honks  he looks toward the sound

                 folks were a little over two and a 
                half hours from touchdown in atlanta but

                crossing the southern section of the rocky 
                mountains a range which includes more 
                than 50 peaks rising above 14000 feet

                as we pass over central colorado shortly

     nekhorvich int cabin  day

     seems intent on the map its changing times and distance  he  
     checks his watch  the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours 
     and 32 minutes as nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending 
     seconds whipping by

     ethan hunt sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat 
     beside nekhorvich

                                ethan
                you keep staring at that watch as if your
                life depended on it doctor

                                nekhorvich 
                well yes  i suppose i am a bit anxious

                with old friends

                                nekhorvich

                sorry
                        bemused laughter then looks at ethan
                 you do know gradski thought the world of you

     nekhorvich is overcome  ethan puts a comforting hand on his  
     shoulder

                                ethan
                he was quite a man  did he know before 
                the end you two had succeeded

                                nekhorvich

     with an almost impish grin and a wink

                                nekhorvich

                devices im an old fart too inept to read 
                a railroad timetable

     goodnatured laughter  cut off by a flight steward who passes 
     by giving a sidelong silence in ethan and nekhorvichs direction 
     oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling  passengers are 
     puzzled and alarmed

                                captains voice
                you captain again  weve experienced a 
                slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure
                
     a passenger struggling with his mask  as nekhorvich fumbles with 
     the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows 
     their altitude is below 30000 feet and dropping  he checks the 
     countdown time on his watch again  nekhorvich looks around him  
     the flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the 
     passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out

     int  cockpit

     the flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks

     the copilot is working on the planes altitude when his hands 
     slip off the controls  his eyes flutter then

                                copilot
                captain i dontcant

     he passes out  the captain hugh stamp turns to verify that the
     relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls

     he then removes his oxygen mask sets the auto pilot inputting 
     numbers to slow the plane and descend  as the craft titles 
     downward

     int  gallery

     the flight attendants are pulling on jump suits  stamp emerges
     from the cockpit

     int  cabin

     ethan returns  nekhorvich beckons to him  ethan sits  grinning 
     around nekhorvich conspiratorially

                                nekhorvich
                it seems we have a problem dmitri

                                ethan

                shouldnt

     nekhorvichs eyes narrow

                                nekhorvich
                youre not dmitri

     with a lightning swift move ethan breaks nekhorvichs neck

                                ethan
                 no

     he grabs the satchel

     ulrich has rolled back the carpet over an access panel just 
     beneath them that leads to the belly of the plane  stamp pulls 
     back the panel hops into the compartment below which is four 
     walls of electronic equipment  stamp kneels and slides back the 
     floor hatch  the wind howls puffs of cloud zip by beneath them

     they don goggles and with ambrose in the lead 
     the team leaps one after another from the hatch sailing off
     into the sky

     int  cockpit day						

     an automated voice repeats in an ominous monotone

                                voice
                terrain terrain  pull up pull up

     the copilot stirs  he blearily rouses himself just in time to 
     see

     a mountain rushing toward him  as mountain meets airplane the 
     frame is filled with fire but when camera pulls back from the 
     fireball it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame 
     which ignited lights a fuse

     the mi theme music kicks in the main credits roll to

     ext  face of mountain day

     for a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the 
     plane crashed but when ethan hunt climbs into frame the angle 
     widen and titles down revealing more of where hes come from 
     than where hes going  aside from the fact that hes in the 
     midst of freeclimbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at 
     least a thousand feet theres the sunny picturepostcard view of 
     a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below  ethan 
     climbs out of shot

     wide up angle day

     revealing the summit a light breeze hitting the lichen and 
     whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside 
     fluffy clouds overhead

     ethan into shot  despite the spectacularly precarious handholds 
     hes using to hang onto the mountain and his life he appears 
     relaxed engaged  for him  in the equivalent of busmans 
     holiday  its leisurely danger for ethan one might almost 
     expect to hear julie andrews trilling climb every mountain on 
     the soundtrack

     then a rock hes been grasping crumbles and ethan drops about six 
     inches before he grabs onto the mountain again  as he hangs by 
     five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesnt seem 
     terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter

     its materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close 
     just overhead casting its shadow downward over ethan  
     instinctively ethan flattens himself against the rock surface 
     as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him  but when 
     its rotors whir it into the distance ethan relaxes and resumes his 
     climb

     a hairy overhang ext mountain  day

     near the summit ethan departing from the vertical and is now 
     traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet 
     exposed to the earth far below  hes clinging to the mountain 
     almost like a fly walking on the ceiling  when he reaches for a 
     handhold that will restore him to the vertical he dislodges a 
     lizard  and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of 
     feet to oblivion
                                
                                ethan
                whoaa

     he pockets the lizard climbs the overhang

     reverse angle  summit

     with ethans hand then ethan coming into view and making the 
     summit  he reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who 
     favors ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude  to 
     lizard

                                ethan
                youre welcome

     the lizard scampers off then a low beeping sound at his back 
     attracts his attention  he turns to see the source of the 
     beeping a small package in dayglo colors with a dayglo 
     streamer  ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now 
     ominously circling back

     ethan lifts the dayglo package and waves it in the direction of 
     the copter  with a distinct lack of enthusiasm

     the helicopter once again turns banks and disappears  ethan has 
     opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses

     ethans pov sunglasses

     ethan removes the glasses then tosses them into space

                                ethan
                if i let you know where im going 

     the glasses explode in a puff of smoke

                                ethan contd
                 wont be on holiday

     ethan with a fair amount of disgust gets to his feet and jumps 
     off the mountain in what for a moment looks like a suicidal 
     snit  then somewhere hundreds of feet below camera theres a 
     little puff of color as the tulipshaped chute pops out of his 
     backpack  begin the sound of a castanets and the animallike cries 
     of flamenco dancers

                                                        dissolve to

     ext  andalusian villa eve

     bustling in the activity of a large private party with arriving 
     guests and attentive valets as a young woman her face unseen 
     exits her car and enters the villa

     a flash of skirt and lace intext villa  flamenco dancers  eve

     where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands 
     wielding the castanets  the dancers perform on a raised platform 
     and nyah nordoffhalls face can be glimpsed thru the swirling 
     skirts and pounding heels looking thru not at them

     reverse angle  ethan

     looking back in a similar way to nyah surreal lighting and the 
     relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the 
     crowed party  nyah continues to look at ethan over the shoulder 
     over her wannabe escort a very attentive gentleman  nyah 
     offers up her empty glass and the gentleman eagerly takes it to 
     the bar for a refill leaving nyah and ethan looking at one 
     another  ethan approaches her

                                ethan
                do you know me

                                nyah

                                ethan

                                nyah

                                ethan
                oh  well  i think that can be arranged

                                nyah

                                ethan
                theres not enough time in the world for 
                any of it to be bad

     this stops her  nyah moves closer to him until theyre nose 
     to nose  whispered but breezy

                                nyah
                look its either you or the rent and i 
                dont mind telling you its not an easy 
                choice

                what if i pay the rent

                                nyah

                                ethan
                uhhuh

     glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink 
     then

                                nyah
                go find the wealthy lady you came with and 
                next time we meet  ill pay your rent 
                        kissing him sweetly
                now bugger off

     and purposeful creature that she is she takes her frustrated 
     desire upstairs timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of 
     the dancers steps to cover her own  once upstairs a security 
     guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her
     down the hall both moving past a pair of windows visible to 
     ethan  in a few moments nyah can be seen past the 
     windows in the opposite direction without the guard following  
     in another moment or two a very puzzled looking security guard 
     can be glimpsed in the first window looking up and down the 
     hall clearly having lost sight of nyah  ethan smiles moves out 
     of shot

     int  master bedroom eve

     nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom

     int  bath eve

     a decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting mirrored 
     walls  the tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler         
     chilling a bottle of crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of 
     ice  nyah cant resist  she spoons a dollop of the caviar and 
     downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to 
     its back  there she pulls out her compact and removes the puff 
     revealing an electronic density meter  she turns it on and holds 
     it at the rear of the tub  its sweep gauge jumps sharply from 
     green thru yellow and into red

                                nyah
                        her fondest hopes confirmed
                mmmm

     she now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the 
     tiles just above the sop dish  her knee eyes search for any 
     cracks in the grout and she spots one  using a tweezers she 
     pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles revealing 
     something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles  
     she slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish

     theres the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble 
     casing out from the rear of the tub  nyah breathes a sigh of 
     relief and anticipation kneeling in the tub she finds herself 
     looking down at an open safe revealing some halfdozen locked 
     compartments  as she studies them

                                ethan
                decisions decisions

     nyah looks up to see ethans reflection in the bathroom 
     mirrors looking down at her kneeling in the tub

                                nyah
                what are you doing here

                                ethan
                think youre the only one who can pick a 
                lock

                                nyah
                        not altogether pleased
                i see  youre not just another pretty face

     before ethan can answer a voice can be heard coming from the 
     bedroom warbling granada in spanish and with considerable gusto

                                nyah contd
                oh god  a bloody baritone

     nyah catches a reflection behind ethans in the bathroom mirror  
     she reaches up and grabs ethan by the lapel yanking him into the 
     tub pulling him down on top of her  once again theyre nose to 
     nose
                                
                                ethan
                i take it you prefer tenors

     she glances up at the mirror  in it is the reflection of senor 
     augusto de larena a big amiable castilian in his fifties whos 
     changing a white dinner jacket thats had wine split on it  he 
     breaks into a heavily accented version of now or never and 
     disappears from the dressing room mirror

                                nyah
                would you mind if im on top

                                ethan
                oh either way works for me

     with a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of ethan and begins 
     working on one of the safe compartments using a tiny torque 
     wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara 
     brush  she glances down and is rather disconcerted  continues 
     working with the pick and wrench

                                ethans voice
                youre never gonna find it there

                                nyah
                        she jumps dropping the torque wrench
                damn it  find what

                                ethan
                his exwifes bulgari necklace that goes 
                up for auction tuesday

     looking down to ethan a touch of indignation

     looking up

     more or less hands locked behind his neck as he rests against 
     the raked back of the tub his eyes and nose inches from nyahs 
     lower pelvic region as she straddles him  not exactly in the mood 
     to move

     she stiffens  he knows too damn much

                                nyah
                 rightwhere is it

                                ethan
                far right 

     she immediately switches her efforts from top left to the
     bottom right compartment  shes utterly nonplussed

                                nyah
                wheres the bloody 

                                ethan
                        plucking it off his chest
                        offering it up like a mechanic
                        under the chassis
                 torque wrench

                                nyah
                 this is very disconerting

                                ethan
                hey you put me here  i just do what im
                told

                                nyah
                 right

     she unstraddles him and with a few deft moves with the torque
     wrench and carbide pick  and its open  she withdraws a velvet
     pouch and opens the pouch  out spills the spectacular necklace

                                nyah contd
                lovely

                                ethan
                that

     the bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards gun drawn
     senor de larena looking highly upset pops in

                                senor de larena
                oh senor keyes thank god it is you

                                ethan
                 did feel that she had rather too long to
                work on the safe before they triggered the
                alarm isnt that right miss hall

                                nyah

                should yes

     nyahs initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary
     intensified curiosity  about ethan

                                ethan
                under the circumstances i think we would
                recommend resetting the senors to
                respond to a lighter load  how do you
                feel about forty kilos miss hall

                                nyah

                to disrupt your party any longer  we have
                some further concerns about the disposition
                of your security guards which youll

                morning hard copy to follow  shall we

                miss hall havent you forgotten
                something

     nyah looking genuinely puzzled

                                nyah
                the necklace

     nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering
     string of diamonds and rubies from her bust

                                senor de larena
                        a great kidder

     the stars dimming the sky a gun metal blue  ethan and nyah
     emerge from the villa walking slowly  nyahs clearly
     preoccupied

                                nyah
                        as she moves to her car
                youre apologizing for me  quite the
                gentleman

                                ethan
                        opening the car door
                not really  i triggered the alarm

     one foot on the floorboard she freezes back to ethan

                                ethan
                hey the bulgari job last week was
                flawless  and ive always been partial to
                pale yellows

     she slides behind the wheel

                                nyah
                        as he leads on the car
                i dont do laundry or put up with
                cheeky bastards who set me up on their
                territory so they can poach on mine

     she takes off spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake
     ethan smiles and shakes his head

     on the road  nyah moving

     around curves hair flying shes free  her car phone rings
     perplexed she lets it ring once or twice picks it up

                                nyah
                        tentatively
                hola

                                ethan
                hi  would you mind slowing down

                even have it

                                ethan voice
                would you like it

     she hits the end button and disconnects  the phone immediately
     rings again  she refuses to pick up  ethan pulls alongside hers
     she looks at him  they speak through the open cars

                                ethan
                pull over and listen to me will you
                just listen

                                nyah

                i need your help and i thin you can use
                mine

                authority  i can make them go away

                                nyah
                oh bloody hell  youre a spy

     she floors it and shoots ahead of ethan nicking his car as she takes off

                                ethan
                        to himself
                i deserved that

     series of driving shots  nyah and ethan

     ethan rings her again  and keeps ringing  her face becomes
     grim her flight progressively more desperate and with ethans
     pursuit progressively more determined  they are reaching the
     limits of adhesion around blind curves

     more shots driving dawn

     the skys battleship gray ethan pursues nyah around hairpin
     turns high above the costa del sol they rip thru patches of
     marine fog drifting on the road obscuring it

     both are appalled by the others willingness to escalate risk in
     this game of flight and pursuit until ethan tears thru a fogbank
     and sees on his gps what nyah cant see thru the fog  
     less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she cant possibly
     negotiate and if she cant shell plunge off the road hundreds of
     feet to rock and sea below  ringing her number again

                                ethan
                        half to himself
                slow down slow down

     she turns up a mound and loses control  she spins out and heads
     toward the edge of the cliff

                                nyah
                        realizing shes in trouble
                uhoh

     ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin
     her car stops just at the cliffs edge

     furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out

                                ethan
                no

     suddenly theres no nyah  ethan leaps over to nyahs car and
     sees nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet
     below holding the door handle

                                nyah
                ohoh

     taking a firm grip on her wrist

                                ethan
                dont look down  justlook at me
                thats itthats it

     he pulls nyah up to the car across the seat and half into
     his arms  for a long moment it looks like shes in shock  then
        
                                nyah
                whats you name

                                ethan
                ethan hunt

                                nyah
                well ethan hunt what is it you want to
                talk to me about

     thru the veil of morning fog nyah looks at ethan  her dark eyes
     suggest wit and willingness and longing

                                ethan
                more than i thought
                
     they scarcely to move to bring their lips together

                                nyah
                awfully short notice

                                ethan
                care to wait a decent interval

                                nyah
                who wants to be decent

     dissolve

     close  ethan intext safehouse  seville  dayeve

     sleeping  his eyes open slowly  he comes to full consciousness
     his head still on the pillow  something approaching serious
     anxiety informs his features  he lifts his head and looks at his
     left angle widening  nyah lies on her side facing him        
     sleeping serenely  anxiety on the order of ohgodthisisnt
     approvedrecruitingtechnique confirmed  he lets his head flop
     back on the pillow  then he turns so he and nyah are profile to
     profile  as he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades replaced
     by curiosity and even wonder  he lifts his hand and just
     brushes her cheek  her eyes open  she knows where she is

                                ethan
                so whatve you got against spooks

     nyah smiles

                                nyah
                when theyve got your recruiting
                technique  not a thing

                                ethan
                oh  wellthis isnt exactly by the book

                                nyah
                theyve got a book for this

                                ethan
                theyve got a book for everything

                                nyah
                the only other spook i knew was a liar
                charming but absolutely incapable of
                telling the truth  hed lie about his
                favorite color  but then i reckon its an
                occupational hazard  all spies really do
                is conceal the truth and tell lies

                not revealing information doesnt
                necessarily make someone a liar

                                nyah

                                ethan

                                ethan
                you gotta be kidding

     swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a dvd and
     projected onto a computer screen staring back at ethan is

     vladimir nekhorvich

                                nekhorvich
                        with exaggerate brio
                well dmitri  how are you

     nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply  ethan smiles

                                ethan
                im fineand you

                                nekhorvich
                im fine

     ethan laughs

                                ethan
                im fine and youre fine

     with ethan simultaneously whispering

                                nekhorvich
                im fine too im fine and youre fine  do
                you remember dear fried how you got
                sergei and i to repeat those lines from dr
                strangelove and we gave you the name of that 
                silly soviet premier because we didnt know
                your namein those days you not only
                saved our lives you saved our sanity  now
                then dmitri  we have this little problem
                every search for a hero must begin with
                something that every hero requires a 
                villain  therefore in a search for our
                hero bellerophon we created a monster
                chimera  i beg you dmitri come to sydney
                and accompany me to atlanta immediately
                however we travel i must arrive at me
                destination within 20 hours of departure
                forgive this fanciful explanation but for
                now prudence dictates that i communicate
                nothing but the gravest urgency
                i fear i can entrust this to no one but
                you dmitri  as we say im sorry and
                youre sorry

     swanbeck stops the dvd

                                swanbeck
                let me ask you something  you have any
                idea what the hell hes talking about

     ethan smiles

                                ethan
                an idea yeah

                                swanbeck
                like

                                ethan
                like its a good idea to pick him up in a
                hurry  and a bad idea to fly him on a
                commercial carrier  so lets get on with
                it  hes still in sydney

                                swanbeck
                dr vladimir nekhorvich is dead  so is his
                colleague gradski but that happened
                earlier  we had nekhorvich on a flight
                from sydney that crashed in the rockies

     ethan sits back heavily

                                swanbeck contd
                 hunt are you listening

     slowly looking up

                                ethan
                if he didnt want to go anywhere without
                me how did you get him on the flight

                                swanbeck
                you were there

     swanbeck clears his throat  he turns back to the computer and 
     punches inmission double imagefile open to computer scans
     of ambrose sean and hunt ethan the computer scanning and
     comparing their features millimeter by millimeter stat by stat
     as the computer then imposes with the help of the physiognomy
     scan ethans face on ambrose hence mission double image

     ethan

     slowly looks up at swanbeck

                                swanbeck
                when i couldnt find you i had to replace
                you  sean ambrose was the obvious choice
                he double you what  two three times

                                ethan
                twice

                                swanbeck
                what did you think of him

                                ethan 
                you know we had reservations about each
                other  isnt it a little late in the day
                to be asking me that

                                swanbeck
                not necessarily

     swanbeck shows ethan a photo of airline captain

                                swanbeck
                airline record list captain harold
                macintosh as the pilot for flt 2207  as
                far as the media and all governmental
                agencies are concerned captain macintosh
                died on the flight but in fact he missed
                it  he did however make the next flight 
                in cargo stuffed into a rather small 
                suitcase considering his size

     another photo of an open suitcase the body in it partially
     obscured by a ring of police and customs officers

                                swanbeck contd
                someone on that flight planned an
                operation designed to down the plane and
                make it look like an accident  someone
                skillful enough to bring the whole thing
                off without a hitch but  they dont
                always get your luggage on the plane even
                when you fly first class

                                ethan
                so theres one thing we know ambrose
                doesnt

                                swanbeck
                then you do think it was ambrose

     ethan barely nods

                                swanbeck contd
                and youre not surprised

     ethan gives swanbeck a look

                                ethan
                whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean
                wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact
                that he took it

                                swanbeck
                enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred
                innocent passengers

     ethan smiles

                                ethan
                sean feels he hasnt done the job unless
                he leaves a lot of hats on the ground

                                swanbeck
                the question is why  what was this
                chimera nekhorvich was carrying

     ethan rises and moves to the window

                                ethan
                right now only ambrose knows that

                                swanbeck
                in any case youve got to recover chimera
                and bring it to us

                                ethan
                in order to do that ive got to figure
                out how he plans to make money with it

                                swanbeck
                 right  in fact since the plane went
                down our banking sources have confirmed a
                marked increase in the stock pilling of
                cash in terrorists accounts

                                ethan
                terrorists

                                swanbeck
                well you know nekhorvichs history
                youre the one who got him out of the
                soviet union was it still in bio
                weapon business

                                ethan
                if thats what youre thinking ambrose
                would have set up a bidding situation with
                any number of buyers before he got on the
                plane  locating him in time to stop
                something like that  

                                swanbeck
                 is where miss hall comes in

                                ethan
                        blindsided
                excuse me

                                swanbeck
                miss hall and ambrose had a relationship
                which he took very seriously  she walked
                away and hes wanting her back ever
                since  we believe shes our surest and 
                quickest way of location him

                                ethan
                        acidly
                and then what

                                swanbeck
                then makes sure she continues to see him
                gets him confide in her and report to
                you

                                ethan
                you made it sound as if i was recruiting
                her for her skills as a thief

                                swanbeck
                well then i mislead you  or you made the 
                wrong assumption  either way were asking
                her to resume a prior relationship not do 
                anything she hasnt already done

                                ethan
                shes got no training for this kind of
                thing

                                swanbeck
                go to bed with a man and lie to him
                shes a woman  shes got all the training
                she needs

     ethans anger flashes but does his best to contain it

                                ethan
                i dont think i can get her to do it

                                swanbeck
                you mean itll be difficult

                                ethan
                very

                                swanbeck
                well its not missiondifficulthunt
                its missionimpossibledifficult should
                be a walk in the park for you  if you can
                think of a quicker way to get to ambrose
                youre welcome to try  oh by the way you
                might want to take a look at theseif you
                have any further qualms about getting her
                to do the job

     he pulls out a little minolta digital camera identical to the
     one in nekhorvichs bag at airport security  swanbeck sets it on
     the table  ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye

     ext  bar night

     a grim ethan starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever
     more lively crowd  as he does

                                street vendor
                senor senor  your flowers

     the vendor holds up the spring bouquet  ethan seems genuinely
     surprised by them

                                ethan
                yes  theyre very nice

     and hes lost in the crowd leaving a very puzzled vendor holding
     the bouquet

     still of crash site in rockies thru minolta still camera

     one after the other flashing by  they are more evocative than
     specific in their suggestion of an abrupt fiery ending where
     the lives of hundred are literally and figuratively torn apart
     and strewn over a desolate landscape

     as the piling besides which it stands  but the features remain
     obscured by the sun at his back

     leans forward as the slender figure grows larger

     the tide is too low for the boat to dock making it necessary for
     he boat to approach the shore  the slender figure moves off the
     end of the dock and onto the beach

     the cigarette

     idles into shadow water but the props start chewing into the
     sand  the boatman grumbles he cant get any closer  the slender
     figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light
     changes  ambrose is waiting

     nyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant slips over the side
     into thighhigh water without taking her eyes off ambrose
     ambrose strides right on into the bay  as they are just an arms
     length apart

     judgment

     ethan strides away from the screen the edge in his voice and the 
     move not altogether lost on either luther or billy

     int  the bay ext palm beach  day

                and my room

     a long moment  ambrose walks to a mirrored wall  the mirrors
     are sliding doors  with a sweeping gesture he slides one of the
     mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer
     clothes

                                ambrose
                thought you could use a little something
                to wear

     nyah stares at the spectacular wardrobe  ambrose pulls out a
     slinky armani and drapes it on the bed

     ambrose sits on a chair by the window and waits  her blouse
     belt skirt fall on the bed  as her slender arm reaches down to
     pick up the armani

     ambrose

     grips her wrist the flimsy armani dangling in the air

                of a lion and the tail of a serpent who
                plagued the ancient world  i think nekhorvich
                has created a monster virus in chimera and 
                apparently the means to kill it in
                bellerophon

     note the same envelope seen at the track and hands it to

                do you trust her     

     as he speaks ambrose pulls a cigar case and a cutter out of his
     robe  takes a cigar out of the case and clips the end of the
     cigar the razorsharp cutter decapitates the tip of the cigar 
     like a guillotine

                                ambrose
                one considers her timing of course 
                getting nicked within a week of the plane
                going down  suggestive even borderline
                suspicious but hardly conclusive

                                stamp
                well youve thorough about it at any
                rate

     ambrose opens the cutter again to clean off the fragments of
     tobacco trapped by the cut

                                ambrose

     sean pulls stamps hand closer

                deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two
                or dont you think i can learn more from
                her than she can from me

     ambrose twists stamps wrist so that stamp drops to one knee
     trying to alleviate the pain

                                stamp
                        in pain

     around stamps pinkie

                                ambrose
                now hugh you must realize that some of us

                she thinks shes here but im willing to
                take the risk because hugh i am gaging
                for it

     ambrose closes the cutter on stamps finger and cuts the nail
     just nicking the top of the finger and drawing blood  stamp
     cries out  ambrose tosses stamp a napkin light his cigar and
     exhale

     overwhelming all but the announcers voice carrying everyone
     around the far turn and into the home stretch with a ringing
     controlled frenzy

     regains consciousness  hes got tubes coming out of every
     orifice and is contained in the equivalent of a plastic bubble
     drenched in perspiration and he looks around for a call button
     he grips the side of the bed

     decides to chance it  she moves onto the pier trying to glide
     by the boathouse  a figure darts out and grabs her  she tries to
     scream but cant  the figure whips her around and she sees

     he holds her

     int  hospital room

     mccloys strapped down but manages to reach the call button and
     push it  again and again

                                nekhorvich
                no use my friend  the medical staff
                wants no part of this  doctors dont
                fancy the idea of dying any more than
                anybody else

     mccloy stares at nekhorvich for a long moment

                                mccloy
                how could ipossiblybe infected

     nekhorvich shrugs

                                nekhorvich
                thats exactly what gradski said  27
                hours before he died  withchimerathe
                most minute exposure can be fatal

     mccloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor  he grips
     the edge of the hospital bed

                                nekhorvich
                but then you shouldnt be feeling to ill
                not for another three of four hours 
                anyway

     mccloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety

                                mccloy
                you have bellerophon

                                nekhorvich
                        mildly
                do i

                                mccloy
                you took it  all of it  and what if i need
                it

                                nekhorvich
                        amused
                if  my my mythe five hundred
                people on bruny island that you
                deliberately infected withchimeraneeded
                it as well

                                mccloy
                oh please  how was i to know they had to
                be treated with bellerophon within twenty
                hours

                                nekhorvich
                by asking me

                                mccloy
                you still dont get it do you  you want
                to make an omelet you break a few eggs i needed to know just how bad the disease
                was in the real world not the lab  and
                you never know til you try  you thought
                you were genetically splicing together
                strains of influenza to create a 
                cure for all influenzas  but i saw you
                creating a disease so terrible inchimerathat the cure would be priceless

                                nekhorvich
                you wanted the disease in order to peddle
                the cure

                                mccloy
                well the thought had occurred to me  i needed
                chimera in order to peddle bellerophon  for
                hero to be appreciated you need a monster
                now thats not so difficult to understand is
                it  look time was a shot of penicillin could

                that  do give my regards to gradski if
                you see him
                
     int  hallway outside mccloys room

     nekhorvich heaves a sigh and rips off a latex mask and the vocal
     oscillator revealing an exhausted ethan  angle widens to
     include luther and billy in hospital greens

     luther and billy nod in disgusted assent

     ext  annex night nyah

     holds tight in her embrace with ethan

                ethan you know what frightens me most
                when im with himthe thought of never

                and were so close  so close  its
                critical that you do whatever ambrose

     he gives her an affectionate smile and she reluctantly heads back
     to the house her expression troubled even suspicious

     with implacable rage  he looks up to see stamp whos been
     obviously waiting for him  tearing the voice oscillator
     leaning with both hands on a countersurveillance monitor table
     he stares at the floor his face rictus of hateful intensity

                okay here you go 

     as luther speaks the building  on his computer graphics one
     with the biocyte pharmaceuticals elevators and renderings is
     being rapidly morphed to three dimension existence off the
     rendering specifications by luther as if the building itself
     were being constructed at a madly rapid pace from its foundation
     to its reinforced steel structure to its honeycombing of floors
     to its outer skin  luthers reconstitution of the building lot
     static but moving around and above it even as he proceeds

                all storage and production of chimera is
                done here in this lab on the fortysecond
                floor the heart of the building

     biocyte lab

     only about eight personnel  chemists in lab coats workers in
     biocontainment suits etc  populate the lab passing through
     security door and air locks monitoring the virus stock pading
     the injection gun etc

                                luthers voice
                chimera itself is kept in two places in
                production vials in an incubation room and
                housed in a small airtight chamber  inside
                three injection guns

                if you look at hunts operational history he
                invariably favors misdirection and deception
                for a start he wont go into biocyte from the
                ground where he has to risk confrontation
                with security

     int  incubation zone

     in front of each of three large television monitors is a vial
     shaped roughly like a sealed beaker somewhere between one and two
     liters in size  each one is contained behind plexiglas and each 
     one pale yellow one sunset red  behind them are monitors marked
     respectively  working seed stock master seed stock in vitro
     virus  behind these is a monitor screen with a blowup of the
     contents of the vials  the magnitude of the blowup  950000x

     these are xray microscope blowups ie allowing the viewer to
     see the motility of the virus and its metabolism not dissimilar
     to an mri this of chimera in its three different cultures

     ethans on the computer controls racing thru to working seed
     stock which calls for optimal levels of 69 ph and 11 
     degrees celsius  he drops the ph to zero and punches up the
     temperature to a hundred  the effect on the greenish hue in
     the bottle is subtle but immediate  not so subtle is the
     effect on the virus seeds viewed microscopically  they
     immediately appear agitated their microscopic dna innards
     contracting and expanding

     ethan moves on to the master seed stock and the in vitro virus
     panels on the computer  the changes he makes are reflected on
     the digital monitoring panels before each viral container

     the working seed

                you know that was the hardest part of
                having to portray you  grinning like an
                idiot every fifteen minutes

                                ethan
                i wouldve thought the hardest part was
                exercising restraint  curbing that
                pressing need of your to get your gun 
                off  you were in such a hurry to knock
                off that 747 you never figured out where
                the virus really was

                                ambrose
                i knew where it was

                                ethan
                oh  then you knew the only way 
                could smuggle the live virus to the cdc
                scientists in atlanta was by injecting
                himself and using his own bloodstream as a 
                petri dish doing it inside of twenty
                hours so he could take the antivirus and
                still have it be effective  you knew that
                while you were knocking him off and
                destroying the very thing you came for

     ethan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen
     round clip into his weapon and he punctuates this last with a
     spray of gunfire attempting to cover his own effort to the reach
     the injection gun  the return fire nearly hits the injection
     gun kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the
     floor

                                ambrose
                stop  put a sock in it  hit that bloody
                gun and youll spray the bloody virus all
                over the place

     everybodys regained cover but the injection gun remains out of
     everybodys reach

     once in the open he exchanges direct gunfire with ambroses
     team wounding a couple men  he reaches the wall and dives thru
     camera with him as he drops 25 stories the sound of gunfire in
     the air all around him

     less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute
     deploys and ethan is lost from view beneath it

                 since it appears that chimera the
                mother of all nightmares is on the loose
                somewhere around here  is there any way
                this disaster can be viewed as a qualified
                one

                                ethan
                        tightlipped
                not yet  we did manage to pull any
                sensitive equipment and material out of
                our safehouse wreckage

                                swanbeck
                we could lock down passport control and
                all ports of authority but that wont
                stop ambrose and beyond him we dont
                know who else were looking for  all 
                terrorist bank accounts of which were
                aware are stable  no deposits no
                withdrawals  therefore no suspects

                                ethan
                we think weve got our finger on the 
                buyer

                                swanbeck
                do you  even assuming youre able to
                prevent ambrose selling chimera youve
                now got an additional problem  you
                destroyed all of chimera at biocyte  if
                ambrose is going to sell chimera now
                hell have to do it by taking a pint or so
                of miss halls blood to market

                                ethan
                yes i believe thats right

                                swanbeck
                but that leaves another seven or eight
                pints of chimera

                                ethan
                you mean that leaves miss hall

                                swanbeck
                yes i believe thats right  now my
                understanding is that 20 hours after
                exposure the victim becomes infectious
                highly infectious

     ethan glances at his chronometer  swanbeck sees it

                                swanbeck contd
                you noted the time of exposure

     ethan nods

                                swanbeck contd
                 good  then if you manage to get hold of
                ambrose and obtain what hes got youve
                got 
                        glancing at the chronometer
                 8 hours 57 minutes and twentythree
                seconds to destroy the largest remaining
                source of chimera on earth

                                ethan
                she sacrificed herself

                                swanbeck
                brave girl  if you can get hold of
                bellerophon with the time limit you may
                spare her the ultimate sacrifice  but in
                either case youve got less than nine
                hours to kill her or cure her  after that
                its out of our hands and a matter of
                worldwide material law  and hunt  however
                you obtain it we want you to preserve a
                sample of chimera  bring it back alive

                arent you even curious  about why she
                did it

                                swanbeck
                no  i cant afford to be curious  and
                neither can you hunt

     intensity the overcast sky filtering into the loft seems
     particularly oppressive  ethans up against it and he knows it

     ethan and ambrose rise from the fall  ethan jumps up and sweeps
     ambrose dropping him to the ground  ethan begins strangling
     ambrose but gets knocked off and when they both stand ambrose
     gets ethan in a choke hold

     ambrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits ethan in the
     midsection and the face  ethan kicks it out of his hand and
     connects with several punches knocking ambrose to the ground

     kneeling ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts
     ethan across the back and face  ambrose dives on ethan and the
     knife is poised above ethans eye before ethan grabs the knife
     and clears holding it out toward ambrose

                                ambrose
                go ahead  use it hunt  its not a bad
                way to go  a lot better than the way that
                bitch is going to die

     ambrose swings again and misses and ethan delivers a series of
     kicks leaving ambrose stunned and barely standing  ethan steps
     back and with a running start strikes ambrose with a leaping
     kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his
     hand

     ethan turns and walks away from ambrose toward the cliff edge
     the copter lands and luther runs toward ethan but pulls up
     looking over ethans shoulder  ambrose has a gun aimed at        
     ethans back

                                ambrose
                hunt  you should have killed me

     near hunts feet is his own gun obscured from ambroses view by
     dust from the copter  ethan tosses the canister to luther and
     then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air  he
     catches it drops down and fires killing ambrose

     int  cultural museum

     didgeridoo music  a child admires a painting  swanbeck and ethan
     face one another  a long long pause  for a moment it appears as
     if swanbeck has lost awareness of ethans presence

                                swanbeck
                sorry ethan  i dont quite know where to
                begin  any suggestions

                                ethan
                youd like me to conduct my own
                debriefing

                                swanbeck
                why not  youve done just about
                everything else on this operation

                                ethan
                id thank you  but im not sure that was
                a compliment

                                swanbeck
                of course it was  anyone whose operations
                requires the level of disinformation that
                yours do is bound to get a little flak
                here and there  you try flogging the
                stories on cnn ive had to come up with
                about whats been going on around here the
                last few days  at any rate its been
                most instructive  what theyll swallow
                or what theyll broadcast with a straight
                face
                        picking up a file
                miss halls blood it appears has
                absolutely no elements of the chimera
                virus  not even antibodies

                                ethan
                yes i gathered as much

                                swanbeck
                and the only other remaining sample was in
                the canister you recover from ambrose

                                ethan
                yes

                                swanbeck
                and that appears to have been destroyed
                it also contained the antivirus
                bellerophon

                                ethan
                well bellerophon it turns out was only
                really effective against chimera

                                swanbeck
                but you were under specific instructions
                to bring back a living sample of the
                chimera virus  id be very interested to
                know how after youd managed its recovery
                intact it subsequently got destroyed

                                ethan
                by fire  thats the best way really


                                swanbeck
                so you didnt fail mission you simply
                changed it

     ethan doesnt respond

                                swanbeck contd
                its no longer enough for you to execute
                and implement imf policy you now wish to
                go in the business of creating it

                                ethan
                no i dont  but in this case 

                                swanbeck
                in this case it wasnt a bad idea  in
                face it was a pretty damn good idea
                just dont make a habit of it  and as for
                ms hall in light of her efforts her
                criminal records will certainly be
                expunged  im assuming you approve

                                ethan
                i do

                                swanbeck
                where is she now by the way  do you
                know

                                ethan
                i dont  no exactly

                                swanbeck
                well hunt what are your plans

                                ethan
                not sure  some sort of vacation  ill
                let you know where im going

                                swanbeck
                oh you dont have to do that wouldnt 
                be a vacation if you did

     ext  sydney day

     ethan emerges to a very crowded street  billy and luther are
     waiting  both look to ethan

                                luther
                        worried
                so what did he say

                                ethan
                good job  and thanks

                                billy
                        incredulous
                thats it  thats it thats it

                                luther
                        dryly looking at billy
                and the checks in the mall

                                billy
                right  just remember mates  billy
                bairds the name  anything you need to
                get move or watch im your man

     and billys gone  ethan and luther remain alone both reluctant
     to say anything both reluctant to leave

     one quick bear hug then

                                luther
                always nice hearing from you man  stay in 
                touch

     and luthers off  ethan looks after him a bit wistfully  then
     curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd  after a half
     dozen steps something catches his eyes  he stops

     one quick bear hug then

                                nyah
                        a tad wary
                do you know me

     nyah

     is inches from him  without batting an eye


                                ethan
                no  should i

                                nyah
                no  you just looked as if you did

                                ethan
                no

     she wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable
     conviction

                                ethan contd
                just as if id like to

                                nyah
                oh  well

     he kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for
     hers

                                nyah contd
                i think that can be arranged

     looks around at the swirling crowd

                                ethan
                lets get lost

     and in a moment theyve vanished from the frame and into the
     crowd  camera begins to pull back the bustling crowd ever
     filling the frame  and in the distance perhaps just a splash
     of a bouquet of flowers can be seen appearing to bounce along on
     its own the rising beat of the mi theme
