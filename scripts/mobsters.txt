               in the bedroom

               charlie stands back trying to figure out what hes missed 
               he returns to the dresser and pulls a drawer all the way out 
               of the cabinet taped to the back of the drawer is an envelope 
               stuffed with twenty dollar bills stuffing the envelope into

               a crack meyer peers out from under brim of his black hat 
               pious to a fault behind him maranzano glimpses the others

               capone sticks a cigar in his mouth and strikes a match to 
               light it the side window explodes under a shower of bullets 
               from a passing car

               capone

               dives to the floor charlie pulls a pistol from his jacket 
               and returns the fire as the limo driver jerks the steering 
               wheel to the left ramming the limousine into the side of 
               the other car a second hail of bullets cuts the limo diver 
               dead the two cars careen together crashing into a parked 
               car

               outside the crashed cars

               as the gunman escapes from the second car he tosses his 
               empty machine gun aside pulls out a pistol and runs down 
               an alley leaving his wounded driver behind

               capone looks up from the floor

               the stub of his cigar clenched in his teeth the remainder 
               shot off charlie strikes a match and lights capones cigar

                                     charlie
                         youre a big target al finish your 
                         cigar

               luciano

               advances down the pitch dark alley pistol drawn silhouetted 
               against the light from the street behind him a flash of 
               gunfire from the end of the alley sends charlie diving behind 
               a line of trash cans

               charlie crawls down the alley

               using the trash cans as cover two more shots ring out 
               bouncing off the trash cans charlie shouts to the gunman

                                     charlie
                         thats three

               peering over the trash cans charlie can see that the alley 
               is a dead end but he still cant make out the gunman luciano 
               grabs a bottle and tosses it down the alley as the gunman 
               wastes a shot on the decoy charlie dashes across the alley 
               ducking behind a dumpster

                                     charlie
                         four

               charlie pushes the dumpster down the alley as he crouches 
               behind it as he nears the end of the alley two more shots 
               ping off the sides of the dumpster

                                     charlie
                         five six

               charlie turns his back to the dumpster gun drawn waiting 
               for the rat to scurry from his hole

               the gunman

               cowering at the end of the alley drops his emptied gun to 
               the pavement he looks to the right of the dumpster then 
               the left torn over which path to take he makes a run to 
               the left

               as the gunman races past the dumpster

               charlie calmly takes aim and fells him with a single shot

               as charlie approaches the limousine

               capone rises from his crouch in the back seat

                                     charlie
                         nobody kills a guy who owes me money

                                                                    cut to

               int railroad dining car  day

               as charlie and tommy are seated charlie looks around at the 
               sober welldressed businessmen at breakfast suddenly aware 
               of the vulgarity of his attire charlie adjusts his jacket

               the waiter lays a bowl of oatmeal in front of tommy

               and a plate of corn beef hash topped with a poached egg before

               briefest of glittering costumes steps out to the wild cheers 
               of the guys followed by another and another meyer squirms

               along his neck

               charlie stands to one side alone and content

               while the others pour champagne down each others throats

               of his mouth he picks up a champagne glass from the side of 
               the tub and sips for this moment utterly content

               and each caress of his lips the praise of a poet

               another angle

               and will falls prey to desire

                         a hundred years ago austria was run 
                         by a prince named metternich austria 
                         was weak and its neighbors were 
                         strong but they were ruled by 
                         passionate men while metternich was 
                         ruthless and brilliant if one country 
                         got too strong he rallied an alliance 
                         against it he would lead all of 
                         europe to the brink of war then 
                         bring the enemies together and forge 
                         the peace

               rothstein cups his hands in front of him

                                     rothstein
                         he barely had an army but he had 
                         europe by the balls

               rothsteins words hang in the air the boys a bit bewildered 
               by the highflown rhetoric

                                     lansky

               ext the jersey woods  dusk

               by the side of a two lane road luciano and costello axes 
               in hand chop awkwardly at the trunk of a tree dropping the 
               axes they push against the trunk which finally cracks and 
               falls away from the road with a great crash

               up the road

               lansky walks along a railroad track he steps on a lever 
               mechanism built into the rail

               at the grade

               where the rails cross the road the warning signal clangs 
               and flashes red siegel waves to lansky down the track he 
               pours water from a ten gallon container down the face of the 
               grade

                                                                    cut to

               ext road  night

               headlights swing into view around a curve in the road

               int truck  same

               a brawny driver squints at the road ahead a hawkfaced gunman 
               rides shotgun the railroad grading looms into view the 
               warning signal flashing and clanging

               outside the truck

               as the gunman shotgun in hand moves cautiously up the 
               grading his breath blowing white in he cold he slips on 
               the ice that has formed the blast of his gun echoes through 
               the night he waves sheepishly to the driver

               inside the truck

               the driver shouts to the men in the back of the truck

                                     driver
                              in italian
                         it was only an accident

               in the woods

               costello and luciano struggle to topple a tree unable to do 
               so they pick up their axes and slash desperately at the 
               trunk

               shooting through the truck windshield

               the gunman limps toward the truck rubbing his ass another 
               blast shatters the night and the gunmans chest explodes 
               splattering his guts across the windshield as he falls we 
               see siegel a wool scarf wrapped across his face scramble 
               up from the ditch at the side of the road his shotgun 
               smoking

               the panicked driver

               slams the truck into gear running over the body of the 
               gunman

               siegel fires again

               shattering the windshield then leaps back into the ditch

               the truck moves halfway up the grade

               where its rear wheels spin helplessly on the ice

               the driver sees siegel climb back out of the ditch

               and calmly pull a pistol from his coat he struggles to get 
               the truck into reverse as siegel levels his gun the truck 
               lurches backward bumping sickeningly over the body of the 
               gunman

               on luciano and costello

               as they push mightily against the tree trunk it cracks and 
               crashes across the road cutting off the path of the truck

               lansky and luciano

               scarves pulled across their faces race toward the truck 
               from opposite sides of the road they beat their pistols on 
               its sides and order the men to throw their guns out

               siegel rips the top off a bag of rock salt

               and pours the contents across the grade he trots toward the 
               front of the truck his pistol leveled at the driver

               costello  also masked

               moves out of the woods toward the rear of the truck as siegel 
               roughly drags the driver around to the back of the truck 
               costello shoves his pistol under the drivers chin

                                     frank
                              in italian
                         tell them to throw their guns out

                                     driver
                              in italian
                         its impossible do as they say

               costello pulls the driver in front of him as a shield siegel 
               climbs up onto the rear bumper and unlatches the door

               amidst the stacked cases of scotch

               stand two guards in long coats

                                     frank
                              in italian
                         throw out your guns and coats

               the guards comply and step off the truck hands raised over 
               their heads luciano lansky costello and siegel surround 
               them all still masked all with guns leveled siegel pats 
               the first guard down he pulls an antique gold watch from 
               the mans vest pocket the guard grabs for siegels hand

                                     first guard
                         no

               luciano and lansky move in closer to bugsy

                                     luciano
                         forget it

                                     siegel
                         fuck em

               siegel jerks his hand away gripping the watch in his fist 
               beside his face the guard grabs at the watch catching 
               bugsys scarf and pulling it from his face

               siegel

               knocks the guard to the ground beating him viciously with 
               his pistol as the guard begs for mercy siegel slams the 
               barrel of his pistol into the guards mouth and fires siegel 
               stands up and looks to the second guard

               truck horn blasts

               a pair of headlight beams swing across the scene as a second 
               truck identical to the first screeches to a halt just short 
               of the fallen tree the second guard makes a run but siegel 
               cuts him down

               the driver breaks away from costello

               and dives into the foliage of the fallen tree

               gunmen

               pour out of the second truck and open fire shots ring out 
               from both sides with the driver caught in the middle

               luciano

               runs to the front of the truck and jumps behind the wheel 
               the engine whines but wont turn over

               costello and lansky

               seek cover along the sides of the truck but siegel charges 
               boldly out into the open firing into the foliage of the 
               tree

               on the roof of the second truck

               a gunman draws a bead on siegel as he advances on the tree 
               as if by instinct siegel looks up at the gunman on the roof 
               and blasts him away tossing the pistol aside he pulls 
               another from his coat

               as the truck roars to life  costello and lansky

               climb into the back shouting for siegel to join them

               siegel continues to blast away

               at the fallen tree when another gunman jumps out from behind 
               the truck and wings bugsy on the right hand

               bugsy retreats to the departing truck

               looking back as meyer and frank pull him aboard the driver 
               crawls out of the branches of the fallen tree and on toward 
               the second truck

               outside the truck

               as it roars up the grade rear tires catching on the salt 
               the truck bounces over the tracks and speeds on down the 
               road

               inside the truck

               charlie slams a fist against the steering wheel

               for the hijack the contents of the bar are scattered across 
               the coffee table indicating serious drinking in progress 
               costello glowers at siegel as bugsy uses his bandaged right 
               hand to pour a fresh measure of scotch

               of the table and holds the jagged edge to his opposite wrist

                         is it blood ya want

               siegel jams his wrist against the jagged edge sparking a 
               trickle of blood he holds his wrist over the table letting 
               the blood drip into an empty glass he milks his arm to 
               increase the flow of blood

                         we got exactly two choices maranzano 
                         or masseria

                                     siegel
                         they dont give a shit about us

                         masserias scared he might make our 
                         deal

                                     siegel
                         we cant sell out to those guys 
                         they aint businessmen

               but nobody pays the slightest attention to bugsys protests

                                     frank
                         but maranzanos got the men and the 
                         brains

                                     luciano
                         which is why he doesnt need us

               frustrated at being ignored bugsy shouts

                                     siegel
                         all they care about is killing the 
                         nephew of some guy who screwed their 
                         grandmother fifty years ago

               charlie continues in a calm contained voice bugsy crosses 
               his arms across his chest and sulks

                                     luciano
                         at least masseria plays by the rules 
                         maranzano thinks hes god and the 
                         rules dont apply

                                     lansky
                         without us masseria dont stand a 
                         chance and he knows it

               the elevator doors slide open and luciano and costello step 
               out into the hallway looking down the empty corridor to a 
               brokennosed lug who stands guard by a door

               down the hallway

               as the lug swings the door open for them

               joe masseria

               sits in the center of the room at a table covered with hors 
               doeuvres meats and shellfish antipasto bowls of pastas 
               cheeses sauces fruits and pastries enough to feed a dozen 
               men he looks up from a pork loin he holds in both hands

               laying the pork loin aside masseria rises to greet charlie 
               and frank wiping his hands on his napkin before shaking 
               theirs

                                     masseria

               sonny catania enters by a side door and stands by a wall 
               regarding charlie with barely concealed contempt

                                     masseria

                         see if these two are my friends

               catania frisks them masseria grabs the pork loin and bites 
               in

                                     masseria
                         so eat

               sometime later

               frank and charlie sit back in their chairs the remnants of 
               their lunches before them across the table masseria has 
               managed to consume an incredibly large amount of food he 
               shoves an entire pastry in his mouth washing it down with 
               wine he scratches his distended belly and belches

                                     masseria

                         never threaten me boss

               masserias only response is a cold stare

                                     luciano
                         but yeah ill join up

               beaming with pleasure masseria picks up another pastry

                                     luciano
                         under the right conditions

               masserias enthusiasm fades as he chews on the pastry

                                     luciano

               catania bristles after a moments hesitation masseria nods

                                     luciano
                         we get a fair piece of all the action 
                         and everything from me and my 
                         associates goes into the pot

               masseria nods again

               this bastard but the time aint right

               outside the limousine

               as it pulls up past a car parked halfway up the sidewalk 
               next to it stands one of masserias henchmen its a narrow 
               street in the garment district little more than a alleyway 
               between two broad avenues runners push racks of clothes 
               trucks making deliveries clog the passage of traffic

               back in the limo

               in the front seat vito nods for charlie to go along the 
               pistol lays in charlies lap aimed at masseria charlies 
               finger strokes the trigger masseria notices and baits him 
               with the unnerving calm of the truly mad

                                     masseria

                         fight this out in hell

               boss

               of traffic they turn and look toward the bank building that 
               sits at the end of the alleyway on seventh avenue as they 
               pass the getaway car charlie slows fighting the urge to 
               flee

                                                                    cut to

               and dump it down a hillside

               the body

               beaten and bloody rolls to a stop at the bottom of the hill 
               colls eyes flicker open his mouth trembling in pain as 
               tears streak down his face you could almost feel sorry for 
               the guy

               as charlie and vito move down the alley a clap of thunder 
               unleashes a summer downpour pedestrians run for cover

               thin old man

               carrying a brown leather satchel scurries out of the bank 
               he hoists the satchel over his head as protection from the 
               rain

               vito heads down the sidewalk

               toward the payroll messenger charlie follows on the opposite 
               sidewalk scanning the alley for potential problems

               as the payroll messenger enters the alley

               a young man pushing a rack of garments through the rain 
               falls in behind him

               vito slows as he spots a policeman on horseback

               on seventh avenue the cop looks up the alley then rides 
               on

               at the service entrance to seventh avenue fashions

               a workman finishes loading a sidewalk elevator and yells 
               below for a coworker to bring it down

               as the payroll messenger

               nears seventh avenue fashions vito hurries to catch him

               across the street

               feeling for his gun charlie heads across the alley toward 
               vito a horn blares he jumps back and a long truck rolls 
               slowly past cutting off his path

               vito tackles the payroll messenger

               sending the satchel skidding across the wet sidewalk and 
               down the shaft of the sidewalk elevator the young man pushing 
               the garment rack pulls a pistol from his coat

               vito scrambles to his feet

               and races to the elevator as the cover closes he heaves it 
               back open the workman stands in the receding elevator 
               satchel at his feet looking up into the barrel of vitos 
               gun the workman squats and grabs the satchel

               as the truck finally passes

               charlie spots the young man with his gun out trying to 
               maneuver the rack out of his path desperate he pushes the 
               clothes aside and steps halfway through the rack gun drawn

               above the elevator

               as the terrified workman tosses the satchel up as vito grabs 
               it a shot knocks him to the sidewalk

               on the young man leaning through the rack

               as he takes dead aim for a second shot at vito

               charlie garbs the rack and jerks it down into the street

               pulling the gunman along with it charlie races to vito and 
               pulls him to his feet blood seeps through a hole in his 
               chest charlie grabs the satchel from his arms

               the mounted policeman

               appears at seventh avenue and charges up the alley on 
               horseback as charlie drags vito up the sidewalk charlie 
               pulls out his pistol and fires at the horse

               on the policeman

               as he and his horse tumble to the pavement

               charlie pushes vito into the back seat of the car

               tosses the satchel into the front and climbs behind the 
               wheel the car spins off the wet sidewalk crashing to the 
               street

               behind the car

               the dismounted policeman fires shattering the rear window

               inside the car

               as it slows its path blocked by the long truck that stopped 
               charlie as he tried to cross the street charlie jerks the 
               steering wheel sending the car up onto the sidewalk and 
               past the truck

               an hasidic jew carrying a package

               backs out of a doorway into the path of the oncoming car

               charlie slams on the brakes

               but the car slides on the wet pavement slamming into the 
               man with a sickening thud and sending him flying over the 
               hood up the windshield and across the roof of the car

               charlie beats on the steering wheel

               in frustration as the car pulls out onto eighth avenue the 
               rain cutting the smear of blood on the windshield charlie 
               looks back at vito sprawled in the back seat dead

               consumed with rage

               charlie grabs the satchel and dumps the money out the window

               on the street

               as a cloud of dollars dance on the urban canyon breeze

                                                                    cut to

               crown of his skull and his eyes roll back in his head

                                                              cut to black

               muffled voices over the sound of wood scrapping on concrete 
               the screeching of metal on metal and a hard splash of water

                                                                    cut to

               dripping wet his eyes fluter open charlie hangs by his 
               wrists from a beam his toes barely touching the ground 
               half a dozen men their faces covered with bandanas surround 
               him maranzano stands to one side as charlie stirs from his 
               stupor looking toward maranzano charlie shakes his head 
               no

               maranzano nods

               and the men converge on charlie working him over with belts 
               clubs and fists not a sound escapes from between charlies 
               clenched teeth

                                     maranzano
                         enough

               one of the men lights up a cigarette slipping it under his 
               bandana to smoke

                                     maranzano
                         one word and all this will end

               charlie stares at maranzano then croaks his response

                                     luciano
                         no

               maranzano shakes his head and nods to the man smoking

                         always the wrong word charlie

               close on charlie

               as the cigarette burns into his chest his body shaking in 
               pain as two of the men hold him another man lights up his 
               face glowing red in the light of the match then the men 
               back away as maranzano moves in closer to the barely conscious 
               luciano

                                     maranzano
                         they will still die even if you die 
                         first and all for nothing

               charlie tries to form his mouth into words his breath coming 
               in desperate gasps maranzano caresses charlies bloated 
               face

                                     maranzano
                         why must you hurt me like this

               charlie jerks his knee up into maranzanos groin

               maranzano doubles over and falls to the ground howling as 
               the men move in on charlie maranzano staggers back to his 
               feet he grabs a knife from one of the men and slashes 
               charlies face one of the men pulls out a gun leveling it 
               at charlies head maranzano knocks the man away

                                     maranzano
                         no let him live to see what the 
                         jews have cost him

               of the road a police car whizzes by but we hear it slow 
               down and pull over as the car doors open then slam shut 
               charlie looks up only now aware of the cops he collapses 
               into the gravel

                                                                    cut to

               the right side of his face sags where his facial muscles 
               were cut giving him a particularly sinister look gay tries 
               to help him turn over on his side

               from his forehead charlie grabs it away from her and uses

               in the courtyard  the guards

               cluster by the entrance to the foyer as the limousines appear 
               at the curb one of them taps on the foyer door lansky steps 
               into the courtyard and follows the guards to the street 
               charlie steps into the doorway blinking against the harsh 
               midday light he looks carefully up and down the courtyard 
               then signals for masseria

               as charlie steps aside to let masseria pass

               he spots the open windows on the third floor opposite the 
               only ones open on a cold day as masseria steps through the 
               door charlie throws himself at the boss sending them both 
               tumbling backwards into the foyer shotgun blasts tear the 
               door apart as masseria shimmies backwards across the floor 
               of the foyer

               charlie

               edges up to the wall breaks out a tiny window onto the court 
               and shoots up at the third floor

               one of the guards

               charges up the courtyard from the street only to be knocked 
               over by a shotgun blast the other guards stop in their 
               tracks

               to the corner and around toward the alley

               the two toughs

               throw their weapons to the floor sprint to the kitchen and 
               on down the rear service staircase followed closely by the 
               dog

               they dash along a narrow passageway

               that runs alongside the building darting between garbage 
               cans mans best friend still in hot pursuit

               at the end of the passageway

               the older tough scales a tall chain link fence as he throws 
               his leg over the top lansky jumps out from behind a wall 
               and blows the mans face clean off his skull his body topples 
               backwards landing at the feet of the young tough

               as the young tough backs up

               lansky shoves the barrel of the shotgun through the fence 
               and blasts him in the chest the dog yaps threateningly at 
               meyer

               in the foyer  masseria

               moves cautiously toward the door where charlie stands as 
               the guards outside shout confused instructions to one another

                                     masseria

                         want

               charlie grabs masseria playfully by the back of his fat neck 
               then kisses him sicilian style full on the lips

               maranzano and joe profaci give a friendly wave

               as they approach down a walkway to all appearances a pair 
               of harmless retirees at their leisure the great cats climb 
               to their feet and roar as though hailing the king

               maranzano thinks for a moment then extends his hand to shake

                                     maranzano
                         i will not interfere with you

               as charlie takes his hand maranzano pulls him into a bear 
               hug bringing his face next to charlies disfigured cheek

                                     maranzano
                         i am sorry for what i had to do

               luciano pulls out of the embrace struggling to be civil

               masseria sits behind a huge oak desk luciano leans across 
               the desk speaking in a low urgent whisper

                                     luciano

                         take action now

               masseria looks uneasily to the two guards standing by the 
               door he whispers to charlie

               charlie makes his way through a throng of wellwishers al 
               capone catches charlie in a bear hug and slips a fat envelope 
               into his hand charlie shakes his head and gives it back

               inside the hall

               as charlie makes his way up the center aisle with lansky 
               siegel and costello accepting the cheers and handshakes of 
               the crowd

                                                                    cut to

               sofa

               charlie walks down the hallway

               rubbing the exhaustion from his face at the bedroom door 
               he flips the light switch

               the scallopshell lamp

               casts its mournful glow across the empty bed charlie stares 
               wistfully for a moment then flips the light back off

               in the dimly lit marble bath

               charlie lays back in the foamy bubbles in the tub lifting a 
               cigar to his mouth he strikes a match and lights it he 
               inhales deeply holds the smoke for a moment then expels it 
               suddenly he tosses the cigar into the toilet where it 
               sizzles and dies he reaches over and flushes the toilet 
               then lays back into the bubbles deep in thought

                                         the end
