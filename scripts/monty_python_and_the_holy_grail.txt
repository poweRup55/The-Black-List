please read this bit before reading the screenplay



  this is the official unoffical monty python and the holy grail screenplay
this file contains the script as it was on march 20 1974 before filming took
place  there are many minor differences from what appears here and what
ended up on the screenthis file also contains cut scenes and lines from the film


  i tried to preserve as much of the screenplay as possible but it isnt
easy to cross out a section and pencil in new dialogue in ascii
any scene or dialogue that was crossed out begins with a  before it
anything penciled in has a  i also put cut information before penciled in


  what is interesting about a screenplay is to see what they threw out and
what catch phrases were literally penciled in  the reason i keyed in
this file was caused by me downloading current transcript going
around internet  it was an amazing job i wouldnt want to have attempted
what he did but it wasnt in a good script format and i didnt like how
direction was written in since i had the real screenplay i thought
what the hell


  after this i plan to key in monty pythons second film it is the 1st draft
of the holy grail it is the script that eventually got canabalized into
sketches for the 4th season of python  it is sill quite different and well
worth a read is anybody interested in it


  oh yes i will stress this fact once more this is a screenplay so
dont yell at me if a line is paraphrased in the film this is what was
written before filming took place and it is still quite accurate


enough of this

say that as the complete and total bastard that i am

   mist  several seconds of it swirling about  silence

   possibly atmospheric music  superimpose england ad 787

   after a few more seconds we hear hoofbeats in the distance

   they come slowly closer  then out of the mist comes king arthur

   followed by a servant who is banging two half coconuts

   together   arthur raises his hand



                              arthur

       whoa there



   servant makes noises of horses halting with a flourish  arthur

   peers through the mist  cut to shot from over his shoulder

   castle eg bodium rising out of the mist  on the castle

   battlements a soldier is dimly seen  he peers down



                               soldier

       halt  who goes there



                               arthur

       it is i arthur son of uther pendragon from the castle

       of camelot  king of all britons defeator of the saxons

       sovereign of all england



   pause



                               soldier

       get away



                               arthur

       i am  and this my trusty servant patsy we have ridden the

       length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join

       our court at camelot  i must speak with your lord and master



                               soldier

       what  ridden on a horse



                               arthur

       yes



                               soldier

       youre using coconuts



                               arthur

       what



                               soldier

       youve got two empty halves of coconuts and youre banging

       them together



                               arthur

           scornfully

       so  we have ridden since the snows of winter covered this

       land through the kingdom of mercea



                               soldier

       where did you get the coconuts



                               arthur

       through  we found them



                               soldier

       found them  in mercea  the coconuts tropical



                               arthur

       what do you mean



                               soldier

       well this is a temperate zone



                               arthur

       the swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin

       or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter yet these are

       not strangers to our land



                               soldier

       are you suggesting coconuts migrate



                               arthur

       not at all  they could be carried



                               soldier

       what a swallow carrying a coconut



                               arthur

       why not



                               soldier

       ill tell you why not  because a swallow is about eight

       inches long and weighs five ounces and youd be lucky

       to find a coconut under a pound





                               arthur

       it could grip it by the husk 



                               soldier

       its not a question of where he grips it  its a simple

       matter of weight  ratios   a fiveounce bird could not

       hold a a one pound coconut



                               arthur

       well it doesnt matter   go and tell your master that

       arthur from the court of camelot is here



   a slight pause  swirling mist  silence



                               soldier

       look to maintain velocity a swallow needs to beat

       its wings four hundred and ninety three times every

       second   right



                               arthur

           irritated

       please



                               soldier

       am i right



                               arthur

       im not interested



                               second soldier

           who has loomed up on the battlements

       it could be carried by an african swallow



                               first soldier

       oh  yes an african swallow maybe  but not a european

       swallow thats my point



                               second soldier

       oh yes i agree there 



                               arthur

           losing patience

       will you ask your master if he wants to join the knights

       of camelot



                               first soldier

       but then of course african swallows are nonmigratory



                               second soldier

       oh yes



   arthur raises his eyes heavenwards and nods to patsy  they turn

   and go off into the mist



                               first soldier

       so they wouldnt be able to bring a coconut back anyway



                               second soldier



       wait a minute suppose two swallows carried it together



                               first soldier

       no theyd have to have it on a line



   stillness  silence again





2  animationlive action sequence  death and devastation



   cut to terry gilliams sequence of brueghel prints  sounds of

   strange medieval music  discordant and sparse  wailings and

   groanings  the last picture mixes through into live action

   big close up of contorted face upside down  a leg falls across

   it  creaking noise  the bodies lurch away from camera to

   reveal they are amongst a huge pile of bodies on a swaying cart

   that is lumbering away from camera  it is pulled by a couple of

   ragged dirty emaciated wretches  behind the cart walks another

   man who looks slightly more prosperous but only on the scale

   of complete and utter impoverishment  he wears a black hood and

   looks sinister



                               cart driver

       bring out your dead



   we follow the cart through a wretched impoverished plagueridden

   village  a few starved mongrels run about in the mud scavenging

   in the open doorway of one house perhaps we jug glimpse a pair of

   legs dangling from the ceiling  in another doorway an old woman

   is beating a cat against a wall rather like one does with a mat

   the cart passes round a dead donkey or cow in the mud  and a man

   tied to a cart is being hammered to death by four nuns with

   huge mallets



                               cart driver



       bring out your dead



   there are legs stick out of windows and doors  two men are fighting

   in the mud  covered from head to foot in it  another man is on his

   hands in knees shovelling mud into his mouth  we just catch

   sight of a man falling into a well



                               cart driver

       bring out your dead

           singing unrecognisably

       i feel happy i feel happy



   the cart driver looks at the large man for a moment  then they both

   do a quick furtive look up and down the street  the cart driver

   very swiftly brings up a club and hits the old man out of shot

   but the singing stops after a loud bonk noise



                               large man

           handing over the money at last

       thanks very much

   forelocks etc  arthur and patsy ride into shot slightly nose to

   the air they ride through without acknowledging anybody  after

   they pass the large man turns to the cart driver

       society  if theres ever going to be any progress 



   an old woman appears

                               dennis

       yes i see



                               dennis

        must be approved at a biweekly meeting by a simple majority

       in the case of purely internal affairs



                               arthur

       be quiet



                               dennis

        but a twothirds majority 



                               arthur

       well how did you become king then



                               arthur

       the lady of the lake her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite

       held excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by

       divine providence   that i arthur was to carry excalibur 

       that is why i am your king



                              old woman

      is frank in  hed be able to deal with this one



                               dennis

       look  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out

       swords  thats no basis for a system of government  supreme

       executive power derives from a mandate from the masses not from

       some farcical aquatic ceremony



                               arthur

       be quiet



                               dennis

       you cant expect to wield supreme executive power

       just cause some watery tart threw a sword at you



                               arthur

       shut up



                               dennis

       i mean if i went around saying i was an emperor because some

       moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me people would

       put me away



                               arthur

           grabbing him by the collar

       shut up will you shut up



                               dennis

       ah now  we see the violence inherent in the system



                               arthur

       shut up



   people ie other peasants are appearing and watching



                               dennis

           calling

       come and see the violence inherent in the system

       help help im being repressed



                               arthur

           aware that people are now coming out and watching

       bloody peasant

           pushes dennis over into mud and prepares to ride off



                               dennis

       oh did you hear that  what a giveaway



                               arthur

       come on patsy



   they ride off



                               dennis

           in the background as we pull out

       did you see him repressing me then  thats what ive

       been on about 





4  exterior  forest  day



   mix through to arthur and patsy riding through the forest  they pass rune

   stones  we track with them  closeups of their faces as they ride

   mix to another tracking shot of them riding through the forest  they

   come to a clearing and stop looking ahead intently their eyes light up



   sound fx of fight



   cut to their eyeline  a clearing on the other side of which is a rough

   wooden footbridge across a stream   at the start of the bridge a

   tremendous fight is going on  a huge black knight in black armour his

   face totally masked in a visor is fighting a slightly smaller knight in

   green armour  perhaps the green knights armour is identical to the

   black knights save for the colour



   cut back to arthur and patsy  they watch growing more impressed

   as they watch the fight



   cut back to the fight  the green knight lunges at the black knight who

   avoids the blow with a skillful sidestep and parry knocking the sword

   out of the green knights hand



   cut back to arthur and patsy even more impressed



   cut back to the fight  the green knight has drawn out a particularly nasty

   mace or spiked ball and chain much longer than the black knights sword



   arthur narrows his eyes wondering whether the black knight will survive



   cut back to the fight the green knight swings at the black knight who

   ducks under the first swing leaps over the second and starts to close

   on the green knight



   cut back to arthur and patsy watching like a tennis match sound fx of the

   fight reaching a climax  four almighty clangs  then silence



   cut back to see the green knight stretched out  the black knight

   sheathes his sword



   arthur looks at patsy  nods and they move forward



   cut back to the black knight picking up the green knight above his head

   and hurling him into the river  arthur and patsy approach him



                               arthur

       you fight with the strength of many men sir knight



                              black knight

      who dares to challenge the black knight



                              arthur

      i do not challenge you



   the black knight stares impassively and says nothing



                               arthur

       i am arthur king of the britons



   hint of a pause as he waits for a reaction which dosnt come arthur is

   only slightly thrown



        i seek the bravest and the finest knights in all

       the world to join me in my court at camelot 



   the black knight remains silent



                               arthur

       you have proved yourself worthy  will you join me



   silence



                              arthur

      a man of your strength and skill would be the chief of all

      my knights 



                              black knight

      never



                               arthur

       you make me sad  but so be it  come patsy



   as he moves the black knight bars the way



                               black knight

       none shall pass



                               arthur

       what



                               black knight

       none shall pass



                               arthur

       i have no quarrel with you brave sir knight but i must

       cross this bridge



                               black knight

       then you shall die



                               arthur

       i command you as king of the britons to stand aside



                               black knight

       i move for no man



                               arthur

       so be it



   arthur draws his sword and approaches the black knight  a furious fight

   now starts lasting about fifteen seconds at which point arthur delivers

   a mighty blow which completely severs the black knights left arm at

   the shoulder  arthur steps back triumphantly



                               arthur

       now stand aside worthy adversary



                               black knight

           glancing at his shoulder

       tis but a scratch



                               arthur

       a scratch  your arms off



                               black knight

       no it isnt

5  exterior  day



   a village  sound of chanting of latin canon punctuated by short sharp

   cracks  it comes nearer  we see it is a line of monks ala seventh seal

   flagellation scene chanting and banging themselves on the foreheads with

   wooden boards  they pass a group of villagers who are dragging a beautiful

   young woman dressed as a witch through the streets  they drag her to a

   strange houseruin standing on a hill outside the village  a

   strangelooking knight stands outside sir bedevere



                               first villager

       we have found a witch  may we burn her



                               all

       a witch burn her



                               bedevere

       how do you know she is a witch



                               all

       she looks like one yes she does



                               bedevere

       bring her forward



   they bring her forward  a beautiful young girl miss islington dressed up

   as a witch



                               witch

       i am not a witch  i am not a witch



                               bedevere

       but you are dressed as one



                               witch

       they dressed me up like this



                               all

       we didnt we didnt



                               witch

       this is not my nose  it is a false one



   bedevere takes her nose off



                               bedevere

       well



                               first villager

        well we did do the nose



                               bedevere

       the nose



                               first villager

       and the hat  but she is a witch



                               all

       a witch  a witch  burn her



                               bedevere

       did you dress her up like this



                               first villager

        um  yes  no  a bit  yes she has got a wart



                               bedevere

       why do you think she is a witch



                               second villager

       she turned me into a newt



                               bedevere

       a newt



                               second villager

           after looking at himself for some time

       i got better



                               all

       burn her anyway



                               bedevere

       quiet quiet  there are ways of telling whether she is a witch



   arthur and patsy ride up at this point and watch what follows with interest



                               all

       there are  tell up  what are they wise sir bedevere



                               bedevere

       tell me   what do you do with witches



                               all

       burn them



                               bedevere

       and what do you burn apart from witches



                               fourth villager

        wood



                               bedevere

       so why do witches burn



                               second villager

           pianissimo

        because theyre made of wood



                               bedevere

       good



   peasants stir uneasily then come round to this conclusion



                               all

       i see  yes of course



                               bedevere

       so how can we tell if she is made of wood



                               first villager

       make a bridge out of her



                               bedevere

       ah  but can you not also make bridges out of stone



                               all

       ah  yes of course  um  err 



                               bedevere

       does wood sink in water



                               all

       no no  it floats   throw her in the pond tie weights on her  to

       the pond



                              bedevere

       wait  wait  tell me what also floats on water



                               all

       bread  no no no  apples  gravy  very small rocks 



                               arthur

       a duck



   they all turn and look at arthur  bedevere looks up very impressed



                               bedevere

       exactly  so logically 



                               first villager

           beginning to pick up the thread

       if she  weighs the same as a duck  shes made of wood



                               bedevere

       and therefore



                               all

       a witch  a duck  a duck  fetch a duck



                               fourth villager

       here is a duck sir bedevere



                               bedevere

       we shall use my largest scales



   he leads them a few yards to a very strange contraption indeed  made of

   wood and rope and leather  they put the girl in one pan and the duck

   in another  each pan is supported by a wooden stave  bedevere checks

   each pan then  arthur looks on with interest



                               bedevere

       remove the supports



   two peasants knock them away with sledge hammers  the girl and the duck

   swing slightly but balance perfectly



                               all

       a witch  a witch



                               witch

       its a fair cop



                               all

       burn her  burn her  lets make her into a ladder



   the villagers drag the girl away leaving arthur and bedevere regarding

   each other admiringly



                               bedevere

       who are you who are so wise in the ways of science



                               arthur

       i am arthur king of the britons



                               bedevere

       my liege  forgive me 



   arthur looks at patsy with obvious satisfaction





                               arthur

       good sir knight will you come with me to camelot

       and join our number at the round table



                               bedevere

       my liege  i am honored



   arthur steps forward drawing his sword with a slight hint of difficulty



                               arthur

       what is your name



                               bedevere

                               arthur

       then i dub you  sir bedevere  knight of the round table

       knights  i bid you welcome to your new home  let us ride 

       to camelot





8  interior  night



   cut to interior of medieval hall  a large group of armoured knights are

   engaged in a well choreographed songanddance routine of the very upbeat

   if they could see me now type of fast bouncy number  the poorer verses

   are made clearer by cutting to a group of knights actually engaged in

   the described task while the line itself is sung  they sing



                               knights

       were knights of the round table

       we dance wheneer were able

       we do routines and chorus scenes

       with footwork impeccable

       we dine well here in camelot

       we eat ham and jam and spam a lot



       were knights of the round table

       our shows are formidable

       but many times

       were given rhymes

       that are quite unsingable

       were opera mad in camelot

       we sing from the diaphragm a lot



   booming basses  a routine where two xylophonists play parts of knights

   armour producing a pleasing effect



       in war were tough and able

       quite indefatigable

       between our quests

       we sequin vests

       and impersonate clark gable

       its a busy life in camelot



                               single man

       i have to push the pram a lot



   cut back to arthur and bedevere and company as we had left them



                               arthur

       no on second thought lets not go to camelot



                               knights

       right



                               arthur

       it is a silly place



   they set off again almost immediately they are suffused in ethereal radiance

   and strange heavenly choir music  the pages horselike take fright for a

   moment they whinny and rattle their coconuts  arthur and the knights

   fall on their knees  a holy voice booms out



                               god

       arthur  arthur   king of the britons 



   they all prostrate themselves even further



       oh dont grovel  do get up  if theres one thing i cant stand

       its people grovelling



   arthur and company rise



                               arthur

       sorry 



                               god

       and dont apologize  every time i try to talk to someone its

       sorry this and forgive me that and im not worthy and 

       what are you doing now



                               arthur

       im averting my eyes lord



                               god

       well dont

      i really dont know where all this got started

       its like those miserable psalms  theyre so depressing

       now knock it of



                               arthur

       yes lord



                               god

       right  arthur king of the britons youre knights of the round

       table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times 



                               arthur

       good idea o lord



                               god

       course its a good idea



   suddenly another light glows beside god or possibly within the light which

   is god a shape slowly starts to form



       behold  arthur  this is the holy grail 

      the sacred cup from which christ drank at the last supper 



   the form in the bright light is just discernible as an iridescent chalice

    the knights gasp



       look well arthur  for it is your sacred task to seek

       this grail



   it begins to fade  music crescendo as both lights fade



       that is your purpose arthur  the quest for the holy grail 



   it is gone  all the knights are left gasping in awe and wonderment  they

   all turn and look at arthur

   a terrific castle a little one would do too  they advance quite close to

   the castle and draw themselves into a line  at a signal from arthur the two

   pages step forward and give a brief fanfare



   a man appears on the battlements  arthur addresses him

   towards the english lines  wind whistles



   shot of the empty scrubland or undergrowth or woodland around the castle

   emptiness  wind  more shots of the french sentries peering into the dusk

  as night falls  mix through to night on the battlements a brazier burns or

  torches on the wall as the sentries peer into the dark shots of the

  woodland with fires burning where the english lines are



   during all this the sounds of extensive carpentry have possibly been herd

   followed by silence followed by renewed outbursts or activity



   closeup french looking very nervous  dawn breaking shot of woodland

   nothing  wind  dawn still breaking  shots of the french  they suddenly

   hear something  a faintly detectable squeaking which is getting louder



   cut to wide shot of castle and woodland  squeaking getting louder  shot of

   the french taunter pointing  wide shot again  the squeaking gets louder

   an enormous twentyfoothigh wooden rabbit is wheeled out of the

   undergrowth into the open space in front of the castle  the english scuttle

   back into the undergrowth  the rabbit has a large red bow tied round it

   and a rather crudely written label  which reads pour votres amis

   francais the chief taunter looks at it narrowing his eyes  then he

   turns and leaves battlements



   cut to arthur and company watching from the bushes  the main gate of the

   castle opens a little and the chief taunters head sticks out  then another

   froggie head  then another  they mutter to each other in french  look

   rather pleased  then rush out and start to pull the giant rabbit in



   cut back to arthur and company behind some bushes watching



                               arthur

       now what happens



                               bedevere

       well now launcelot galahad and i wait until nightfall

       and then leap out of the rabbit and take the french by surprise

       not only by surprise but totally unarmed

   arthur cuffs him  arthur looks at the battlements  there is a loud twang

   look of horror  the rabbit comes sailing over the battlements

       defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened

       king arthur  the ferocity of the french taunting took him

       completely by surprise and arthur became convinced that a new strategy

       was required if the quest for the holy grail were to be brought

       to a successful conclusion  arthur having consulted his closest

       knights decided that they should separate and search for the grail

       individually  now this is what they did  no sooner



    a knight rides into shot and hacks him to the ground  he rides off

11  exterior  glade  day



    a knight is trotting along through a wooden sundapled glade followed by

    his trusty page banging the usual half coconuts  as we see them approach

    we hear the beautiful lilting sound of medieval music and see that

    the knight is followed by a small retinue of musicians in

    thirteenthcentury courtly costume one sings and plays the tambourine

    one bangs at a tabor a small drum oed and one plays the pipes



    the knight looks very proud and firm as we hear the first part of the song

    but the combination of the lyrics and the large signs they pass start

    to have their effect 



    song



       bravely bold sir robin rode forth from camelot

       he was not afraid to die oh brave sir robin

       he was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways

       brave brave brave brave sir robin



       he was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp

       or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken

       to have his kneecaps split and his body burned away

       and his limbs all hacked and mangled brave sir robin



       his head smashed in  and his heart cut out

       and his liver removed and his bowels unplugged

       and his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off

12 exterior  glade  day



   they now pass three knights impaled to a tree  with their feet off the

   ground  with one lance through the lot of them they are skewered up

   like a barbecue



   then they pass three knights sitting on the ground with one enormous axe

   through their skulls  they look timorous



  then a huge tree is absolutely packed with maidens tied to it  they all

  look fed up  sir robin calls out cheerfully as he passes

13 exterior  glade  day



   quick sequence of sir robin  the music is jolly and bright as if

   triumphant  robin is not at all happy with the lyrics



                               singers

       brave sir robin ran away



                               robin

       i didnt



                               singers

       bravely ran away away



                               robin

       no no no



                               singers

       when danger reared its ugly head

       he bravely turned his tail and fled

       yes brave sir robin turned about

       and gallantly he chickened out

       bravely taking to his feet

       he beat a very brave retreat

       bravest of the brave sir robin

       petrified of being dead

       soiled his pants then brave sir robin

       turned away and fled



   they disappear into distance



   animation  the tale of sir galahad





14 exterior  storm  forest  dusk



   as the storm rages we pick up galahad forcing his way through brambles and

   over slippery rocks  progress is hard  he pauses and at this moment

   we hear the howling of wolves  galahad turns then hurries onward even

   more urgently  another louder closer howl is herd and galahad stumbles

   and falls heavily  though obviously injured he bravely struggles

   forward a little and regains his feed reacting with pain  more louder

   closer howling  he grips his sword valiantly and as he glances around

   a flash of lightning reveals the silhouette of a huge terrifying castle

   perhaps looking rather derelict  he makes up his mind in an instant and

   stumbles manfully toward it  more louder howling  he reaches the

   forbidding and enormous doors of the castle and beats on the doors with the

   handle of his sword looking over his shoulder the while  pause

   he beats again shouting



                               galahad

       open  open the doors  in the name of king arthur  open the doors

      i am sir galahad a knight of the round table



  some suitable noises are herd inside



      i am on a quest for the holy grail  i seek shelter



   some rattling chainy noises come from inside with huge bolts being

   drawn  the wolves howling is very close  as the door creaks

   open galahad steps quickly inside



15 interior  castle  night



   from inside we see galahad enter wiping the rain from his eyes and turn

   as the door crashes behind him  galahad turns to the door reacting to the

   fact he is trapped



                               zoot out of vision

       hello



   galahad turns back  we see from his pov the lovely zoot standing by him

   smiling enchantingly and a number of equally delectable girlies draped

   around in the seductively poulticed room  they look at him smilingly and

   wave



                               girlies

       hello



                               zoot

       nice and we shall attend to your every  every need



                               galahad

                               midget and crapper

           grovelling with delight

       oh thank you zoot thank you thank you



                               zoot

       away varletesses

           to galahad

       the beds here are warm and soft and very very big



                               galahad

       well look er i 



                               zoot

                               zoot

       mine is zoot just zoot

           she is very close to him for a moment

       but come



   she turns away and leads him towards a door leading to a corner leading

   to the bedchamber



                               galahad

       well look im afraid i really ought to be 



                               zoot

       sir galahad



   there is a gasp from the other girls



                               zoot

       you would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality



   galahad looks at the other girls  they are clearly on the verge of

   being offended



                               galahad

       well 



                               zoot

           she moves off and galahad unwillingly follows

       im afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared

       to yours  we are but eightscore young blondes all between

       sixteen and nineteenandahalf cut off in this castle with no

       one to protect us  oooh  it is a lonely life  bathing 

       dressing  undressing  making exciting underwear



   they reach the end of the corridor and enter the bedchamber

   zoot turns



                               zoot

       we are just not used to handsome knights 

           she notices him limping

       but you are wounded



                               galahad

       no its nothing



                               zoot

       you must see the doctors immediately

            she claps again

       you must lie down



   she almost forces him to lie on the bed as piglet and winston enter the

   room  they are equally beautiful and dressed exotically  they

   approach galahad



                               piglet

       well  what seems to be the trouble



                               galahad

       theyre doctors



                               zoot

       dr winston dr piglet  practice your art



                               winston

                               galahad

                               piglet

                               galahad

       theres nothing wrong with  that



                               piglet

           slightly irritated

       please  we are doctors



   zoot reappears  galahad tries for one brief moment to relax  then there is

   a sharp boing from the lower part of his armour  winston glances quickly

   in the appropriate direction as galahad sits up and starts getting off the

   bed and collecting his armour saying



                               galahad

       no no this cannot be   i am sworn to chastity



                               piglet

       back to your bed  at once



                               galahad

       im sorry i must go



   galahad hurries to the door and pushes through it  as he leaves the room

   we cut to the reverse to show that he is now in a room full of bathing

   and romping girlies all innocent wideeyed and beautiful  they smile

   enchantingly at him as he tries to keep walking without being diverted by

   the lovely sights assaulting his eyeballs  he nods to them stiffly once

   or twice and then his eye catches a particularly stunning young lady

   he visibly gulps with repressed emotion and cannot resist saying



                              galahad

      good evening  ah zoot  er 



                              dingo

      oh  well im sorry but i must leave immediately



                              dingo

          very dramatically

                              galahad

                              galahad

                               galahad

       well i suppose i could stay a bit longer



   at this moment there is a commotion behind and sir launcelot and concord

   possibly plus gawain burst into the bathing area with swords drawn and

   form themselves round sir galahad threatening the girls



                               launcelot

       sir galahad

                               dingo

       oh shit



   by now launcelot and concorde have hustled galahad out of the bathing

   area and are running through the outside door



                               launcelot

       we were in the nick of time  you were in great peril



                               galahad

           dragging his feet somewhat

       i dont think i was



                               launcelot

       look let me go back in there and face the peril



                               launcelot

       its too perilous



   they are right outside the castle by now



                               galahad

       look its my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as i can



                               launcelot

       no no we must find the grail



  the thunderstorm is over  a bunch sic of pages are tethered to a tree with

  more men waiting  their tethers are untied and the pages start banging away

  with their coconuts  galahad is swept along with them as they ride off



                               galahad

       oh let me go and have a bit of peril



                               launcelot

                               launcelot

       no im not



   gawain or concorde gives a knowing glance at launcelot  voice comes in as

   they ride off



                               voice over

       sir launcelot had saved galahad from almost certain

       temptation but they were still lost far from the goal

       of their search for the holy grail  only bedevere and

       king arthur himself riding day and night had made

       any progress





16  animationlive action



    arthur and bedevere in the depths of a dark forest with an old blind

    soothsayer  he lies in a broken down old woodmans hut



                               arthur

       and this enchanter of whom you speak  he has seen the grail



   the soothsayer laughs forbiddingly adding to the general spookiness of

   this encounter



                               arthur

       where does he live

           he stares into the blind eyes of the old man

       old man  where does he live 



                               soothsayer

       he knows of a cave  a cave which no man has entered



                               arthur

       and  the grail  the grail is there



   the blind man laughs again to himself



                               soothsayer

       there is much danger  for beyond the cave lies the gorge

       of eternal peril which no man has ever crossed



                               arthur

       but the grail  where is the grail



                               soothsayer

       seek you the bridge of death 



                               arthur

       the bridge of death  which leads to the grail



   the old man laughs sinisterly and mockingly  they look down and he is

   gone  they stand up  suddenly behind them is a noise  they turn sharply

   in the door of the little hut is a cat  it miaows and is gone  they

   slowly back out of the hut  as they touch the doorposts they just flake

   away into dust  the whole hut is rotten  it collapses



   spooky music  they are thoroughly shaken and they begin to hear noises of

   people moving in the forest around them  they start to back cautiously

   away from the hut suddenly there is heavy footfall behind them  they

   turn in fear and



   sudden cut to big closeup of a frightening blackbrowed evil face

       but father



                               father

    he points to a wedding suit on a table or chair  father throws one last

    look at the boy and turns goes out and slams the door



    the prince slumps onto window seat looking forlornly out of the window

    music intro to song 



    the door flies open the music cuts off and father pokes his head in



                               father

        and no singing



                               second guard

       hic



                               father

           as he goes out

       go and have a drink of water



   father slams the door again  the guards take up their positions  the son

   gazes out of the window again  sighs  thinks  a thought strikes him

    he gets up crosses to his desk and scribbles a quick note and impales

   it on an arrow  takes a bow down from the wall  and fires the arrow

   out of the window



   he looks wetly defiant at the guards who smile pleasantly





15 exterior  a forest  day



   cut to the middle of the forest  sir launcelot is riding along with

   a trusty servant concorde



                               launcelot

       and  o v e r   we go



   he strides over a big tree trunk  his horse does run and jump 



                               launcelot

           enthusiastically

       well taken concorde



                               concorde

       thank you sir most kind 



                               launcelot

       and another



   concorde misses a beat



       steady  good  and the last one 



   concorde does the runup with the coconuts  he does the break for the

   leap  there is a thwack  sir launcelot is waiting for the horse

     to land



                               concorde

       message for you sir



   he falls forward revealing the arrow with the note



                               launcelot

       concorde  speak to me



   he realises he might be in danger and so starts to crawl off 

   when he notices the note  he takes it out and reads it



                               launcelot

           reading

       to whoever finds this note 

       i have been imprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry

       against my will  please please please please come and rescue me

       i am in the tall tower of swamp castle



   sir launcelots eyes light up with holy inspiration



                               launcelot

       at last   a call  a cry of distress 

           he draws his sword and turns to concorde

      concorde  brave concorde  you shall not have died in vain



                               concorde

       im not quite dead sir 



                               launcelot

           a little deflated

       oh well  er brave concorde  you shall not have been fatally

       wounded in vain



                               concorde

       i think i could pull through sir



                               launcelot

       good concorde  stay here and rest awhile



   he makes to leap off dramatically



                               concorde

       i think ill be all right to come with you sir



                               launcelot

       this most daring desperate adventure in this genre



                               concorde

       really i feel fine sir



                               launcelot

       farewell concorde



                               concorde

       it just seems silly  me lying here



   sir launcelot plunges off into the forest



20 exterior  castle gateway  day



   two hanging banners one each side of the gate with the monogram

   h  l



   two sentries with spears  slightly weddingly  red ribbons on their

   right spears  we can hear from inside revelry and celebration music



   we hear launcelots footsteps  the two sentries are watching him  one of

   them raises his hand



                              first sentry

      halt friend 



   launcelot leaps into shot with a mighty cry and runs the guard through and

   hacks him to the floor  blood  swashbuckling music perhaps

   launcelot races through into the castle screaming



                               second sentry

       hey



   he looks down at his mutilated comrade





21 exterior  day



   cut to inside of the castle grounds or courtyard



   in the sunlight beautifully dressed wedding guests are arriving

   converging on a doorway  a country dance in progress



   sir launcelot rushes towards them



   cut to handheld closeups as he charges through the crowd hacking

   right and left a la errol flynn at all who come in his way



   he fights his way through the country dance  blood  shrieks  bemused

   looks of guests  not horror so much as uncomprehending surprise



   possibly errol flynn music



   one country dancer is left holding just a hand



   right and left the guests crumple in pools of blood as he fights his

   way through the door and into the main hall





22 interior  day



   cut to interior of main hall  sound of busy preparations  men setting

   up huge hogsheads of wine  men putting up last minute flower arrangements

   cooks bearing huge trays of food pies suckling pigs a swan boars

   head etc



   the bride being dressed by several attendants  father ordering servants

   around  organizing the stewards etc



   sir launcelot bursts through the middle of them slashing heroically

   hacking wounding and killing  again fairly closeup chaotic shots

   we see guests stagger back wounded  a cook bites the dust etc



   sir launcelot eventually reaches the staircase  runs up it and

   into a small door





23 interior  day



   cut to sir launcelot running up spiral staircase  he reaches the door

   of the princes room  he flings it open



                               first guard

       ah  now  were not allowed to 



   sir launcelot runs him through  grabs his spear and stabs the other

   guard who collapses in a heap  hiccoughs quietly



   sir launcelot runs to the window and kneels down in front of the prince

   averting his head



                               launcelot

       oh fair one behold your humble servant sir launcelot

       from the court of camelot  i have come to take you 

           he looks up for the first time and his voice trails away

           suddenly looking in the door

   music cuts out



   father sees sir launcelot still kneeling before his son



                               father

    he throws a rope out of the window which is tied to a pillar in the room

    he  looks rather pleased with himself that he has got it all ready



                               father

                               launcelot

                               prince

           half out of the window

                               father

       me a fortune



                               launcelot

       i can explain   i was in the forest  riding north

       from camelot  when i got this note



                               father

   the princes head peeps over the windowsill



                               prince

       hurry



                               launcelot

                               prince oov

           loud and shrill

       i am ready



   as they walk past the rope the father nonchalantly cuts with his knife

   there is no sound except after a pause a slight squeal from very far away

   as the prince makes contact with the ground



                               launcelot

       its just that when im in this genre i tend to get overexcited

       and start to leap around and wave my sword about  and 



                               father

       oh dont worry about that  tell me  doesnt camelot own

       that stretch of farmland up by the mountains



   he puts his arm round launcelots shoulders as they go though the door





24 interior  day



   cut to the great hall  guests wounded and bloody are tending to the dead

   and injured sighs and groans the princess in her white wedding dress is

   holding her chest and coughing blood

   people dabbing the stains off her dress



   father and sir launcelot start to walk down the grand staircase  talking

   to each other



   one of the guests notices and points to sir launcelot



                               guest

       there he is



   as one man all remaining ablebodied men look up and make for the staircase

   muttering angrily  sir launcelot grabs his sword



                               father

       hold it



   but it is too lake  sir launcelot cannot be stopped  with fearless abandon

   he throws himself into the crowd and starts hacking and slashing  he has

   carved quite a number up before the father can stop him and pulls him back

   onto the stairs  renewed groans and cries





                               father

           shouting above noise

       hold it  please

                               launcelot

       sorry  sorry 

           with bitter self reproach

       there you see  i just got excited again and i got carried away 

       im ever so sorry

           to the crowd

       sorry



   crowd kneeling round their wounded again  moans etc



                               guest

       hes killed the best man



                               second guest

           holding a limp woman

       hes killed my auntie



                               father

       no please  this is supposed to be a happy occasion

       lets not bicker and argue about who killed who   we

       are here today to witness the union of two young people in

       the joyful bond of the holy wedlock  unfortunately one

       of them my son herbert has just fallen to his death



   murmurs from crowd  the bride smiles with relief coughs



       but i dont want to think ive not lost a son 

       so much as gained a daughter 



   smattering of applause



       for since the tragic death of her father 



                               shout from back

       hes not quite dead



                               father

       since the fatal wounding of her father 



                               shout from back

       i think hes getting better



   father nods discreetly to a soldier standing to one side  the soldier

   slips off  fathers eyes watch him move round to where the voice

   came from



                               father

       for  since her own father  who  when he seemed about to

       recover  suddenly felt the icy  hand of death upon him



   a scuffle at the back



                               shout from back

       oh hes died



                               father

       i want his only daughter from now onwards to think of me as her

       old dad  in a very real and legally binding sense



   applause



       and im sure sure  that the merger  er  the union

       between the princess and the brave but dangerous sir launcelot

       of camelot 



                               launcelot

       what



   gasp from the crowd



                               crowd

       the dead prince



   there is concorde holding the dead prince in his arms



                               concorde

       hes not quite dead



                               prince

       i feel much better



                               father

       you fell out of the tall tower you creep



                               prince

       i was saved at the last minute



                               father

       how



                               prince

       well  ill tell you 



   music intro to song  concorde stands the son on his feet and adopts cod

   and now a number from my friend pose



                               father

       not like that



   but the music doesnt stop and the crowd starts to sing



                               crowd

       hes going to tell



                               father

       shut up



                               crowd

       hes going to tell 



                               father

           screaming

       shut up



    as the song starts the father tries yelling at them and eventually gives

    up  sir launcelot joins concorde in the crowd



                              launcelot

      we must escape  quickly before the song



                              concorde

      come with me sir



                              launcelot

      youre not right for this genre  i must escape more dramatically





                              concorde

      quickly sir come this way



                              launcelot

      no  its not right for my idiom  i must escape more   more 



                              concorde

      dramatically sir



                              launcelot

      dramatically



                               crowd

       hes going to tell

       hes going to tell

       hes going to tell about his great escape

       oh he fell a long long way

       but hes here with us today

       what a wonderful  escape



   concorde goes  sir launcelot runs back up the stairs grabs a rope

   of the wall and swings out over the heads of the crowd in a

   swashbuckling manner towards a large window  he stops just short

   of the window and is left swing pathetically back and forth



                              launcelot

      excuse me  could somebody give me a push 





25 exterior  a deserted village  dusk



   toothless old crone by the roadside  arthur and bedevere and two pages

   ride up and draw up alongside the crone



                               arthur

        is there anywhere where we could buy a shrubbery



   the old crone crosses herself with a look of stark terror



                               crone

       who sent you



                               arthur

       the knights who say ni



                               crone

       aaaagh

           she looks around in rear

       no  we have no shrubberies here



                               bedevere

       surely there must be



  arthur restrains from threatening the lady



                              arthur

          aside

      it will be not good to argue  these simple people are terrified

      of the knights who say ni



                              crone

          she cowers

      ohhh



  arthur takes bedevere further aside



                              arthur

      there is only one way to get the information we want 



                              bedevere

      send her a letter from a long way away



                              arthur

      er no  no we must 



                              bedevere

      talk to her in funny voices



                              arthur

          slightly crossly

      no 



                              bedevere

      how about trying ourselves to a tree



                              arthur

          grittily

      no  our only hope is to make her as afraid of us as she is of

      the awful knights who say ni



                              bedevere

          sagely

      ah  hit ourselves with a big rock 



  he nods knowingly



                              arthur

          tolerantly but firmly

      no  nothing we do to ourselves will frighten her as much as

      what we can do to her 



                              bedevere

      ah



                              arthur

      we must threaten to say ni



                              bedevere

          terror

      oh no



  they reapproach the old crone who is cowering more than ever



                               arthur

       shrubbery my friend and i will  we will say ni

       oh what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say ni

       at will to old ladies  there is a pestilence upon this land

       nothing is sacred  even those who arrange and design

       shrubberies are under considerable economic stress

       at this point in time



                               arthur

       but there is one small problem



                               arthur

       shut up

           to arthur

       therefore we must give you a test a test to satisfy the knights who

       say neeeow  wum  ping

        recently knights of ni



                               knight

       ni



                               tall knight

       firstly  you must get us another shrubbery



                               other knights

           half seen

       more shrubberies  more shrubberies for the exknights of ni



                               arthur

       not another shrubbery 



                               tall knight

       when you have found the shrubbery place the shrubbery here

       beside this shrubbery  only slightly higher so you get a

       twolevel effect with a path through the middle



                               other knights

       a path  a little path for the late knights of ni



   chorus of ni  ni



                               tall knight

       when you have found the shrubbery then you must cut

       down the mightiest tree in the forest  with a herring



                               other knights

                               other knights

                               tall knight

                               other knights

       not is  not is



   suddenly singing is heard from deep in the forest



                               sir robins singers

       bravely good sir robin was not at all afraid

       to have his eyeballs skewered 



                               tall knight

           irritated

                               tall knight

           covering his ears

       youve said the word again



   sir robin and his singers appear in the clearing  the singers are going on

   cheerfully as usual and robin walks in front of them continually

   embarrassed at their presence



                               singers

        and his kidneys burnt and his nipples skewered off 



   robin holds his hand up for silence



                               arthur

       sir robin



   he shakes his hand warmly



                               robin

                               robins singers

           starting up again

       he was going home  he was giving up

       he was throwing in the sponge



                               robin

           to singers

       shut up  no  er  no  i  er  i  er  i certainly

                               arthur

           losing his patience with the fearful knights of ni

       oh stop it



   terrific confusion amongst the knights of ni they roll on the ground

   covering their ears  the tall knight remains standing trying to control

   his men



                               other knights

       theyre all saying the word 



                               tall knight

   arthur beckons to bedevere and robin and they pick their way through

   the helpless knights of ni and away into the forest





27 exterior  historians glade  day



   we cut to an almost subliminal shot of the historians wife being shown

   into a police car which then roars off out of the glade



   cut back to the forest  the knights of ni are slowly recovering  they

   get up



                              tall knight

      well at least weve got one shrubbery



                              other knights

                              other knights

      good idea  more shrubberies  as many as possible



   perhaps we start to track back from the scene as they go on talking



                              tall knight

      what shall we call ourselves this time



                              knight

      how about the knights of nickynicky





28 exterior  day



   a small group of peasants are being shuffled into a group formation at the

   apparent direction of someone behind the camera  a few coughs

   as they shuffle together  a moment of silence  then they burst

   into pleasant melliflubus song



   song   when the trees do blossom full

           and all the hills are green

           oh oh we sing

           hey hey we sing

           our country song



   a hail of arrow hits them and they crumple up  sound of raucous

   laughter off camera



   cut to reveal a firing squad of archers kneeling not ten feet away from

   the group of singers



   sitting on the throne on a dais is king brian the wild  he is roaring with

   roaring with laughter  and his court is slightly shabby  bearing all the

   marks of a faded richness  it is a court without women and nobody

   does the washing or shaves very well perhaps there is washing however

   on the line over the castle  king brians advisers stand around

   him   everyone bears the signs of past injuries except for brian

   himself ie they have an arm in a sling or head bandaged all the people

   at court except for brian have their left arm missing possibly

   the result of some violent edict a few years back



                              king brian

      ha ha ha ha ha ho ho ho ho ha ha ha ha

      oh very good next



                              first adviser

          a little uncomfortably  perhaps his arm is in a sling obviously

           giving him some pain

      there are no more sir



                              king brian

          grabbing him by the collar

      what doyou mean you filthy dog



                              first adviser

      there are no more close harmony groups in the kingdom sir



                              king brian

      no more close harmony groups



                              first adviser

      we have scoured the kingdom



                              king brian

          lifting him bodily into the air and breaking his

           arm again slightly

      you miserable worm you wretch you walking son of a dunghill keeper

      guards



   two rather shabby looking guards approach as everyone else they also

   have their left arms missing



                              first adviser

      have mercy your majesty



                              king brian

   guards take him away and suspend him by his nostrils from the highest

   tree in the kingdom



   the guards grab him unmercifully and drag him off  he whines piteously





29 exterior  day



   cut back to the glade where the knights of ni were  a police car

   roars up  two plain clothes detective and a constable get out look

   around suspiciously perhaps kneel and examine the ground one policeman

   finds patsys shoe and the other finds a strange scientific instrument that

   was hanging from bedevere



   they nod grimly to each other climb back in the car and drive off





30 exterior  day



   back in king brians court the first adviser has been dragged off  there

   are muffled screams coming from the nearby tree  the first adviser

   is being hauled up it on pulleys



                              second adviser

      your majesty i can find you a lute player whose music is passing

      sweet



                              king brian

      its not the same you thickheaded fool

          king brian hits him on the back of the head  he falls

      theres no fun in killing soloists



                              second adviser

          picking himself up

      he may have a friend



                              king brian

      guards



                              second adviser

      oh please your majesty  please



                              king brian

      take him away and tie his kidneys to the longest hedge in the kingdom



   the guards drag the adviser roughly away



                              second adviser

      no

          he is dragged off screaming and protesting



                              king brian

          roaring at the rest of the court

      i will personally disembowel the next little bastard who tells me that

      there are no more close harmony 



   at this moment we hear faintly the sound of singing king brian stopped

   to listen  the entire court turns thankfully towards the mellifluous

   sounds



      were the knights of the round table

      our shows are formidable

      but many times were given rhymes

      that are quite unsingable



                              king brian

      wait a minute five point harmony with a countertenor lead



   various members of the court sigh and breathe more easily



                              creep

      thank goodness



                              king brian

      shut up

          punches him right on the end of the nose and shouts to the

           second adviser

      oy you



                              second adviser

          doubledup surrounded by soldiers busy with his stomach

      yes your majesty



                              king brian

      go and get em



                              second adviser

          gratefully

       thank you sir

          he staggers off with some difficulty



                              guard

      ere wed just started taking his kidneys out



   cut to arthurbedeveregalahad and lancelot  garwinthrstam hecrot

                              second adviser

      that he may listen at his ease ooh



                              sir lancelot

          general murmur or agreement from the other knights

                              other knights

      no fear etc



                              second adviser

          in increasing pain

      it need not be close harmony oooh agh



                              sir galahad

      ah but it would get round to close harmony wouldnt it



                              second adviser

      not necessarily  as i say king brian is much more relaxed than

      he used to be



                              sir galahad

      i mean could we just stick to one line of plainsong with a bit of

      straight choral work



                              second adviser

      well obviously hed prefer a bit of close harmony arghhh

   they start off



                              second adviser

          by now lying on the ground at his last gasp but still trying to

           sound threatening

      if you dont come and sing for him  ah  hell drive  oh

       iron spikes though your heads



                              knights

      ah that sounds more like brian the wild



                              second adviser

          looking helplessly at his intestines

      he  he  still gets irritable occasionally



                              sir galahad

      like with close harmony groups



                              second adviser

          with his last ounce of strength

      very well king brian challenges your to sing before him in close

      harmony



                              arthur

      a challenge



   the knights look at each other rather taken aback but an idealistic glow

   suffuses king arthurs eyes as he looks heavenwards the other knights

   look at him rather fearfully



                              arthur

          majestacally

      it is a challenge  we cannot refuse

   the arena



                              king brian

      ah good



   cut to trumpeters who executes a rather bad fanfare full of missed

   notes  meanwhile various shots of preparation



   king brian settling down



   knights being led up to the podium the last of the previous close harmony

   group is being loaded onto a cart and pushed away by the cart driver

   from scene tow perhaps we see him being paid off



   shot of king brian on his podium and the herald being untied and having

   his gag removed



   shot of arthur and knights getting into a group on the podium still

   rather nervous



   the fanfare comes to an end and several wrong notes

          who cant wait

      right carry on gentleman

      all right  two tenor lines  ill take the base



   they all nod



      one two three



   sound of bows being drown very near by



   arthur looks up and frowns



   cut to reveal a line of twenty archers they all have their left leg

   missing but they do have two arms



   their arrows are drawn back and point directly at arthur  co



                              arthur

      left  left  left left left left



   they hop round behind a long fence and disappear from sight

   quick flash of archers sensed to fire one tires to hold his shot back but

   fails and fires his arrows by accident in the air



   quick flash of first adviser who is hanging by his nostrils from the

   highest tree in the kingdom moaning getting hit by the arrow



                              king brian

   sound in the distance of beautiful close harmony singing



      bravely good sir robin was not at all afraid



   cut to see sir robin and his minstrels approaching from round a corner

   of the castle sir robin walks a few feet in from of the them looking

   rather embarrassed



                              king brian

          turning to the sound

      fantastic



   cut back to robins minstrels



      to have his eyeballs skewered and his kidneys  argh



   they are suddenly pincushioned with arrows



                              king brian

      ha ha ha ha ho ho ho ho

      oh bloody marvellous



   robin turns and looks at the decimated remains of his minstrels surprised

   but relieved

      sir robin this way



   arthur leads is men off the platform and they are joined by their pages and

   he swings his sword and slices the heralds head off

       changed back into autumn and autumn gave winter and spring a miss and

30 exterior  wastes  day



   the knights are riding along the top of a ridge  the country is wild and

   inhospitable  suddenly some of them see fire in the distance and ride

   towards it  as they approach they see an impressive wizard figure striding

   around conjuring up fire from the ground and causing various bushes and

   branches to burst into flame



                               arthur

                               tim

       to the north there lies a cave  the cave of caerbannog

       wherein carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock

       the last words of olfin bedwere of rheged 



   there is a thunderclap and a wind starts  they knights get nervous



                               tim

         make plain the last resting place of the most holy grail



                               arthur

                               tim

       follow



   the knights register delight and wheel round on themselves



       but follow only if you are men of valour  for the entrance

       to this cave is guarded by a monster a creature so foul

       and cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived

       bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair 

       therefore sweet knights if you may doubt your strength or courage

       come no further for death awaits you all with nasty pointy teeth



                              arthur

      what an eccentric performance





31 exterior  day



   cut to impressive rock face with caves in it  the knights are riding

   towards it  a foreboding atmosphere supervenes  tim gives a signal for

   quietness  arthur shushes the horses



                               arthur

       shhh



   the pages decrease the amount of noise they are making with the coconuts

   for a few seconds  then there is a burst of noise from them including

   whinnying



                               bedevere

           to arthur

       theyre nervous sire



                               arthur

       then wed best leave them here and carry on on foot



   tim takes a strange look at them  they walk on leaving the pages behind

   after a few more strides tim halts them with a sign



                               tim

       behold the cave of caerbannog



   cut to shot of cave  bones littered around  the knights get the wind

   up partially  a little dry ice glowing green can be seen at the

   entrance  suddenly we become aware of total silence  any noises the

   knights make sound very exaggerated  they unsheathe their swords



                               arthur

       keep me covered



   stir among knights

                               tim

   they all turn and see a large white rabbit lollop a few yards out of the

   cave  accompanied by terrifying chord and jarring metallic monster noise



                               arthur

       where



                               tim

       look



   as tim points they all spin round to see the rabbit leap at bors

   throat with an appalling scream  from a distance of about twenty feet

   there is a tin opening noise a cry from bors  a quick closeup

   of a savage rabbit biting through tin and bors head flies off  the

   rabbit leaps back to the mouth of the cave and sits there looking

   in the knights direction and growling menacingly



                               arthur

       jesus christ



                               tim

   second fight with peckinpahish shots and borrowing heavily also on the

   kung fu and karatetype films ensues in which some four knights are

   comprehensively killed

           taking up cry

   they run down from the cave and hide regrouping behind some rocks  tim

   some way away is pointing at them and laughing derisively

       a mistake

                               arthur

           shouting

       bring up the holy hand grenade



   slight pause  then from the area where the horses are a small group

   of monks process forward towards the knights the leading monk bearing

   and ornate golden reliquary and the accompanying monks chanting and

   waving incense  they reach the knights  the hand grenade is suffused

   with the holy glow



   arthur takes it  pause

       armaments chapter two verses nine to twenty one



                               another monk

           reading from bible

       and st  attila raised his hand grenade up on high saying

       o lord bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow

       thine enemies to tiny bits in thy mercy and the lord did grin and

       people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies

       and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and



                               brother maynard

       skip a bit brother 



                               another monk

        er  oh yes  and the lord spake saying first shalt thou

       take out the holy pin then shalt thou count to three no more

       no less  three shalt be the number thou shalt count and the

       number of the counting shalt be three  four shalt thou not count

       neither count thou two excepting that thou then proceed to three

       five is right out  once the number three being the third number

       be reached then lobbest thou thy holy hand grenade of antioch

       towards thou foe who being naughty in my sight shall snuff it



                               arthur

   he pulls pin out  the monk blesses the grenade as

32 interior  cave  day



   mix through to the knights entering the cave  it is a large cave and as

   they walk inside it we see in the darkness at the side of the cave

   a fearsome looking creature which watches them with some surprise

   as they walk to some writing carved on the back of the cave wall

   the knights are accompanied by brother maynard



                               arthur

                              bedevere

      no  oooooh in surprise and alarm



   he indicated the entrance of the cave  they all turn and look  there in

   the opening is a huge unpleasant fairly well drawn cartoon beast



                               arthur

       oh

                               galahad

       its the  its on the tip of my tongue 



   another hideous roar

       what



                               bedevere

       its the legendary black beast of aaaaarrrrrrggghhh



  at that moment there is a yell and a scream out of vision  arthur turns



                              arthur

      who was that



                              hector

          from back of group northern and helpful

      it was sir alf



                              arthur

      i didnt know we had a sir alf



                              hector

      he was feeding it bread



                              arthur

          shouting back

      well that was a very silly thing to do  now the rest of you stand

      well back from the black beast of aaaaarrrrrrggghhh



                              hector

      aaaaarrrrrrggghhh



                              robin

      look out



  the animation monster starts lumbering towards them  the knights retreat

  into the darkness of the cave



                              gawain

          as they run

      its only a cartoon



                              arthur

      sh



   they run off  darkness  the monster lumbering through on animation



                              voice over

      as the horrendous black beast lunged forward escape for arthur

     and his knights seemed hopeless  when suddenly  the animator

     suffered a fatal heart attack



                              animator

      aaaaagh



                              voice over

      the cartoon peril was no more  the quest for holy grail

      could continue



   animated sequence  leads through to the group reappearing and seeing a

   distant opening to the cave  they reach the opening  it is day





33 exterior  day



   the knights emerge from the mouth of the cave to find themselves in a

   breathtaking barren landscape  glencoe  they are half they way up

   the side of a mountain  they rest a few seconds and get their breath

   back



                              galahad

     look



                              galahad

     there it is



                              arthur

     the bridge of death



                              robin

          to himself

      oh great 



   they look and see on the side of the mountain there is a sort of milestone

   which bears the words  aaaaarrrrrrggghhh  5 miles and an arrow



                              arthur

      god be praised  this must be the gorge of which the old man spoke

      in scene twentyfour



   the knights set off along and rather perilous track edging along

   the side of the mountain  galahad is leading



   mix through they are climbing higher  the path gets more and more

   slippery and dangerous  they reach another milestone which says

   aaaaarrrrrrggghhh  4 miles and an arrow and ni  82 miles and

   an arrow pointing in the opposite direction  they go on  it is

   dangerous and difficult  tension in their faces



   as they are climbing bedevere turns to robin and arthur



                              bedevere

      we must find the bridge  the bridge of death 



                              robin

          to himself

      oh great



                              bedevere

      the bridge is guarded by a bridgekeeper who asks each traveller

      three questions  and he who answers the three questions can

      cross in safety



                              robin

          warily

      and if you get a question wrong



                              bedevere

      you are cast into the gorge of eternal peril



34 exterior  day



   cut to them struggling along  perhaps downhill now  it is growing misty

   sir launcelot stops them and points  they peer



   cut to see in the mist  a weird bridge with mist swirling up from the

   gorge below  we cannot see the other side



   beside the bridge an old man stands he is the blind soothsayer they

   met earlier in the forest



                              arthur

          to bedevere

      hes the keeper of the bridge  its the old man



                              bedevere

      and he will ask you three questions  answer those question as

   bridge of death

                              arthur

                              galahad

      three questions may cross in safety



                              robin

          warily

      and if you get a question wrong

   launcelot approaches the bridgekeeper



                               bridgekeeper

       stop



   sir launcelot stops  the knights watch anxiously  arthur sniffs briefly

   and glances momentarily down at sir robins lower armour



                               bridgekeeper

       who approaches the bridge of death

       must answer me

       these questions three

       ere the other side he see

       right  off you go



   sir launcelot runs across into the mist  the bridge perhaps disappears

   into the mist and we cannot see the other side  arthur and sir robin

   exchange glances  robin breathes a great sigh of relief



                               robin

   he is immediately hurled by some unseen force over the edge of the

   precipice



                               robin

       aaaaarrrrrrggghhh





35 exterior  day



   cut to sir launcelot who is only just arriving on the other side  he looks

   back across the invisible chasm  dimly in the distance he hears



                               gawain  out of vision

       sir gawain of camelot

      oh er  babylon  er  aaaaarrrrrrggghhh



   sir launcelot stands on the other side of the bridge  in the

   distance we hear the ritual of questions and then a scream and thud

   suddenly a hand lands on launcelots shoulder



                              policeman voice over

      just want to ask you some questions sir



    launcelot turns and reacts  he is led away





36 exterior  lake  day



   cut to arthur galahad and bedevere struggling towards the lake



                              bedevere

          to arthur

      how did you know how many wingbeats a swallow needs to

      maintain velocity



                              arthur

                              arthur

      what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow



                              arthur

                              arthur

      well you have to know these things when youre a king you know



   suddenly they appear at waters edge  they look across the water  a huge

   expanse disappearing into the mist  how can they cross



   suddenly the air is filled with ethereal music and out of the mist

   appears a wonderful barge silently and slowly drifting towards them



   they gaze in wonder  the mysterious boat comes to where they are standing

   as if bewitched they find themselves drawing closer

   to the boat  as they are about to step in a ragged figure looks

   up at them



                              boatkeeper

          he is the same as the bridgekeeper and the soothsayer

      he who would cross the sea if fate

      must answer me

      these questions twentyeight



   he fixes them with a baleful eye arthur and bedevere exchange glances

   then turn with minds made up pick him up bodily and throw him in the

dear mike



the censors representative tony kerpel came along to fridays

screening at twinkenham and he gave up his opinion of the films

probale certificate



he thinks the film will be aa but it would be possible given

some dialogue cuts to make the film an a rating which would

increase the audience  aa is 14 and over and a is 514



for an a we would have to



           lose as may shits as possible



           take jesus christ out if possible



           loose i fart in your general direction



           lose the oral sex



           lose oh fuck off



           lose we make castanets out of your testicles



i would like to get back to the censor and agree to lose the

shits take the odd jesus christ out and lose oh fuck off but

to retain fart in your general direction castanets of your

testicles and oral sex and ask him for an a rating on

that basis



please let me know as soon as possible your attitude to this



yours sincerely



mark forstater
