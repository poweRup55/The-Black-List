               the capitol dome at washington fades in it is night and 
               the dome is flooded in light

               this view dissolves to the exterior of a newspaper office 
               window seen at night the letters on the window illuminated 
               by a street light are picked out with increasing 
               distinctness they read washington postdispatch this 
               dissolves into the night city editors office where a 
               lethargic eyeshaded man behind a desk reaches for the 
               telephone which is ringing

                                     editor
                              mechanically
                         desk
                              then perking up
                         what

               inside a phone booth in a hospital corridor where a nurse 
               seated at the corridor desk is visible through the glass 
               doors of the booth a man is telephoning

                                     reporter

                         drop it or delay itwe are going to 
                         bring about investigations and 
                         investigations will show that we own

                         are strained to the breaking point

               he throws his serviette down and rushes from the diningroom

                                     emma

                         papas mad mama

               the scene dissolves to hubert hoppers study at night hubert 
               is pacing miserably as emma enters carrying his dinner on a 
               plate and setting it down on his desk

                                     hubert
                              in quiet heart
                              breaking appeal

                         no wonderwithout your dinner

                                     hubert
                         emma which is ithorace miller or 
                         henry hill

                                     emma
                              starting out
                         well your children are very bright
                         and they say jefferson smith

               and emma without pausing passes on out hubert is beside 
               himself and begins to pace again

                                     hubert
                              to himself

                         millerhorace hiuhhenry

               then on a desperate impulse he takes a coin from his pocket 
               and gets ready to flip

                                     hubert
                         headshill tailsmiller

               he shuts his eyes and flips the coin falls on the library 
               table he rushes to it his eyes pop

               the coin is seen standing on edge leaned against a small 
               stack of magazines and papers

               hubert is at his wits end then his eyes travel over to the 
               paper on top of the pile we see the newspaper headline

                             grateful citizens pour gratitude
                                    on hero jeff smith

               hubert stares at this headline then suddenly wildly dashes 
               for the door

               the scene dissolves to a street at night a row of simple 
               whiteframe houses with neatly kept front years and white 
               picket fences street lamps illumine the scene a limousine 
               has come to a stop before one house jefferson smiths and 
               governor hubert hopper is alighting he pauses to look at 
               the house is uncertain for an instant as to whether to go 
               in or not then makes up his mind pushes through the gate 
               and goes up the walk

               at the door hubert pauses again before knocking but finally 
               does so as his knuckles rap on the door a terrific blast 
               of band music blaring instruments badly played lets go 
               from inside the house hubert startled out of his wits 
               turns to run for his life and makes two steps when the door 
               is opened and there stands a smallish somewhat gray sweet
               faced little lady jeffs ma the music goes on so that 
               both have to raise their voices above it

                                     ma
                         i thought i heard yes

               in the sitting room of the smith home a neat cozy room 
               there are about twenty kids ranging from nine to fifteen 
               imitating a band an older boy is leading them they are of 
               all descriptions of dress some in poor clothesone with 
               his leg in a brace hubert edges into the room dumbfounded

                                     ma
                              loudly above the 
                              music
                         ill call jeff hes back in the 
                         shop

               she starts across the room hubert remains disconcerted by 
               the music suddenly he looks off into the adjoining room 
               with curious interestand also to escape the music he moves 
               toward it

               the adjoining room the hubert enters is an office it contains 
               everything from a rolltop desk crammed with mail to a small 
               power printing pressto shortwave radio equipment it is a 
               beehive of activity with some eight or ten boys working

               copies of boy stuff into bundlestinkering with the short
               wave set hubert is set back on his heels by this unexpected 
               sight he notes the little placards framed on the wall 
               bearing the words of great men and such admonitions as 
               when theres an edgegive it to the other fellow when a

               the exterior of the capitol building is seen in the view 
               from the library of congress side showing both wings of 
               house and senate with the steps leading up to the massive 
               columns

                         home of congress

               in front of the capitol people in a bus are craning their 
               necks outand we find jeff among them a spieler is 
               standing in front near the driver speaking through a small 
               megaphone

                                     spieler
                         yes sir you are looking at the 
                         building where your lawmakers have 
                         sat since the time of washington

               in the bus jeff looks at the spieler suddenly

                                     jefferson
                         since the time of adamsnot 
                         washington

                                     spieler

                                     jefferson

                                     spieler
                              trying to scare him 
                              out of his facts
                         ohyoure sure of that now

                                     jefferson
                         yes washington laid the cornerstone 
                         thoughwearing an apron for the 
                         ceremony that was embroidered by 
                         madame lafayette

                                     spieler
                              interrupting

                              quickly to driver
                         lets go henry

               the driver throws the bus into gear as the spieler gives 
               jefferson a dirty look

                                     spieler
                         now on your right folksyou see 
                         the library of congress

               all heads turn to look out of the right side of the bus and 
               the exterior of the congressional library is seen as the bus 
               moves along

                                     spielers voice
                         greatest library in the world 
                         five million books and two and a 
                         halfmillion maps charts and musical 
                         compositions

               in the bus jefferson seen closely is looking at the 
               building in an awed manner

                                     jefferson
                         you left out the most important thing 
                         thats where you see the constitution 
                         and the declaration of independence

               the spieler is seen getting pretty sore at this kind of thing

                                     spieler
                         as the gentleman sayswithout anybody 
                         asking himthats where you see 
                         those original priceless documents
                         the constitution and declaration of 
                         independence
                              to jeff sarcastically
                         much obliged my friend youre a 
                         great help to me lets go henry

               the scene dissolves to a series of views a travel montage 
               of the washington monuments as jeff sees themhis amazement 
               and reverence on seeing the supreme court building the white 
               house the washington monuments constitution avenue and so 
               on

               then the lincoln memorial comes to view and jeff is seen 
               walking up the stepseyes fixed ahead wonderingly soon he 
               approaches the top steps and now his is on the floor of the 
               shrine suddenly he stops dead and the full figure of lincoln 
               comes to viewthe huge overpowering figure seated in that 
               great armchair it is an almost breathing sculpture of the 
               great humane man looking out

               jefferson seen closely is overawed and reverent looking 
               up at the face with mechanical steps he comes forward 
               against a background of enormous columns which shed a powerful 
               solemnity upon the scene he comes forward slowly and stops 
               and the words on the statue appear

                                      in this temple
                              as in the hearts of the people
                               for whom he saved the union
                                  the memory of abraham
                                         lincoln
                                   is enshrined forever

               jefferson has his heart in his mouth his head turns slowly 
               to the left

               on the left wall the second inaugural address of lincoln 
               carved in the stone appears and jeffersons head turns 
               back to lincoln he quotes in a halfvoicelooking up as 
               though he heard lincoln say it

                                     jefferson
                              softly
                         with malice toward none with 
                         charity for allwith firmness in 
                         the right as god gives us to see the 
                         right

               he breaks off and turns his head to the right

               then at the right wall the gettysburg address carved in 
               stone appears and jefferson turning back to the figure of 
               lincoln again recites

                                     jefferson
                              softly
                         that these dead shall not have 
                         died in vainthat this nation under 
                         god shall

               lincolns figure is seen at close range as jeffersons voice 
               comes over

                                     jeffersons voice
                         have a new birth of freedomand 
                         that government of the people by 
                         the people for the peopleshall 
                         not perish from the earth

               while jefferson says these words and while we hold on the 
               face of the man who uttered them the scene dissolves slowly

               jeffs senate outer office is seen at dusk the light is 
               murky saunders is pacing a groove in the carpet diz moore 
               is still reclining on the sofa

                         yesi think maybe youd better

               the scene dissolves to the interior of the taxicab with 
               jefferson and saunders jefferson looking out of the windows 
               seeing what he can see even though its night saunders 
               giving him an impatient martyred look

                                     jefferson
                              pointing out

               suddenly he leans over saunders and points excitedly out her 
               side of the cab

                                     jefferson

               jeffersons side

               now we see the hotel curb the cab the footman and jeff

               the scene dissolves to a phone booth with saunders on the 
               phone

               jeffs room jeff appears standing at the window with one of 
               his pigeons while mcgann is heard on the phone

                              she hangs up

               in mcganns room mcgann hangs up tiptoes over quickly and 
               closes the door to jeffs room then makes a dash for his 
               coat

                         fell into something

               the scene dissolves to the hotel lobby at night and mcgann 
               is seen watching for his date but in jeffersons boarding 
               house sitting room there is a startling tableau jeff is 
               standing in the center of this rather homely anciently 
               appointed sitting room surrounded by ten or a dozen newspaper 
               men three or four of whom have cameras a woman reporter is 
               present nosey is leading the circus as the main interrogator

               separating and making for their seats jeff excitedly sits 
               down again

               after a full view of the chamber showing people subsiding 
               into their seats all over the gallery we see the gray small 
               president of the senate he has a mild humorful face 
               everything is in order in front of him as he looks out over 
               the body of the senate and picks up the small ivory gavel
               head his eyes look off intently at something he raises his 
               gavel a the long hand of the clock that comes to view jumps 
               to twelve oclock exactly two gavel pounds are heard

                                     president

                         the senate will come to order

               the body is lulled though a few members are walking to their 
               desks then the senator occupying the desk traditionally 
               used by the majority leader front and center and on the 
               right side of the aisle rises

                                     majority leader
                         mr president

                         the journal stands approved

               jefferson is seen in close view his attention darting from 
               one point to the other

                                     senators voice
                         mr president

                         the clerk will call the roll

               at the rostrum the chief clerk proceeds to call the roll 
               and senators voices answer to their nameshere or 
               present

               the clerk is next seen passing up the roll sheet to the 
               president who looks at it

                                     president
                         eighty senators have answered to 
                         their names a quorum is present

               paine rises

                                     paine
                         mr president

                                     president
                         senator paine

                                     paine

                         jefferson smith who has just been 
                         appointed senator by the governor of 
                         my state

               a page takes the credentials from paines hand and takes 
               them to the desk

                                     paine
                         the senatordesignate is present

               jefferson looks startled

                                     paines voice
                         and i ask that the oath of office 
                         be administered to him at this time

               the president is picking up what are evidently jeffersons 
               credentials

                                     president
                         if the senatordesignate will present 
                         himself at the desk the oath will 
                         be administered

               jefferson swallowing frightened is glued to his seat for 
               an instant people in the gallery and the senate turn to 
               look for him among them are saunders and in the press 
               section diz a few of the senators consult the newspapers 
               on their desks significantly

               paine rises motioning to jefferson to get to his feet and 
               jefferson on seeing him gets up unsteadily paine starting 
               to the back indicating that he is to follow him jefferson 
               advances to the rear of the center aisle where paine is now 
               waiting for him then both of them start down the aisle toward 
               the rostrumwhile the people including saunders the press 
               and groups of senators watch them advance some of the 
               senators appearing tightlipped and disapproving aware of 
               the eyes on him jefferson in the company of paine arrives 
               at the lower level of the rostrum while the people of the 
               press rise to look over their desks at the ceremony then 
               paine indicates to jefferson to mount one more step to the 
               level just below the presidents desk but as jefferson makes 
               the designated step up and the president is about to rise 
               a voice cracks out from somewhere out in the chamber

                                     senators voice
                         mr president i rise to a question 
                         of order

               all turn to the senator who has risen jefferson standing 
               before the president turns to look back

                                     president
                         the gentleman will state it

                         if the gentleman about to be sworn

                              chamber is visible
                         but one that brings his rank down 
                         to the level of a sideshow 
                         entertainerand reflects on the 
                         sincerity if not the sanity of

               the president shakes hands with jefferson paine shakes his 
               hand then guides him down one step to the clerk where 
               jefferson dazed understands that he is to sign the register 
               then jefferson and paine start back up the center aisle all 
               eyes following them and ripples of laughter breaking out 
               from all over the chamber

               jefferson is seen making his way back up the aisle suddenly 
               he snatches up a paper from a desk he passes and his eyes 
               fasten on the headlines he continues to walk readinghis 
               jaw muscles tighteningthen he looks up into the press 
               gallery

               see a pair of doors on which is printed press club and 
               when these doors are pushed aside violently the press club 
               bar is visible as jeff stands glaring newspaper men are at 
               the bar and at tables ranged along the wall conversation
               smoke sweeney farrell flood summers and diz are there
               and nosey

                              with a distinct lack

               in a great perspiring fuss he drops the subject like a hot 
               coal comes to paine quickly and seizes his hand

                                     jefferson

                              starting to back 
                              toward the foyer as 
                              he speaks to susan

               and at this point he backs right into a delicate sidetable 
               with a lamp on it table and lamp go down with a crash

               jeff turns like a rabbit and heads for the hall door we 
               hear it slam susan laughs loudly paine looks toward the 
               foyer thoughtfully

                                     paine
                              reflectively

                         these days

               the scene dissolves to jeffs outer office at night with 
               saunders at her desk as mcgann comes charging in perspired 
               and bothered

                                     mcgann

                              innocently slipping

               as the door is swung open jeff bursts in marching in step 
               to his spirited whistle he marches right up to the astounded 
               saunders and mcgannand finishes his whistle with a flourish

                                     jefferson

               jumps up as saunders goes to her desk to pick up paper and

                              without stopping
                              giving it the southern

               mcgann is a man fit to be tied suddenly he lunges for his 
               hat and starts out quickly into the corridor

               rushes up

                         and something else too miss saunders
                         the spirit of itthe ideathe

               in his walk he has come to the window he points out 
               suddenly

                                     jefferson
                         thats whats got to be in it

               she looks in that direction and sees the lighted capitol 
               dome as seen through the windowwith jefferson in the 
               foreground

                                     jefferson
                              pointing
                         that

               saunders indicates that she sees the dome her eyebrows 
               lifting a little

                                     saunders
                              quietlywith only a 
                              touch of sarcasm
                         on paper

                                     jefferson
                              still looking out of 
                              the window not 
                              conscious of her 
                              cynical question
                         i want to make that come to life
                         yes and lighted up like that too
                         for every boy in the land boys forget 
                         what their country meansjust reading 
                         land of the free in history books 
                         and they get to be menand forget 
                         even more liberty is too precious 
                         to get buried in books miss saunders 
                         men ought to hold it up in front of 
                         themevery day of their lives and

                         children will

               and we see saunders looking at jefferson with a new expression
               listening rather raptlythen starting to make rapid notes

                                     jeffersons voice
                         the boys ought to grow up 
                         remembering that

               he breaks offturns from the windowcollecting himself out 
               of a dazeand a little embarrassed

                                     jefferson

                         wow

               as he makes a dive for his hat the scene dissolves to 
               glimpses of the shopping tour of jefferson smith

               he has the prince albert coat of a new suit onstanding 
               before a mirrorthe sleeves too shortlooking really 
               like a scarecrowand being frightened of his own image in 
               the mirror saunders is standing by supervising

               he is trying to walk in a pair of pointed black shoes his 
               feet hurt terribly

               he is trying on hats we catch one that sits on his head 
               like a peanut he looks to saunders who shakes her head

               in a barbers chairhis hair being cuthis nails are being 
               manicured he stares unbelievingly down at the manicurists 
               work

               jeff in his rooms is getting all tricked out in his new 
               clothes saunders ties his tie and puts a flower in his 
               buttonhole

               finally the scene dissolves into the paine limousine and we 
               see at last the full result of the dressing of jefferson 
               smithtogged out from top to toe and very uncomfortable 
               susan snatches glances at the effect out of the corner of 
               her eyes

                         senator i wanted to meet you thanks 
                         for coming sit down

               jeff hesitates looks at the men his eyes resting on paine 
               a moment more and more puzzled he takes a chair just a 
               step away

                                     taylor
                         well i hear youve been right on 
                         your toes since you got here pitching 
                         right in lots of people took you 
                         for dumbbut theyre wrong youre 
                         smart in fact i think youre 
                         smart enough to understand a situation 
                         when its explained to you

                                     jefferson
                         like what mr taylor

                                     taylor
                         well nowjust to take an example
                         putting up a damon willet creek 
                         as i look at itthat dams going to 
                         do the people of our state a lot of 
                         good

                                     jefferson
                         yes so i was told mr taylor but

                                     taylor
                              interrupting
                         but you have some objections here 
                         and there and maybe right for all 
                         i know but the point istheres no 
                         sense stopping the whole works now
                         specially after some men have worked 
                         hard for a long time to put this 
                         through

                                     jefferson
                         what is your interest in this mr 
                         taylor

                                     taylor
                         mine whynaturallywhatever 
                         benefits the state is mighty important 
                         to meowning a lot of its industry
                         newspapers and other odds and ends 
                         and if i thought you had the welfare 
                         of the state at heart like myself
                         for instance if you were to turn 
                         around and help a project like this 
                         along instead of standing in the way
                         why id say you were a man to watch 
                         for a fellow your age youd be in a 
                         spot to make a great start in life 
                         if you liked businessyou could 
                         pick any job in the state and go 
                         right to the top or politics if 
                         you like being a senator no reason 
                         why you couldnt come back to that 
                         senate for the rest of your life

                                     paine
                         jim

                                     taylor
                              sharply
                         just a minute joe

                                     paine
                              fighting
                         you cant say that to

                                     taylor
                         i know what im doing ill say 
                         what i want

               paine rushes to the door and is gone there is silence for 
               an instant jeff rises

                                     taylor
                         sit down smith im not through

               jeff remains standing

                                     taylor
                         as i was sayingthe state needs 
                         men like yousmart men
                              indicating the boys
                         now these boys are and theyve 
                         been doing all right they dont 
                         worry about being reelectedor 
                         anything else they take my advice
                         and theyll go a lot farther yet 
                         so you see youve got a pretty 
                         important question to settle for 
                         yourself smith but youre smart

               jeff looks from taylor to the other boys

               jeff turns and starts for the door taylor rushes after him

                                     taylor
                         smith

               jeff goes out quicklyas paine stops dead staring after 
               him

               the scene dissolves to the visitors room adjacent to the 
               senate chamber with taylor and paine huddled together 
               talking in low tones and rapidlypeople occasionally passing 
               in the background

                                     taylor

                                     paine
                         its crucifying him

                                     taylor

                         yes on the date set forth here mr 
                         kenneth allen came before me to record 
                         this deedsetting over these two 
                         hundred acres in the name of jefferson 
                         smith

                                     a senator
                         let me understand mr smith did 
                         not appear before you

                                     kim
                         no sir that is not required by our 
                         state law

               now senator paine is talking to the committee with apparent 
               difficultyand reluctance

                                     paine
                         this is a very painful duty for me 
                         this boy is the son of my very best 
                         friend i sponsored him in the senate 
                         i helped him frame his bill and the 
                         day he presented it i went over to 
                         congratulate him but i pointed out 
                         that a dam was already going up on 
                         the very site he had chosen for his 
                         camp there are hundreds of equally 
                         good camp sites nearby and so i 
                         suggested he choose another he became 
                         furious he said move the dam i 
                         was amazed at his violent reaction 
                         i couldnt understand it until the 
                         evidence came to me that he owned 
                         those very two hundred acres and as 
                         you have heard had carefully made 
                         plans to make an enormous profit out 
                         of the nickels and dimes scraped 
                         together by the boys of this country 
                         faced with that and regardless of my 
                         personal feelings for the boy my 
                         sense of duty told me that his 
                         expulsion from the senate was the 
                         only possible answer

               then jeff is on the standgrim determined while the 
               chairman holds the deed and contract

                                     chairman
                              strongly
                         what possible explanation can you 
                         offer for this charge beingas you 
                         saytrumped up against you

                                     jefferson
                              firmly
                         it was done to stop me from talking 
                         about a section of the appropriations 
                         bill

                                     chairman
                         it was

                                     jefferson
                         yes this was how i could be put out 
                         of the senate and out of the way 
                         they even promised me that if i

                                     a senator
                         wait a minute three days ago this 
                         bill was read in detail before the 
                         body why didnt you object then

                                     jefferson
                         i wasnt in the senate that day

                                     senator
                         where were you

                                     jefferson
                         toto a receptionuhfor a princess
                         i forget her name

               after an instants pause a quick look passes between the 
               chairman and the committee

                                     chairman
                         and you say you never signed this 
                         contract with mr allen

                                     jefferson
                         i did not

                                     chairman
                         youve never seen this contract

                                     jefferson
                         never

                                     chairman
                         but you did talk to mr allen about 
                         that and

                                     jefferson
                         ii discussed it with himyes
                         because iyou see ive always had 
                         this camp in mindbut i made no 
                         contract with him

                                     chairman
                              shoving contract at 
                              jeff
                         thenthis is not you signature 
                         senator

                                     jefferson
                         looks like it but

                                     chairman
                         but it isnt

                                     jefferson
                         it couldnt be

                                     chairman
                         you are saying in effect that this 
                         is a forgery

                                     jefferson
                         im saying i didnt sign it

               we see jeffersons hand writing his namethe eighth signature 
               in a row then a man on the stand is comparing papers in his 
               hands

                                     man
                         in my professional opinion as an 
                         expert on handwriting id say that 
                         the name of jefferson smith on this 
                         contract has been forged

               then another man stands before a large screen with jeffs 
               signature blown up on it

                                     second man
                         after a long study of this signature 
                         it is my professional opinion that 
                         it is definitely in jefferson smiths 
                         own handwriting

               then a third man is on the standwith papers spread before 
               himcomparing as he talks

                                     third man
                         it is extremely difficult to tell a 
                         clever forgery from the real thing 
                         you can always get divided opinions 
                         from experts but i would stake my 
                         whole twentyyear professional career 
                         on the fact that this is not a 
                         forgery but is mr smiths own 
                         signature

               the scene dissolves to saunders room at night where saunders

               she turns her back to paine and goes to the window he 
               hesitates a momentthen moves to leave dropping the folded 
               paper on the table he goes saunders turns and sees the 
               paper she clamps her jaws and turns away again

               the scene dissolves to jeffs private office at night jeff 
               is behind his deskonly the desk lamp lighted in the room
               sitting numbly staring ahead blankly the phone rings

               in jeffs private office we see that ma has nearly broken 
               jeff down he hangs on with all hes got

                                     jefferson
                         why sure ma sure

                              crying outright
                         wellso long skinny

               he hangs up quicklyand rises from his chair he appears to 
               have been pushed to the breaking point in terrible torment 
               he looks out the window then on an impulse he seizes his 
               hat from off the corner of his desk and starts out

               the scene dissolves to the lincoln memorial jeff is walking 
               up the steps his eyes lifted up intently to something ahead 
               the memorial stands magnificent and breathtakinglighted up
               in the background as he mounts the steps jeff gains the 
               top level and proceeds toward the lincoln figure and the 
               stone lincoln comes into view in the backgrounddramatically 
               lighted he approaches to within fifteen feet of the figure 
               and pauses now jeff is scanning the face of lincoln with a 
               tortured expression then he turns awayas if not being 
               able to face the spirit of the manand moves quickly to the 
               steps then jeff nearly blind stumbling out of the interior 
               of the memorial comes to a stop at a columnthen breaks 
               down completely slipping to the steps at the base of the 
               column and burying his face in his hands

               saunders is standing near another column close by her eyes 
               on jeff and is swallowing back her tears when she hears 
               jeffs sobs she starts toward him she comes to him and 
               sits down beside him it is an instant before he realizes 
               that anyone is there

                                     saunders
                              quietly
                         hello

                                     jefferson
                         saunders

               he turns away and tries to recover himself she waits
               watching him at last jeff can trust himself to talk

                                     jefferson
                              attempting lightness

               he turns away again to get control of himself saunders 
               watching him

                                     saunders
                              after a pause
                         what are you going to do

                                     jefferson

                              as she watches him
                              quietly
                         it might save some of the pieces

                              and pulls him down 
                              the steps

               the scene dissolves to the senate chamber as the president 
               pounds the gavel

                                     president
                         the clerk will call the roll

               the clerks voice begins to call the namesand the voices 
               of senators answer the president looks out to jeffersons 
               empty desk then paine is seen also looking at jeffs desk
               as paine answers to his own name

               in the packed visitors gallery as the roll is heard an 
               old lady who is knitting and an old man look down

                                     old man
                         nope not here they never show up

                         too bad mightve been a little 
                         excitement

               taylor and mcgann are seen smiling down with satisfaction

                                     mcgann

               in the press gallery sweeney and farrell are looking at jeffs 
               empty seat

                                     sweeney
                         well thats good never could 
                         stand executions

               in the senate chamber the clerk reads a few names then

                                     clerk
                         jefferson smith

                                     jeffersons voice
                              ringing out
                         here

               jefferson enters the chamber with a brisk step his head 
               held high the only thing peculiar about him is the bumpy 
               appearance of his jacket pockets in his hands are books and 
               papers everywhere there are reactions to his appearance at 
               the rostrum the clerk in amazement has stopped reading 
               and watches jeffs progress to his desk the saunders and 
               diz enter the press gallery she carrying a senate manual 
               and jeff takes his seat in the chamber

               then a hum grows over the packed chamber seen in full view

                                     president
                              banging
                         the clerk will proceed with the roll

               the startled clerk proceeds as jeff smiles around at the 
               chamber and then looks up at the gallery where saunders is 
               waving to himsmiling

               the scene dissolves into the senate chamber

                                     president
                         proceeding now to the order of 
                         business

                                     senators voice
                         mr president

               the senator who was chairman of the committee on privileges 
               dearborn is on his feet

                                     dearborn
                         in pursuance of the notice i gave 
                         yesterday i desire to call up the 
                         report of the committee on privileges 
                         and elections on the expulsion of 
                         jefferson smith

               we see jefferson smiling a shade sickly looking up at 
               saunders

                                     presidents voice
                         the clerk will read the report

               the clerk rises senator dearborn remains standing as the 
               report is read while in the press gallery saunders is seen 
               indicating sit tight to jeff

                                     clerk
                              reading
                         the committee on privileges and 
                         elections report that it appears to 
                         the satisfaction of the committee 
                         after hearing a number of witnesses 
                         that justice to the senate requires 
                         that jefferson smith no longer 
                         continue a member of this body

               there is dead silence in the chamber

                                     clerks voice
                              as we see jeff smiling 
                              courageously
                         they therefore respectfully report 
                         this resoultion with the unanimous 
                         recommendation that the same do pass

                                     clerk
                              seen in the full 
                              chamber
                         resolved that jefferson smith be 
                         expelled from his seat in the senate

               there is continued dead silence in the chamber then a senator 
               rises

                                     senator
                         mr president i move for the 
                         immediate adoption of the resolution

               in the press gallery saunders is now signaling frantically 
               to jeff and then jefferson and another senator leap to their 
               feetcalling out almost simultaneously

                                     jefferson
                         mr president

                                     senator
                         mr president

                                     jefferson
                         i addressed the chair first sir

                                     senator
                         i am about to ask for a roll call on 
                         the passage of the resolutionwithout 
                         further delay the senator can have 
                         nothing to say at this time that 
                         would not be either in bad grace or

                                     president
                         however senator smith is still a 
                         member of this body and as such has 
                         equal claim on the attention of the 
                         chair

                                     jefferson
                         you were about to recognize me sir

                                     president
                         that is merely your impression 
                         senator the chair has yet to settle 
                         the question to its own satisfaction

               in the press gallery on a nudge from saunders diz applauds 
               and yells

                                     diz
                         let him speak

               sweeney and flood also applaud dizs cry

               in the visitors gallery the old lady and old man are leaning 
               forward interestedlyeyes bright this is fireworks they 
               applaud too and immediately the sound grows all around 
               them from people in the gallery

               in the senate chamber the president bangs his gavel and 
               looks up at the gallery

                                     president
                              sharply
                         before proceeding i should like to 
                         remind visitors that they are here 
                         as our guestsand ought to behave 
                         as such i might add that their 
                         sentiment will certainly in no wise 
                         affect the judgment of this chair

               he pauses and glares out over the senate

               jefferson is seen waiting for the chairs rulingholding 
               his breath there is a dead pause during which jeff and the 
               contending senator are on their feet suddenly the president 
               whips his gavel up and out like a referee saying in that 
               corner

                                     president
                              barking
                         the chair recognizes senatorsmith

               a wave of excited relief sweeps the chamber while in the 
               press gallery saunders tense face is thawing out fast

                                     jefferson
                              a smile breaking 
                              over his face
                         i thank you sir

               he glances up at saunders who smiles back at him

                                     jefferson
                              addressing the chair
                         wellseems like some of the gentlemen 
                         are in a pretty tall hurry to have 
                         me out of here the way the evidence

               there is a hum in the chamber and the gavel pounds paine is 
               on his feet

                         to hear what a man of his condemned 
                         character has to say about any 
                         section of any legislation before 
                         this house

                         was ready to tell you that one man 
                         in my statemister james taylor
                         was putting that dam through for his 
                         own profit

               a hum of excitement and the gavel pounds we get glimpses 
               of taylors reaction and paines growing dread of this 
               outburst

                         and everything else worth controlling 
                         in that statepowerful enough to 
                         buy men and put them in this congress 
                         to legislate his graft i saw three 
                         of those menwhen mister taylor 
                         came here to see me

                         a place in this senate for twenty 
                         years if i would vote for a dam 
                         that he knew and i knew was a 
                         fraud but if i opened my mouth 
                         against it he promised to break me 
                         in two and i stood here one day and 
                         triedi started to open my mouth
                         and it all came to pass the long 
                         powerful arm of mister james taylor 
                         reached right into this sacred chamber 
                         and took me by the scruff of the 
                         neck

                         tell you why we were in tht room 
                         because mr taylor a respected 
                         citizen of our state had brought 
                         with him the evidence against this 
                         man later presented from this floor 
                         and we were urging him to resign

                         clean and honorable state

               jeff now listens in amazementstunned by the desperate 
               fighting lies of paine

                         the state and all of usif we did 
                         not let him go through with his

                         as he tried to blackmail me to 
                         prevent his expulsion he would 
                         probably even try to hold up this

                              he breaks off 
                              remarking the senators 
                              relieving each other

                         the senator will please suspend until 
                         order is restored in the chamber

               a close view of jefferson shows a slight strain after these 
               seven or eight hours of continuous talk his collar is undone 
               his beard has started to sprout his eyes go back to his 
               book and he continues his reading

               a broadcasting studio appears revealing h v kaltenborn at 
               the microphone

                                     kaltenborn

                         in its most dramatic form the 
                         least man in that chamber once he 
                         gets and holds the floor by the rules 
                         can hold it and talk as long as he 
                         can stand on his feetproviding 
                         always first that he does not sit 
                         down second that he does not leave 
                         the chamber or stop talking the 
                         galleries are packed and in the 
                         diplomatic gallery are the envoys of 
                         two dictator powers they have come 
                         to see what they cant see at home
                         democracy in action

               the floor of the senate is seen again

                                     jefferson
                         certain unalienable rightsthat 
                         among these are life liberty and 
                         the pursuit of happiness that to 
                         secure these rights governments are 
                         instituted among men deriving their 
                         just powers from the consent of the 
                         governed that whenever any form of 
                         government becomes destructive of 
                         these ends it is the right of the 
                         people to alter or to abolish it 
                         and to institute new government 
                         laying its foundation on such 
                         principles and organizing its powers 
                         in such form as to them shall seem 
                         most likely to effect their safety 
                         and happiness
                              finishing with a 
                              flourish and putting 
                              the book down
                         now thats pretty swell isnt it 
                         i always get a great kick outa those 
                         parts of the declarationespecially 
                         when i can read em out loud to 
                         somebody

               he picks up the book and starts to walk with itstretching 
               his legs to get the stiffness out

                                     jefferson
                              waving the book
                         you see thats what i had in mind 
                         about campexcept those men said it 
                         a little better than i can now 
                         youre not gonna have a country that 
                         makes these kinds of rules work 
                         if you havent got men whove learned 
                         to tell human rights from a punch in 
                         the nose and funny thing about men
                         they start life being boys thats 
                         why it seemed like a pretty good 
                         idea to take kids out of crowded 
                         cities and stuffy basements for a

                                     a senator
                              looking back and 
                              calling out dryly
                         you wouldnt care to put that to a 
                         vote senator

               a ripple of laughter the gavel pounds another senator is 
               up

                                     senator
                         will the senator yield for a question

                                     jefferson
                         i yield

                                     senator
                         in view of the gentlemans touching 
                         concern for the senators would he 
                         permit a motion to recess until the 
                         morningat which time he could 
                         continue to educate this august body 
                         with his profound babblings

               jeff pauses he looks up senators come up from under their 
               newspapers on the alert maybe this is the trick that 
               dislodges him

               we see saunders shaking her head pointing jeffs attention 
               to the chair then jeff looking down from saunders then 
               around him suspiciously

                                     jefferson
                              addressing the chair
                         well nowi wouldnt know about 
                         that mr presidentwhat happens to 
                         me in the morningi mean about my 
                         having this floor to go on babbling

                                     president
                              seen if a full view 
                              of the chamber
                         if the senator permits this motion 
                         to recess he will not have the floor 
                         in the morning to babble or anything 
                         else unless he is recognized first 
                         by the chair

               with a wise expression jeff picks up where he left off way 
               back saunders and diz leave the press gallery in this 
               scene

                                     jefferson

                         gentlemenim either right or crazy 
                         and i feel fine

               the senators go back under their newspapers the ruse didnt 
               work

                                     jefferson
                         the people of my state have got both 
                         ears full by this time theyre

                         oh thanks
                              the page boy shows 
                              he still has on his 
                              ranger button

                         states
                              reading
                         article onesection one

               the scene dissolves to a street in jackson city at night 
               to a parade of which we see the torchlights and hear the 
               noise of bands and shouts a huge banner is seen extended 
               across the marchers reading

                                       mass meeting
                                    jackson city hall

               this banner passes and another comes forward which reads 
               protest smith filibuster then we see the public auditorium 
               at night people jamming the entrance and milling around 
               outside at the entrance groups are seen being told that 
               the place is full up with no seats then we are in the 
               auditorium where several prominent citizens are seated on 
               the platform among them happy hopper happy mops his brow 
               in extreme discomfort kenneth allen is addressing the 
               assembly rabblerousing

                                     kenneth allen
                         hes a redhanded criminal that 
                         jefferson smith going to block that 
                         damkeep money and employment out

                         millions are we going to let a 
                         scoundrel like that throw mud at a 
                         man like joe paine

               a shout of no is thrown back at him

                                     allen
                         are you for joe paine

               a yell goes up

                                     allen
                         then tell him you are

               another cheer and at this point somewhere in the auditorium 
               a youngster yells down with all his might

                                     kid
                         hurray for jeff smith

               but simultaneously with his yelling and right at the end of 
               the cheer the band strikes up stars and stripes forever 
               the kids are drowned out and almost immediately are seized 
               by the scruff of the neck hands clasped over their mouths 
               and dragged out the scene dissolves to headlines flying up 
               to screen capping allens request

                                           wire
                                  congress stop smith

               this dissolves to the jackson city press office with mcgann 
               at a desk surrounded by a few other men

                                     mcgann
                              talking excitedly

                         sweetwater

               in the senate upper corridor saunders and diz are pushing 
               out of one of the gallery doors and through the crowd diz 
               has saunders by the hand

                                     saunders
                              in alarm

               she pulls him along quickly

               the scene dissolves to jeffersons office at night with 
               saunders on the phonea sheaf of papers in her hand diz 
               alongside

                                     saunders

               in ma smiths sitting room ma is on the phone several boys 
               around her a clock here shows the hour to be about 1021

                                     ma

               the boys pile around with pads and pencils

                         shoot clarissa

               and little bobby with a bugle raises it and blows a 
               tremendous exultant blast

               the scene dissolves to a montage presentation of the conflict 
               between the taylormcgann press and the youngsters press 
               first saunders is on the phone reading material to ma

                                     saunders
                         the willet dam is a graft to line 
                         the pockets of the taylor machine 
                         taylor has bought off congressmen 
                         for years and has systematically 
                         robbed the people he offered jeff a 
                         seat in the senate for life if he 
                         would vote as he was told

               this is contrasted with taylor with a sheaf of papers in 
               his hand reading over the phone

                                     taylor
                         chicki want the whole morning

                         holds the floor of the united states 
                         senate

               from the above starts by saunders and taylor there follow 
               the words of saunders being taken down on a broken little 
               portable typewriter by one of the kids with other kids 
               bringing him sheets of paper in longhand

               contrasted is mcgann listening in while beside him a couple 
               of men with earphones pound professionally at typewriters 
               the sheets are grabbed out of their rollers by runners who 
               tear out of the office with them

               we see the kids setting type laboriously

               contrasted are linotypists of the jackson city press

               the kids cut their paper to size on a little hand apparatus

               contrasted we see the huge rolls of paper being set in the 
               giant presses

               we see the kids composing and locking their type in little 
               flats

               contrasted are the moulds being put into place on the jackson 
               city press rollers

               we see the little press starting up hand fed and pumping 
               out one little circular at a time

               contrasted is the whirling giant press rattling out at trip
               hammer speed

               back to the little press pumping out boldly printed 
               circulars with headlines that read

                                  people of this state
                                    read jeffs story

                                jeff smith speaks to you

                                smash the taylor machine

                               jeff smith is fighting graft

               contrasted is the whirling jackson city press over it 
               headlines flash up

                             smith forcing nation to crisis

                                       stop smith

                                         protest

               then a cartoon is seen depicting jeff with a little whiskbroom 
               sweeping back an ocean labelled public condemnation

               then another cartoon showing a line of haggard people at a 
               window marked relief funds a man at the window holds up 
               his hand palm out and says sorry jefferson smith is 
               still talking

               back to kids who are stacking and tying bundles of circulars

               contrasted we see the professional stacking and tying of an 
               army of workers in the jackson city press rooms perhaps 
               showing a change of shiftsfresh men coming in as the gong 
               sounds and shows that it is five oclock in the morning

               back in the smith home with the kids still active and the 
               press still going ma is giving the kids coffee one kid is 
               bobbing at a desk a big boy is putting a little fellow 
               sound asleep down on a bed

               the scene dissolves to bobbing senators at their desks in 
               the united states senate jeff is seen still talking his 
               hair is disheveled he is weary in the joint with black 
               circles under his eyes collar open jeff is saying

               circulars are carried out and loaded on these contraptions 
               some of the kids are starting away with their bundles the 
               bugle note sounds over the scene

               contrasted at the jacskon city press the morning extra is 
               being loaded on big handsome trucks which roar away

               then the distribution of the reading matter by both taylors 
               press and the kids we see taylors trucks dumping bundles 
               at street corners to newsboys

               jeffs kids race down residence blocks throwing circulars on 
               lawns passing them out on business streets shoving them 
               into peoples handsat crowded street corners at factory 
               entrances

               taylors newspaper boys are interspersed hawking their 
               papers end of the montage

               in the jackson city press office mcgann is on the phone 
               with men rushing into him with copy

                                     mcgann

                         loud speaker equipment on wheels

               he is interrupted by a man who rushes in with some leaflets 
               in his hand

                                     man

                         the boys out kill it

               the scene dissolves to residence blocks three episodes 
               showing a couple of kids rushing along with a wagon full of 
               circulars and other kids taking from it to distribute them 
               a big open truck swerves up to the curb a couple of men 
               rush out push the kids away from the little wagon grab the 
               circulars and toss them into the truck the kids raise a 
               hue and cry and pile on a quick freeforall in which the 
               kids are sent sprawlinga smack to the jaw a kick

               this dissolves to a slum location a large truck is loaded 
               with signs is surrounded by shabbilydressed men mcgann is 
               on hand with a fist full of money signs are being passed 
               down to the waiting men and as each takes one mcgann slips 
               a bill into his hand and he hurries off with a sign the 
               signs carry these appeals stop smith wire congress

               americans starve hero joseph paine joe paine saved

               then we see an overlapping series of posters going upa 
               banner being hoisted over a street men pasting up huge twenty
               four sheets and three sheetsand little cards tacked to 
               telegraph poles and sides of buildings they read stop 
               smith wire congress a piece of bunting folded up suddenly 
               is pulled open to reveal stop smith now we are in a street 
               at the front end of a small but boisterous parade composed 
               principally of adults with a sprinkling of kids both adults 
               and a few children flanking the marchers play instruments 
               there are banners at the end of the parade which read down 
               with graftand taylor

               smash the taylor machinesmith is fighting your battle 
               jeff smith was framed have jeff smith and a clean state

               suddenly those in the forefront look off in horror as almost 
               simultaneously they are hit by a might stream of water we 
               see a fire truck and hoses pouring water held by a couple 
               of firemen with the aid of a plugugly there are glimpses 
               of people as they are swept off their feet and whirled 
               violently on the ground simultaneously a calliope is heard 
               down the street comes the truck pulling a tremendous poster 
               on which is printed stop jeff judas smith this truck 
               with calliope playing moves through what remains of the 
               parade a loud speaker attached bawls out

                                     loud speaker voice
                         stop smith remove this scoundrel 
                         from the senate wire congress

               this dissolves to a corner a soap box is surrounded by a 
               small group which is in the act of forming

                                     soap boxer
                              yelling

                         if you want the truth read

               the small group is rushed by some professional hoodlums 
               they charge through the group and the soap boxer is dragged 
               from his perch at this instant a screaming siren is 
               overheard people pause to look up then a moving airplane 
               is seen with siren screaming pulling a streamer on which 
               are the the letters stop smith wire congress

                         citizen

               various groups of people in the streets are looking uppeople 
               raising their windows to look out people rushing out of 
               doors from factories and public building as the loud speaker 
               continues

                                     loud speaker voice
                         to wire congress put smith out of

                         needy and hungry americans

               but in a street there appears the car of the governors 
               children and it is pulling a trailer on which small hand
               painted posters lean against each other these posters bear 
               the words stand behind jeff and read what taylors papers 
               wont print the governors kids are recognized in this car 
               and also the little boy with the bugle who is playing one 
               continuous blast the kids are throwing circulars to the 
               left and right as they move down the street suddenly a big 
               touring car with some plug uglies in it bears down with a 
               roar on this little trailer they run into itgasoline is 
               either poured on it or the gasoline tank is drilled with a 
               bullet and a match is set to the whole works the trailer 
               and the car go up in a blaze as the kids scramble out to 
               save their lives

               the scene dissolves to the hopper executive office in which

                         the only causes worth fighting for 
                         and he fought for them once for the 
                         only reason that any man ever fights 
                         for them because of just one plain 
                         simple rule love thy neighbor

                         fight for this lost cause even if 
                         this room gets filled with lies like 
                         these and the taylors and all their 
                         armies come marching into this place 
                         somebodyll listen to mesome

               the chamber whirls in front of jeffs eyesand he pitches 
               forward to the floor people get to their feet automatically 
               all over the houseand there is dead silence except for 
               saunders who utters one shriek as she gets to her feet
               then stands unable to move

               then paine rises stifflyhis face a complete blankand 
               starts toward the cloak room several feet away

               the tense silent shock of the senate floor is broken and 
               men start for jeffs inert form a tumult goes up and 
               jefferson is seen inertcompletely goneas men surround 
               him and thensuddenlyoffscenea pistol shot is heard 
               heads turn violently in the direction of the cloak room 
               women scream

               in the cloak room near the door to the chamber paine is 
               now struggling with three or four men who wrest a revolver 
               out of paines hand in violent desperation paine tears 
               himself loose and rushes for the chamber

               in the chamber paine comes toward the center aisle jefferson 
               still lying face down on the floor

                                     paine
                              crying out to the

               he continues toward the chair as he talksa man distracted

                         and i committed it

               paine walks mechanically toward the chair

                                     paine
                              shouting

                                     saunders
                              wildly clutching 
                              diz
                         he did it

                                     diz

                         this story

                              pounding vainly with

                                     saunders
                              screaming
                         he did it yippee

               the scene dissolves to the hopper kids a newspaper between 
               themand just yelling at the tops of their lungs

                                     boys
                         yeow

               and this is followed by a bonfire scene with boy rangers 
               leaping and yelling and then we see the window of the offices 
               of the jackson city press at night where a rock goes crashing
