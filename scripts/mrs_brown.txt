	ext the grounds of windsor castle forest  night

	begin on black  the sound of rain driving into trees 
	something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
	a forest on the shoulders of a wildeyed kilted john
	brown  drenched hair streaming head swivelling left and
	right as he searches the lighteningdark  a crack to his
	left  he spins round raises his pistol smacks past
	saplings and plunges on

	ext the grounds of windsor castle forest  night

	closeup on brown as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
	air  a face in its fifties madfierce eyes handsome
	bruised lips liverish  he goes on searching the dark 
	stops  listens through the rain  a beat  thinking he
	hears a faint thump in the distance he swings round and
	races on

	ext the grounds of windsor castle forest  night

	brown tears through the trees pistol raised at full arms
	length breath coming harder and harder  but even now
	theres a ghost grace a born hunters grace  he leaps
	fallen branches swerves through turns in the path eyes
	forward never stumbling once

	ext the grounds of windsor castle forest  night

	brown bursts into a clearing breaks to the centre and
	stops  with his pistol raised he turns one full slow
	circle  his eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
	wildly swaying trees

	theres a crack and a branch snaps behind him  he spins
	round bellows deep from his heart

				brown
		god save the queen

	and fires

	nothing happens  the trees go on swaying the storm goes
	on screaming and brown just stands there staring into
	empty space  a pause

	slowly he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
	him that he is alone  he stares at the thrashing trees
	waving their mocking arms at him  his hand lets the pistol
	drop to his side  he feels the rain drench down his face 
	and now for the first time we see that his socks have
	fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds  he
	shifts a foot  his dressshoes are covered in mud  he
	goes on staring into the dark  nothing 
	just the wind and rain  gradually we pull back higher
	and higher  as we do we hear the quiet cultivated voice

		i have sent for a mr john brown from

		a most devoted outdoor servant to
		prince albert during his last days

	int osborne house queen victorias dressing room  day

	the screen is black  as the camera pulls back we discover
	that we are looking at a black nightgown

	queen victoria is sitting at her dressing table while an
	elderly hairdresser also in black works at her hair

				ponsonby vo
		 the depths of the queens sorrow
		remain impenetrable  she has now
		restricted herself to a regime of such
		ferocious introspection that we are
		all at our wits end

	int osborne house prince alberts dressing room  day

	a bust of the prince consort is draped in black  his desk
	is laid out as if for work  a valet is brushing one of his
	suits before laying it carefully on the bed

				ponsonby vo
		 the household continues at her
		instruction to observe the rituals
		now so familiar to her in a vain
		attempt to render vivid that which can
		never be revived

	closeup on a small table as a shaving brush is placed
	carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water

	int osborne house queen victorias dressing room  day

	the hairdresser is pulling victorias hair back into the
	widows cape  for the first time we see her face  it is
	set in a mask of severity

				ponsonby vo
		 it will not surprise you to hear
		that she continues steadfast in her
		refusal to accept any public
		engagements however trivial

	int osborne house queen victorias bedchamber  day

	a bronze cast of prince alberts hand hangs above the royal
	bed  his sleepinggown is laid out on one side

	a somberly dressed middleaged man stands by the bed
	doctor jenner the queens physician  he is placing
	potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table

	behind him two maidservants are busy stripping and
	remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
	room

				ponsonby vo
		 family and staff expend all their
		efforts endeavouring to draw her out
		of this state of unfettered morbidity
		but to no avail  indeed doctor
		jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
		her sanity unless some remedy is
		found

	int osborne house queen victorias dressing room  day

	victoria is turning slowly around as a young assistant
	dresser completes the fastening on her black crepe dress

				ponsonby vo
		 we must hope therefore that this
		mr brown will appeal to the queens
		sentimental though deeplyheld view
		that all highlanders are good for the
		health  if she can at least be
		persuaded to take the air the
		prospect of further recovery may seem
		less remote

	the assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress 
	victoria winces slightly

				assistant dresser
			terrified
		sorry maam

	ext the sea front isle of wight  day

	we glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads
	isle of wight 1864

	a driver stands against the sea front with a horse and cart
	bearing the royal coat of arms

	john brown leads his pony along the dockside towards the
	waiting driver  he is in his late thirties fit handsome
	and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket

	sitting at his writing desk completing a letter

				ponsonby vo

	he folds the letter and slips it into an envelope  he is a

	int osborne house corridor and queens dining room  day

	a series of windows are being slammed open by white
	stockinged footmen as members of the royal family and upper
	household hurry by in silence all dressed in mourning and
	rushing to make the luncheon hour

	int osborne house queens drawing room  day

	queen victoria heads down the empty corridor with two
	ladiesinwaiting lady ely and lady churchill hurrying
	along a pace behind

	members of the royal family and upper household hurry into
	the icy dining room and take their designated places at the
	luncheon table  everybody is dressed in mourning and
	nobody speaks  wind whistles through the open windows 
	silence

	among the diners we catch our first glimpse of bertie the
	prince of wales  he is in his midtwenties plump stiff
	dressed and balding  he stands next to his young wife
	princess alexandra who fiddles nervously with her shawl
	trying to keep warm

	as bertie smooths down his thinning hair doctor jenner
	bustles into the dining room stands himself next to
	ponsonby and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
	with the prince of wales entirely in whispers

				jenner

	john brown leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the
	carrier bearing the royal coat of arms  the driver leans
	in

				driver
		are you riding up front

	brown looks straight at this man quiet and reserved

				brown
		ill stay with the pony thank you 
		shes all the way from deeside and
		shes not sure she likes you yet

	the driver shrugs and slams the doors on them

	int osborne house corridor and queens dining room  day

	victoria reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
	breath  lady ely and lady churchill stop a pace behind

				victoria
		how many

	lady ely is slightly taken aback

				lady ely
		the royal family and senior members of
		the household maam

				victoria
		just them

				lady ely
		yes maam

	victoria closes her eyes then steels herself and steps
	through the door

	int osborne house queens dining room  day

	everyone stiffens as victoria walks in  acknowledging the
	other diners with a quick nod the queen takes her place

	she flaps open her napkin and bang on cue everyone else
	sits and does the same  the meal is served immediately by
	waiting servants who plonk the food down without ceremony

	its a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables  victoria
	starts eating heartily straight away  everyone does the
	same

	only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence

	ext osborne house the grounds  day

	the royal horsecarrier rattles into the grounds and on
	down the driveway past the beautiful manicured lawns
	stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of osborne
	house  a few outdoor servants watch its progress
	curiously

	int osborne house queens dining room  day

	the silence continues as victoria finishes her plain
	pudding  immediately servants appear at every place and
	whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
	finished or not  nobody thinks this odd it is part of the
	routine  doctor jenner clears his throat

				jenner
		were expecting brown this afternoon
		maam

				victoria
		whom

	a beat  victoria takes a sip of water dabs her mouth with
	her napkin and rises  everyone else rises too  suddenly
	the queen turns to berties nervous wife princess
	alexandra and proclaims abruptly

				victoria contd
		thats a very pretty shawl you are
		wearing alex  silk suits you well
			beat
		but you are not eating enough  one
		must not let vanity overrule ones
		appetite

				princess alexandra
		yes maam

	victoria nods earnestly  lost to the effect her words have
	had she marches out again  behind her she leaves
	princess alexandra feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
	front of all the others  bertie takes her hand and
	squeezes tight trying awkwardly to console

	ext osborne house  day

	the horsecarrier pulls up outside the servants entrance
	and the driver opens the doors

	john brown pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
	the time  his eyes narrow critically

				brown
		i was due at a quarter past one
			beat
		youre late

	int osborne house corridor  day

	a few minutes later john brown strides down the long
	corridor with ponsonby at his side  their journey takes
	them down an endless series of corridors past servants and
	householders hurrying about their duties  the presence of
	the dead albert is felt all around in the blackwreathed
	portraits and busts that crop up along the way

	brown and ponsonby could not be more contrasted

				ponsonby
			in low tones
		her majestys routine at osborne house
		is not as you will remember it  the
		household remains in full mourning and
		noone is permitted to raise their
		voice under any circumstances
		whatsoever  as for the queens
		routine she breakfasts at nine
		thirty lunches at twotakes tea at
		five thirty and dinner at eight forty
		five  no one is allowed to leave the
		building while the queen is at home 
		on the rare occasions when she is out
		you may ask permission to leave but
		only with my consent 
		youre to be ready to walk the pony at
		any time after ten oclock  youll
		clean her outdoor things and do any
		odd jobs as and when she requires

				brown
		how will i know

				ponsonby
			surprised to be interrupted
		im sorry

				brown
		how will i know what she requires

				ponsonby
		youll be sent a message

				brown
		wholl bring it to me

				ponsonby
		her highness equerry

				brown
		i need a man who knows where i am

				ponsonby
		im sure it wont be difficult to find
		you

				brown
		thats not good enough

	a beat

				ponsonby
		then well have to see what can be
		arranged

				brown
		aye do

	ponsonby stiffens  a beat

				ponsonby
		there is to be no communication with
		other members of the household on
		matters concerning the court except
		through myself or one of the
		equerries  no plans must be altered
		unless you are given prior authority
		by myself or a senior member of the
		household

				brown
		i came down at the queens request 
		ill take my orders from her

				ponsonby
		in matters concerning the household i
		act on her behalf

	brown takes the measure of him

				brown
		do you

				ponsonby
		yes
			beat
		i do

	brown glances up the corridor

				brown
		so is passing wind out of the
		question or do i need permission for
		that

	ponsonby refuses to acknowledge what he has heard  they
	reach the door of the royal chamber and he concludes the
	interview

				ponsonby
		as i am sure you remember from
		balmoral you do not talk while in her
		majestys presence unless her majesty
		addresses you directly

	brown refuses to answer so ponsonby knocks  after a
	moment the door is opened by lady ely who ushers them in

	int osborne house queens sitting room  day

	brown walks stiffly into the room and stops  ponsonby
	waits by the door

				ponsonby os
		mr brown maam

	victoria is bent over the desk working at one of her
	numerous red boxes  she scribbles furiously at a letter
	underlining and accenting words as she goes  finally lady
	ely steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear 
	she carries on working

	brown has time to survey the room  dominating everything
	are the same blackwreathed busts and portraits of prince
	albert glimpsed in the corridor

	finally victoria nods and lady ely beckons brown forward 
	he steps up in front of the desk and waits  victoria looks
	up and brown bows deeply

	silence

	she stares at him for a long moment without apparently
	registering who he is  he towers over her in bright
	tartan while she sits hunched in her seat all in black
	and knotted with tension

	finally she finds her voice  she sounds nervous and edgy

				victoria
		mr brown

				brown
		maam

				victoria
		you are here safely

				brown
		aye maam

				victoria
		you are well

				brown
		i am

				victoria
		and the pony

				brown
		shes well too

	victoria blinks at the sight of him  his presence is
	bringing him back  a beat

				victoria
		your family sent cards  it was much
		appreciated

				brown
		im glad of it

	in an effort to control her emotions victoria now sounds
	the same severe note as at lunch  but brown unlike
	others seems unaffected

				victoria
		my husband was always very
		complimentary in speaking of you  he
		would have approved i am sure of my
		calling on you in this way
			beat
		i trust it does not inconvenience you
		too much

				brown
		ive no family maam apart from my
		brothers and sisters

				victoria
		yes
			beat
		you have a brother in service here do
		you not
			furrowing her brow
		i forget his name

				brown
		archie

				victoria
		yes
			beat
		that will be company for you

				brown
		yes maam

	silence  victoria starts to tire  she takes a sip of
	water and spills a little on herself  flustered she
	searches for a hanky but cannot find one  lady ely hurries
	up with one of her own and the queen dabs it off  brown
	watches all of this with genuine concern  when victoria
	finally looks up he stares at her in deep sympathy

				brown contd
		honest to god i never thought to see
		you in such a state  you must miss
		him dreadfully

	victoria stares back in stunned silence  ponsonby coughs
	involuntarily  lady ely freezes  a beat

				victoria
		you do not  he  get him out
			beat
		get him out  get him out

	suddenly brown finds himself tugged backwards out of the
	room  lady ely rushes up to assist as victoria shouts
	herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing

	int osborne house browns quarters  day

	some minutes later brown is angrily unpacking a trunk 
	his humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
	ferocity with which he slams down every object

	his younger brother archie sits on the bed  hes in his
	early thirties bright sharp and dressed in the same
	distinctive kilt and tweed

				archie
			telling it fast
		so the day they arrive she greets the
		sultan and his family with barely a
		word and then retires to her chamber 
		the sultan not used to state
		occasions without a head of state is
		standing in the lobby waiting for
		someone to tell him what to do  but
		the court is under strict instructions
		not to talk in the corridors so nobody
		speaks to him not a living soul for
		the whole afternoon  so now its
		dinner and everyones standing round
		the table  still not a word 
		waiting for her majesty to arrive 
		one hour goes by two the sultans
		getting a wee bit peckish to say the
		least  so finally his wee laddy
		breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
		slice in his mouth  well the uproar
		when she heard  youd have thought
		someone had stolen the crown jewels

	brown stares back still pissed off

				brown
		so

				archie
		so there are rules  things you do
		and things you dont do

				brown
		i was just telling the woman how i
		feel for gods sake

				archie
		you dont tell her majesty how you
		feel

				brown
		i speak as i find archie

				archie
		not down south you dont

	brown slams a drawer shut  archie lets it go and watches
	his brother  a beat

				archie contd
		so what did ponsonby do when she
		started shouting

				brown
		i think he nearly ruptured his truss

	a beat then both men burst out laughing

	int osborne house servants hall  day

	the clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
	hurry about with plates knives and forks laying the upper
	servants huge table for dinner  archie leads brown
	through this rush of activity

				brown
		how much

				archie
		seventy a year

				brown
		not bad not bad

				archie
		how about yourself

				brown
		sixty

				archie
			grinning
		thats pretty good for a ghillie

	brown smiles dryly  they pour themselves a drink from the
	table

				brown
		prince leopold  is he the one who
		bleeds all day  so what does his
		valet do  wash his poultices for him

				archie
		its better than shovelling horse
		shit

				brown
		if you were looking for promotion you
		should have picked one of the
		healthier ones

				archie
		shes hardly a full hamper herself

				brown
			beat
		its only grief makes her like she is

				archie
		three years john  is that not a bit
		long to be grieving

				brown
		she loved him

				archie
		come on man  theres love and
		theres 

				brown
		what

				archie
		you know what i mean

				brown
		im not sure i do archie

				archie
		theres love and theres behaving like
		you do because theres nobody to tell
		you not to

	hold on brown  he lets it go and moves on  across the
	hall he spots the pretty assistant dresser watching them

				brown
		which one of us is she flirting with

				archie
		the goodlooking one

				brown
		aye  then shes obviously not got
		enough to do

				archie
		you work the system right you could
		ask her yourself  just be thankful
		youre not working for household  the
		queen never lets them out of her
		sight  but wee spats like us can slip
		through the net easy

	a beat  brown stares straight at him

				brown
		im no wee spat archie

	int osborne house upper corridor  morning

	the next day victoria and her ladies are hurrying down a
	corridor on her way into the dining room  victoria
	suddenly stops and stares out of the windows  her
	entourage are several steps past her before they realize
	whats happened and scurry back to take up their positions
	behind

	now we see what has caught her attention  brown is
	standing in the courtyard below by his pony  she watches
	him for a moment then without reacting walks on

	ext osborne house  afternoon

	some hours later  it is now raining

	a gaggle of royal grandchildren hurry out of a carriage
	from their afternoon recreational while their nannies
	frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas  john
	brown stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
	around him laughing and giggling

	int osborne house upper corridor  evening

	rain on the window  victoria is walking in the opposite
	direction down the corridor with her entourage  she stops
	at the same place as before

				victoria
			as if she had not seem him
			 earlier

	lady ely peers through the rain

				lady ely
		its mr brown maam

		horse

				victoria
		i made no request to go out riding
		today

				lady ely
		i dont know maam
			nervously

				victoria
		sir henry mr brown is standing in the
		courtyard  i have no wish to go
		riding

				ponsonby
		im very sorry maam  i cant
		imagine  he was certainly given no
		instructions

				victoria
		please make sure it does not happen
		again

				ponsonby
		of course at once

	victoria takes one last look and walks away

	int osborne house private secretarys chambers  night

	half an hour later ponsonby stands at his desk facing
	brown

				ponsonby
		what on earth did you think you were
		doing

	brown stares straight back

				brown
		awaiting my orders

				ponsonby
		you do not report for duty unless the
		queen requests it  you know that very
		well

				brown
		i didnt come all this way to sit on
		my arse

				ponsonby
		you will await your orders like
		everyone else  unless you prefer a
		repeat of yesterdays little
		excitement

				brown
		no

				ponsonby
		i beg your pardon

	int osborne house upper corridor  day

	the next day  from a high window we see ponsonby
	scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
	john brown who is standing exactly as he was the day
	before

	victoria watches impassively

	ext osborne house courtyard  day

	ponsonby stands close to brown shouting in his face

				ponsonby
		i thought i made myself perfectly
		clear  you do not leave your room
		until her majesty requests it

				brown
			eyes straight ahead
			 shouting back
		well you tell her majesty from me if
		her husband was here now hed have
		had her out of that house and getting
		some air in her  what the hells the
		point in me being here otherwise

	from the window above victoria takes in his words  a
	beat  ponsonby collects himself

				ponsonby
		go inside at once

				brown
		is that the queens request

				ponsonby
		yes it most certainly is

	brown turns grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back
	to the stables

	int osborne house stables  day

	a few minutes later brown is in the process of stabling
	his horse  suddenly he turns

	victoria is standing at the far end of the stable with her
	entourage

				victoria
		mr brown

				brown
		yes maam

				victoria
		you have been told repeatedly not to
		stand in the courtyard unless
		requested to do so

				brown
		yes maam

				victoria
		then why do you persist in doing it

				brown
		because i think her majesty is wrong 
		if ever there was a poor soul who
		needed fresh air it is her

	a beat

				victoria
		the queen will ride out if and when
		she chooses

				brown
		and i intend to be there when shes
		ready

	silence  the two of them stare at each other

	ext osborne house the grounds  day

	the next day high and wide over the stunningly manicured
	landscape  long lawns windcropped copses and in the
	distance the glittering sea

	ext osborne house the grounds  day

	victoria sits sidesaddle on a horse  brown leads her in
	silence

	ext clifftop  day

	victoria looks up

				victoria
		prince albert was going to build a
		bench here  he thought it one of the
		best views in osborne

				brown
		its a fine spot maam

				victoria
		he thought so yes

	she stares ahead

				victoria contd
		in everything i do and everything i
		say i try to think as much as
		possible what he would do or say if
		he were here now  my private
		secretary wishes me to return to
		public duties

	she stops abruptly but brown cuts in

				brown
		if prince albert were here today hed
		tell him a thing or two

				victoria
		sir henry is not alone  they all wish
		it
			beat
		the same people who refused to grant
		my husband the title of king because
		he was deemed of insufficient rank

	she stops again cutting quickly back to smalltalk

				victoria contd
		it is a fine spot for a bench is it
		not

				brown
		aye maam

				victoria
		yes

	a pause

				victoria contd
		i have some letters in the saddle bag 
		i wish to read them

	brown walks up to her side opens the saddle bag and hands
	her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon

				victoria contd
		i cannot read them like that

	brown undoes the ribbon and tries again  victoria cuts in

				victoria contd
		you will hand them to me as i require

	brown takes off the top letter and hands it to her

	int osborne house upper servants table  night

	the clatter and crush of the upper servants table as upper
	servants sit themselves down to dinner while under servants
	prepare to serve soup

	archie comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
	next to an empty seat  a moment later brown strides in

	but instead of sitting at the place beside his brother he
	goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
	down  slowly the clatter dies away as the whole room
	stops and stares at him in silence  brown fixes them with
	a look

	an elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
	amazement at brown  a smooth young man berties valet
	hurries up to intercede

				berties valet
		mr carter the head butler sits
		there

				brown
		not now he doesnt  this is my place

				berties valet
		by whose authority

				brown
		my own

	a little frisson of ohmygawdness  berties valet stares
	icily at him

				berties valet
		the order of seating at the upper
		servants table is arranged personally
		by the queen herself

				brown
		thats a tautology lad
			unable to stop himself
			 seriously explaining it
		if you say the queen arranges
		something youve no need to say shes
		done it personally  thats
		understood

	but as far as berties valet is concerned it isnt  he
	stares down in mute fury then snaps his fingers at one of
	the under servants who rushes over  there is a hurried
	exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out

	unperturbed brown brings out his flask and pours himself a
	substantial draft of whiskey  he turns to the pretty
	assistant dresser sitting to his right

				brown contd
		are you dresser to her majesty

	she blinks nervously at him

				assistant dresser
		assistant sir yes

	brown tucks into his soup  everyone watches and waits

				brown
		whats your name

				assistant dresser
		mary taylor sir

				brown
		have i seen you up in balmoral mary

				assistant dresser
		i hope to go up next year

				brown
		you wouldnt happen to know what the
		queens reading for recreation would
		you mary

	the assistant dresser thinks for a moment

				assistant dresser
		lord tennyson sir

	brown nods  all conversation stops as the under servant
	bursts back in  she halts at the door looking blankly
	from berties valet to the elderly butler  a beat  the
	old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
	table

	brown looks up from his soup

				brown

	with a clatter of spoons everyone obediently eats

	int osborne house drawing room  day

	a few days later  a morning drawing room  standing
	round the unlit fireplace are doctor jenner lady ely lady
	churchill the two ladies in waiting and princess
	alexandra  all are dressed against the icy wind that
	whistles through the open window where victoria sits
	knitting busily while bertie stands beside her coat
	buttoned up to the collar  ponsonby has stationed himself
	opposite beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes 
	he runs through the daily itinerary

				ponsonby
		lord clarendon arrives by invitation
		at eleven oclock followed at twelve
		by a picnic in the grounds to
		celebrate princess alices birthday 
		dispatches as usual at two
			finishes then coughs
		the chancellor writes to say that by
		happy coincidence he will be in cowes
		for the weekend  he asks if your
		majesty might grant him an audience

				victoria
		why

				ponsonby
		he thought perhaps your majesty
		might wish to be informed of the
		latest developments in government

				victoria
		no  i shall be out walking

	a beat  bertie watches closely now  ponsonby coughs
	again nervous

				ponsonby
		then perhaps your majesty might
		consider it opportune if the prince of
		wales were to meet him on your behalf

	victoria stiffens  she speaks without turning

				victoria
		on no account

	ponsonby gives up  politely but firmly bertie takes up
	the reins

				bertie
		mama i really do think its time we
		made ourselves a little more 
		available

	victoria carries on knitting

				bertie contd
		i think we must accept our position in
		the country is not entirely unrelated
		to the continued absence of the
		monarchy from public life
			silence
		i thought perhaps we might consider a
		small gesture of some kind

	victoria looks up sharply

				victoria
		gesture

				bertie
		i thought a dinner for our
		ambassadors perhaps

				victoria
			cutting in firmly
		no dinners bertie
			beat
		why are you dressed for outdoors

				bertie
		its so infernally cold in here

				victoria
		cold is good
			calling across
		is that not so dr jenner

				jenner
		im sorry maam

				victoria
		cold is good

				jenner
		excellent maam excellent
			trying his hand
		but perhaps if her majesty were to
		consider accompanying her newfound
		physical vigor with the benefits of
		mental activity

				victoria
			becoming very agitated
		why am i being lectured in this way

				jenner
		forgive me your majesty  in no way
		did i wish to suggest

				victoria
			cutting across him
		i will not tolerate anybody lecturing
		me about the responsibility of the
		monarchy

				bertie
		mother

				victoria
		 least of all my son  it was his
		irresponsibility that drove my husband
		to his grave

	an appalled silence  with great dignity bertie absorbs
	the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
	in another direction

				bertie
		if it is inconvenient to her majesty
		then perhaps she might consider
		allowing the prince of wales to host

				victoria
		i do believe they send so many boxes
		to taunt me 
		doctor jenner writes to them to say
		that my nerves are in an extremely
		fragile state and yet they continue to
		hound me with box after box after box
		after box after box

	silence  victoria has crossed to the window and stares out
	at the view  having recovered her composure she turns to
	address them all

				victoria contd
		i wish to take the princesses for a
		swim

	for a moment nobody believes what they have heard  she
	continues

				victoria contd
		the turns i have been taking in the
		grounds have proved most beneficial to
		me and brown thinks that salt water
		will do me good

	bertie stares at her in silence while ponsonby and doctor
	jenner exchange a worried look

	ext private beach isle of wight  day

	the doors of the royal bathingmachine swing open and queen
	victoria in a voluminous swimdress sails out like a duck
	into the freezing sea  as she does so the doors of the
	other machines open and princess helena and princess louise
	follow her in  dignity does not allow them to shout out
	but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture

	victoria begins swimming around in a vigorous little
	circle

				victoria

	hold for a moment on the princesses miserable faces

	ext osborne house  day

	half an hour later ponsonby doctor jenner lady ely and
	two footmen watch as brown helps victoria up some steps and
	onto her horse  he glances at the stiff line of
	householders and mutters curtly to himself

				brown
		you could buy that lot for garden
		ornaments and still see change from
		ten guineas

	the household do not hear this but queen victoria has
	overheard and tries to suppress a smile 
	as she settles into the saddle her foot comes loose 
	brown fastens it into the stirrups

	everyone hears this  victoria obeys  taking the reins he
	then walks the queen out of the courtyard  as they vanish

	int the houses of parliament  day

	tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the tory back benches
	from knee to knee  it is entitled where is britannia
	and shows an empty throne draped with the royal cloak

		 but by a chain of traditions that
		have been cherished from generation to
		generation because in them  in our
		traditions  are embodied all the
		laws which have enabled us to create
		the greatest empire of modern times

	during the above the cartoon reaches the front benches and
	lands on the knees of the young earnest stanley  as he
	frowns at the picture in front of him disraeli winds up

				disraeli contd
		 but even though we have amassed
		great capital and even though we have
		established an industry with no
		parallel in the world yet all these
		mighty creations are as nothing
		compared to the invisible customs that
		shape our lives  to those honorable
		gentlemen of the opposition who seek
		to destroy the essential elements of
		this country i say let them remember
		england cannot begin again

	during this peroration we see disraeli for the first time 
	he is handsome obviously jewish and wire thin like
	dickens on slimfast  he dresses almost dandyishly but
	speaks with startling vigor a combination of brilliance
	and cheek that is his key  to cheers from his back
	benchers he sits

	as he looks up he catches the eye of his opposite on the
	liberal benches  gladstone is different in almost every
	respect dour dogged heavyset and tall  they stare
	levelly for a second then disraeli flashes a brilliant
	smile

	stanley plops the cartoon on his lap

	int the houses of parliament lobby corridor  day

	a few minutes later disraeli and stanley are strolling
	down the busy lobby corridor  throughout their talk tory
	backbenchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
	offer their congratulations

				stanley
		should we take it seriously

				disraeli
		the cartoon or her majestys
		absenteeism

				stanley
		well both

				disraeli
		the question is do we need her

				stanley
		surely youre not suggesting we
		dispense

				disraeli
		my dear stanley a prime minister with
		only a handful of friends must respect
		public opinion

				disraeli contd
		gossip counts  lord aberdeen was
		right  this country is not governed
		by wisdom but by talk

		granted it wouldnt take much to
		winkle the old girl out of mourning
		but if public opinion is against her
		then it doesnt do to appear too

				brown
		what does he know about the highlands

				victoria
		he has been attending at balmoral for

				brown
		that doesnt make him an expert

				victoria
		his remarks were directed at the

				brown
		i dont groom a horse to have it
		admired by others i groom it because
		it needs grooming

				victoria
			curtly
		i do not do it for others  but
		ponsonby thinks they are good

		aye well if all you want is a good

	brown lowers his head

				victoria contd
			in a softer tone
		i mention you in them

		in particular the occasion when

	bertie is in midplea

				bertie
		surely it is for the gentlemen to
		decide when to stop

				victoria
		it is a disgusting habit bertie  it
		should be discouraged

				bertie
		yes but isnt midnight a little
		excessive

				victoria
		it is quite late enough

				bertie
		but mama the room was built expressly
		for that purpose  it has been a
		smokingroom by tradition ever since

				victoria
			cutting in angrily
		browns responsibilities are onerous

		to do without having to stay up all

		the smokingroom will be closed and

		mama

		and that is my last word on the

				bertie
		well im sorry but i really do think

	before bertie can continue brown steps right into his

		and in your opinion  is she foolish

		i would talk to her myself but she

		abandon this ridiculous favoritism
		before a situation develops

				disraeli
		a situation

				bertie
		i dont imagine you frequent the

				brown
		this is a slur on her good name

		in as much as the article is about

		it is not for any of the queens

		your majesty a settled resignation is

		active grief  if the good lord sees
		fit to bring one into contact with
		congenial fellow beings one should
		not analyze ones reaction too deeply 
		to allow oneself to be comforted by
		someone else need not imply any

	almost drowning out prince arthur prince louise and prince

	coughs  brown slowly lifts his head  his eyes have the
	slightly unfocused look of too much drink  it is clear to
	archie that he is about to be sentup

		did you see any irish assassins today

	brown doesnt react

	everyone bursts out laughing  brown slams down his glass

				brown
		theres not a soul here cares about

	he stops  archie has come across to his brothers chair
	and pulls gently on his arm

	brown stares at the servants  everyone is about to burst
	out laughing  keeping his dignity he pushes back his
	chair and lets archie lead him away

	as brown reaches the double doors the laughter hits him in
	the back like a wave archie holds him steady

	int balmoral castle browns quarters  night

	brown is lying on a grubby bed  archie is looking around
	the untidy room  for the first time he notices a thick
	manuscript on the table  brown follows his eyes

				archie
		whats this

				brown
		its a diary

				archie
		be careful who sees it

				brown
		what do you take me for

	archie turns back to brown

				archie
		you should have someone look after
		you

				brown
		im all right  i just need to rest up
		a wee bit
			feeling everything spin

	brown shuts his eyes and starts to drift  archie watches
	over him

				archie
		the place is a mess

				brown
		i cant move to tidy

				archie
		its what the maids are for

				brown
		im not having some prattler going

	int balmoral castle servants corridor  day

	dawn the next morning

	brown is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the
	stairs

	ext balmoral castle  day

	brown crashes out of a sidedoor  just fully dressed 
	to be met by the smiling figure of disraeli  he is got up
	in smart walking boots plusfours and a tweed jacket

				brown
		you sent for me

				disraeli
		ive been called back to london  my
		last day  i thought i might take a
		walk on lochnagar

	brown stares straight back

	ext lochnager  day

	an hour later brown leads disraeli up the hill  brown has
	his head down on with the job  disraeli slows to a halt

				disraeli
		princes and lords are but the breath
		of kings an honest mans the noblest
		work of god
			beat
		you must miss such magnificent views

				brown
		i dont think about it

	they reach the top and continue along the high ground 
	disraeli glances at brown and notices the limp

				disraeli
		forgive me ive called you out and
		you should have been resting

				brown
		im fine

				disraeli
		youre injured

				brown
		its nothing

				disraeli
		still someone must attend you  your
		wife should not have let you out

				brown
		im not married

				disraeli
			deadpan
		oh

				brown
		this is the top

	disraeli admires the view for a moment then continues

				disraeli
		i confess i sometimes feel as if i am
		not married myself i see my wife so
		little  but im forgetting the
		rewards

	he looks across  brown keeps staring ahead

				disraeli contd
		the look on their faces when one walks
		into the room  still gives one a
		ridiculous thrill

				brown
		i wouldnt know

				disraeli
		surely 

				brown
			interrupts
		what i do i do for my queen

				disraeli
		was there never ambition

				brown
			beat
		maybe once

				disraeli
		then i envy yo

				brown
		why

				disraeli
		to have achieved ones ambition or to
		have reconciled oneself to its limits
		is a lifetimes work

				brown
		i do what i do

				disraeli
		for her majesty

				brown
		aye

				disraeli
		but yourself
			beat
		what about john brown

				brown
		i said
			beat
		i serve the queen

				disraeli
		no other aspiration

	brown stares for a long moment  finally he speaks

				brown
		to see her safe

	disraeli steps a little closer

				disraeli
		you will not be unaware of the threat
		now posed by republicanism

				brown
		why do you think i keep her here

				disraeli
		ah but therein lies the paradox  it
		is her very isolation that encourages
		the malcontents  the longer she is
		away the stronger they become and
		who honestly can promise security
		against that  however many doors you
		lock someone will always get in 
		even here

	brown watches him eyes alert

				brown
		so

				disraeli
		the truth is the queen would be safer
		doing her duty and returning south to
		her public  john bull loves her and
		john bull is her best defense

				brown
		her mind is set  she wont change
		now

				disraeli
		she trusts you john

	disraeli is right on his shoulder now like his own voice

				brown
		they dont see it

				disraeli
		see what

				brown
		the threat
			beat
		i tell them but they dont see it

				disraeli
		they arent as watchful as you

				brown
		too busy looking after themselves

				disraeli
		the greasy pole

				brown
		no loyalty

				disraeli
		no love

	silence  for a moment brown seems unaware that someone
	else has said that

				brown
		i promised to protect her from people
		like you

				disraeli
		for once in my life i am not the
		issue

				brown
		shell never understand it

				disraeli
		in time she will

				brown
		shell think i betrayed her

				disraeli
		but others will know that you acted
		for the greater good

	brown stares off into the distance

	ext loch muick  day

	the next day

	brown is rowing victoria across the loch  the equerries
	wait on the shore

	victoria trails her hand in the water frowning at the
	surface  brown concentrates on the oars slipping them
	carefully through the water  

				victoria
		i received a letter today from mr
		disraeli  parliament is calling for
		my return to public duties
			beat
		why wont they let us be

	brown does not answer

				victoria contd
		he insists that the country expects me
		to preside over the opening of the new
		session  i refuse to offer sustenance
		to enable his weakening grip 
		besides you know how much i should
		hate it  it frightens me

	she notices that brown has said nothing

				victoria contd
		john

	brown does not look at her  finally

				brown
		we cant always have what we wish

	victoria stares at him

	int balmoral castle queens drawing room  day

	later that day

	victoria and brown are in the middle of a blazing row in
	front of the entire household including ponsonby jenner
	and lady ely

				victoria

		if duty and safety are served by the

				brown
		im breaking no promises

				victoria
		you are forcing me to do the very
		thing you know i fear most

				brown
		for gods sake woman im just trying
		to keep you safe

				victoria
		i will not hear any more about my
		safety  you made me a promise and
		now you have broken it

	brown rounds on her deeply wounded

				brown
		 when i took you out riding come
		rain or shine because i knew it was
		right for you when i kept the bairns
		off your back so you could have a bit
		of peace when i saw you safe from

		i was there  all ive ever thought
		about is you

				victoria
		then why send me back to them

				brown
		because i have to
			pause
		will you no listen to me woman

	face turned from him victoria replies in a brittle voice

				victoria
		do not presume to talk to your queen
		in that manner

	a long silence  brown watches her but she will not look
	at him again  finally she walks very slowly across the

	slightly

	a great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks
	and stands  clearly they were not expecting her  in
	silence victoria steps up and takes her place at the head
	of the table

	at last ponsonby leans forward deferentially

				ponsonby
		may i say how glad i am to see your

	victoria nods then turns and looks about at the others 
	princess alexandra is seated at the far end of the table 
	victoria frowns

		then why are you not with him

	victoria stares blankly at doctor jenner

				victoria
		no  you are mistaken  prince albert
		my husband had typhoid fever  i
		asked what was wrong with my son

		the same your majesty

	victoria stops  she stares down the length of the table

		i did not consider it wise in the

				victoria
		how ill is he

	suddenly the huge castle doors open and victoria bustles
	out with her entourage in tow  brown  only just in time 
	 yanks open the door for victoria to step past him and
	take her place  she ignores him completely

	brown slams the doors  as he looks up he sees his brother
	archie staring at him from across the courtyard  for a
	second the two brothers hold each others gaze  its
	obvious that archie has noticed the queens indifference 
	brown turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races
	away under him

	queen victoria sits at the foot of the bed a matriarch
	surrounded by her royal family  they watch doctor jenner
	bend to examine the ghostly figure of bertie  he listens
	for a pulse  finally he looks up

	victoria lets out a deep breath  she takes hold of

	a few minutes later brown stands in the corridor when the

	with ponsonby at her side

				ponsonby

		the queen will be riding to st

	a series of angles on brown as he walks amid the mass of
	onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding
	the cathedral  all the time his eyes flick left and
	right searching the faces in front of him for potential
	assassins  over his intense watchfulness we hear 

				dean wellselly os
		 praise and magnify thy glorious

		from the bed of sickness 
		we pray thee to perfect the recovery
		of thy servant and to crown him day by

	and brown follow brown sees arthur oconner break from the

				brown
		no

	brown looks straight ahead

				bertie contd
		i believe i saw him first and then
		alerted brown  im not convinced that
		he wasnt taking a snooze on top of
		the box  anyway we had our man
		pinned down and i must say brown
		acquitted himself admirably  of
		course the gun was a fake but all the
		same it was well done

	noone registers brown  but while victoria does not look
	at him she is acutely aware of his presence

		i intend brown to be rewarded with a

		it is a great comfort to me that my

		over the years have not been in vain

	the room has been cleared of bottles but the thinness of

	he is lying in bed barely conscious  after a moment he
	opens his eyes and stares at her  she steps forward
	smiling nervously

	her voice is the old voice between friends

				victoria
		you should never have gone out in such

		someone has to look after you

		it couldve been someone  it was

		yes  yes it was

		i know i have not always been the

		dont be silly woman

	his old familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
	herself together  seeing a bowl of water on the side
