          he looks around him to see several multi colored
          buildings and he appears to be on a checkered red and
          white brick road between two rows of buildings he sees
          a miniature castle at the end of the road that is about
          150th scale of another similar theme park

          the whole room is about 600 yards long and it gets small
          as you go near the castle there is a merry go round
          just to the left of castle and there are only four doors
          on the entire street one labeled movie theater the
          second labeled the old west the third fantasy land
          and the last labeled the real world the ceiling is as
          high as a high school gymnasium

          from beside the miniature castle comes a giant human
          sized scraps the dog a theme song starts to play over
          the intercom

          saundra is mildly amused with matthew and this is a
          tension causer for zach zach has no tolerance for
          anything not work related

                                          matthew contd

          int conference room  day

          this is a big money bank so the furnishings are
          extravagant the giant oak wood table is in the center
          of this room and a giant glass window facing the park
          can be seen

          saundra is at the table with about twenty other nd
          executives they are watching the latest internal video
          from ceo john c mccay

          on the video we see a nice little creek and pasture
          setting and wearing jeans  a sweater mccay sitting near
          a wooden fence

                                          john c mccay

                         for you

          the video ends with mccay giving the camera a thumbs up
          and the graphics saying first bank works for you 

          fred thomison 45 stands up and turns the monitor off
          he turns to the waiting executives

                                          fred thomison
                          well

                                          john c mccay
                              over the speaker phone

                                          fred thomison
                         we will start work on it now sir

          there is a rude unacknowledged click from the speaker
          phone then dial tone thomison turns the line off

                                          fred thomison
                         anyone know where to start 

                                          zach
                              oc
                         i do

          all eyes turn to zach in the door

                                          zach
                         we start with the top and work our way
                         down we start with the high salaries
                         and then just let the little people go
                         no need to make the blue collars go
                         crazy

                                          saundra
                         i disagree i think we should start
                         looking into the severance pay
                         schedules and make sure the people with
                         families can

                                          zach
                         look miss i know youre still upset
                         about that incident in chicago but
                         understand this is a cut throat
                         business we dont have time to play
                         nursemaid to every single tom dick and
                         harry

                                          saundra
                         maybe we should make the time
                         especially considering the sixteen
                         million dollars we have set aside
                         expressly to settle law suits from
                         these very events

          the whole room sits still for a moment

                                          fred thomison
                              democratically
                         lets put it to a vote all those in
                         favor of cutting loose without the
                         proper relations to our old co workers
                          put your hands up

          only zach raises his hand

                                          fred thomison
                         that about covers it then now the next
                         order of business will be

          cut to


          int ceo penthouse first bank  day

          this goes way beyond posh here there are exotic
          paintings originals and lots of open spaces elephant
          tusks and other hunter type trophies this is definitely
          a mans office from a man who suffers from penis envy
          he has all the high brow multi millionaire furnishings
          in dark wood and an outside fountain and arboretum this
          room is at least three thousand square feet

          zach enters with his briefcase in hand

          from outside enters john c mccay president of first
          bank hes in his mid to late fifties and all gray hair
          and a little portly he wears glasses and presents
          himself as having power

                                          john c mccay

                         not that well sir i believe we have a
                         few too many soft hearts in the
                         building did we aquire a bank from
                         chicago or a charity 

                                          john c mccay

                         you dont fuck with first bank this is
                         the real deal and we aim to keep it
                         strong my daddy always told me that
                         only the strong survive

                                          zach
                         i thought that was darwin sir or
                         perhaps nietzsche 

                                          john c mccay
                         perhaps it was i was in boarding
                         school for so many years its hard to
                         remember do you have the tape of the
                         latest exploits from my favorite hobby
                         

                                          zach

                         question 

                                          john c mccay
                         of course

                                          zach

                         as i am on the payroll but why not
                         something like a yacht club 

                                          john c mccay
                         zach how old are you son

                                          john c mccay
                         and how much do we pay you annually 

                                          zach
                         i make roughly four hundred thousand a
                         year

                                          john c mccay
                         zach my boy i can spend your yearly
                         salary in a blink i have had that kind
                         of money all of my life if i wanted
                         to i could fly to paris for the
                         afternoon
                              starts to pace
                         my father formed this company over
                         seventy years ago when my brother
                         became mentally challenged it was put
                         in my charge now running a bank of
                         this size is very stressful i need to
                         relax on what little down time i have
                         a yacht club will not quite make my
                         blood pressure decline understand 

                                          zach
                         yes sir

                                          john c mccay
                         i have entrusted you with a great many
                         things in your tenure with this
                         company you have seen and heard things
                         that could upset the very economic
                         world in which we live i think this
                         kind of loyalty should be rewarded

                                          zach
                         thank you sir

          john c mccay reaches into his desk and hands zach a pen
          set

                                          zach contd
                         thank you sir i was really hoping for
                         shares or possibly cash but this
                         this is really personal

                                          john c mccay
                         son lets watch the tape


          int john c mccays video lounge first bank  day

          john c mccay and zach sit on a couch in a soundproof
          room in the penthouse office suite the big screen tv
          replays the demise of simpson zach watches as stoically
          as he did the previous night john c
          mccay watches like a pervert watching a porno he is
          excited as the tape ends

                                          john c mccay
                         that was rather disappointing

                                          zach
                         i had suggested that they tone down the
                         program so that the guests might take
                         longer to expire

                                          john c mccay
                         i want more action i want to see more
                         ingenuity than that i want to see the
                         injured man out wit the machines 

                                          zach
                         but sir most of the people we are
                         putting into the park are accountants
                         that embezzle or investment bankers
                         they are not known for their physical
                         or intellectual prowess

                                          john c mccay
                         i dont believe ol bruce is having as
                         much fun with this as he once did he
                         still insists on the guests being of
                         the more nefarious type

                                          zach
                         thats right sir he does a thorough
                         background check and if he finds them
                         to be criminal or guilty of
                         embezzlement then he will put them in
                         the park he has refused the last three
                         suggested guests

                                          john c mccay
                         what about that time when the mail room
                         kid was accused of stealing and we put
                         him in the park  wasnt that a
                         computer glitch 

                                          zach
                         yes sir it turns out we put an
                         innocent man into the park and he was
                         not the one who stole from the stamp
                         machine that is also about the time
                         when bruce began refusing

                                          john c mccay
                         that mail room kid was the longest
                         lasting guest yet  maybe we can
                         alter the computer records and make
                         another guest from the more athletic
                         of our staff

                                          zach
                         bruce may still refuse it is my belief
                         that he is becoming more belligerent

          the ceo contemplates this for a while

                                          john c mccay
                         i propose we consider a hostile take
                         over perhaps ol bruce is in need of a
                         new job opportunity

                                          zach
                         what do you mean sir 

                                          john c mccay
                         what if we were to put bruce into the
                         park as a guest 

                                          zach
                         sir 

                                          john c mccay
                         ill bet that would be the park run of
                         the century 

                                          zach
                         sir he created the park he would know
                         how to circumvent any of the traps

                                          john c mccay
                         im willing to bet that even the
                         creator cant out wit his creation

                                          zach
                         what then sir  what would we do with
                         the park with out bruce 

                                          john c mccay
                         do you think the assistant whats his
                         name

                                          zach
                         john sir

                                          john c mccay
                         yes do you think he would like a raise
                         and a new position 

                                          zach
                         sir this is not like firing any
                         employee we cant predict what will
                         happen

                                          john c mccay
                         that my boy is the best part life on
                         top of the world is boring
                         predictable if i wanted life without
                         chances i never would have paid for
                         murderland now go make a formal
                         proposal and see about the assistant
                         find out if its viable

          zach begins to go into the elevator

          after hes gone mccay opens up a video library named
          after former employees who have entered murderland


          int 44th floor first bank  day

          zach walks out of the elevator again he sees matthew
          flirting with saundra although his face wont betray
          it zach is very jealous of this


                                          matthew
                         come on im serious look at wilma

                         big guy he has to be hung like a
                         horse and thats why wilma puts up

                                          saundra

                         reduced to a sexual exploitation quite
                         like that youre funny

          zach is right on the other side of the cubicles from
          them he can hear clearly but they dont know hes
          there

                                          matthew

                         prepared then i even wore these pants
                         because i could get on my knees to
                         grovel

                                          saundra
                         as appealing as that sounds

                                          matthew
                         dinner at my place then  say seven

                         sure

          saundra leaves

          from the next cube leans over jeff24 and a little
          unshaven and wearing a loud suit and tie jeff is
          equally free of any real responsibility

                                          jeff
                         i cant believe she said yes 

                                          matthew
                         i know normally id have to spend
                         weeks laying down the leg work to land
                         a beautiful baby like that

                                          jeff
                         you are so lucky that zach didnt get
                         there first

                                          matthew
                         you mean mr bad ties  i wasnt
                         worried about him hes one of those
                         guys who has a wardrobe but no
                         personality saundra doesnt want that
                         she wants someone who can make her
                         laugh not someone she can laugh at

          they both crack up at this and zach walks away

                         i just think that maybe i am

          bruce just sighs out loud and then turns a switch and
          the merry go round horses begin to fire right towards
          johhny they hit right at his feet he dances a little
          jig around the bullets

                                          johnny contd
                         jesus christ  stop stop stop 

          they stop and bruce is laughing hysterically

                                          johnny
                         you asshole  they could have missed 


          int nightingales bar  day

          this is a small bar in an alley in manhattan it looks
          as though no one has entered it in decades its run
          down and dusty the lights are off

          zach enters through the front door he sits at the bar

          johnny comes in from the back

                                          johnny
                         hey mr executive buy you a drink

                         have a file on them may i see bruce 

                                          johnny
                         hes been expecting you


          he points the way to the broom closet they go in and
          the back of the closet opens up into an elevator


          both of them enter


          int elevator murderland  day

          this elevator is like the service elevators at the back
          of a hotel that only the janitors see only smaller it
          can barely fit these two

          zach curiously looks at johnny

                                          johnny

                         you got a fucking problem 

                                          zach
                         no i was just curious if what i heard
                         about you is true 

                                          johnny
                         what did you hear 

                                          zach
                         only that you were one of the finest
                         hit men in the mob that if you wanted

                         some of these traps


          int hall of doors murderland  night

          the distance is closing fast

                                          matthew
                         okay now im worried what exactly is
                         on the other side of the door 

                                          bruce
                         either youll be shot with bullets
                         impaled with a large spike or nailed
                         like a super model basically youre
                         fucked any way you go

                                          matthew
                              heavy on the sarcasm
                         and thats different than this
                         because 

          as the floor gets nearer to the ceiling bruce opens the
          air vent on the ceiling he crawls in

          matthew stares in disbelief and saundra moves right
          after bruce into the tunnel

                                          matthew
                         okay maybe you know the answer to
                         this but im still the trivia champion
                         at bw3s

          matthew jumps into the vent


          int vent murderland  night

          this is like an air conditioning vent only a little
          large to accommodate human guests on their hands and
          knees or kneeling the light comes from the floor vent
          ahead

          bruce crawls through and kicks in the vent to the next
          room he jumps down

          saundra looks ahead of her and jumps down herself

          matthew a little hurt from the foosball thing pokes his
          head down into the next room then he falls through


          int human size foosball field murderland  night

          what we have here is a human sized foosball playing
          field

          there is astro turf on the ground bright soccer field
          lines and giant metal poles each one with either four
          three or two players

          the players are giant six foot tall versions of their
          three inch counter parts they are lightly padded but
          with enough force they could be lethal

          a five foot tall white inflatable ball is already in
          play on the field the ball could knock the wind out of
          you but not fatally

          bruce is waiting next to a hole that leads into the
          field saundra and matthew drop down from the vent to
          see him waiting gun in hand

                                          johnny
                              vo from pa
                         come on boss man  dont you wanna play
                           youve never beaten me on the table
                         up in the bar

          the wall beside them starts to close in forcing them
          into the playing field

          bruce waits for a moment then starts to run through
          the field saundra goes next then matthew follows

          once on the field matthew realizes what hes in

                                          matthew
                              in comedic shock
                         youve got to be kidding me 

          at that moment matthew is swiped by one of the
          cushioned human sized foosball players he gets the
          wind knocked out of him

          further ahead bruce ducks and dodges the players with

          int demon water ride murderland  night

          the three of them come into the start of the ride there
          is a log ride boat awaiting them in the small tunnel of
          water it leads to the left and there is an obvious drop
          right away

          the room has a bayou motif complete with fake wooden
          sheds and boat houses the light is green and simulates
          a louisiana mystic evening

          the sign reads keep your hands and feet in at all times
          or else the gators will bite them off  enjoy the
          demon water ride 

          matthew stops for a second to ponder the sign

                                          matthew
                         you said you built this place

                         trains or something

          a boat arrives the walls start to push in forcing
          everyone into the boat

                                          bruce
                         get in

                         yes get in

          on the monitor we see them all get on board the little
          log shaped boat


          int demon water ride murderland  night

          in starts off slow and theres the canned screams from
          rides from the 1920s

          they immediately drop at a 40 degree angle and splash
          into a little water the lighting gets dimmer as they
          go

          matthew gets most of the splashes and is drenched

                                          matthew
                              wipes the water out of his
                              eyes
                         awk  this sucks 

          the boat moves slowly to the left then jerks slightly
          to the right up ahead we see a small hill leading up

          bruce begins to tighten his grip on the bar saundra
          notices and also grabs tightly

                                          saundra
                         this isnt so bad

          just then the boat starts down a slop while missing th
          up hill ahead

                                          matthew
                              screaming
                         oh shit 

          the ride begins several sharp turns and steep drops
          saundra is terrified matthew is feeling nauseous bruce
          is smiling slightly hes proud of his work

          after a about three minutes of turns and drops and even
          sudden lifts they reach the bottom its darker here
          than the rest of the ride

          the boat stops

          int dragons cave murderland  night

          bruce is dripping and saundra is shaking for the first
          time yet matthew has been shaken since he woke up and
          is finding new levels of scared

          this tunnel is about four feet wide and simulates a real
          cave the walls are brown and gray with moss in certain
          spots there are pink and blue lights to give this a
          fairy tale look fake smoke comes from tiny spouts in
          the floor

          we here faint growls from something ominous

                                          matthew
                         whats next walt 

                                          bruce
                         a dragon

                                          matthew
                         so what happened  did you have a real
                         bad theme park experience as a kid and
                         this is your revenge 

          bruce stops at a corner

                                          bruce
                              whispers
                         be very very quiet

                                          matthew
                              whispering
                         are you hunting wabbits 

          pan around the three and the camera peeks around the
          corner to reveal a 

          giant animatronic dragon it is about thirty feet long
          green with scales all the way down its long tail it
          has wings in the back and its head is down low like it
          is sleeping smoke comes out of its nostrils as it
          groans the eyes slowly open and close and the head
          barely lifts off the ground

          the pink and blue lights shine on its green skin to
          give it a surreal look

                                          bruce
                              whispering
                         the room has sound sensors if you wake
                         it up it breathes fire

                                          matthew
                              whispering

          bruce makes his way across the room silently matthew
          tries to go next

          he stops and stares at the dragon he then keeps moving

          saundra goes last from the side of the wall a trip
          wire extends out she trips and falls

          the dragons head rises the roar is horrible from the
          mouth starts to breath fire like a flamethrower

          bruce rushes back and pulls saundra up forcefully the
          heat is immense

          they all three make it around the corner to a set of
          stairs bruce rushes them all up the stairs

                                          bruce
                              screaming over the burning
                              sounds
                         keep moving keep moving

          fire fills the last three or four steps it catches
          bruce on the foot he winces but keeps moving

          int subway station x murderland  night

          this is a perfect mock up of a current day subway
          station in new york

          matthew is looking at the sign that says mens room
          rather longingly saundra is scoping the room out
          bruce is staring forward

                                          matthew

          just as bruce yells for him matthew is shut into the
          mens room and the subway train arrives the smoke and
          air rushes in

                                          saundra

          stalls emit an odor that keeps him from crossing the
          room he hold his nose

          on the speakers a muzak version of presidents of the
          united states song lump starts to play

          they go into the long service tunnel its about 100
          feet ahead and looks like just a brick tunnel where
          workmen would walk


          int racetrack murderland  night

          matthew gets over to the wall where a barely visible
          door is with the partition he never would have been
          able to make it to this part if the floor was still
          electrifying

          matthew boldly opens the door and peeks in the door
          slams right back at him he jumps in a panic

          there is a hallway with emergency lights on

                                          matthew

          a small section of an old west town there is a saloon
          a general store a stable and at the far end to his
          right is the sheriffs station

          ceiling this area still has full power the ceiling is
          about sixty feet up and simulates high noon there is
          even a wind machine blowing dust and tumble weeds back
          and forth across the street

                                          matthew
                              to himself
                         what the hell will he think of next

          his pistol and starts to move quickly and silently to

                              clears her throat

          saundra picks up a piece of wood from the wreckage of
          the saloon

                                          zach

          saundra belts him with the wood and matthew punches him
          fiercely

          zach manages to get up and run into one of the halls


          int vietnam jungle murderland  night

          johnny is cowering next to a tree

          it is very very dark in here its not at all clear
          where we are

          suddenly the lights flicker back to life like a tape
          being slowly turned back on the sound effects of the
          room are that of a jungle and helicopters

          the lights come back full on to reveal a fake jungle
          set there is a constant loop of robert duvall from
          apocolypse now screaming i just love the smell of
          napalm in the morning 

          explosions begin to be set off randomly in every
          direction

          johnny starts to run and bruce appears before him in the
          fake creek in the center of the room

          johnny stops dead still after a moment of sizing each
          other up johnny pulls out a knife menacingly

          bruce reveals a knife from his boot then he calmly and
          slowly approaches johnny

                                          johnny
                         time to bitch slap the boss
                              attempts a stab
                         come on bitch

          bruce just steps up and slices into johnnys arm

                                          johnny
                         muther fucker 


          int cubicles of the damned murderland  night

          zach limps into what appears to be an office in
          disarray he sees the lights flickering on and off its
          hard to say that this intentional or not

          as he passes a fax machine it shoots out little white
          tubes just like the old cylinders that fax paper used
          to be wrapped on he trips and falls his glasses fly
          off of his head

          matthew comes in behind him so does saundra

                                          matthew
                         this is fitting the offices of the
                         damned this is as good as any place
                         for you to die you pond sucking piece
                         of shit

          zach backs away from the ratty looking pair

                                          announcer
                              vo from pa
                         uh oh  its the boss 

          as the voice is heard saundra pushes matthew to the
          floor

          from the big dark office behind zach comes an
          animatronic john c mccay very realistic looking ala
          hall of presidents on wheels holding a machine gun

          zach turns in time to see it as it sprays him full of
          bullet holes

                                          john c mccay
                              animatronic pre recorded
                              voice with no lips moving
                         youre fired  youre fired  youre
                         fired 

          the animatronic john c mccay recedes back into the
          office on its rollers

          saundra remains on the floor looking at matthew who
          checks his own body for holes

                                          matthew
                         are you okay  any holes  i mean aside
                         from the ones that nature gave you 

                                          saundra
                         im fine

          they both get up and look at the bloody lifeless corpse
          of zach on the floor

                                          matthew
                         another bad tie

          they both walk out of the room back to the old west


          int vietnam jungle murderland  night

          bruce has johnny in a head lock and is choking him to
          death

          bruce then takes out his knife and slams it into the
          back of johnnys neck

          that says fantasy land he barely dodges the bullets
          as he makes it into the room


          int fantasy land murderland  day

          the room is like a cartoon a cartoon living room where
          all the objects are ten times bigger than they should
          be

          the walls are about 100 feet straight up and there is
          bluewhite wall paper up also of enormous size the
          floor is like giant carpet with a blue shag and even an
          afghan on the blue 30 foot tall couch in front of the
          couch is a twenty foot tall coffee table

          mccay runs forward towards the other side of the room
          the mouse hole is the exit a giant vacuum cleaner
          begins to chase him he ducks around a leg of the table
          the vacuum continues on past him

                                          john c mccay
                         is this the best you can do bruce 


          int control room  murderland  day

          we see bruces silhouette in front of the moniter his
          hand works the controls silently we can see mccay on
          the monitors and a diagram of the room on another

                                          john c mccay
                              from the moniter
                         did you think i didnt learn anything
                         from watching all those tapes 


          int fantasy land murderland  day

          john c mccay is laughing a little and his breath is
          labored he sees the vacuum at the other side of the
          enormous room turning back around

                                          john c mccay
                         even i can out run this thing he
                         starts to walk a little away from under
                         the table

          a giant iron falls from on top of the huge table as
          mccay takes another step he gets crushed by the giant
          clothing utensil

          the vacuum circles the table legs

                                          matthew

                         coursing through my veins
                              pause
                         now that ive gotten the stitches
                         removed from my arm and the
                         chiropractor fixed my back

          he presses down on the water button and nothing happens
          he hits it and hurts his hand

                                          matthew contd

                         very sexual movie i mean listen to
                         this
                              mocks ther characters
                         luke at that speed will you be able
                         to pull out in time  or you came in
                         that thing  youre braver than i
                         thought


          an executive in a 1000 three piece suit walks up and
          smoothly gets the cup full of water he then turns to
          face saundra and has his back to matthew

                                          bruce

          matthew does not recognize or see him at all as far as
          hes concerned he thinks its another exec

          saundra doesnt notice who it is at first but does a
          double take and her jaw goes to the floor as she sees
          that it is bruce

                                          matthew
                              very nervous and not

          matthew backs away and starts to go back to his cube
          matthew trips over a trash can

          after a beat matthew straightens up and attempts to
          salvage the microbe of dignity he has another beat and
          he walks away
