my best friends wedding




ronald bass
first draft screenplay








	int  bouley restaurant new york  night

	dim lighting crowd buzz a long line of the rich the celebrated 
	the congenitally impatient  everyone in this queue holds a 
	reservation at least an hour overdue  tourists cant even make the 
	line  pan ahead to

	 the burnished dining room the tables of power the elegant 
	service  covertly many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving 
	by far the most lavish service of all  captains hover presenting 
	delicacies pouring wines murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose 
	person they screen from our view  we can see however

	 the honored guests companion  ignored bemused across the 
	table  this is digger downes 36 darkly attractive  kind eyes 
	an intellectuals mouth saville rows most unobtrusive and 
	conservative chalkstripe suit  he is gay but you wouldnt guess 
	it  loyal and wise and generous and you might  he watches with a 
	quiet twinkle as the captains now step back revealing to us

	 their most unlikely icon  julianne potter almost 28 wears 
	her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled 
	together in fifteen seconds  she is unkempt quick volatile 
	scattered and beneath it all perhaps because of it all an 
	original beauty  dark liquid eyes a cynical mouth slender 
	expressive fingers which point to

				captain
		    a variation on our squid ink 
		    risotto  trace of moselle to 
		    sweeten the stock

	she doesnt like that idea at all  shoots him a sharp look of 
	doubt that makes him smile  murmur

				captain
		    dont kill us on this one its 
		    a long shot

	places the moist lump of black rice before her  she takes a 
	surprisingly small amount rolls it over her tongue  makes dead 
	flat eye contact with digger  and nods its actually quite nice  
	the captain breathes with relief  she turns her dark eyes to him  
	the tone says theyre pals

				julianne
		    im writing it up as inventive and 
		    confident  which it is  off the 
		    record ill need an extra boat of 
		    the ink  or a salt shaker

				captain
		    ill toss a coin

	as the captain splits digger looks around at the other tables 
	which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away

				digger
		    is it ever embarrassing having 
		    your bum kissed in public

				julianne
		    if your ass isnt chapped you 
		    are not a goodwriter of note

	she glances at her two remaining waiters who shamelessly fawn 
	nearby

				julianne
		    is it sad to be an editor and bask 
		    only in reflected insincerity

				digger
		    ive adjusted and thanks for asking

	she leans forward as if sharing something conspiratorial

				julianne
		    see the pull of a book like 
		    twenty chefs is not who i 
		    put in  its who i leave out

				digger
		    which is everyone you couldnt 
		    get in

				julianne
		    plus some guys whose food i dont 
		    like

	pushes the risotte across to him  he lifts a fork

				digger
		    this fellow from newsday ever 
		    call

	she shrugs  pulls a cellular out of a large jumbled bag

				julianne
		    ill buzz my machine  inventive 
		    and confident yeh

	she dials  he tastes

				digger
		    needs salt

				julianne
		    is newsday a real interview or 
		    just some cute guy youre setting 
		    me up w

				digger
		     i dont send you men anymore  
		    you dont know what to do with them

	shes punching in her code

				julianne
		    sometimes i do  like for two months

				digger
		     weeks

	over the phone we hear her answering machine

				mans voice vo soft
		    hey  its michael

	and her face changes  warms  just to hear the guileless voice

				michael vo
		    god it must be what months huh 
		    i cant wait to talk to you  im 
		    in chicago at the ritz carlton

	she looks impressed and surprised  fancy place for this guy

				michael vo
		    call me four in the morning 
		    whatever we gotta talk

	as she hangs up  she still has that look in her eye  digger has 
	never seen that and he likes it very much

				digger
		    who called the man of the 
		    moment

	she smiles  a sweet natural smile that makes us like her too  
	the bohemian sophisticate has vanished

				julianne
		    no no the opposite  thats 
		    my best friend michael oneal  
		    he sounds desperate to talk

				digger
		    the wandering sportswriter

	he pushes the risotto back her way

				digger
		    i didnt know you two had a 
		    past

	her gaze sharpens  hmmn

				digger
		    the look in your eye

	she blushes  shakes her head no way

				julianne
		    sophomore year at yale we had 
		    this one hot month  and you 
		    know me i got restless

	he knows her  she got restless

				julianne
		    so i get up the nerve to break 
		    his heart  i tell him theres 
		    this dreamy exchange student 
		    from pakistan who wants to 
		    you know

	he knows

				julianne
		    and he gets this look  he 
		    says i knew i couldnt hold 
		    your interest which of course 
		    makes me feel like the shallow 
		    bitch ive always been

	he nods yeah

				julianne
		    then he says but what makes 
		    me want to cry  is im losing 
		    the best friend i ever had

	hears the feeling  in her voice

				julianne
		    and when he said it i knew  
		    i felt the same

	silence now  she covers with a smile

				julianne
		    so i cried  for maybe the third 
		    time in my life  and i kissed 
		    him  and weve been best friends 
		    ever since

	ever since  fingers turning her wine glass

				julianne
		    nine years weve seen each other 
		    through everything  losing jobs 
		    losing parents losing lovers  
		    travelled all over weve had the 
		    best times  the best times of my 
		    life maybe  just drinking and 
		    talking  even over a phone

				digger
		    kindred spirits

				julianne
		    no hes nothing like me  hes 
		    like you  only straight

	no offense taken

				julianne
		    hes the salt of the earth  kind 
		    and loyal and generous  the one 
		    constant thing in my life is hell 
		    always be there

				digger
		    hes still in love with you

	that stops her  she has to say

				julianne
		    maybe  but it never gets in 
		    the way

	something she probably hasnt confessed out loud before  digger 
	understands

				digger
		    well he has a true friend in 
		    you

	he wants her to know he sees that

				digger
		    whenever george tells someone 
		    how steadfast i am he always 
		    makes me sound boring

				julianne
		    solid and genuine is not boring  
		    michael can be completely insane

	a young waiter arrives  sets a boat of black squid ink beside her 
	plate

				julianne
		    there was this one night in 
		    tucson like six years ago  
		    we got amazingly drunk i mean 
		    keith richards time

	the kid tops off her glass of meursault  looking at her

				julianne
		    god i havent thought of this 
		    in so long

	the waiter hanging now  openly listening

				julianne
		    i can even believe we did 
		    this

	digger sees the guy listening gestures to her with his eyes  so 
	she looks up

				julianne
		    could you give us a minute

	the kid stunned speechless  people lose jobs for a lot less

				julianne
		    you wont miss much i promise 
		    there was no sex

	he reddens and disappears

				digger
		    ive lost interest

				julianne
		    he takes a razor from his dinky 
		    little dopp kit cuts his fingertip 
		    takes my hand does the same to me

	she places the tips of her index fingers together

				digger
		    blood oath

				julianne
		    he says swear  when were both 
		    28 if weve never been married 
		    we marry each other

	and laughs again  can you believe that  but digger isnt smiling  
	she wonders why  begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto

				julianne
		    see he figured that would be a 
		    sign from god or someone of 
		    comparable authority that wed 
		    misunderstood our destinies

	he still has this real serious look  shes still spooning ink

				julianne
		    we never talked about it again  i 
		    dont know what made me think of

				digger quietly
		    i do

	and everything  stops  she lifts her spoon mesmerized by the 
	gravity of his tone

				digger
		    youll be 28 in three weeks  
		    how old is he

	holy  fucking  shit  it hits her like a ton of lead bricks  she 
	shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth without looking

				julianne
		    you think

				digger
		    desperate  to talk

	she shovels in more drippy black goop  it is really disgusting

				julianne
		    hes not proposing marriage 
		    theres no way im buying one 
		    word of th

				digger
		    then why are you compulsively 
		    eating if youre not hysterical

	more goes in  her lips and mouth completely black  like a circus 
	clown

				julianne
		    he cant do that to me

				digger
		    were about to find out

	ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down 
	her face  she absently dabs a napkin keeping some of it from 
	reaching her sweater

				julianne
		    when i turn him down

	she realizes the full weight of the truth

				julianne
		    well never be the same

				digger
		    i have a suggestion

				julianne
		    ill have to kill myself before i 
		    call him

	staring in each others eyes

				digger sadly
		    that was it

	int juliannes bathroom  late night

	julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush  
	gray foam pours from her mouth spattering the oversized basketball 
	jersey she wears as a nightshirt  in the mirror her troubled eyes 
	dwell on michael flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on 
	the closed toilet lid

	she spits sticks her tongue way out  incredibly black  great  
	depressed terrified and disfigured for life  she snatches up the 
	hated phone and wanders aimlessly into

	 her bedroom  west village view  defiantly jumbled aggres
	sively eclectic  traces of wonderful taste mixed with ilikeit
	yougotaproblemwiththat she stumbles around rehearsing

				julianne
		    this is awkward timing michael 
		    i just joined this convent and 
		    they never give your deposit ba

				julianne
		     and i have two weeks to live

	changes tone

				julianne
		    michael im trying to be gay 
		    dont confuse me

	she turns to continue pacing and walks straight into a dresser  
	stuns her momentarily  enough already she punches up the 
	number primping absently in the mirror  when it connects

				julianne
		    i was calling michael oneal 
		    but seeing its so late i could 
		    just leave a mes

	no such luck  cut off  waits  and then

				julianne soft

		    hopes of improvement but finally

				michael vo urgent

	she swallows

				michael vo

		    that if you turn me down i dont 
		    know what ill d

				julianne bright

		    thing first okay i mean this

				julianne

				michael vo soft

				michael vo
		    i think about that night all 
		    the time

	shes going to have a heart attack

				michael vo
		    but its not why i called

	she blinks  its not  and just as a tsunami of relief begins to 
	sweep away

				michael vo
		    i called because i met someone

	and her smiles breaks off  like a spine snapping  because there is 
	something in his voice

				julianne
		    well thats great  you havent 
		    really had anybody since dingbat 
		    jennylee

				michael vo
		    you dont understand  ive never

	out at the skycaps clinging to her cigarette as he eases to the 
	curb

	looks in his eyes

				julianne
		    and at my wedding  ill be the 
		    only bride with her own best man

	and she kisses his cheek

	jumps out of his car  before she cries  yanks her bags from the 
	back  brave smile

	they trade small salutes  and then shes gone

	int  ohara airport chicago  morning

	the jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony 
	called ohare  julianne lugging multiple carryons trying to pull 
	flyaway strands of hair into place nervous as a schoolgirl 
	looking all around and

	 there he is  michael is tall and squareshouldered a boyish 
	grin an unruly shock of hair  he looks gorgeous sweet and just 
	dangerous enough to be irresistible  worthwhile stakes  his face 
	lights to see her and she

	 runs to his arms shedding bags along the way slamming off 
	heedless civilians to be

	 swept off the earth in strong arms spun around laughing like 
	crazy their cheeks tight together  when he sets her down

	 he kisses her nose  his arms are still around her

				michael murmurs
		    can you believe it can you believe 
		    im actually gonna do this

				julianne lost in his eyes
		    not hardly

	he beams  turns  she follows his gaze and

	 there she is  kimberly wallace is 20 small and slender but it 
	is a body to die for  the face is striking not at all perky and 
	vapid but lovely and interesting  worst of all intelligent

	she walks toward them purposefully her eyes locked to the woman in 
	her fiancees arms  at the last moment michael releases julianne 
	and kimmy

	 throws her arms around the startled visitor  holds her tight 
	with such genuine warmth that julianne can only slowly hug back  
	as michael beams

				kimmy
		    this just makes everything so 
		    perfect

	her arms stay around the slightly dazed julianne  the younger 
	girl leans close confides

				kimmy
		    all ive heard from the day i 
		    met michael is julianne this 
		    and julianne that

				julianne
		    well were

				kimmy
		    i think the best part of marrying 
		    this guy is finding you

	pale gray eyes  alive with joy and intimacy

				kimmy
		    ive never had a sister

	int  kimmys convertible  day

	kimmy tearing down the throughway in her mercedes 500 sl a 
	dashing confident driver  julianne riding shotgun hair flying a 
	total wreck in the open convertible  michael is happily crouched 
	on the little platform behind their seats hugging his knees  the 
	roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them

				kimmy
		    my hearts in my throat here  
		    right off i have to ask this 
		    monstrous favor

				julianne
		    you need a few dollars

	kim glances over  at eighty miles an hour  a bittersweet look

				kimmy
		    dry  just like he said

	her eyes at once admiring and regretful

				julianne
		    excuse me

				kimmy
		    i can be quick  i can even 
		    be funny

	shakes her head  an endearing youngster

				kimmy
		    but i cant be dry

				julianne
		    can you watch the road

				kimmy
		    see  dry  its in the delivery

	she looks back to the highway

				kimmy
		    this is a very presumptuous 
		    and burdensome fav

				julianne
		     you want a menage on your 
		    wedding night

				kimmy straight back
		    no that wouldnt be burdensome

	julianne studying the delicate angular profile  hard not to like 
	this kid

				kimmy
		    my classmate angelique shattered 
		    her pelvis line dancing in 
		    abeline on spring break

	looks over  the sweetest smile

				kimmy
		    be my maid of honor

	julianne just blinks

				kimmy
		    you cant believe what itd 
		    cost to bring in a temp

				julianne
		    uh  how about promoting a 
		    bridesmaid  someone you know 
		    for at least fortyfive minutes

	we cut off a huge semi who blasts his horn  kimmy fearless 
	oblivious and analytical

				kimmy
		    the bridesmaids are my only two 
		    female relatives under forty  
		    identical twin debutantes from 
		    nashville who are basically 
		    vengeful sluts  with amazing 
		    bodies

				julianne
		    which was the disqualifying 
		    factor

				kimmy
		    the twin part  i like to remain 
		    impartial in my contempt

	sees the offramp and slices across four lanes of speeding bullets 
	in a heartstopping nanosecond  this kid could drive for penske  
	julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started  looks 
	back to see if michael fell out

	 he is absurdly windblown  gives her a beautiful grinning 
	thumbsup  loves this stuff

				kimmy
		    this means i have four days 
		    to make you my new best friend

	brings juliannes eyes back

				kimmy
		    and since i already know everything 
		    about you  including intimate 
		    facts im mortified to have heard 
		    but too envious to forget  its 
		    time for you to learn about me

	easing off the freeway  she meets juliannes glance

				kimmy
		    force yourself  to get personal

				julianne smiles
		    sounds like a plan

	int  dress shop north michigan avenue  morning

	the place is stunning  highceiling soft light large rococo 
	mirrors louis quatorze sofas and chairs  michael wanders rest
	lessly fish out of water among designer displays and stylish 
	female patrons

	takes a look at his watch

	int  dressing room  morning

	a period sitting room ringed with mirrors along its tapestried 
	walls  kimmy sits on a louis treize loveseat next to a stack of 
	costly gowns  watching with an expertise beyond her years as

	 julianne stands on a platform  a seamstress fitting her into a 
	sleek pale daffodilcolored gown  there are pins everywhere as 
	the seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit  continuously 
	looking to kim for approval

				kimmy
		    if youd rather the lilac

	julianne shakes her head  this one is beautiful

				julianne
		    i thought bridesmaids had to wear 
		    the same dress

				kimmy
		    not you  you wont be comfortable 
		    unless youre distinctive

	julianne glances over

				julianne
		    what else did he tell you

				kimmy
		     you hate weddings you never go

	oh  well yeah

				kimmy
		    youre not up for anything 
		    conventional or popularly 
		    assumed to be female priorities  
		    including marriage  or romance  
		    or even

	and she stops  not wanting to offend

				julianne quietly
		     not even love

	the look holds  the seamstress keeps working as if shes deaf

				julianne
		    thats why michael and i were 
		    the wrong fit  right from the 
		    start

				kimmy
		    he said that too

	she stands up  walks to the platform  smooths her hand over the 
	fabric down juliannes back along her hips  communicating to the 
	seamstress with her irritated expression

				kimmy
		    well i thought i was like you  
		    and proud to be  until i met 
		    rumpled smelly old michael

	pins start to come out  kimmy points these too

				kimmy
		    and then i found i was just a 
		    sentimental schmuck  like all 
		    those flighty nitwits id always 
		    pitied

	she leans forward  so they can look at each other

				kimmy
		    funny world huh

	julianne swallows  it is that

				julianne
		    i need a smoke

	and before anyone can breathe she steps off the platform ripping 
	the living shit out of the gown right down the side  the seam
	stress eyes flash open in abject horror  julianne a deer in 
	headlights looks quickly around at the evidence of her screwup in 
	six different mirrors

	kimberly just steps to her fingers the tear

				kimmy
		    its mostly the seam  lets 
		    get this to carlos

	and unzips julianne down the back  in her rush to step out 
	julianne stumbles  but her arms are pinned by the pulleddown dress 
	and she just

	 topples like a felled oak thudding on her face the gown 
	ripping some more the seamstress screaming like an idiot

	then  silence  julianne looking up helplessly a trussed hog 
	bound in her dress

				kimmy firm
		     just  dont  move

	like you talk to a threeyearold  deftly kimmy pulls the 
	dress free leaving julianne in her underwear  signals to the 
	seamstress lets go

				julianne
		    dont you have to be somewh

				kimmy
		     just my bridal shower  and 
		    michael has to meet our dads and 
		    the groomsmen at comiskey for a 
		    onethirty game

	opens the door

				kimmy
		    other than that

	closed solid  gone

	int  dressing room  later

	julianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties lighting one 
	cigarette from the butt of another  suddenly she hears

	 an argument outside the door  strains to listen  it does sound 
	like michael and kim  we cant make out the words  she jumps up 
	dashes for the door stubbing her toe on the platform shit falls 
	heavily against the door with a thud that makes her wince and

	 the argument stops  damn  she opens the door a crack  sees 
	nothing  opens it wider to reveal

	 a teenaged boy looking right at her  he sends a true shit
	eating grin and she slams the door hard enough to rattle walls

	she paces furiously helplessly arms around her halfnaked self 
	until

	 soft knock  the door opens a crack and her daffodil gown 
	comes through it

				julianne
		    come in and shut the

	stops  because its michael who has entered  with the dress

				julianne
		     door

	so he does  she flushes and snatches up her own clothes which 
	were characteristically tangled in a heap and tries desperately to 
	untangle them enough to cover herself  he is amazed and amused by 
	her embarrassment

				michael laughing
		    should i turn around or someth

				julianne
		    michael im in my underwear

	shes tearing at her clothes only making more of a mess

				michael
		    weve seen each other a lot 
		    more naked than this

	she seems ready to rip her clothes apart so he gently takes them 
	from her hands  she tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily 
	untangles them

				michael
		    i mean we were skinnydipping 
		    in greece just as pals less 
		    than two years ago

	she grabs the clothes and covers the front of herself  looking at 
	him with a mix of emotions she couldnt begin to sort out

				julianne
		    things are different now

	he looks in her eyes  and nods a little sadly  guess they are

				michael softly
		    well  i leave with two thoughts 
		    in my mind

	he walks to the door  puts his hand on the latch  looks back

				michael even softer
		    youre still a very pretty 
		    girl

	the look holds  and holds  there is such feeling on both sides 
	she doesnt know what to make of it  she swallows

				julianne
		    whats the sec

				michael
		    mirrors

	and hes gone  she looks around at six different views of her 
	uncovered backside  hmm

	int  hotel underground garage  day

	the parking valets wait by their stand as the convertible pulls up 
	these girls must be late for something the way theyre jumping out 
	of the car

		    fucking hemisphere is all im s

		    only there a ye

				julianne
		    so your honeymoon is exactly where

	well

				kimmy
		    it depends  if san antonio sweeps 
		    sacramento we could start there  
		    or phoenix  or depending on indiana
		    clevel

				julianne
		     garden sports all  little swing 
		    of maybe fifty degrees fahrenheit 
		    represents a packing challenge but 
		    theres fine food and cocktails at a 
		    choice of embassy suit

				julianne

	an empty elevator arrives  they get in

				julianne
		    takes one woman in a billion to 
		    put up with his array of shit  
		    the guy is a oneman festival of 
		    idiosync

	kimmy slams the penthouse button  looks at her calmly  go on

				julianne
		    well  youve been introduced 
		    to the symphonic range of

				kimmy
		     his snoring yeah  he says 
		    its worse than ever  that 
		    snaffle one

	julianne imitates an incredibly annoying highpitched snarl  three 
	times  kimmy nods

				kimmy
		    well now it has this sorta 
		    phlegm rattle behind it

	stopped at the lobby  a family of four gets in  oblivious kimmy 
	demonstrates the phlegm rattle  really gets into it  as the 
	family watches julianne tries her own version  like that no  
	more like this  the family is looking at each other

				kimmy
		    guess what earplugs work

	oh

				julianne
		    how about

				kimmy
		     cigars in bed i broke him 
		    on that  but the bathrooms a 
		    swamp he wears reeboks to dinner

				kimmy
		     loves action movies subscribes 
		    to playboy for godsake reads over 
		    my shoulder cant keep track of 
		    the checks he writes

	ninth floor  the family gets out  the door closes

				kimmy
		    he sucks soup through his 
		    front teeth

				julianne
		    a trademark move dont touch 
		    it

				kimmy
		    but he sure can kiss

				julianne
		    its been awhile  ill take 
		    your word

				kimmy
		    after two weeks of cataloguing 
		    all his faults i made a command 
		    decision that changed my life

	she slams the emergency stop button  we jolt to a halt

				kimmy
		    i threw the list away

	shakes her head

				kimmy
		    hes not a balance sheet so 
		    many wonderful qualities so 
		    many faults  hes michael

	from her heart

				kimmy
		    and loving him means loving 
		    all of this

				julianne
		    do you get nervous in small 
		    confined spaces

				kimmy
		    so its sweet of you to be 
		    protective

				julianne
		    let me rephrase that

				kimmy
		   but nothing ever could ever 
		   did give me a moments pause 
		   about this marriage

				 julianne
		   do you get hysterical in small 
		   confined spa

				kimmy
		     except one

	juliannes face  stops

				julianne
		    oh yeah

	kimmy nods  confides

				kimmy
		    you

	a stopper

				kimmy
		    youll always be there  in his 
		    mind  the perfect creature he 
		    loved for all those y

				julianne
		    well perfection can get wearing 
		    after whi

				kimmy
		    im not joking  i had to face 
		    up to all my competitive drives 
		    and believe me ive got em

				julianne
		    no

				kimmy
		    and the answer was so simple

				julianne
		    i was gonna predict that

				kimmy
		    you win

	julianne blinks  excuse me

				kimmy
		    youre enshrined in his heart 
		    and memory  unassailable  
		    which works out great

				julianne
		    ive missed a step

				kimmy
		    he has you on a pedestal  and 
		    me in his arms

	oh  julianne smiles  lunges for the emergency button yanking it 
	so hard it comes off in her hand  a terrifying buzzer ensures

				julianne
		    jesus were trapped

				kimmy
		    ju

				julianne
		    no this happened to me once 
		    almost it was excruciating

	begins banging random buttons out of control  kimmy watching 
	this  julianne looks wildly up

				julianne
		    theres a panel up there you 
		    could boost me

	ripping off her platform shoes

				julianne
		    you know how little air is 
		    in these things ive seen 
		    statistics once youre trapped 
		    between floors

	kimmy taps her  points to the lighted panel  it says ph theyve 
	reached the penthouse

				julianne
		    god then the door is jammed

	takes a heavy platform and begins banging the metal door with all 
	her strength sending resounding booms throughout the area as 
	kimmy reaches and

	 presses door open  the metal doors part opening directly onto 
	the banquet room just as a mighty blow comes down and the platform 
	flies from juliannes hand straight between

	 two identical stunning young women serving as twin hostesses 
	for the shower  a beat of mutuallystupefied looks and we hear 
	the shoe crash somewhere to a small spattering of shrieks

				mandy
		    mah gawd its the bride 
		    and the woman shell nevah 
		    live up to

				kimmy mutters to julianne
		    that would be us

	belles with the faces of angels and bodies made for hot oil 
	wrestling  mandys hair is dyed ash blonde sammys is amber

				womans voice vo
		    is this michaels julianne

	all eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely 40  she has her

	half an empire  fonda would envy

				isabelle
		    im isabelle wallace and my 
		    handsome new son scarcely did 
		    you justice girl

	she takes both of juliannes hands and our heroine is sort of 
	magically charmed  as if touched by glinda the good witch of the 
	north

				isabelle
		    now my husband says to scoot 
		    you over to the ballpark so 
		    you can hang with michael  but 
		    first you have to meet a lot of 
		    really old women

	looking warmly in her eyes

				isabelle
		    that is if youve absorbed 
		    enough profanity

	flicks a glance at the twins  leads julianne off

	int  taxi south side  day

	cab crawling toward comiskey park through stifling traffic

				julianne
		    that desperate  may i never get

	int  luxury box comiskey park  afternoon

	game in progress  watched by michael three groomsmen his age two 
	middleaged men and one bodyguard  suddenly a dull thumping at 
	the door  it keeps up  they finally all look over  the bodyguard 
	gets the door revealing

				julianne
		    which of you gents ordered 
		    two beers

	one single tray  holding fourteen beers  balancing on one hand  
	michael jumps up terrified at the impending mayhem this sight 
	suggests

				michael
		    wow  lemme give you a ha

				julianne sweetly
		    michael  youll unwittingly 
		    imply that im clumsy

	he stops in his tracks  the guys whistle

				michael
		    think of that  and as well as 
		    i know you

	she goes first to the bodyguard

				  bodyguard
		    sorry maam im on duty

				julianne lovely smile

	heads down the row

				michael
		    julianne potter this is hank 
		    and gerry from si and you know 
		    daniel

	shes nodding flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter 
	of the tray keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center  
	michael is flat dumbstruck  next a tall patrician gentleman with 
	rolledup sleeves on his handstitched silk shirt

				michael
		    oh  this is my fatherinlaw 
		    walter

	once again she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished 
	fatherinlaw

				michael
		    how are you doing this youre 
		    on drugs

	sets them down  the man has a smile wonderful in its ease  
	murmurs

				  walter
		    if he gives you grief ill have 
		    him skillfully beaten where the 
		    wounds wont show

				julianne
		    i guess getting him whacked would 
		    be politically out of the question

				walter
		    under the circumstances  charmed 
		    to know you jules

				julianne
		    nice meeting you too walt

	a nod between equals  she moves on

				michael
		    and this guy you know

	she sure does and effortlessly balancing her onehand load she 
	dips to kiss a porky balding guy with bigtime shoulders  
	straight on the lips

				julianne
		    papa joe

	they go way back  he is uncomfortable at this rich mans wedding 
	even as gracious as everyone has been  his watering eyes twinkle 
	at her and the voice has a trace of boston

				joe
		   you gonna be my boys best man

	despite shouts from the others

				julianne
		    best everything joe  but im 
		    going to dance with you

				michael
		    dance  you dont dance  you 
		    learn to dance

	her innocent smile

				julianne
		    moves  youve never seen

	big reaction from the guys as she heads toward michael with the 
	last of the beers not looking down at the fielders mitt which 
	lies right in her path and as his lips part to scream a warning 
	she skips

	 neatly around it  hes in shock

				michael
		    youre an impostor what have 
		    you done with my best friend

	as he takes away the remaining beers

				michael
		    and how was the hot dog

	hot dog his eyes fix on her left breast  huge mustard stain  
	she cant believe it

				michael
		    cheap and unnecessary  we were 
		    looking anyway

	ext  luxury box roof  day

	michael and julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury 
	box roof  the game the stadium spread out beneath them  yet 
	they are alone in the world  she dangles her legs and we can hear 
	her kicking the glass below

				julianne
		    i just admire your maturity 
		    thats all  i mean there are 
		    people who would find that kind of 
		    perfection boring  day after day 
		    year after year

				michael
		     see thats what i thought at 
		    first  how can you like someone 
		    that perfect no potential for 
		    longrange livability

	drinking their beers  side by side  both stare only at the game

				michael
		    luckily  the closer i watched 
		    the more the fault came into 
		    focus  each imperfection its own 
		    adorable slice of vulnerability

				julianne
		    such as

				michael
		    shes too genuine

				julianne
		    hate that

				michael
		    how can you trust someone you 
		    can never mistrust

				julianne
		    whats next

	keep sipping  never look at each other

				michael
		    no matter how many times i 
		    leave the toilet seat up she 
		    forgets and puts it down

				julianne
		    endearingly absentminded

				michael
		    my very point  heres another one

	shakes his head  this one really gets him

				michael
		    every day  she makes the bed

				julianne
		    quite the little eccentric

				michael
		    at first i thought it was a 
		    gag but shes always done it

	this is not the ammunition julianne was hoping for

				julianne
		    is there a coup de grace in 
		    here somewh

				michael
		    she admires  tommy lasorda

				julianne
		    waiter check please

				michael
		    she finds him personable

				julianne
		    can that kind of defect be 
		    passed on genetically

	she looks over now  and michael is looking back  smiling the most 
	wonderful smile  her reaction shows that she thinks its for her 
	until

				michael
		    then again  she has a few good 
		    traits

	hating herself for asking but seeing no way out

				julianne
		    gimme like eight and nine off 
		    the top ten list

				michael
		    first girl i ever knew  who 
		    lets me give her a bath

	the look in his eyes  she can hardly bear it

				michael
		    and when i hug her even in 
		    public  i dont have to let go 
		    right away  she lets me hold 
		    her as long as i want

	he seems so deeply in love

				michael
		    nice kid dont you think

	a beat  a slow nod  a quiet

				julianne
		    looks like from here

	int  south side club  night

	a slender black woman sings a soaring gospel number backed by 
	three ladies who could each solo in any church choir  it is 
	mesmerizing stirring transcendent  the unseen audience clapping 
	fiercely in rhythm shouting support  slow pan now

	 every face is black  we arent in church at all but a 
	venerable blue club  one of those places youd swear everybodys 
	played from robert johnson to bessie smith and back again  as 
	the song ends there is applause some rapping on tables with their 
	knuckles or their drunks  we keep panning to a far corner  three 
	faces

	julianne leans across her beer to kimmy

				julianne
		    howd you find this pl

	kim shaking her head  looks admiringly to michael

				kimmy
		    lived here my whole life 
		    never heard of it  until 
		    our first date

	she reaches slender fingers  traces one back along his hair

				kimmy
		    he finds all these spots 
		    everywhere he goes its a 
		    mystical gift

				michael shy

	slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle  starts giving a little

	bristles

				julianne
		    in case simple lying doesnt work

	at the last second  she stops  we dont know why because shes

	the phone into the green swamp which spatters all over her front

	none of this is lost on kimmy  shes wondered the same

				kimmy
		    but he always says

				julianne
		     whatever is manly and 
		    independent

	kim nods slowly  way ahead of her

				julianne
		    why would he trade that for 
		    running say a big piece of 
		    the pr at a powerful complex 
		    challenging conglomerate like 
		    your dads

	kim stares back  a strange look

				kimmy
		    thats just the sort of thing 
		    my father and i discussed

	julianne just blinks  amazed

				julianne
		    im not stupid  say how 
		    about this

				julianne
		    by any yardstick that involves 
		    sanity it would be the greatest 
		    thing that ever happened to him  
		    present company excepted

	kimmy nodding slowly  her yearing achingly apparent

				julianne
		    on the other hand hes proud  
		    last thing a man wants to admit 
		    is being trapped in a dispiriting 
		    deadend job that can never 
		    support a family

	a very sweet smile

				julianne
		    throw a man a life preserver  
		    hell say thanks anyway

				julianne kind but wise
		     lying  all the time

	that brings the gray eyes up  julianne bats her dark ones

				julianne
		    oh darling my pitiful desires 
		    and ambitions are dirt beneath

				julianne pouring it on

	mr  mooney is the most gracious brit salesperson ever to offer 
	kindness intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer  he is 
	large sixty with disappearing hair watering eyes and a manner 
	that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler

				julianne
		    bridesmaid gifts for two well 
		    assertive outspoken tennessee 
		    debutantes

				kimmy still focused
		    he wont be mad

				julianne to mooney
		    nothing here seems to quite capture 
		    their distinctive personalities

				  mr  mooney
		    something customized perhaps 
		    we can fashion most any item 
		    from gold

	ah  julianne nodding  reflecting

				mr  mooney
		    an object that might represent 
		    what is closest to their heart

				kimmy under her breath
		    dont even think dildo

	julianne digs through her jumbled bag

				julianne
		    could you do this

	tossing an object on the counter

				julianne
		    in 24 carat

	it is a mastercard  a gold one

				kimmy softly
		    bingo

				kimmy

	a beat  can julianne even make herself do this

				julianne
		    your call  you can live a lie  
		    in a fabulous selection of red 
		    roof inns  or you can make one 
		    desperate stab at hap

				kimmy
		    i just dont want to freak him 
		    out

	what do you think julianne stares into the soft gray eyes  its 
	now or never  the smile of a dear sister

				julianne
		    how mad could he get

	int  fashion restaurant  lunch hour

	julianne enters with a really nervous kimberly in tow  approaches 
	the maitre d  we close to hear

				maitre d
		    oh mr wallace and his guests 
		    have retired to the humidor

	points to an escalator leading to the mezzanine  behind a glass 
	wall what looks like a british mens club  thirty guys and a 
	billion cigars  as julianne starts toward it

				maitre d
		    oh  mademoiselle

	she turns back  loves this shit

				maitre d
		    its unofficial of course  but 
		    traditionally the humidor is for 
		    gentlemen only

				julianne
		    great  ive got this girlfriend 
		    at the justice department  with 
		    all this time on her hands

	her look is every bit as hard as his  he gestures to the 
	escalator  she takes kimmys hand and up they go  we can see 
	walter in a big leather chair enjoying a major stogie  kimmy 
	licks her lips

	they enter  every head turns  a nice range of reactions from 
	offended to attracted and points in between

				julianne murmurs
		    piece of cake  ill hang and 
		    think happy thoughts

	kimmy nods  heads over toward her father  julianne walks 
	confidently even provocatively to the wall lined with bins of 
	cigars  every eye in the place is on her butt

	she runs her fingers over a few contenders  plucks one out 
	examines it puts it back  walks a little farther  selects 
	another big and black  rolls it expertly in her fingers  sniffs 
	along its length

	a guy comes over  could be 40 successful a brokers pinstripe  
	nearly as attractive as he thinks he is

				guy
		    know what youre looking for 
		    little lady

	little lady huh she glances at his coven of buddies who pretend 
	not to notice  then straight to the guys blue eyes

				julianne
		    yeah  do you

				guy
		    i asked first

	ah  wit  she holds up her cigar

				julianne
		    i like em long and hard  kind 
		    of big around

	runs it under her nose

				julianne
		    smell is important im a believer 
		    in that

	takes a match from a cut crystal bowl

				julianne
		    but you never know what youve 
		    got  till you run your tongue 
		    over it

	and she does  moistening the full length of the cigar  the boys 
	are laughing openly  she strikes the match  as she lights up

				guy
		    i meant  what youre looking for 
		    in a man

	she glances at his wedding ring  then straight into his eyes

				julianne
		    actually im partial to married 
		    gentlemen

	the way she says that  the guy swallows  we can see some of the 
	air has been sucked from the room

				guy
		    why is that

				julianne
		    its so much time  when i phone 
		    the wives

	explosive laughter from the peanut gallery  as she jams the big 
	clemente churchill into her mouth she sees kimmy waving her over 
	from across the room  without even looking at the guy shes just 
	put away

	 she crosses the room walter stands politely looking very 
	dapper very powerful and focusing on her with considerable 
	interest  he waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather 
	hassock

				walter
			    simply
		    your idea

	she cant read this guy  maybe thats how he built an empire  she 
	nods yeah

				walter
		    youre a woman of insight

	he sits on the arm of his chair  close enough to speak quietly

				walter
		    my wife and i love this marriage 
		    and deplore its circumstances

	he puffs his cigar  julianne puffs her  kimmy looks on a kid 
	watching the grownups

				walter
		    as you guessed my daughter is 
		    unhappy about giving up her life  
		    and in my opinion cowardly in 
		    avoiding the necessary confrontation

	then he stops  as if reading juliannes eyes

				walter
		    mike has a world of ability  
		    id do anything to have him in 
		    my company

	one more puff

				walter
		    except ask him

	julianne is a little stunned  kimmy looks helpless

				walter
		    hed resent it  and me  and 
		    most important kim

	no smile on his lips  straight talk

				walter
		    hes a great kid but hes still 
		    a kid  instead of recognizing 
		    that his resistance comes from 
		    insecurity hed turn it to anger  
		    to protect himself

	spreads his hands

				walter
		     from realizing that hes 
		    ignoring my daughters needs 
		    despite how very much he loves her

	he looks to his daughter now

				walter
		    they both have some growing up 
		    to do  but theyre good people 
		    theyre starting with love  
		    theyve got time

				julianne
			    softly
		    i think youre making a mistake 
		    sir

	his eyes come back to her  a little sharply

				walter
		    and that interests me  how 
		    someone who knows him so well 
		    could be so wrong

	a formidable guy  she meets his gaze

				julianne
		    see i love him too as much 
		    as anyone here  and for a 
		    whole lot longer

	from her heart

				julianne
		    i think i know best what would 
		    make him happy

	int  toilet stall  day

	julianne fully dressed sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat  
	the stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut  
	her cellular phone pressed to her ear she is listening angrily 
	smoking ferociously every call in her body running at redline

				julianne
		    okay okay okay okay i hear 
		    you all right

	she closes her eyes

				julianne
		    it is stupid dishonest desperate 
		    beyond belief and cant possibly 
		    ever work  it can only end in 
		    humiliation and disgrace  now can 
		    i say two words

	deep drag on the cigarette  for strength

				julianne
		    do it do it do it do it 
		    do it do it

	shes striped her gears  coughs horribly

				julianne
		    all right twelve words

	int  public restroom  day

	julianne exits the stall  to face three black teenage girls  just 
	staring at her

				teenager
			    supportive
		    you do it girl

	julianne nods to the kids  they nod back  damn straight  she 
	exits the restroom into

	 glaring sunlight  we are in the middle of the brookfield zoo  
	and sitting on a bench eating popcorn from a bag

				michael
		    wow  what was going on in 
		    there

	she shudders

				julianne
		    some crazy person

	ext  zoo  day

	michael and julianne walking together  hes eating his popcorn  
	she carries a cardboard container with nachos a gooey fudge waffle 
	cone and a large drink

				michael
		    youre not eating

				julianne
		    i never eat when im serene

				michael
		    you never eat when youre 
		    despondent

				julianne
		    i switched that around when you 
		    werent looking

	she swirls a single nacho chip in cheese  but her heart isnt in it

				michael
		    last zoo we were in was 
		    beijing yeah  sure  the rhinos 
		    were fucking

				julianne
		    boy those were the days

	and when she looks over  his eyes are waiting

				michael
			    softly
		    yeah they were

	theyre passing the hippo pen  but they dont notice

				julianne
		    that was nice  the way you 
		    said that

	so was that  hes feeling restless something  doesnt know quite 
	what to say

				michael
		    its weird being the groom  all 
		    these things kimmy has to take 
		    care of

				julianne
		    you need a babysitter  thats 
		    what im here for

	he holds her eyes  then looks down  awkward  and the way hes 
	doing it begins to excite her

				julianne
		    say it

	he looks up neither one of them noticing that as they walk she is 
	about to

	 crash into a chesthigh metal stand that displays animal facts  
	we have followed him as she is wiped from frame  his face from 
	shock to amusement

				michael
		    now theres my girl

	 to tenderness  pan back to see her wearing everything from her 
	cardboard container  nachos fudge sauce diet coke the works  
	it is really awful  kids bystanders laughing cruelly  her eyes 
	fill with tears and she tries bravely to smile against it

				julianne
		    see i can only do it with 
		    beer

	he takes out his handkerchief  and with that and his hands gently 
	scoops the worst of the mess off her  the fact that hes touching 
	her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice  
	she laughs softly and a few tears fall even though she doesnt 
	know why  such an odd raw confusing moment  to the world 
	looking on they are lovers

				michael
			    murmurs
		    see better already

	and he kisses her face  not quite her lips  but only an inch away  
	we can feel her heart pounding  he strips off his shirt only a tank 
	top underneath

				michael
		    well go back to the bathroom 
		    youll put this on

	okay she sniffles okay  swallows

				julianne
		    bet youre glad im here to 
		    take care of you

	he puts his arm around her

				michael
		    bet i am

	holds her close as they start toward the restroom

				michael
		    hope that crazy persons not 
		    still there

	were on their backs

				julianne os
		    she doesnt scare me

	ext  beach club lake michigan  sunset

	julianne in tshirt and shorts rushes onto the deck of a sprawling 
	beach club  clutching her bag she quickly surveys the scene

	 the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party  
	young folks old folks little kids maybe 200 people  we scan 
	with her to find a crowd around

	 a threeonthree volleyball game  kimmy and two groomsmen on 
	one side facing michael and the tennessee debs  the twins wear 
	spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic as well as 
	predictably uninhabited  as the next point begins kimmy serves

	 sammy in back makes a nice dig lobbing to mandy who sets for 
	michaels vicious spike straight through his best mans hapless 
	defense  the crowd cheers michael and as he turns mandy gives 
	him a savage

	 chest bump of congratulation that any nfl linebacker would be 
	proud of  it puts the surprised michael straight on his butt  
	laughter applause  the twins pull him up and sammy gives him a 
	hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react  kim plays good 
	sport  julianne watches michaels body for a beat then

	 dashes off  down the beach several barbecue grills have been 
	set up  manned by beach club staff and family alike  michaels 
	pop joe is dispensing beers from a keg  kims mom isabelle is 
	coordinating the beans potato salad and cornonthecob table  
	julianne races across the sand to

	 a huge smoky grill where walter is basting baby back ribs 
	clearly enjoying himself  julianne runs up to him says something 
	into his ear  he looks at her  then turns his station over to a 
	club steward and follows julianne down toward the lakeside

	close now  as they stroll together shes a little breathless  
	hes watching her profile curious silent  at the waters edge

				julianne
			    whispers
		    is anybody watching

				walter
		    i hope so  this is all too 
		    mysterious to waste on just me

	she reaches into her big bag  pulls out a single folded sheet of 
	paper

				julianne
		    i picked up michaels messages 
		    for him at our hotel  i stole 
		    one

	his face darkens  the easy smile fades  he holds up his palms

				walter
		    julianne reading my soninlaws 
		    mail is not something

				julianne
		    sir this is important havent 
		    you ever in your life cut one 
		    corner to make something important 
		    turn out right

	his smile returns  just a little

				 walter
		    matter of fact thats how i got 
		    married

	the look holds  she thrusts the paper out  he still doesnt take 
	it

				julianne
		    its a fax from sports illustrated 
		    from ben isaacson michaels boss

				walter
			    quickly
		    i know ben

	she opens the paper

				julianne
		    mike  we still have no answer to 
		    our email of wednesday  which 
		    option do you select i dont mean 
		    to rush you but personnel needs to 
		    tie up the loose ends

	he takes the paper  we see it now  looks authentic

				julianne
		    i think hes been fired

				walter
		    it doesnt say th

				julianne
		    hes said some things over the 
		    past few weeks  look this is why 
		    i came up with the idea of you 
		    offering him a job

	he looks up  hes listening  closely

				julianne
		    and why i couldnt say anything 
		    before in front of kim

	she bites her lip  seems so earnest

				julianne
		    i just think of how desperate 
		    he must be feeling  hes marrying 
		    a rich mans daughter and hes 
		    about to become destitute  you 
		    know the kind of job market hell 
		    be facing

	he does

				walter
		    and you think hes kept this to 
		    himself

				julianne
		    hes too proud to beg for help  
		    and if you wait till this comes out 
		    your offer will be like charity  
		    completely humiliating

	hes staring at her  but his mind is working behind his eyes

				julianne
		    if you do it now its like hes 
		    helping you  he can accept with 
		    dignity

	he taps the paper with the back of his knuckles

				walter
		    this fax could mean any number 
		    of things

	she nods  she knows that

				walter
			    softly
		    maybe  i should call ben

				julianne
		    then it could all come out sooner 
		    or later  nobody should be in on 
		    this  just you and me  or more 
		    correctly i

	she takes the paper back

				julianne
		    what if what if i could find 
		    that email

	and she reaches across the desk with her lovely slender hands  
	does it for him  her fingers brush his chest on the way back  we 
	can assume a woody

				julianne
		    you know my friend the one 
		    whose message i picked up

	helping another guest across the way

				julianne
		    well hes still with the wedding 
		    party  and he asked me to get 
		    something he needs real badly from 
		    his room

	looks down the long hallway sees a maids cart  heads the other 
	way briskly to

	 a small alcove  opens the gym bag pulling out a bath towel  
	begins to yank her top up over her head

	angle the young maid now pushing her cart down the hall wheels 
	squeaking and from nowhere

	 julianne darts into her path barely covered by the towel held 
	tight across her she is grinning blushing

				julianne
		    help me

	the maid can only blink

				julianne
		    i locked myself out 1526 please 
		    hurry

	and looks frantically up the hall mortified that any moment a 
	stranger could happen upon her predicament  her eyes dart back to 
	the maid  please  the maid just stares  stares

	oh

	int  michaels room  twilight

	julianne alone in his room looking around frantically  no worries 
	about this guy making his bed every day stuff clothes strewn 
	everywhere the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated  
	shes tramping through a bachelors debris wearing only her towel 
	looking looking

	there it is  the corner of his laptop sticking out from beneath a 
	discarded bedspread  she snatches it up opens it sets it on the 
	cluttered desk and

	 stops  there are walletsized snapshots of kimmy  some alone  
	some as a little girl  some with michael  and next to them

	 the plastic foldout wallet inset  that he has not yet quite 
	rearranged  so she picks it up  leafs through until she finds 
	what she was praying would be there

	 julianne grinning  michaels arm around her  on the deck of a 
	boat  they have drinks in their hands  happiness in their eyes

	and she stares at it  jesus god how long has he carried this 
	around  she flips through further all the rest have her in them  
	maybe half a dozen  her heart is throbbing  her eyes are damp

	back to the one on the boat  she slips it from the plastic window  
	holds it  then gently

	 puts it back where it belongs  punches up the goddamn laptop  
	this is it girl  do or die

	 a small clubby room  books leather polished woods  only 
	two people here  walter looking on stonyfaced as a determined 
	julianne grimly struggles to find what shes looking for in 
	michaels laptop  and then

	 she stops typing  looks at the text on the screen  her eyes 
	sharpen as she reads what walter cant see  its an oscar 
	performance for our desperate girl  she turns the screen around

				walter

	seethrough  her hair is bound up with silver pins  as she moves 
	through the room toward us we can see that for once her makeup

	 michael is beaming admiringly  he stands up

				michael
			    softly

				julianne

	int juliannes room  early morning

	rear view of julianne asleep on the floor sunlight streaming in  
	a soft knocking on a door somewhere nearby  she barely stirs  
	the knock becomes a strong rapping and she fights for conscious
	ness  her back still to us she

	 rises stumbles to the door which is now pulsing with an 
	insistent pounding and throws it open as we snap to

	reverse angle close on juliannes face still encased in a now
	decomposing purple mask her eyes springing wide she screams in 
	shock and we snap back to

	original angle digger watching impassively at the highstrung 
	shriek  in the silence that follows

				digger
		    you stole my line

	he touches his face and she realizes

				julianne
		    oh shit

	starts clawing at the overripe mask but he grabs her wrists

				digger
		    chill  we dont want your face 
		    coming off with it

				julianne
		    chill  since when do you say 
		    ch

				digger
		    when im talking to children

		    we have this thing with georges 
		    family in the hamptons

	int  bathroom  morning

	julianne seated at the sink staring into the mirror as digger 
	gently applies soup cloth and water to easing away the mask  a 
	paleontologist restoring a bronze age artifact  by the side of the 
	halffilled sink rests her pluggedin curling iron

				julianne
		    what i mean when i say annoyingly 
		    perfect is that there is nothing 
		    annoying about her perfection  
		    it is vulnerable and endearing  
		    and that is annoying as shit

				digger
		    you like her

				julianne
		    if i didnt have to hate her id 
		    adore her

	she looks up at him and winces as the movement makes him scrape 
	her face  hes sorry

				julianne
		    last night she was crying these 
		    big real tears when she thought 
		    shed lost him  it was like there 
		    was a knife in her heart

	looking in his eyes  needs him to hear

				julianne
		     and i put it there  i hated 
		    myself i grieved for her i 
		    couldnt enjoy one second of it 
		    and then when it didnt work

	can you believe this

				julianne
		    i was devastated

				digger
			    softly
		    go figure you

				 julianne
		    because i realized  when i see 
		    him say i do that knife will 
		    be in my heart  and it will be 
		    there every

	she holds his wrists now  to stop him  to plead for 
	understanding  forgiveness

				julianne
		     every time i think of him 
		    forever which could be a lot

	she almost choked on that last part  so she composes herself

				julianne
		    you watch a guy caress his 
		    girlfriends butt  you see an 
		    old spice commercial  sentimental 
		    moments are everywhere when 
		    youre in the right frame of mind

	she swallows hard  fights for a grip on her determination

				julianne
		    there are 18250 nights in the 
		    next 50 years

				digger
		    youve been working on this huh

				julianne
		     and having done the right 
		    thing will only really be 
		    comforting oh maybe five 
		    six times

	she sets her jaw

				julianne
		    this is my whole lifes happiness  
		    i have to be ruthless

				digger
			    quietly
		    and you believe that

				julianne
		 	    unconvincing
		    sure

	his eyes are gentle and merciless at once  no way she gets off 
	this hook

				julianne
		    he was in love with me every day 
		    for nine years  i can make him 
		    happier than she can

				digger
		    its not his happiness youre 
		    feeling guilty about

				julianne
			    proudly
		    i dont know the meaning of the 
		    word guilt

				digger
		    impressive

				julianne
		    i am breaking her heart in the short 
		    run but doing her a gigantic favor 
		    she would be miserable tagging 
		    along after this insensitive doofus

				digger
		    the man you love

				julianne
		    beyond reason  the feminist 
		    warrior will rise up in this kid 
		    and shell be standing over his 
		    sleeping form with a butcher 
		    knife selecting from a short 
		    list of body parts

				digger
		    someday shell thank you

				julianne
		    lets not get carried away

	and the defenses drain from her clayravaged features  the real 
	julianne is glimpsed

				julianne
		    id settle for  someday ill 
		    forgive myself

	for

				julianne
		    for doing this terrible thing

	her eyes tear up

				julianne
		    which by the way i cant 
		    figure out how to do

	as the tears fall he wipes at them discovering

				digger

	knocking the appliance into the halffilled sink  she lunges for 
	it and a terrified digger grasps her arm

		    that plug are you a licensed 
		    contractor

	michaels is a tall flamboyant male in a dayglo vest

	each man has one hand soaking the other being worked on by a 
	manicurist so julianne goes from one to the other removing their 
	cigars so they can exhale  a seraglio feel to the way she does 
	this

	now shes arguing with michaels storklike stylist  we cant hear 
	over the music but she keeps tugging on michaels hair pretty 
	passionate about her point of view  suddenly she grabs the

		    say it this way but

	he stops  her eyes widen in a burlesque of anticipation  so he 
	smiles  she knows how to put him at ease

				michael
		    youve sort of been yknow 
		    the woman in my life

				julianne
			    straight back
		    youve been the man in mine

	passing under the michigan avenue bridge  no one knows quite what 
	to say

				michael
		    and i was thinking this could be 
		    our last time  alone  together  
		    you know

				julianne
		    except for the hot affairs well 
		    have twice a year

				michael
		    except for that

	shes smiling so easily  who would guess her stomach is double
	knotted

				michael
		    i can hardly wait for your 
		    wedding

				julianne
		    me either

	she watches his surprise

				michael
		    boy i never thought id hear you 
		    say that  can i come

	she holds herself together  real soft with

				julianne
		    i couldnt have it without you

	hes glad to hear that  and then

				michael
		    its normal to have second 
		    thoughts huh to be scared

	is this a change of direction or is it the direction shes been 
	praying for

				julianne
		    i wouldnt know  i never had 
		    that many first thoughts

				michael
		    i mean you commit to a wedding  
		    and then it seems like this 
		    momentum you know  you forget 
		    you chose it

	she nods  understands

				michael
		    you and i  i mean in all our 
		    relationships with other people 
		    we didnt use the word love 
		    a lot did we

	we didnt

				michael
		    kimmy says  when you love someone  
		    you say it you say it out loud  
		    right now  or the moment

	long beat

				michael
		     passes you by yeah  shes a 
		    smart girl

	off in distance the centennial fountain shoots an eightfoot jet 
	of water across the river  for michael and julianne it goes 
	unnoticed

				michael
		    we dont have a song

	hmm

				michael
		    kimmy and i  we dont have a song  
		    is that a bad sign

	all julianne can do is shrug  then

				michael
			    sings softly
		    someday when im awfully low
		      and the world is cold

	she doesnt want to cry  so she puts all the strength she has into 
	fighting it back

				michael
			    sings
		    i will feel a glow just thinking of you
		      and the way you look  tonight

	he stops  smiles that sweet boyish smile

				michael
		    dance card filled

				julianne
		    ill check  i have it on 
		    powerbook these days

	he holds up his arms  and she moves into them  he begins to dance 
	with her turning so slowly  and yes people are watching

				michael
		    	    sings in her ear
		    with each word your tenderness grows
		      tearing my fears apart

	she holds him closer  bites her lip

				michael
			    sings
		    and that laugh
		      that wrinkles your nose
		    touches my foolish heart

	he stops  he looks at her  shes still in his arms

				michael
		    where did we first hear th

				julianne
		  	    straight back
		    the night we met

	right to his eyes

				julianne
		    the night we fell in love

	he doesnt know what to do with that

				michael
		    so we heard it like right 
		    that that first

				julianne
		    we danced to it  just like this

	just like this  a long beat  and he has to say

				michael
		    i wont lose you will i

	her eyes close  then open  utterly lost in his

				julianne
		    no  because i wont let you

	int  wallace enterprises  day

	julianne in crisp chalkstripe trousers and a buttonedup dress 
	shirt  her coat slung over her shoulder she wanders through 
	the saturdaydeserted office space  desks cubicles monitors 
	silent  a row of executive offices standing empty waiting for 
	the custodian  turning a corner we hear

	 life at the end of the hallway  a grand conference room with a 
	glass wall  walter in shirtsleeves running a strategy meeting 
	for five  deidre his personal secretary clicking every word into 
	her laptop at warp speed  walter sees julianne through the glass  
	a comic take of pleased surprise  he comes out to greet her

				walter
		    i thought michael was picking 
		    me up

				julianne
		    i told him get the important 
		    stuff kims ring  ill collect 
		    the inconsequentials

	meaning you  they smile at each other  then

				walter
		    kim said when he turned down 
		    the job there was no friction

	julianne thinks back

				julianne
		    friction  no

	he smiles at her line reading  but his mind is always probing

				walter

		    have i

				julianne
		    nobody has  so far

	int  walters office  day

	julianne enters the spacious corner office high above the city  
	closes the door quietly behind her  so anxious she is 
	practically hyperventilating  she goes slowly to the vacant 
	cherrywood desk  its computer and monitor standing silent  she 
	is stalking it like a deadly animal  and then  she is there

	talking to herself her own desperate support network

				julianne
			    softly
		    you can do this

	sacred filled with doubt and conflict  her hands clutch at each 
	other  then one flicks out  and the computer goes on  the 
	screen glows  waits for her  her mouth is sand her stomach 
	water  she pulls the paper from her pocket

	 looks at it  looks to the monitor  and begins  to type

				julianne
			    mumbling to herself
		    email address  to ben isaacson

	she glances to her huge bag  rummages through pulling out a manila 
	folder  lays it by the blank computer  fans out a few pages in a 
	natural disorderly way  takes a step back

	and stares  struck to her gut  but when she has done

	int  conference room  day

	walter alone with deidre now signing a stack of documents as she 
	efficiently places one after another before him  when he glances up 
	he sees julianne wandering the halls  stands tells his secretary

	tailored to fit her body set off by a bold silk tie  solid 
	dynamite  she hangs back while walter proceeds down the vaulted

	hanging on his arm pressing her body against him as they walk 
	murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear  hes a really good 
	sport and really uncomfortable  sammy is walking backwards 
	right in front of them drops her bag and bends to retrieve it as 
	if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display

	julianne is so lost in her own anxiety she doesnt even notice 
	until

	int  crab house  night

	close on a bowl filled with squares of butter  hear the butt of 
	conversation from a rowdy friendly joint  juliannes right hand 
	reaches to the bowl fingers trace the rim innocently then

	 slide the bowl into juliannes lap beneath the table  her right 
	hand massages all the butter into a gooey revolving mess  we can 
	pick out familiar voices now family in distance the twins closer  
	as hidden from view julianne brings

	 her left hand from her pocket  yep  the ring is still there  
	the finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it 
	off  and as applause surrounds us julianne

	plunges her ring finger into the morass of grease frantically 
	tearing at the ring butter splurging on her pants everywhere as 
	we pull back to see

	 the long table covered with butcher paper the family at the far 
	end the twins down here with us a mug of beer for each place as 
	team of waiters with heaping platters of crabs which they

	 fling across the butcher paper as applause continues from 
	everyone but julianne who still struggles secretly  as the waiters 
	set huge wooden mallets in front of each guest joe oneal rises 
	pounds the table with his mallet for attention

				joe
		    like to welcome everbody to 
		    our little rehearsal supper

	he coughs unaccustomed to public speaking  walter and isabelle 
	clap and call out support  so joe lifts his mallet

				joe
		    okay everyone stand up

	and everyone does  with one exception  trapped  she jams her 
	left hand in her coat pocket smears her right palm sort of clean 
	on the underside of the table grabs her mallet and jumps up

				joe
		    to the bride uh goes the 
		    honor of cracking the first 
		    crab

	everyone applauses by banging their mallets  joe raises his high  
	everybody imitates

				kimmy
		    but first a toast

	and everybody snatches up their beers with their left hands as 
	julianne drops her mallet with a horrific crash grabbing her beer 
	looking up to

				julianne
			    on the spot
		    im righthanded

	a hugely embarrassing halfsecond  bailed out by

				kimmy
		    to our host my cuddly papa 
		    joe

	all turns

				kimmy
		    who taught me to play blue 
		    hawaii on my nose

	with a look at julianne kim sets down her mallet gently and 
	performs a nasal hum of the tropical standard strikingly her nostril 
	repeatedly for vibrato  it is charming and everybody watches

	int  hotel ballroom  later

	close on an actual living if geriatric lion  he blinks from his 
	cage bored as hell  hear the surrounding noise chatter loud 
	sinatra music of a very large party  pull back to see

	 and overdecorated ballroom in dim and dramatic lighting 
	dripping with the trappings of ancient rome  the mingling guests 
	are the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party most of 
	them older women  they are served by wandering wellbuilt athletes 
	in roman togas or gladiator costumes  pan to

	  julianne still in her suit hiding by a table piled with a 
	carload of grapes  her left hand still buried in her pocket  the 
	eyes of a hunted animal  from nowhere

				mandysammy os
		    boo

	she jumps a foot both hands flying up left one awkwardly slamming 
	back into its pocket  the girls have snuck up behind her  they 
	have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons 
	wrapped around their bodies

				mandy
		    i know why youre scared of our 
		    party  its too hip

	sinatra singing stranger in the night hugelymuscled halfnaked 
	black and white studs serving enchanted bluehaired ladies

				sammy
		    kimberly wanted to tickle the 
		    grandmas so we figured give 
		    em a cheap thrill  walter 
		    supplied the decorative 
		    touches

				sammy
			    points out the jokes
		    nose tackle from the bears 
		    power forward from the bulls 
		    defenseman from the black

				sammy
		    this is usda prime largely 
		    available beef  with no notice
		    able competition present company 
		    excepted

	now they stare at her  with identical really odd smiles

				sammy
		    and yet here you are  all 
		    celibate and reclusive

				mandy
		    with those big dark haunted eyes  
		    as if you were harborin some 
		    unspeakably guilty secret

	oh

				julianne
		    well im worried about something

	something  their expressions are deliciously identically 
	expectant

				julianne
		    oh  i left this really important

				julianne
		     figures  on territorial sales

	julianne blinks  ring

				mandy
		    the one you better get the fuck 
		    off your third finger left hand

	ah  that ring

				julianne
		    well  see  that was a 
		    reflex to see if it would

				mandy
			    helpful
		     look good on kimberly

				julianne
		    right  and then it didnt want 
		    to come off  exactly

				sammy
		    maybe its happy there

				mandy
		    oh the way out of the crab house 
		    we asked michael if we could see 
		    the ring

				sammy
		    he said you told him  itd be 
		    safer with you

				mandy

	laughs bitterly at that  shakes her head at how fuckedup she finds 
	herself  squeaking wheels approach but she is too lost to hear them

	ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw

				julianne
		    i tried it on  but it wont 
		    come off

	he smiles at that  a sad smile of friendship  then takes her 
	finger gently

	 into his mouth  it is something like a kiss  and when he 
	removes her moistened finger

	 he pulls the ring off  nothing to it  she blinks

				julianne
		    its mental you know

				julianne
		    amazing huh  i didnt do things

		    down

	cradling the phone against her shoulder she carefully tears the top 
	of the pack completely open

				julianne

		    children later when i sit with 
		    michael on some rustic porch 
		    slogging through our sweet swamp 
		    of nostalgic memories

	reaches the pack toward the toilet

				julianne

		    of one weekend in chicago

	drops the lid with a clatter  hits the flush

				julianne

		    lets just settle for not 
		    frightening small animals

	she spits  tells diggers machine

			 	julianne
		    anyway i couldnt have done 
		    it without you  even though i 
		    did if you follow that

	int  bedroom  morning

	julianne sprawled all over the bed mouth open like a carp 
	sleeping mask against the daylight  a sudden rapping at the 
	door and she

	 sits bolt upright  utterly disoriented until she pulls off 
	the mask  stumbles out of bed walking toward the firm knocking 
	when

	 it stops  a message slip slides beneath her door  she lifts 
	it barely conscious  this wakes her up  in one

				julianne
			    to the slip
		    youre going where

	ext  wallace estate  day

	julianne climbs from her taxi  only slightly in awe she sets off 
	past the reflecting pool which fronts a mansion of graceful stone 
	and timber  its a hike today because the circular drives is 
	clogged deep with bentleys mercedes and waiting limos vying for 
	space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds maintenance 
	trucks catering and florist and food vans

	int  great room  day

	julianne escorted into an enormous room where brunch is in 
	progress for more than a hundred  she looks from the vaulted 
	ceilings to the frescoed walls the inlaid floors the massive 
	pipe organ above the stone staircase the oil portraits of scottish 
	ancestors and their favorite dogs

	isabelle has risen from the main table and comes to her  all 
	smiles  julianne is in the twilight zone  what are these people 
	laughing about  do they still think theres a wedding

				isabelle
		    jules  were so glad you 
		    slept in

	takes her arm graciously  this woman would make anne bancroft look 
	coarse  as they walk

				isabelle
		    now you have a choice  the idea 
		    is bride and groom shouldnt see 
		    each other on the magic day

	julianne looking all around  magic day it seems to be  where the 
	bell is a bride or a groom

				isabelle
		    so michael stays put in the garden  
		    kimmy stays in here

	pointing  there she is obscured by a cluster of the appropriately 
	fawning  she has the same hunted eyes and false slightly manic 
	smile julianne wore yesterday  this at least makes sense

				isabelle os
		     and the guests go back and 
		    forth  where will you start

	close on julianne  watching the brave frightened bride

		    she looks tense

	where crews are setting up tents lights heaters for tonight  the 
	circus has come to town  when she looks back

	the court has become a giant holding pen for tonights balloons  
	there are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all 
	directions under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread 
	across the top of the courts chainlink fence

	michael stands outside the court clutching the chain link like a 
	prisoner as julianne comes through the gate  from somewhere we 
	hear high squeaky alien voicelike sounds  incongruous 
	against

				michael
		    how is she

	julianne absorbs this  as the bizarre sounds continue she whirls 
	around

				julianne
		    knock it off

	we now see three stoner college guys who have been filling the 
	endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court  
	clearly theyve been inhaling their working materials

				  stoner kid
			    minnie mouse
		    yes sir

	a nazi salute  when she turns back

				michael
		    i asked you

				julianne
		    she admits its her fault

	he absorbs that  and then

				michael
		    do you think she still loves 
		    me

	we watch the struggle inside her  her voice drops

				julianne
		    sure she does  shes crazy 
		    about you

	now tears stand in both their eyes  the stoners are doing their 
	alvin and the chipmuks impersonation festival in the bg singing 
	in castrato harmony  but our two dont notice

				michael
		    i keep asking how can i explain 
		    what happened and i keep 
		    getting that same answer all 
		    night long

	which is

				michael
		    i cant  and it doesnt matter  
		    i drove her to it because i 
		    want things my way  and even 
		    if she did something tricky and 
		    unfair she was blinded by 
		    love okay

	julianne swallows  for obvious reasons

				julianne
		    does that make it right

	pan along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents  nearly 
	twelve feet high the pile curves along the balcony high above the 
	diners in the great room extending al the way to

	 an organ loft  alone above the noise of the party julianne 
	and kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase  trapped 
	between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth 
	organ  dwarfed by their surroundings kimmy draws the hardest 
	breath of her life

				kimmy
			    whispers
		    so  what did he say

	juliannes eyes move over the young girls face

				julianne
		    he said  marry me

	kimmy yelps in her ecstasy flinging herself against julianne and 
	they go down full length across the organs pedals blasting the 
	room with a monster chord of chinarattling volume and horrifying 
	disharmony

	as grown men and women scream in spontaneous terror below kimmy 
	begins to

	 laugh  and kiss and hug her new sister  and holds her tight

	ext  willow pond  day

	julianne and michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking 
	pond ringed with willows that dig heavy branches to the waters 
	surface  he is relieved reflective  head down he never notices 
	that she is

	 dangerously freaked  too petrified even to hyperventilate 
	were lucky shes breathing at all  we watch her life unraveling 
	before her glassy eyes

				michael
			    never looks up
		    thank god you were here

				julianne
			    mumbles to herself
		    oh yeah

				michael
		    i was so confused so conflicted 
		    so unstable

				julianne
		    well it happens

	they pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking 
	area  family vehicles delivery trucks service vans  everything 
	that couldnt fit on the circular front driveway

				michael
		    i might have thrown away

	searching for the right words

				julianne
		     your one chance for true 
		    happiness

				michael
		     yeah that

				julianne
		    you never want to do that see 
		    thats always a costly 
		    turnover  as they say in the 
		    sport biz

	theres a vague stepford wife quality to her voice  he hears that 
	now and looks at her  maybe he cant tell shes frightened  but 
	he can tell shes something

				michael
			    softly
		    are you okay

	she stops walking  she cant look at him so she looks around  
	across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly
	colored tents unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and 
	chairs raising the poles between which all those balloons will be 
	strung  at the center of it all

	 a huge topiary white sox batter just completing a murderous 
	swing  hes maybe fifteen feet tall  she points to it

				julianne
		    the big hurt huh

				michael
		    nellie fox  walter likes the 
		    past  and he likes the little 
		    guys

	so julianne nods  because she does too  squints up at michael

				julianne
		    got a minute

	he nods you bet  worried for her  what is this she looks in 
	another direction and we now see that we have nearly reached

	 a stage thats been set up for the band  chairs music stands 
	sound equipment  a gleaming dance floor already in place over the 
	lawn  next to it a shimmering white gazebo  like the centerpiece 
	of a wedding cake

				julianne
		    why is the dance floor by the 
		    gazebo

	she takes his hand  they walk toward it

				michael
		    kimmys idea  she thought it 
		    would be such a romantic place  
		    for our wedding dance

	looking down at her

				michael
		    whats up

				julianne
		    shhh

	up the white steps now  together  the gazebo floor has been 
	covered with hardwood  the perfect place  for a wedding dance  
	and julianne

	 turns suddenly  he almost runs into her  she is staring up 
	at him so strangely their bodies only inches apart  he is caught 
	transfixed by the intensity in her eyes

				julianne
		    i have to say this quick okay 
		    or ill have this massive 
		    coronary and youll never have 
		    to hear it  which you need to  
		    does that make any sense at all

	the coronary part does  we can feel her heart beating from here

				michael
		    jules whats wrong

				julianne
		    this is the dumbest thing i will 
		    ever do  so dumb in fact that 
		    i cant  i dont think

	and then she does  she puts her hands flat on his chest  looks 
	in his eyes

				julianne
		    michael i love you

	a heartbeat passes

				julianne
		    ive loved you for nine years 
		    but i was too arrogant and 
		    scared to realize it  now im 
		    just scared

	he stares at her dumbstruck  she moves even closer

				julianne
		    i know this comes at an 
		    inopportune time but i have to 
		    ask this one really gigantic 
		    favor okay

	holds her breath  and

				julianne
		    choose me  marry me  let me 
		    make you happy

	and in a half beat of excruciating silence

				julianne
		    i know  it sounds like three 
		    favors

	his eyes are loving  they care for her  she swallows lost in 
	them

				julianne
		    but when you think about it

	slides her arms around his neck and raises her mouth

	 to his  the most beautiful kiss she will ever offer  all of 
	her heart is in this and as his hands touch her body

	 a scream rips the world to pieces  they whirl to see

	 kimmy halfway up the path  her hands across her mouth as if 
	to stem the horror that pours forth as she shrieks from her soul 
	and

	 runs  back down the path  michael bolting after her shouting 
	her name  a frozen moment and

	 julianne takes off after him  all three running screaming 
	their various emotions at the top of their lungs as workmen stop 
	to watch from neighboring countries

	kimmy staring from halfway there has an insurmountable lead  
	leaps into her convertible and peels out just tearing up the 
	gravel as she rockets out of sight  no way to catch her  still

	 michael is racing for the cars  julianne sprinting her guts 
	out losing ground with every stride  michael jumps into a 
	cherokee

				julianne
		    michael dont youll never 
		    catch her

	he grinds the gears  she keeps running  his engine fires

				julianne

		    drives like a rabid animal

	he blasts off  she keeps going  gasping for air clutching her side 
	shes dying here  slams into a florists truck looks inside shit 
	next a butchers van looks inside jesus

		    machine

	she slams on the brakes throwing herself against the wheel

				younger field man os
		    uh this is one monkey zebra  
		    it wasnt bees in the gals 
		    wall it was cats

	she tears the door open  scramble out

				younger field man os
		    she says gas em anyway 
		    shell pay cash  uh how 
		    do i pay this

	with julianne now racing through the lot michael vanishes into 
	the station she plunges in after him bouncing off bystanders 
	apologizing lunging on gasping for breath past exhaustion 
	threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk 
	catching a lucky glimpse as he heads

	 down a staircase to the tracks  my god whats he doing  a 
	second wind fueled by panic and she bolts after him dancing down 
	the steep staircase somehow without killing herself reaching the 
	concourse to see him running for

	 track 29 a train already rumbling ready to pull out she 
	sprints after him

				julianne
		    michael

	he disappears behind the train she falls skids springs up 
	pushes through gaping onlookers almost there the train pulls 
	away

				julianne
		    nnnoooo

	but hes just standing there  his back to us  watching it go

	her body nearly collapses with relief  she pushes herself on but 
	her legs arent working right in their maxedout fatigue and she 
	lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him  hes still lost 
	in thought staring after the train

	she tries to speak but theres no breath  so she puts her hands 
	on her knees and just gasps for air like a dog  wheezing panting 
	trying once more to speak but she cant yet and then he casually 
	turns and

	 jumps out of his skin  a heart attack seeing her

				julianne
			    croaks
		    dont speak

	he just blinks at this sweaty rippedup maniacal figure

				michael
		    uh  i saw that moving

				julianne
		    dont speak

	flinging both her hands across his mouth  a frozen beat  he nods 
	okay  cautiously she takes her hands away  at least she has made 
	him smile in spite of everything  at least shes done that

				julianne
		    i have to make a confession  
		    another confession  besides 
		    that i love you  this is even 
		    worse

	this  hes waiting to hear

				julianne
		    the email  you thought walter 
		    sent your boss  i wrote that

	you  what  synapse overload

				michael
		    youre not saying you actually 
		    youre saying that y

				julianne
			    stricken with remorse
		     wrote it yeah  im the 
		    bad guy

				michael
		    are you crazy

	she nods her head wildly hair flopping

				michael
		    are you absolutely insane

	bigger nodding

				michael
		    are you on drugs

	shakes her head like a twoyearold

				michael
			    pacing in circles
		    i mean do you realize what 
		    youve well of course you 
		    realize thats why youre 
		    confessing i mean i mean 
		    how could you do that

				julianne
		    i didnt know it would get 
		    sent  i just wanted you to 
		    get mad at kimmy and

	and watching  as this begins to sink in

				julianne
		    ive done nothing but slimy 
		    underhanded despicable not 
		    even terribly imaginative 
		    things  ever since i got 
		    here  trying to

	staring in his eyes  eyes she cant read at this point

				julianne
		     to win you  to win you 
		    back

	tears in her own eyes now  big ones

				julianne
		    and i was blinded by love  
		    like you said

	shaking her head

				julianne
		    but that doesnt excuse any 
		    part of it  i am pond scum

	no

				julianne
		    actually  lower  i am the fungus 
		    that feeds on pond scum  lower  
		    the layer of mucous that cruds up 
		    the fung

				michael
		    lower

				julianne
			    agreeing
		    lower

				michael
		    the pus that infects the mucous 
		    that cruds up the fungus

	and to her amazement  the trace of a smile

				michael
			    softly
		    on the other hand thank you

	she blinks at that  which squeezes out a tear

				michael
		    for loving me that much that 
		    way

	he shrugs  just above a whisper

				michel
		    its pretty flattering

				julianne
		    except it makes me fungus

				michael
		    well that part i knew

	shes never loved him more

				julianne
		    so you have to marry kim  
		    because she will actually make 
		    you happy  i in contrast am 
		    a shallow neurotic psychopath 
		    with relatively little to offer

	okay

				julianne
		    kim  nod your head  do as 
		    youre told

	he nods his head still smiling  her tears are running now  maybe 
	she doesnt notice

				julianne
		    just promise youll never tell 
		    me who you would have chosen 
		    if i hadnt confessed

	she chokes back a sob

				julianne
		    cos if you would have chosen me 
		    then i threw away a perfectly 
		    good life  just to be a decent 
		    person  which is a questionable 
		    tradeoff  right

	he nods slowly  because hes supposed to

				julianne
		    and if you would have chosen 
		    some 20yearold punk over me 
		    id have to kill myself

	ah  his smile keeps getting smaller  more loving  more wonderful

				michael
			    whispers
		    ill take it to my grave

	good  she looks around

				julianne
		    im so glad you didnt jump on 
		    that train before

				michael
		    i came here looking for her

	for her  the words leave a silence

				julianne
		    why would she come here

				michael
		    this is where i proposed

	stares deep in her eyes  she needs to hear this

				michael
		    i had to cover a game in 
		    milwaukee  she saw me off  
		    and when the train started to 
		    leave i jumped up on the 
		    step i help the handle and 
		    without

	he grins  has to admit

				michael
		     without a thought in my head  
		    i shouted marry me

	i did  now her eyes tear up again  and she doesnt know why

				michael
		    and she gasped and covered her 
		    mouth and the train was pulling 
		    out and suddenly she screamed 
		    yes  just once  and blew me a 
		    kiss

	what a girl

				michael
		    i never forgot that

				julianne
		    its two weeks

				michael
		    almost three

				julianne
		    that is so romantic

	which makes him reach and touch her hair

				michael
		    i just wonder if you know why

	do you

				michael
		    its because romance isnt 
		    mystery and tricks and doubts 
		    and halting unspoken longings  
		    thats not the real romance

	tears in his eyes now  first time

				michael
		    the real romance is saying yes

	does she know that now  he looks at his watch

				michael
			    sighs
		    woulda been a nice wedding

	oh  that

				julianne
			    urgently
		    you cant believe youve lost 
		    her  sooner or later youll 
		    find her and youll look in 
		    each others eyes and youll 
		    see all that love

				julianne
		    course if its later rather 
		    than sooner id hate to be you 
		    at six oclock
			     beat
		    youve got a lot of explaining 
		    to

				michael
		    im just thinking of how shes 
		    hurting  lost  alone  like 
		    her life is over

				julianne
		    thats little egotistical

	he glares at her

				julianne
		    but undoubtedly accurate

	she claps her hands galvanized by the emergency

				julianne
		    okay well split up  you go 
		    to every romantic place you 
		    guys have ill go someplace 
		    brilliant and the first one 
		    who

				michael
		    if you find her

	strange tone  a gentle warning

				michael
		    the kiss  may be hard  for 
		    you to explain
			    beat
		    because the only fear she 
		    really has is

				julianne
		     me yeah  and she likes 
		    tommy lasorda  case closed

	looks at her own watch  shit

				michael
		    but if you do get to her first

	she looks up

				michael
		    there is something you are 
		    authorized to say

	ext  taxi stand  day

	julianne sits on the fender of this guys taxi  the driver smokes 
	paces while she waits for a connection on her cellular  then
