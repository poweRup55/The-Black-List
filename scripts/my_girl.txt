        with mr bixler enhaloed in a heart shape music begins to 
        play and vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking 
        at the photo longingly

        accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the 
        basement

        scary music

        vada goes very slowly down the stairs and peeks round the 
        corner she is clearly very scared of the basement and the 
        corpses contained in it she then rushes down and grabs the 
        ball as she turns around shelly who is upstairs walking 
        through the house and sees the door ajar slams it shut 
        unaware that vada is down there vada runs up the stairs and 
        tries to open the door she cant drops the ball and starts 
        to yell out for help and bang on the it shelly hears the 
        noise and comes to the door vada overcome with fear sits 
        on a step covers her ears and begins to sing doowahdiddy
        diddy shelly yanks the door open and sees vada crouched on 
        the step

                i think she looks nice her lips are very 
                thin so i used the gloss to give them a more 
                sensual quality and her eyes just needed a 
                little definition and her hair im sorry 
                nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972

                                 harry

        summer writing class focus on mr bixler

                                 mr bixler
                the great way is not difficult for those 
                with no preferences with the absence of both 
                love and hate everything becomes clear and 
                undisguised that was written by a chinese 
                philosopher in the year 600 now why would i 
                choose to bring that up in a creative writing 
                class because the absence of judgment helps 
                us to appreciate reality in other words i 
                want you to listen to your classmates writing 
                with a clear and open heart okay so whos 
                gonna go first

                                 guy

        he gets up

                i sang a song for you to hear i painted a 
                picture for you to see i picked a rose for 
                you to smell i planted grass for you to 
                touch but you did not hear my song you did 
                not see my picture you did not smell my rose 
                and you did not touch my grass

                woman
                maybe she was outta town

                                 guy2
                thats not funny his poem is about futility 
                we toil in unrewarded obscurity

                                 mr bixler
                now i hear judgment lets not forget the 
                part about the open heart

        the door at the back of the room opens and vada enters 
        holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous

                vada is there something i can do for you

                                 vada

        j awaits her she lies down length ways across the step and

        outside the sennets house vada is creeping along night

        vada approaches the sennets house and signals through the 
        window for thomas j to come outside which he does

                                 thomas j
                vada vada where are you

                i stopped that

        at the church focus on the bingo announcer who is calling 
        out the numbers

                                 harry
                dont worry theres a strategy to bingo for 
                instance on a given night anybody can win 
                but i play the odds when choosing bingo 
                cards i use a range of theories from the laws 
                of probability to avoiding duplicate number 
                systems this way you get much more activity

                                 shelly
                        hopeful
                does it make it easier to win

                                 harry
                no just more activity

        harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it cutting 
        shelly off who has to pull her own seat out and sit down

                                 harry
                        as he sits down to the 
                        person next to him
                hi carl

        outside the church night

                                 vada

        vada and thomas j are ducking behind a counter on one side 
        of the church harry and shelly are quite clearly visible on 
        the other side of the room

                                 shelly
                        in the distance as a number 
                        is announced
                oh great

                                 thomas j
                hey theres your dad and shelly

                                 vada

                                 shelly
                        in the distance again as 
                        another number is announced
                aarrggh

        close up of harry and shelly

        as shelly looks around the bingo table she notices that 
        everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big 
        way

                                 shelly
                i just had a terrible thought harry

                                 harry
                whats that

                                 shelly
                im gonna be putting makeup on some of these 
                people very soon

                                 harry
                why dyou think these seats were empty

        outside

                                 vada

                after dark

        close up again

                                 shelly
                oh im just not lucky harry

                                 harry
                look its not always luck i mean depending 
                upon the placement of the numbers a guy with 
                10 cards could win just as easily as a guy 
                with 100

                                 shelly
                kinda like men

                                 harry
                oh how do you mean

                                 shelly
                you can be in a room with 100 men and not 
                like any of them or you can be in a room with 
                just one man and hes exactly the one you 
                want

        harry and shelly are about to kiss each other vada sees 
        this and doesnt look too happy about it

                                 vada
                        in semideep fake voice
                bingo

                raise their hand

                outside yelled bingo you moron

                                 harry
                hey fellers fellers its just a bingo game

        meanwhile shelly has found it all rather amusing

        outside

                                 vada
                we can go now

        vada and thomas j run off down the street

        vadas bedroom night vada is lying on her bed thinking

        as she hears harrys car approaching she goes to her 
        window and looks out it through the venetian blinds

        outside stopped car

        harry gets out of his side comes round to the other side 
        and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers 
        advice and let shelly get out herself which she does 
        eventually

                                 shelly
                i had a good time tonight

                just for a minute

                about how to maximize small spaces

                people are always curious about that like 
                what happens when you flush

        harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the 
        bathroom and then flushes the toilet

                                 harry

        vadas room vada lying on bed thinking

        vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see grammoo 
        she seats herself cross legged next to grammoo on her bed 
        and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual 
        healing

        supermarket day vada and harry are shopping

        vada is seen turning her head to look at harry and shelly 
        she doesnt like harry and shelly standing so close 
        together she decides to make her move and pushes in between 
        harry and shelly

                                 vada
                are they ready yet

        shelly begins to brush vadas hair with her fingers which 
        vada does not like and she shakes her head to get shelly off

                                 vada
                when

                        which there doesnt appear 
                        to be anything wrong with
        and vada shakes her off again

                                 vada
                when

        vada backs off followed by shelly

        the two men that got out of the car are proceeding up the 
        sultenfuss driveway

        focus on phil harry vada shelly and grammoo at the table 
        outside shelly says a semigrace

                        laughing
                thats attractive

        shellys glance moves to behind grammoo on the other side 
        of the table and beyond where the two men are standing 
        looking around

                                 shelly
                        under her breath

                and theres really nothing anyone can do to 
                comfort you but i urge you to focus on the 
                times you had with the camper the trips you 
                took the sights you saw those days are gone 
                now but theyll live on in your heart 
                forever

                                 danny
                        to shelly

                                 shelly
                        disgusted
                danny thats a real bonehead thing to say

                                 harry
                        to danny
                look youre not gonna take shellys camper

                                 danny

                                 harry
                its her home its where she lives

                                 danny

                        to shelly

        danny tries to grab the keys from shelly

                                 shelly
                stop it that hurts

        harry is now very annoyed

                                 harry
                danny

        as harry says danny for a second time he plants his fist 
        in dannys stomach with force winding him and shutting him 
        up

        focus on vada and phils faces which are startled

        full scene shelly is gaping danny is bent over with ralph 
        holding him up vada and phil watching closely and grammoo 
        staring into space

                                 ralph
                whatd you do that for

                                 harry
                who are you

                quite often

                                 ralph

                                 harry
                because if he ever tries to take shellys 
                camper again im gonna bury him in my front 
                yard

        ralph looks rather disturbed by this

        focus on vada and phil vada still gaping

                                 phil
                        quiet voice to vada
                your father is a savage

        vada looks up at phil phil looks back and nods

        road in front of sultenfuss house danny and ralph in car 
        shelly leaning over with her head in window night

                                 shelly

        the car with danny and ralph in it pulls away and shelly 
        waves

                getting married

        vadas expression begins to change from hopeful to horror 
        but then she drops her fish

                                 vada
                oh my fish

        fish

                        pointing at vada
                i am gonna get you

        vada straps herself in shelly turns around and gives vada 
        the thumbs up vada looks very intent on brutally murdering 
        something now and she returns the thumbs up as she does 
        so music begins to play and the power is turned on the 
        song is bad moon rising

                                 harry
                vada keep your hands on the wheel

        vada rushes straight at shelly and rams into her at top 
        speed so that shellys car is spun around a little shelly 
        screams this is all in good fun at the moment then vada 
        rams her again and again and again and again and 
        eventually shelly does not look too pleased she cant 
        escape vada

                                 harry
                careful vada careful

        wwhhaammm

        shelly and vada pull up along side each other vada gives 
        shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin

        vada is riding her bike along her street towards the 
        camera she stops and dismounts outside thomas js house

        vada rings the sennetts doorbell and mrs sennett answers

        outside front of sennetts house vada and thomas j are

        thomas j climbs down from tree and leaves

        dissolve into next scene

        vada still in tree night she looks around and then decides 
        to get down

        vada jumps down and we can now see that the tree was on 
        the sultenfuss front lawn

        inside view of front door vada enters and closes it

        as soon as vada has entered she waits for someone to come 
        running and ask her if shes all right where shes been 
        they were so worried etc nothing happens all she can hear 
        is the noise that the tv is making so she opens the door 
        again and slams it still nothing she decides to give up 
        and go find harry she walks to the living room where the tv 
        is on harry and grammoo are asleep in their chairs

        vada begins to ascend the stairs depressed

                                 vadas thoughts
                in social studies we learned some people 
                stole the limburg baby right out of his house 
                i think ill sleep with my window open 
                tonight

        outside sultenfuss house a loud high pitched scream is 
        heard

        view of corridor leading to bathroom

                                 vada
                oh my god

        vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs

                                 vada
                daddy daddy daddy daddy

        vada runs into a room where shelly is

        door bell is heard ringing

        is angry

                to seven days

        vada runs inside and slams the door leaving poor thomas j 
        sitting on the porch looking startled

        funeral room of sultenfuss house pipe organ is being 
        played many people are seated and there is an open coffin 
        up the front

        living room vada is reading a book and watching grammoo 
        to be sure that she doesnt wander off vada puts the book 
        down

        she then gives grammoo a little kiss and makes her way out 
        of the living room to the bathroom closing the door behind 
        her as she goes to enter the bathroom she hears giggling 
        coming from the next room so she goes to investigate harry 
        and shelly are kissing and giggling as she is watching 
        this grammoo gets up enters the funeral room and makes her 
        way to the front when she gets there she picks up a rose 
        takes a look at the dead man and begins to sing into the 
        rose as if it were a microphone

                                 grammoo

        and make off for the funeral room vada quickly retreats 
        into the room where harry and shelly were closing the door

        of the room shelly looks back at harry expectantly

                                 vada
                i guess

        as vada rides off thomas j smiles

        back in the woods where vada and thomas j had found the 
        beehive

        thomas j comes across the beehive inspects it and then 
        kicks it he waits and then once he is adamant that there is 
        no danger he begins to search for vadas mood ring he 
        searches and as he does so bees begin to swarm he finds 
        the mood ring and by the time he notices that there are 
        bees everywhere it is too late

                                 thomas j
                        as he finds the mood ring
                yes

                                 thomas j
                        reacting to the bees
                ow ahh no get away

        we see thomas js glasses fall off onto the ground

        outside front door sultenfuss house policeman presses 
        doorbell harry answers

        a policeman enters takes his hat off and explains what has 
        happened to thomas j to harry who becomes clearly very

                there were just too many of em

        when vada hears this her eyes begin to flood with tears 
        and the expression on her face changes movingly it looks as 
        though she just lost the most special and important part of 
        her life and she has

                people didnt exactly thrill me but when i

                living without a family at least i can work 
                with one and maybe once in a while ill be 
                invited in for supper

                yeah and when those suppers are disrupted 
                because theres a car crash or theres a 
                fire or a little boy steps on a beehive

        shelly exits

        funeral room minister is walking up the front

                                 minister
                we are here to honor thomas james sennett he 
                was born may 7 1961 in madison 
                pennsylvania and he was survived by his 
                loving parents charles and susan sennett
                        fades as camera changes

        camera is on vada who is slowly making her way out of her 
        room

        the minister is heard to say this in the background

                                 minister
                the family has asked me to say a few words 
                before we proceed no words that i could say 
                would begin to describe the loss and grieving 
                one word that keeps ringing in my ear is 
                why why would god choose to take this 
                little boy from us i cant give you an answer 
                to that question but i can tell you that god 
                has chosen thomas j for some very special 
                reason we must find solace in knowing that 
                thomas j is now in gods care in that face 
                there is no sorrow such as

        the ministers words fade into the very moving music

        camera is on vada slowly descending the stairs and looking 
        into the funeral room the music scene and actions of 
        characters is getting to the point of making the viewer cry

        vada stops and sits on a step where she can look through 
        and see thomas j lying in his coffin she begins to cry

        back in funeral room vada enters at the back and begins to 
        slowly make her way up to the front

                                 minister
                disciples began to chastise them and 
                jesus said let the children come to me do 
                not hinder them for the kingdom of god 
                belongs to such as these
                        the minister notices vada 
                        coming around the front of the 
                        room
                he laid his hands on their heads before he 
                left that place let us pray in silence

        vada has made it right up to the coffin which she leans 
        over and crying says the following

                                 vada
                wanna go tree climbing thomas j

        camera does a close up of thomas js bee sting covered face

        camera goes back to previous shot incorporating vada as 
        well

                                 vada

                        approaching vada shelly takes 
                        hold of her and tries to pull

        vada breaks away from harrys grip and runs out of the 
        room followed closely by harry and shelly

        outside the house vada is running down the steps followed 
        closely by harry

                                 harry

                                 vada
                weeping willow with your tears running down 
                why do you always weep and frown is it 
                because he left you one day is it because he 
                could not stay on your branches he would 
                swing do you long for the happiness that they 
                would bring he found shelter in your shade 
                he thought his laughter would never fade 
                weeping willow stop your tears there is 
                something to calm your fears you think death 
                as if you forever part but i know hell 
                always be in your heart

        there is a long pause as it sinks in everybody remains 
        silent then just before the scene changes the temptations 
        song my girl begins to play

        outside the school vada comes out the door and down the 
        steps where judy awaits her

                                 vada
                hi judy

                                 judy
                hi vada

                                 vadas thoughts
                things are a little better these days i 
                finally swallowed that chicken bone judy and 
                i are gonna be in the same home room and the 
                republican party just renominated mr nixon

        vada and judy ride off down the road on their bikes the 
        camera angle rises and the credits begin to roll as the song 
        my girl plays

        end
